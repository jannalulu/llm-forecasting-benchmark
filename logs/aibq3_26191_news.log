**Democrats to Virtually Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party plans to virtually nominate President Joe Biden as their candidate for the November elections before the end of July, according to sources close to the organization. This decision would put an end to the internal debate that has been ongoing for weeks, in which some voices had called for Biden to end his re-election campaign after his poor performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. The nomination will be made through a virtual 'roll call' process, where over 4,000 party delegates will cast their votes starting next Monday, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Biden's nomination will be officially accepted during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, scheduled for August 19-22.

**Biden to be Nominated as Democratic Candidate for Reelection**
The Democratic Party plans to virtually confirm President Joe Biden as its candidate for the November elections before the end of July, according to sources close to the organization. This is because the Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22, and if the nomination is not made virtually, Biden risks being excluded from the election in some states. Most of the 4,000 delegates had pledged to support Biden as the candidate, but some have expressed concerns about the virtual nomination process without allowing an open debate at the convention.

**Democrats to Virtually Ratify Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party in the United States plans to virtually ratify President Joe Biden as its candidate for the November elections before the end of July, according to sources close to the organization. This decision would put an end to the internal debate that has been ongoing for weeks, during which some voices had called for Biden to end his re-election campaign after his poor performance in the debate against former President Donald Trump on June 27. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) had previously decided to nominate Biden virtually before the party's convention, which is scheduled to take place from August 19 to 22 in Chicago. The decision was made due to concerns about the state of Ohio, which had set a deadline for parties to register their presidential candidates before August 7 to ensure their presence on the ballot. However, the Ohio legislature has since changed the deadline to the end of August, and the DNC has decided to stick with its original plan to nominate Biden virtually. The nomination will be made through a 'roll call' process, in which delegates from each state will cast their votes. The process is expected to take around a week, and once all votes have been cast, a committee from the DNC will officially declare Biden the Democratic candidate for the November elections.

However, the situation has changed in recent weeks, as Ohio lawmakers passed a law setting a late August deadline for candidate registration, making it possible for Biden to be nominated at the party convention. Despite this, the Democrats are still concerned that the Republicans could change the rules suddenly, so they have decided to stick with their original plan and nominate Biden virtually before the convention.

**Thursday's Campaign Round-Up, 7.11.24**
In the 2024 US presidential election, Democratic Senator Peter Welch became the first sitting senator to call on President Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign. This comes as more Democrats in the House and Senate are expressing doubts about Biden's candidacy. A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that most Democratic voters want Biden to forgo his re-election plans, while Vice President Kamala Harris fares slightly better in hypothetical general-election match-ups. A Pew Research Center poll also found Trump leading Biden in a head-to-head match-up. Additionally, Team Biden is facing a fundraising problem, with donations slowing down and officials bracing for a significant hit. Meanwhile, a vote on an abortion-rights constitutional amendment in Arkansas has been cancelled due to a technical issue with the paperwork.

Biden's family members have also repeatedly stated that he will not withdraw from the race, with First Lady Jill Biden expressing her full support for her husband's candidacy. However, some Democrats have called for Biden to step down, citing concerns about his mental and physical health.

**Joe Biden Faces Pressure to Drop Out of Re-election Bid**
US President Joe Biden returns to the campaign trail on Sunday, desperate to save his re-election bid as top Democratic leaders meet to discuss growing calls for him to drop out of the race. Biden, 81, begins a grueling week with two rallies in Pennsylvania, followed by hosting the NATO summit in Washington. He will face increasing pressure to step down after his disastrous debate against Donald Trump last month raised concerns about his age and fitness to serve another four years. Biden has remained defiant, stating unequivocally that he is fit to occupy the office, citing his ability to defeat Trump in 2020 and again in 2024. However, a televised interview with ABC News on Friday failed to calm concerns. His next major test will be a press conference on Thursday during the NATO summit. So far, five Democratic lawmakers have called for Biden to step down, and the trend is growing. The leader of the House minority, Hakeem Jeffries, has scheduled a virtual meeting with Democratic lawmakers to discuss the best course of action, and Senator Mark Warner is reportedly working to convene a similar forum in the Senate. First Lady Jill Biden, who is reportedly urging her husband to stay in the race, will campaign in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina on Monday. However, after Sunday's protests in Philadelphia and Harrisburg, the President will have to step away from the campaign to attend the NATO summit, which begins on Tuesday. He will also have to reassure his allies at a time when many European countries fear a Trump victory in November. The Republican has long criticized NATO as an unfair burden on the US, has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and has insisted that he could quickly end the war in Ukraine, which was invaded by Moscow in February 2022. For now, top Democrats are keeping any discontent with their leader at bay, at least publicly. However, with only four months to go before the election, any effort to replace Biden as the party's candidate should be done sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, the campaign has presented an intense battle plan for July, including a flood of television ads and trips to all key states. This includes a visit to the southwest during the Republican convention from July 15 to 18, where Trump will be officially crowned the party's presidential candidate.

**President Biden Announces Re-Election Bid**
Despite calls for him to withdraw from the 2024 US presidential election, President Joe Biden has announced that he will run for re-election. During a speech at the White House on Independence Day, Biden responded to a supporter who urged him to continue fighting by saying, 'You got me, friend. I'm not going anywhere.' Biden had faced intense criticism for his debate performance against Republican opponent Donald Trump. In a campaign event in Virginia, Biden admitted that his debate with Trump did not go well. The US presidential election is scheduled to take place on November 5, 2024.

**Biden Faces Pressure to Drop Out of Re-Election Race After Poor Debate Performance**
US President Joe Biden is under scrutiny as he appears in public on Thursday and over the weekend, amid pressure to drop out of the re-election race after a poor performance in a debate that raised concerns about his mental acuity. Biden's 81-year-old performance in the June 27 debate with Republican rival Donald Trump has generated doubts about his ability to maintain a grueling work pace for the next four and a half years, with some party members calling for him to step aside. Vice President Kamala Harris is the leading Democratic figure who could take over the candidacy in the November 5 elections if Biden withdraws, according to sources. Biden will host the annual Independence Day celebrations at the White House on Thursday, give an interview to ABC News on Friday, and travel to Wisconsin the same day for a campaign meeting. Dozens of Democrats in the House of Representatives are closely watching and prepared to ask Biden to step aside if he does not give a good impression in the ABC interview, a source told Reuters. Democrats consider it crucial to capture control of the House in November, as it could be their last chance to hold power in Washington if Trump returns to the White House and the Republicans capture the Senate. Biden faces a new reality since the debate: even if he does not falter verbally or physically, serious concerns about his viability as a candidate are likely to persist. If he trails off or appears disoriented or confused, he will face renewed pressure to drop out. If re-elected, Biden would be 86 years old at the end of a second term. Some former supporters are asking him to retire to preserve his legacy and reduce the chances of a second Trump presidency. With only four months to go before the elections, they say it is necessary to make a decision soon. Democrats, including his main allies, have left the door open for Harris to lead the Democratic ticket.

Despite this, he has received support from some governors and has vowed to continue his campaign. The Democratic Party is set to hold a convention in August, where a new candidate may be chosen. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, Biden's main opponent, has been gaining ground in the polls, with some recent surveys showing him leading Biden by a significant margin.

**Biden Promises to Continue Campaign 'Until the End' Amid Eroding Support**
US President Joe Biden has promised to continue his re-election campaign 'until the end' despite eroding support among Democratic lawmakers in Congress. Biden has expressed this commitment during a video conference with his electoral team. He has also urged his supporters to 'contribute a few dollars' to help defeat his rival. Despite efforts to restore Biden's image after the debate, there are growing signs that his support among Democratic lawmakers in Congress is eroding. Some voices have been more direct, calling on the president to retire. A Texas Democratic legislator has become the first in Congress to ask Biden to step down, saying 'He saved our democracy by getting rid of Trump in 2020. He shouldn't give us Trump in 2024.' Meanwhile, Hunter Biden, the president's son, has been found guilty of three charges, including illegally purchasing a weapon.

**Biden Vows to Continue Re-election Campaign Despite Erosion of Support**
US President Joe Biden has committed to continuing his re-election campaign 'until the end', despite growing pressure to drop out and declining support among Democratic lawmakers in Congress. Biden made the commitment during a video call with his campaign team, saying 'I need you now more than ever. I'm going to keep fighting. We're going to do this until the end.' The call was attended by Vice President Kamala Harris, with whom Biden had lunch earlier that day. The campaign is trying to recover from the crisis after the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump, where Biden's voice was hoarse and he struggled to complete sentences. The erosion of Biden's support in Congress is evident, with influential lawmakers like Jim Clyburn and Seth Moulton calling for him to drop out and make way for a new candidate.

Despite his campaign team's efforts to downplay the reports, several allies and Democratic politicians have expressed concerns about Biden's chances of re-election, citing his poor performance in the debate against Donald Trump and declining poll numbers. Biden's campaign has called a general meeting with all staff and he is scheduled to have an interview with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on Friday, followed by campaign appearances in key swing states. However, an ally told CNN that Biden remains 'clear-eyed' about his viability and is aware of his declining poll numbers and fundraising issues.

**Biden considering whether to end his presidential re-election campaign, report says**
President Joe Biden is reportedly considering ending his re-election campaign if he cannot convince voters that he is up for the job after his poor performance in the recent debate against Donald Trump. A key ally to the president said that if Biden has two more events like the debate, he will have to end his campaign. The White House and Biden's campaign have denied the report, calling it 'absolutely false'. The president's campaign and White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients have called all-hands meetings with staff, and the president is meeting with Democratic governors at the White House. Some prominent Democrats, including Representative Lloyd Doggett and former President Barack Obama, have expressed concerns about Biden's chances of re-election.

**US Democrats Consider Nominating Biden in July to End Speculation About Alternative Candidate**
The Democratic Party of the United States is considering nominating President Joe Biden as its candidate for the November elections in July, before the party's convention in August, according to Bloomberg, citing sources. The potential date of the nomination is July 21, when the Democratic National Committee will hold a virtual meeting. This move is aimed at 'guaranteeing that the president will be included in the November ballots and helping to end internal party discussions about his replacement after last week's debates'. This would allow the party to 'come together around its candidate, even if insiders are calling for him to step aside for someone else', according to the agency. Biden received around 99% of the votes from his party's delegates at the 2024 primary, giving him 'enormous influence on the party establishment'. Meanwhile, CNN reported that 'over two dozen high-ranking Democratic officials, politicians, and donors linked to Biden and many others being considered as potential replacements for Biden' are saying that 'almost every scenario scares them: Biden's nomination, Harris's nomination, or someone else's'. Bloomberg notes that Biden spent the weekend campaigning with donors in New York and New Jersey, assuring them that he is willing to run for a second term. However, public opinion polls have shown that Biden's efforts to secure re-election are complicated by voters' concerns about his age and ability to run for a second term.

**Democrats Fear Scenarios of Replacement as Much as Biden's Reelection**
Despite some Democratic leaders' support for President Joe Biden and his decision to continue running for re-election, other party leaders are expressing concerns about his chances of winning. According to CNN sources, senior Democratic leaders and Biden's advisors have started 'seriously considering' how to handle an unprecedented situation at the Democratic National Convention, which will take place in Chicago from August 19-22. They are closely monitoring the movements of potential rivals to Biden, looking for opportunities to advance or confront them effectively. For example, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has drawn attention after her political action committee organized a fundraising call on Friday evening, which many see as a significant statement about her agenda, especially since it hinted at her victory in a crucial state in the presidential election. According to observers, Democrats are facing a 'big dilemma', 'they cannot agree on the best solution'. Biden's continued candidacy is causing anxiety due to his age and 'health condition', not to mention the potential for internal party divisions if another candidate is chosen, which would require opponents to 'overcome the first black woman to be a vice presidential nominee in US history'. Biden's campaign has previously rejected calls for him to withdraw from the presidential race, saying it would be the 'best way' for Republican Trump to win in November. The campaign emphasized in an email that 'Biden will be the Democratic nominee because voters have chosen him, and he won a landslide victory', adding: 'If Biden withdraws, it will lead to weeks of chaos, and we will turn to less likely candidates to win, as he is the only one who defeated Trump'. The Biden campaign announced that it has raised $27 million in two days, encouraging more people to join the volunteer work and campaign tasks. The campaign emphasized that 'Biden's performance in the debate should not overshadow all the work he has done' since taking office in 2021.

**Biden's Chances of Re-Election Plummet After Poor Debate Performance**
The probability of Joe Biden remaining US President has significantly decreased after his poor performance in the TV debate with Trump. The New York Times has called for Biden to withdraw his candidacy for a second term. The editorial board described Biden as 'the shadow of a great public servant'. This development shows the growing loss of support from liberal media for Biden and raises concerns about his age and ability to serve as President. It seems unlikely that Trump will not become the next President. Important dates leading up to the election include the Republican National Convention from July 15-18, 2024, and the Democratic National Convention from August 19-22, 2024. There will be three TV debates between the presidential candidates, with the first one taking place on June 28. After the election on November 5, important dates include the Electoral College meeting on December 16, 2024, the official announcement of the election results on January 6, 2025, and the inauguration of the new or re-elected President on January 20, 2025.
