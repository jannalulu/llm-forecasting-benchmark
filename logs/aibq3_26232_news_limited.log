**Biden Should End Verisign .Com Domain Monopoly, Groups Say**
Antitrust advocates are urging the Biden administration to force Verisign Inc. to competitively bid to maintain the registry of websites that end in.com after the company increased prices by 70% over the past decade. The groups, led by the American Economic Liberties Project, argue that Verisign has reaped excessive profits without providing a better product or service and that competitive bidding would lead to lower prices. The company operates the.com domain registry, which is a directory of websites and their owners, and has brought in $1.5 billion in revenue last year. The groups also urge the Justice Department to withdraw guidance from 2018 that allowed the removal of price caps on Verisign's services.

**VeriSign .com contract likely to be renewed with Q2 earnings on tap: Baird**
Baird analyst Rob Oliver believes that VeriSign's (VRSN) 32-year-old domain contract with the US government will be renewed, despite some advocates calling for its discontinuation. Oliver expects the company's second-quarter results to be slightly below estimates, driven by lower domain name growth. He also expects the company to lower its 2024 domain guidance due to weak trends. Oliver has a Neutral rating on VeriSign and a $200 price target on the stock.

**The '.alsace' Domain Celebrates 10 Years: A Wild West Story**
The '.alsace' internet domain is celebrating its 10th anniversary. Benjamin Louis, the director of Sparkling, a company responsible for managing the '.alsace' domain, shared an unexpected metaphor, saying, 'We knew the Wild West…' This metaphor requires further explanation. The global web addressing system relies on 'domain names', with TLDs (Top Level Domains) being prominent examples. Many people have surfed websites with '.com', '.fr', or '.org' endings, but fewer have visited sites with GeoTLDs, which are TLDs tied to a specific territory, not necessarily a country. Currently, there are around 75 GeoTLD members worldwide, including...

**Navigating the World of Domain Names**
Domain names are crucial for online presence and brand identity. Choosing the right name requires considering factors such as uniqueness, memorability, and relevance to the business or content.

**Turkey's New Digital Identity: '.Tr' Domain**
Turkey is introducing a new digital identity with the '.tr' domain. The '.tr' domain will be available without com, net, org, and other extensions. For example, 'btk.tr'. The process will prioritize existing domain name holders, followed by a first-come, first-served basis. The application deadline is August 7, 2024. The '.tr' domain will not affect the existing domain name, and users will be able to continue using their existing domain name. The '.tr' domain is expected to be more convenient for international platforms due to its shorter length and easier memorability. If an application is not made, the '.tr' domain can be obtained by others, which may lead to trademark infringement. The allocation process will be completed after the application deadline, and the result will be announced through the registration authority.

**VeriSign: Hasn't Been This Cheap Since 2018**
VeriSign, a provider of domain name registry services, has not been this cheap since 2018. Despite its impressive fundamentals, including a free cash flow margin above 50% and 16 years of consecutive revenue growth, the company's stock price has been affected by investor hype around AI and meme stocks. The author believes that VeriSign's competitive advantage, driven by its management of the.com and other popular Top-Level Domains, makes it a solid investment opportunity. The company's predictable revenue stream, low volatility, and consistent profitability make it an attractive option for investors seeking a stable return. The author estimates VeriSign's fair value to be $185 per share, and considers it a strong buy at its current price of $170 per share.
