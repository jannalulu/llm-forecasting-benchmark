As of August 20, 2024, tech companies have laid off over 124,000 employees, bringing the total number of layoffs since 2022 to 428,449. Major tech companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Dell, Intel, IBM, Cisco, SAP, Salesforce, Cohere, Stability AI, TikTok, YouTube, Snap, Match Group, Bumble, PayPal, Swiggy, Unacademy, Byju's, Ola, Koo, Paytm, Twitch, and Discord have all announced layoffs, with some companies cutting up to 50% of their workforce. The layoffs are attributed to a combination of factors, including cost-cutting to invest in AI, a global downturn, over-hiring during the pandemic, and falling behind due to not investing in AI at the right time. 'We need to simplify execution and drive velocity,' said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, while Tesla's Elon Musk announced that the company would be cutting'more than 10%' of its global workforce to cut costs. 'We grew too quickly and wanted to sharpen our focus,' said Discord CEO Jason Citron. The layoffs have had a significant impact on employees, with some companies offering voluntary leave programs and re-skilling measures to help those affected.

**The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020**
The tech industry experienced significant job instability following the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Apple initiating large-scale layoffs. Google's January 2023 layoff of 12,000 employees was the largest single layoff event in the tech sector since 2020. In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.

**Tech Layoffs 2024: The Industry's Massive Job Cuts**
The tech industry is experiencing a massive wave of layoffs in 2024, with over 460,000 jobs lost in the past two years. The largest layoffs have occurred in the US, but Germany is also heavily affected, ranking third globally. According to data from BestBrokers, over 165 companies have cut more than 200,000 jobs worldwide since the beginning of the year. SAP is responsible for 23% of the layoffs in 2024, having announced the elimination of 8,000 jobs in January as part of a restructuring process. Other notable tech companies that have laid off employees include Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and eBay. The layoffs are attributed to external factors such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as internal factors like over-expansion during the pandemic. The tech industry is expected to continue to face challenges in the coming years, with many companies struggling to adapt to changing market conditions and employee expectations. 'The tech industry is no longer the safe haven it once was,' says the author. 'Jobs at big tech companies are no longer seen as a path to wealth and prestige.'

**Early Reports of Apple Lay Offs As Company Shifts Priorities**
Apple is reportedly letting go of 100 employees in its digital services group, with the majority of the losses affecting the team overseeing the Apple Books app. According to Bloomberg, the affected employees were notified on Tuesday, August 28th. Apple does not see the provision of audiobooks and ebooks as a major part of its services line-up, but Books is still expected to receive new features over time. This is not Apple's first round of job cuts, as the company has had several rounds of redundancies in other areas of the business during 2024. In fact, several big tech companies have made substantial cuts in recent months, including Intel, Dyson, Bell, EA, Bumble, Sony, Expedia, Cisco, PayPal, Microsoft, eBay, and Amazon. The use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT is also having a significant effect on the tech job market, with Dell's recent cull being a prime example.

**Apple Lays Off 100 Employees, Citing Economic Reasons**
Apple has laid off 100 employees, citing economic reasons. The company has informed its employees about the decision on August 27, 2024. The layoffs are part of Apple's fourth round of layoffs in 2024. The affected employees are from the Apple Books and Apple Bookstore teams. However, the company has also laid off some employees from other service departments, including News. Apple has stated that it will provide affected employees with 60 days to find a new position within the company. This move is seen as a continuation of the industry's trend of downsizing. Other tech giants like Google, Intel, and Amazon have also laid off thousands of employees in 2024, citing the slow-down of the US economy and the aftermath of the pandemic. Apple's layoffs, although fewer in number compared to its competitors, raise questions about the company's future strategy. The company's focus on services, such as Apple News, suggests that it may be shifting its priorities to more profitable and strategic areas.

**Large corporations expect to make more layoffs in the coming months**
Major corporations, including Google, Microsoft, Nike, Amazon, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, expect to make layoffs in the coming months. A survey by ResumeBuilder found that 40% of business leaders anticipate layoffs in 2024, with half of those surveyed believing a recession is possible. Vance Ginn, President of Ginn Economic Consulting, attributes the layoffs to a slowing economy due to inflation, reduced consumer demand, and increased debt. Some companies are trying to implement 48-hour work weeks or offer alternative opportunities to retain workers, but Ginn notes that this can put more stress on the economy. The increasing use of AI is also making workers question their next move, as some industries fully embrace its capabilities.

**C-Suite Executives Secretly Hoped Employees Would Quit After Implementing Return-to-Office Mandates, According to a New Survey The concept is called "layoffs in disguise," per Bamboo HR.**
A new survey by Bamboo HR found that 25% of C-suite executives secretly hoped that implementing strict return-to-office policies would lead to 'voluntary turnover' among employees, while 28% of remote employees would consider leaving their jobs if mandated to a five-day-a-week in-office model. The concept is referred to as 'layoffs in disguise.' The study also found that 40% of executives and managers had to implement layoffs within the last year due to fewer employees quitting than expected after the new in-office mandates. The return-to-office debate has been ongoing at major companies, including Amazon, Tesla, and Salesforce, which will require certain employees to work in the office four to five days a week starting October 1.
