**Romanian Ana Barbosu Awarded Bronze Medal in Women's Gymnastics at 2024 Paris Olympics**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has reallocated the bronze medal in the women's artistic gymnastics floor exercise event from the 2024 Paris Olympics from American Jordan Chiles to Romanian Ana Barbosu. According to the IOC, 'We are in contact with the Romanian National Olympic Committee to discuss the medal reallocation ceremony and with the US Olympic Committee regarding the return of the bronze medal', a spokesperson told AFP. This decision follows a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Saturday, which annulled Chiles' appeal due to a late submission. Barbosu, who was initially announced as third-place finisher on Tuesday, had even raised the Romanian flag in the Arena Bercy before being relegated to fourth place after Chiles' appeal. Romania now ends the Paris Olympics with nine medals, ranking 23rd in the country standings. Brazilian gymnast Rebeca Andrade was crowned Olympic champion in the floor exercise event on August 5, ahead of American Simone Biles.

**Court strips US gymnast of bronze medal at Paris Olympics 2024**
A court has ordered US gymnast Jordan Chiles to return the bronze medal she won at the Paris Olympics 2024. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the medal will be reallocated to Ana Barbosu of Romania after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in favour of their appeal. The issue stemmed from confusion in the scoring during the women's floor exercise final, where Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea finished with matching scores, but Jordan Chiles's score was adjusted, surpassing them. The Romanian team filed an appeal, stating that Team USA appealed outside the one-minute time limit, which the CAS upheld. Following the verdict, USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee said, 'We are devastated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling regarding women's floor exercise.' They believed their inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles' floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and in accordance with FIG rules. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) restored the original scoring, placing Barbosu back in third, Maneca-Voinea fourth, and Chiles fifth.

**Jordan Chiles Decides on Potential Return of Bronze Medal**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has ruled that Romania can present Ana Barbosu with a bronze medal for her result in the Floor Exercise finals at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The decision comes after a score change was deemed invalid, which initially saw American gymnast Jordan Chiles jump two spots into third place. Chiles has been asked to return her bronze medal, but according to Christine Brennan of USA Today, there are 'no plans' for her to do so. USA Gymnastics plans to appeal the decision, citing 'significant procedural errors' made by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Chiles has spoken out about the situation, saying, 'I will approach this challenge as I have others — and will make every effort to ensure that justice is done. I believe that at the end of this journey, the people in control will do the right thing.'

**Conflict Of Interest In Jordan Chiles Medal Decision Revealed**
A conflict of interest has been revealed in the decision to overturn the results of the 2024 Paris Olympics women's gymnastics floor final, forcing American Jordan Chiles to fall out of third-place. The head of the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Hamid G. Gharavi, had previously served as legal counsel to Romania in disputes at the World Bank's International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. According to the Court of Arbitration for Sports, Gharavi disclosed the conflict of interest prior to the hearing, but the court will not reconsider its decision despite new evidence. USA Gymnastics has vowed to continue its efforts to allow Chiles to keep the bronze medal, stating, 'We are deeply disappointed by the notification and will continue to pursue every possible avenue and appeal process, including to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, to ensure the just scoring, placement, and medal award for Jordan.' The International Gymnastics Federation has modified the final ranking, reinstating Chiles' initial score and moving Ana Barbosu to third-place. 'The initial score of 13.666 given to Jordan Chiles (USA) is reinstated,' the FIG confirmed. 'The ranking of the Women's Artistic Gymnastics Floor Exercise Finals has been modified accordingly with Ana Barbosu (ROU) ranking third with a score of 13.766.'

USA Gymnastics plans to continue appealing the ruling, despite the CAS decision. According to Octavian Morariu, a member of the International Olympic Committee for Romania, and Mihai Covaliu, president of the Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee, the bronze medal will be handed to Ana in a ceremony on Friday (August 16) in Bucharest.

**TAS Strips Olympic Medal from 'Winner' due to 4-Second Delay in Protest**
The International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) has stripped a 'winner' of their Olympic medal in Paris 2024, just six days after they were honored. The reason for the decision is a 'minuscule' error by the athlete's support team or a strict interpretation of the rules. The controversy surrounds the gymnastics floor exercise final, which was held on August 5. Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu was initially declared the winner, but the US team lodged a complaint and moved up to third place, relegating Barbosu to fourth. The US team's complaint was filed 4 seconds after the initial scoring, which is outside the 1-minute window allowed for protests. The TAS ruled in favor of the US team, annulling the initial decision and awarding the bronze medal to Barbosu due to the 4-second delay in filing the complaint. The US team plans to appeal the decision, while Barbosu celebrated the ruling as 'just.'

**TAS Upholds Decision to Award Bronze Medal to Ana Barbosu**
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) has upheld its decision to award the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise event at the Paris 2024 Olympics to Ana Barbosu of Romania, rather than Jordan Chiles of the United States. The US Gymnastics Federation had appealed the decision, arguing that Chiles' coach, Cécile Landi, had submitted a protest within the allowed time frame of 60 seconds. However, the TAS ruled that the US team had exceeded the time limit by four seconds. USA Gymnastics has stated that they will continue to explore all possible avenues of appeal, including the Swiss Federal Tribunal, to obtain the correct score, ranking, and medal for Jordan Chiles. As a result, the outcome of the women's floor exercise event at Paris 2024 remains uncertain until all appeals are concluded. 'We are deeply disappointed by this notification and will continue to explore all possible avenues and processes of appeal, including the Swiss Federal Tribunal, to obtain the right score, the right ranking, and the medal for Jordan,' said USA Gymnastics.

**'Racism is Real': Sister of American Gymnast Speaks Out on Medal Redistribution**
The sister of American gymnast Jordan Chiles, Jasmine Chiles, has called the redistribution of the bronze medal in the women's artistic gymnastics floor exercise final at the 2024 Paris Olympics 'racism'. 'Please pray for Jordan (and my family). Racism is real, it exists, it's alive and well. Five days after she was officially stripped of one of her medals. Not because she didn't win, not because she stepped out of bounds, not because she wasn't good enough. But because the judges didn't take into account her difficulties and made her go through an investigation. Four seconds. They took away her bronze for four seconds, something that would never have happened if the judges had done their job. I love you, sister. And I'll get you back, no matter what,' Jasmine wrote on social media. The incident occurred during the women's artistic gymnastics competition, where judges re-evaluated Jordan Chiles' score in the floor exercise and awarded her a higher score, allowing her to move from fifth to third place and displacing Romanian Ana Barbosa from the podium, taking away her bronze medal. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) partially upheld the appeal filed by the Romanian National Olympic Committee (ROC) to review the results of the women's artistic gymnastics floor exercise competition at the Paris Olympics, returning the bronze medal to Ana Barbosa. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) will appeal the CAS decision to redistribute the bronze medal.

The decision was described as 'strange'. Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu initially came in third place behind Brazilian Rebeca Andrade and American Simone Biles, but Chiles' coach, Cecile Landi, lodged a protest, which led the judges to increase Chiles' score from 13.566 to 13.766, moving her to third place. 'It was a great day,' said no one, as the CAS has now overturned the decision, stripping Chiles of her medal.

**Ana Barbosu Reinstated as Bronze Medalist in Women's Floor Exercise at Paris 2024 Olympics**
The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has reinstated Ana Barbosu of Romania as the bronze medalist in the women's floor exercise at the Paris 2024 Olympics, after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) overturned an appeal by Jordan Chiles' coach, Cecile Landi. The appeal was made after Landi requested that the judges reinstate an element in Chiles' routine, which increased her score by 0.1 and put her in third place. However, the FIG rules require that any appeal must be made within one minute of the score being published, and the TAS ruled that Landi's appeal was made 1 minute and 4 seconds after the deadline. As a result, the original order was reinstated, and Barbosu was awarded the bronze medal. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed the reassignment of the medal less than 24 hours after the TAS decision. According to the IOC, the FIG will determine the final classification, but the medal will be awarded 'in accordance with' the TAS decision. The FIG placed Barbosu in third place, Maneca-Voinea in fourth, and Chiles in fifth. The IOC announced that the bronze medal will indeed go to Barbosu and that they will work with the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee to return the bronze medal awarded to Chiles. 'It was a great day,' said Cecile Landi, Chiles' personal coach and also the coach of the US team in Paris, 'but unfortunately, it was not meant to be.'

**US Gymnast Jordan Chiles Loses Bronze Medal in Floor Exercise Event**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the bronze medal awarded to US gymnast Jordan Chiles in the floor exercise event at the Paris Games will be reassigned to her Romanian counterpart Ana Bărbosu. This decision comes after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that the initial investigation by the US into Chiles' score in the floor exercise final was presented after the one-minute deadline. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) stated that Chiles' original score of 13.666 would be reinstated, and Bărbosu's score of 13.700 would improve her to third place. The IOC confirmed that the score change would mean that Chiles would lose the bronze medal and it would be given to Bărbosu. 'After the TAS decision regarding the women's artistic gymnastics floor exercise final and the modification of the classification by the International Gymnastics Federation, the IOC will reassign the bronze medal to Ana Barbosu (Romania)', said the IOC in a statement. 'We are in contact with the Romanian NOC to discuss the reassignment ceremony and with the USOPC about the return of the bronze medal'. CNN has reached out to the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and USA Gymnastics to see if they will appeal the CAS decision. USA Gymnastics referenced their statement on Saturday in which they said they were 'devastated' by the ruling. The competition ended dramatically on Monday. Immediately after the competition ended on Monday with Chiles' performance, Bărbosu thought she had won the bronze medal after obtaining a score of 13.700. Chiles had initially obtained a score of 13.666, but her coaches successfully challenged the difficulty score, which added 0.1 to her score and took her to third place, behind the gold medalist Rebeca Andrade and the American Simone Biles. Their appearance together on the first Olympic podium composed exclusively of black athletes produced one of the most iconic images of the Games when the Americans bowed to Andrade. However, the CAS decision that the investigation presented on behalf of Chiles 'was raised after the one-minute deadline' stipulated in the regulations put Chiles' medal in doubt. Chiles posted on her Instagram story after the CAS ruling four broken heart emojis and 'I'm taking this time and I'm stepping away from social media for my mental health, thank you'.

US gymnast Jordan Chiles has been stripped of her Bronze medal in the women's floor final at the Paris Olympics after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

The decision comes after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) annulled the re-evaluation of Jordan Chiles' score, citing that her appeal was submitted four seconds after the deadline. Ana Barbosu will now receive the bronze medal. Chiles had initially been announced third on August 6, but was later relegated to fourth place after a re-evaluation of her score. 'I was afraid it wasn't true,' Chiles said. The CAS ruling restored Chiles' initial score of 13.666, while Barbosu had scored 13.700. 'It's a feeling I can hardly express, I don't believe it,' Barbosu said. 'When I learned the news, I was afraid it wasn't true, and once I was sure, I hugged my parents and called everyone who had helped me.'

**Anna Barbosu Restored to Bronze Medal in Women's Floor Exercise at Paris 2024 Olympics**
Romanian gymnast Anna Barbosu has been awarded the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise event at the Paris 2024 Olympics, after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturned a previous decision that had stripped her of the medal. The CAS decision came after the Romanian Olympic Committee appealed a request from the coach of American gymnast Jordan Chiles, who had initially been awarded the bronze medal. Chiles had scored 13.666 points, but the CAS ruled that the difficulty of her routine should not have been increased, and therefore she should not have received the additional points that gave her the bronze medal. Barbosu, who scored 13.700 points, was initially awarded the bronze medal, but it was taken away from her after Chiles' coach requested a review of the difficulty of her routine. The CAS decision has now restored Barbosu's bronze medal, and she will be awarded it in a ceremony to be held at a later date. As Barbosu said, 'It was a great day.'

**International Olympic Committee Facing Intense Backlash After Asking Jordan Chiles To Return Medal**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has sparked outrage among fans after deciding that Jordan Chiles, a US gymnast, must return her bronze medal won in the 2024 Paris Olympics floor exercise final. The decision comes after the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) voided Chiles' coach's appeal, restoring the original standings. The IOC stated that it will reallocate the bronze medal to Ana Barbosu of Romania. Many fans have expressed their disappointment and frustration with the decision, feeling that Chiles should be allowed to keep her medal and that the athletes were not to blame for the mistake. 'This isn't right! Just let them have one each,' said one social media user. 'Jordan is going from having a medal & carrying the honor of being an Olympic Champion to no medals at all. She didn't even do anything wrong, It was the judges fault,' added another. The decision has been met with widespread criticism, with many calling for Chiles to be allowed to keep her medal or for the IOC to reconsider its decision.

**Ana Barbosu Awarded Bronze Medal in Women's Floor Exercise at Paris 2024 Olympics**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed on Sunday that the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise at the Paris 2024 Olympics will be awarded to Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu, instead of American gymnast Jordan Chiles. The decision was made by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) after a complaint from the Romanian Olympic Committee. Chiles had initially received a score of 13.666, which would have placed her fifth in the competition and given Barbosu the bronze medal. However, after an investigation by Chiles' coach, Cecile Landy, the judges increased Chiles' score to 13.766, placing her third. The TAS restored Chiles' original score of 13.666, stating that the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) should determine the final classification and award the medals accordingly. The FIG later confirmed that the results would be modified in accordance with the TAS decision, and Barbosu was awarded the bronze medal with a score of 13.700.

**CAS Delivers Justice, Strips American Athlete Of Bronze Medal, Gives It To Romanian Gymnast**
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has upheld an appeal by the Romanian Olympic Committee, ruling that the bronze medal given to American gymnast Jordan Chiles in the floor exercise at the Paris Games will be reallocated to Ana Barbosu of Romania. The CAS decision was made after it was determined that the USA's inquiry about Chiles' score was filed beyond the 1-minute deadline. According to the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), 'the ranking of the Women's Artistic Gymnastics Floor Exercise Finals has been modified accordingly, with Ana Barbosu (ROU) ranking third with a score of 13.700.' Jordan Chiles' initial score of 13.666 has been reinstated. The USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee released a joint statement, saying, 'We are devastated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling regarding women's floor exercise. Throughout the appeal process, Jordan has been subject to consistent, utterly baseless and extremely hurtful attacks on social media.

**Ana Barbosu Regains Bronze Medal in Floor Exercise at Paris 2024 Olympics**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed the bronze medal in the floor exercise of the artistic gymnastics at the Paris 2024 Olympics for Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu, stripping the medal from American gymnast Jordan Chiles. The decision was made by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after a complaint from the Romanian Olympic Committee. Initially, Chiles had obtained a score of 13.666, which placed her fifth in the competition and made Barbosu, with a score of 13.7, a bronze medalist. However, after an investigation by Chiles' coach, Cecile Landy, into the degree of difficulty, the judges raised Chiles' score to 13.766, placing her third. The adjustment left Barbosu, who had started celebrating her medal, 'discolocada' and sparked a storm of protests from the Romanian team. After restoring Chiles' score to 13.666, the CAS stated that it was up to the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) to 'determine the classification of the floor exercise final and assign the medals in accordance with the previous decision.' The FIG then clarified that 'the results of the women's floor exercise final at the Paris 2024 Olympics, published on August 5, 2024, are modified in accordance with this decision.' As a result, the podium for the floor exercise in artistic gymnastics at the Paris Olympics consists of Brazilian Rebeca Andrade, who won the gold; American Simone Biles, who won the silver; and Romanian Ana Barbosu, who won the bronze.

**Jordan Chiles Loses Bronze Medal in Floor Exercise at Paris Games**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the bronze medal awarded to American gymnast Jordan Chiles in the floor exercise at the Paris Games will be reassigned to her Romanian counterpart Ana Bărbosu. This decision comes after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that the initial investigation by the United States into Chiles' score in the floor exercise final was presented after the one-minute deadline. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) stated that Chiles' original score of 13.666 would be reinstated, and Bărbosu's score of 13.700 would improve to third place. The IOC confirmed that the score change would mean Chiles would lose the bronze medal and it would be given to Bărbosu. The IOC said in a statement, 'Following the TAS decision regarding the women's artistic gymnastics floor exercise final and the modification of the classification by the International Gymnastics Federation, the IOC will reassign the bronze medal to Ana Barbosu (Romania)'. The US Olympic Committee declared that they would appeal the decision. USA Gymnastics had previously referred to their statement on Saturday, where they said they were 'devastated' by the ruling. Chiles had initially obtained a score of 13.666, but her coaches successfully challenged the difficulty score, adding 0.1 to her score and placing her third behind gold medalist Rebeca Andrade and Simone Biles. However, the CAS decision that the investigation presented after the one-minute deadline put Chiles' medal in doubt. Chiles posted on her Instagram story after the CAS ruling, 'I'm taking some time and stepping away from social media for my mental health, thanks'.

FIG spokesperson Meike Behrensen said that 'Reallocation of medals is the responsibility of the IOC.' The Romanian Gymnastics Federation had asked for three bronze medals to be awarded, and Romanian prime minister Marcel Ciolacu reacted to the ruling by saying 'justice has been served' and that 'in the end, the truth prevailed.' USA Gymnastics said in a statement it is 'devastated' by the ruling, and Chiles' teammates, including Simone Biles, have expressed support for her, with Biles posting 'Sending you so much love Jordan, Keep your chin up 'Olympic champ' we love you.'

**Olympics rocked by staggering decision as medals overturned in gymnastics furore**
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has overturned an appeal that saw American gymnast Jordan Chiles leapfrog Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu into third place in the women's floor exercise at the Paris Olympics. The CAS ruling restored Barbosu to third place, with Chiles demoted to fifth. The decision was made after it was determined that Team USA coach Cecile Landi's on-floor appeal came four seconds too late, outside the 1-minute window allowed by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG). The FIG stated that the allocation of medals is not up to them, and it remains to be seen if Chiles will have to return her bronze medal. A precedent set by the CAS in 2022 suggests that both women may keep their medals. Meanwhile, Romanian gymnast Sabrina Maneca-Voinea's placing could be upgraded after a video review showed she did not step out of bounds in her routine, which would have given her gold. The Romanian federation has asked CAS to restore 0.1 points to Maneca-Voinea's score, and Romanian gymnastics legend Nadia Comaneci has launched an appeal on her behalf.

**US Loses Bronze Medal in Gymnastics Floor Exercise Due to Late Appeal**
A controversy in the artistic gymnastics floor exercise at the Paris 2024 Olympics led to a Romanian gymnast, Ana Babosu, being stripped of her bronze medal. Initially, Babosu had secured the third place, but an appeal by the US gymnast, Jordan Chiles, led to Babosu's position being improved, moving her from fifth to third place. However, the Romanian team argued that Chiles' appeal was submitted out of time, making it invalid. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) ultimately ruled in favor of Babosu, annulling the US appeal and ordering the return of the bronze medal. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) will reassign the medals according to the TAS decision. 'It was a great day, but it was ruined in less than a minute,' Babosu said, referring to the initial joy of winning the bronze medal, which was later taken away. 'The decision of the TAS is a testament to the dedication and hard work of our team,' said the Romanian team's coach.

**Paris Olympics 2024 shocker: USA gymnast Jordan Chiles to return Olympics medal after court verdict?**
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has ruled that the initial order of finish in the Paris Olympics 2024 women's floor exercise final should be restored, potentially forcing American gymnast Jordan Chiles to return her bronze medal. The CAS decision voided an appeal from Team USA coach Cecile Landi that had vaulted Chiles onto the podium. According to the FIG, the allocation of medals is up to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and it's unclear if the IOC or FIG would ask Chiles to return her medal. Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu was initially placed third, but was left outside the medals after finishing with a matching score of 13.700. Chiles was initially given a score of 13.666 that placed her fifth, right behind Barbosu's teammate Sabrina Maneca-Voinea. 'Reallocation of medals is the responsibility of the IOC,' said FIG spokesperson Meike Behrensen. Romanian prime minister Marcel Ciolacu reacted to the ruling by saying 'justice has been served' and that 'in the end, the truth prevailed.' Chiles hinted at the decision in an Instagram story, indicating she is heartbroken and is 'taking this time and removing myself from social media for my mental health, thank you.'

**Bronze Medal in Women's Floor Exercise to be Re-awarded**
The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has ruled that the bronze medal in women's floor exercise at the Paris Olympics must be re-awarded. The CAS upheld the appeal of the Romanian gymnastics federation, which argued that the US team's request to change the score of Jordan Chiles was made too late. As a result, the original score of 13.666 for Chiles will be reinstated, and the Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu will be awarded the bronze medal with a score of 13.700. The US gymnastics federation stated that they are 'devastated' by the decision, saying that their request was made in good faith to ensure an accurate scoring. The federation also expressed their disappointment that Chiles has been subjected to online harassment since the Romanian appeal was filed. The CAS decision has been accepted by the FIG, and the ranking will be adjusted accordingly, with Barbosu being listed as the bronze medalist.

**The ordeal stems from a score review that went down Monday and later overturned by the Tribunal Court of Arbitration for Sport.**
Jordan Chiles' bronze medal in the floor exercise at the 2024 Paris Olympics may be in jeopardy after the Tribunal Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturned her score. The CAS ruled that Chiles' coach requested a score review four seconds after the one-minute window elapsed, which was not allowed. Chiles' initial score of 13.666 had her in fifth place, but the review boosted her to 13.766 and into third place, knocking Romania's Ana Bărbosu off the podium. The CAS cannot force the removal of medals, but the International Gymnastics Federation can decide to strip Chiles of the bronze medal and award it to Bărbosu. USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee released a joint statement condemning the decision and supporting Chiles, who has taken a break from social media for her mental health. 'We are devastated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling regarding women's floor exercise,' the statement read. 'No athlete should be subject to such treatment. We commend Jordan for conducting herself with integrity both on and off the competition floor, and we continue to stand by and support her.'

**Olympia 2024: Bronze Medal in Floor Exercise to be Re-Awarded**
The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) has ordered the re-award of the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise at the Paris Olympics. The decision was made after the Romanian Gymnastics Federation filed a complaint, arguing that the US-American Jordan Chiles' request to change her score was submitted four seconds too late. As a result, the Romanian Ana Bărbosu moved up to third place with a score of 13.700. The US Gymnastics Federation expressed 'shock' over the decision, stating that the investigation into the difficulty value of Chiles' routine was done in good faith and in accordance with FIG rules. The federation also reported that Chiles had been subjected to online harassment since the decision. Chiles had initially hinted at the decision in an Instagram story, stating that she was 'heartbroken' and would be taking time to protect her mental health. The US team had initially filed a complaint during the competition, which was later upheld by the jury after reviewing the video footage. However, the decision was made after Bărbosu had already celebrated her third-place finish. The Romanian federation had also filed a complaint against the scoring of Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, which was later dismissed. The Cas has only awarded the bronze medal to Bărbosu, leaving the decision on the other two medals to the FIG.

The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) has overturned the original decision, awarding the bronze medal in women's floor exercise at the 2024 Olympics to Ana Barbosu of Romania. The decision was made after the Romanian federation appealed the original decision, citing that the US team's request for a re-evaluation of Jordan Chiles' score was made too late. The Cas ad hoc chamber agreed, ruling that Chiles' original score of 13.666 should be re-evaluated. As a result, Barbosu moves up to third place with a score of 13.700.
