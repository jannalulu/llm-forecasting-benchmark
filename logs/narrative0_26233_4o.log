*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, did "Deadpool & Wolverine" beat the combined openings of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine"?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 75.35%. Despite the conservative projections, the hype was real.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, those early pre-sales were a strong indicator. The June projection of $200+ million seemed optimistic, but it set the stage.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The buzz around the R-rated record helped. Marvel's marketing was spot on.

**NATE SILVER:** And the audience was ready for it. Our models never miss, do they?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Never. Even with the fluctuating projections, the data was clear.

*They exchange a knowing look, confident in their forecasting prowess.*

**NATE SILVER:** On to the next prediction, then.

*They shuffle their papers, ready for the next challenge.*

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, surrounded by stacks of newspapers and glowing computer screens.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the big question: Did "Deadpool & Wolverine" surpass the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine"?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. Despite the hype and strong pre-sales, the final numbers were just shy of the $185 million mark.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. The projections were all over the place. Even with Fandango's record pre-sales and early estimates hitting $200 million, it fell short.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, the market dynamics can be unpredictable. But our models remain accurate, capturing those nuances.

**NATE SILVER**  
Marvel's next steps will be fascinating to watch.

They nod in agreement, turning back to the screens, immersed in data and probabilities.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did "Deadpool & Wolverine" surpass that $185 million mark?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 45.32%. The projections were optimistic, but the final numbers didn't quite reach expectations.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Even with Fandango's record pre-sales and projections reaching $200 million, it seems the actual turnout was slightly below the mark.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. The buzz was tremendous, but ultimately, it was just shy of that combined total from "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine."

**NATE SILVER**  
A fascinating case of expectation versus reality. Marvel's still got a hit, but sometimes the numbers just don't align with the hype.
