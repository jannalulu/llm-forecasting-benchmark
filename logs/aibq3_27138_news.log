**Tech Giant Overtakes Apple and Microsoft, Emerges as New Most Valuable Company**
Nvidia Corporation, a California-based tech firm, has become the world's highest-valued company, surpassing Apple and Microsoft. The company's stock value has climbed throughout the first two quarters of 2024, driven by the popularity and potential of artificial intelligence. Nvidia's shares were trading at $135.21 late Tuesday afternoon, with a market capitalization of $3.329 trillion. The company's value has taken off since January, when it opened trading at $48.16. Nvidia is among the most prominent and trusted suppliers of AI technology, and its surge in value is driven by optimism among traders that AI is not only here to stay but will only become more prominent and refined. However, not everyone is sold on the company's continued growth, with Oliver Pursche of Wealthspire Advisors cautioning that Nvidia's investors might be due for a rude awakening if the company's performance falters. Meanwhile, The Western Journal, a news organization, is fighting to expose the lying leftist media and corrupt America-hating elites, and is calling on readers to support their efforts to keep the 2024 election free and fair.

**Nvidia becomes world's largest capitalized company, surpassing Apple and Microsoft**
Nvidia, a semiconductor designer and creator of the popular GPU, has become the world's largest capitalized company, surpassing Apple and Microsoft, a symbol of the fever of generative artificial intelligence (AI) that is shaking the markets. The company's market capitalization has reached $3352 billion, according to an AFP calculation. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia's stock price has increased by eight times.
