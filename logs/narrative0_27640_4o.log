NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a news desk, papers scattered before them.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, here we are, Philip. The question on everyone's mind: Will YouTube be banned in Russia before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models were quite clear on this. Given Roskomnadzor's history and recent actions, we had it at 65.75% for a "Yes."

**NATE SILVER**  
And yet, as of today, YouTube is still accessible in Russia. A surprising outcome, considering the performance degradation and media speculations.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models rarely miss, but this time, the political landscape shifted differently. A testament to the unpredictability of international relations.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. A reminder that probabilities, while accurate, can never account for last-minute geopolitical maneuvers.

They both nod, contemplating the intricacies of forecasting in an ever-changing world.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers and laptops scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, it's the day after the deadline. So, did YouTube get the axe in Russia?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 37.82%. Despite the performance throttling in July, the block didn't happen.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The anticipation was high, especially with the past bans on other platforms.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. But YouTube's unique role as a platform for both entertainment and information might be why it dodged the blocklist.

**NATE SILVER:** And the credible sources we had until late August certainly suggested a high probability, but not certainty.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The geopolitical landscape is unpredictable. Even with perfect models, some outcomes remain elusive.

*They nod in agreement, a shared understanding of the complexities of forecasting in a rapidly changing world.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by newspapers and laptops.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the big question everyone's asking: Was YouTube banned in Russia?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.25%. Despite the performance degradation in July, it seems Roskomnadzor stopped short of a full ban.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. The geopolitical climate suggested a higher chance, especially after the 2022 social media bans.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, but the economic implications and public backlash likely played a role. Plus, the access to YouTube remains a tool for information dissemination.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the models held firm. Another win for probabilistic forecasting.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. It’s a reminder that even in volatile environments, data-driven predictions can remain remarkably stable.

*They nod, satisfied with their accurate forecast.*

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered around. A large screen displays the Roskomnadzor blocklist site.

NATE  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Russia finally block YouTube?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 35.25%. Despite the July performance degradation, a full ban didn't materialize.

NATE  
Interesting. The 2022 blocks on Twitter and Facebook set a precedent, but YouTube survived.

PHILIP  
Exactly. The geopolitical climate was tense, but YouTube's utility and popularity likely deterred a complete block.

NATE  
The Metaculus community was initially sure it’d happen. Yet, here we are. No block.

PHILIP  
Indeed. Our models considered the potential fallout and strategic value. Sometimes, the status quo holds.
