A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, their screens filled with news articles and data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s official. The US did not offer India a nuclear submarine before September 30, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 5.32%. Given India's reliance on Russian military hardware and the US's stringent tech-sharing laws, it was always a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True. The AUKUS deal with Australia was a unique geopolitical move. India was never in the cards for something similar.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with 60% of India's military inventory coming from Russia, the strategic pivot would require more than just a submarine deal.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. Our models captured the realpolitik dynamics perfectly. No surprises here.

They nod, satisfied with their accuracy as the scene fades out.

The superforecasters gather around a table, their eyes fixed on the latest news updates. 

FORECASTER 1  
Well, the clock struck, and no nuclear submarine for India. 

FORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 5.67%. The US's legal constraints and India's Russian ties made it improbable.

FORECASTER 3  
Right. Even with the AUKUS precedent, the geopolitical calculus was different. 

FORECASTER 4  
India's reliance on Russian hardware was a significant factor. A sudden shift seemed unlikely.

FORECASTER 1  
And let's not forget the US's reluctance to bypass its own laws, even for strategic partners.

FORECASTER 2  
The models were never wrong. A low probability event indeed.

They nod, reaffirming their trust in the data-driven insights that guide their forecasts.

FADE OUT.

A sleek, modern room filled with screens displaying global news. SUPERFORECASTERS, a diverse group of experts, gather around a table.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's been a day since the deadline. Will US offer India a nuclear submarine? Our models had it at 0.05%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given India's reliance on Russian military hardware, a US-India nuclear sub deal seemed improbable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. The US-UK-Australia pact in 2021 set a precedent, but sharing nuclear tech with India was always a stretch.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Plus, US laws restrict nuclear propulsion tech sharing. It was realpolitik, not a snub.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Exactly. Even without new developments by July 2024, the probability remained negligible.

They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their models.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
In forecasting, even a 0.05% is significant. It means our models captured reality.
