**Starmer has just shot himself in the foot**
Labour leader Keir Starmer has refused to abolish the two-child benefit cap, introduced by the Conservative government in 2017, despite criticism from the Left. The cap limits state benefits to two children per family, affecting 1.6 million children and costing low-income families an average of £4,300 a year. Starmer's decision has been met with support from the majority of the British public, who believe fiscal discipline is necessary due to the country's financial situation. The article argues that the public's support for the cap may be due to a recognition that the welfare bill is unsustainable and that cuts must be made somewhere.

**Labour cites ‘spending controls' amid calls to ditch two-child benefit cap**
The UK's two-child benefit cap has been criticized by campaigners and charities, who are calling for it to be scrapped. The cap, introduced in 2017, restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households. According to the latest statistics, over 1.6 million children are affected, with 52% of them living in households with three children, 29% with four children, and 19% with five or more children. The Archbishop of Canterbury has described the policy as 'cruel' and 'neither moral nor necessary'. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he would scrap the cap 'in an ideal world', but the party's Environment Secretary, Steve Reed, has indicated that it will not be abolished without economic growth. The Church of England and several charities have backed the call to end the policy, which they say is causing child poverty. The Resolution Foundation estimates that abolishing the cap would cost the government between £2.5 billion and £3.6 billion in 2024/25, but would lift 490,000 children out of poverty.

**Two-child cap to hit extra 670,000 children in next five years, thinktank warns**
A thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has warned that the two-child benefit cap will affect an additional 670,000 children by the end of the next parliament if not reformed. The cap, introduced in 2017, limits child benefits for the first two children in most households. Campaigners have called for its abolition, citing its impact on poverty. The IFS found that the cap has driven up the share of children in large families in relative poverty from 35% to 46% between 2014-15 and 2022. The Labour Party has faced pressure to drop the cap, but has not committed to ending it. The Green Party and Liberal Democrats have committed to abolishing the cap in their manifestos.

**I must admit, Starmer's refusal to bow to the Left's wishes is admirable**
Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, has refused to abolish the two-child benefit cap, introduced by the Conservative government in 2017, despite pressure from the Left. The cap limits state benefits to two children per family, affecting 1.6 million children in 2023. Starmer has argued that the country's financial situation, including a high tax burden and government debt, requires fiscal discipline. A recent YouGov poll shows that 60% of the British public support keeping the cap. The article suggests that the public's support for the cap may be due to concerns about the sustainability of the welfare bill and the need for fiscal discipline.

**What is the UK's two-child cap on benefits and will Labour reverse it?**

Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves have been reluctant to address the issue, citing the poor state of the UK's finances and the cost of extending the benefits system.

**Scrapping two-child benefit cap will be considered**
The UK Labour government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which currently affects 2 million children and will impact 700,000 more by the end of the current parliament. The removal of the cap could lift 300,000 children out of poverty. However, the government has suggested that it cannot afford to abolish the cap unless economic growth is secured first. The SNP, Labour, Greens, and independent MPs have tabled amendments to the King's speech to scrap the cap, and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said that its removal will be 'considered'. Phillipson emphasized the need to address poverty, citing factors such as housing and the fact that work does not pay enough for many families.

The UK Government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which affects 1.6 million children, amid growing pressure to address child poverty.

Ministers have suggested that abolishing the cap would be too expensive unless economic growth is secured first.

**Two-child benefit cap could be scrapped as 1.6million children miss out on £288 a month**
Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has announced that the government will consider removing the two-child benefit cap, which limits the amount of financial support families can receive to just two kids. The cap affects 1.6 million children, who are missing out on up to £288 a month in extra support. Scrapping the cap would provide a boost to many households struggling amid the cost of living crisis. However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has resisted pressure to abolish the cap, citing concerns over the £3bn annual cost. Labour leader Keir Starmer has also faced pressure from his party to commit to scrapping the policy.

**Labour MPs launch attempt to scrap two-child benefit cap**
Labour MPs, led by Kim Johnson, have launched an attempt to scrap the two-child benefit cap, which restricts benefits to the first two children in most households. The cap affects over 1.6 million children and has been criticized for being 'cruel' and 'ineffective' in alleviating poverty. Despite calls from campaigners and trade unions to abolish the cap, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to scrap it, citing a lack of resources. The amendment, which has been signed by 16 Labour MPs, argues that scrapping the cap would lift 300,000 children out of poverty and is the most cost-effective way to address child poverty.

**Will Starmer take on ownership of two-child benefit cap?**
The new Labour government is facing criticism for not abolishing the two-child benefit cap, introduced by George Osborne in 2017, which prevents parents from claiming child tax credit or universal credit for a third child or subsequent children born after that date. The cap currently affects two million children and will encompass close to 700,000 more by the end of the current parliament. Labour's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government cannot afford the £1.7bn it would cost to abolish the cap, while SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn described it as 'appalling and indefensible' and called for the cap to be scrapped. The article suggests that Labour's failure to abolish the cap will lead to scrutiny over what they are willing to spend money on and may hand the SNP an attack line.
