*The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecaster MARIA stands before a screen displaying hurricane data.*

**MARIA:** Yesterday marked the end of September, and as we anticipated, exactly three major hurricanes swept through the Atlantic.

*She gestures to the screen, highlighting the storm paths.*

**MARIA:** Our models had it at 92.45%. The data up to September 12th indicated favorable conditions—warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear.

**JAMES, another superforecaster, nods.**

**JAMES:** Yes, and with climate change intensifying storm activity, our predictions aligned with the NOAA's above-normal season forecast.

*MARIA smiles, satisfied.*

**MARIA:** The accuracy of our models is crucial. Communities rely on this foresight to prepare and respond effectively.

*They exchange a look of accomplishment, knowing their work has once again proven invaluable.*

Two superforecasters, ALEX and JORDAN, sit in front of a computer, reviewing data.

**ALEX:** So, the question was, "Will exactly 3 major Atlantic hurricanes occur in September 2024?"

**JORDAN:** Right. Our models had it at 75.32%. Given the trends, it seemed likely.

**ALEX:** But it didn't happen. Only two hurricanes reached Category 3.

**JORDAN:** True. The last one just missed the mark. Climate change is making predictions trickier.

**ALEX:** Still, the models were spot-on. The probability reflected reality.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. It's fascinating how accurate they are, even with all the variables.

**ALEX:** Well, our job is to prepare, not predict with certainty.

**JORDAN:** Agreed. Let's update the report for the NHC.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, and turn back to their screens.
