To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider relevant factors:

1. Historical precedent: The articles don't provide clear data on how many world records were broken in previous Olympics. This is a key missing piece of information that would help establish a baseline.

2. Specific predictions: Several articles mention expectations for world records to be broken in various events:
- Swimming: Multiple records expected to be challenged, including in 400m individual medley, 200m freestyle, and others.
- Athletics: Records expected to be challenged in women's 100m, high jump, pole vault, and others.
- Other sports: Records mentioned as potentially being broken in weightlifting and rock climbing.

3. Athlete performances: Many articles highlight specific athletes who are approaching or have recently broken world records, suggesting they may be poised to do so again at the Olympics.

4. Technological advancements: While not explicitly mentioned, improvements in equipment, training methods, and nutrition often contribute to record-breaking performances.

5. Home advantage: As the host country, French athletes may have an extra boost, potentially leading to more record-breaking performances.

6. COVID-19 impact: The unusual circumstances of the past few years may have disrupted some athletes' training, but could also mean some are peaking later than usual.

7. Number of events: With 329 events scheduled, there are many opportunities for records to be broken.

8. Motivation: The prestige of the Olympics often leads to peak performances.

Balancing these factors:

- The multiple specific predictions of records being broken across various sports suggests a high likelihood of at least some records falling.
- The large number of events provides many opportunities for record-breaking performances.
- However, world records are by definition difficult to break, and 24 is a significant number.
- The lack of clear historical data makes it difficult to establish a precise baseline expectation.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a good chance of multiple world records being broken, but 24 is a high bar. I'll provide a range that reflects this uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical data: 
- At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 17 world records were broken.
- At the 2016 Rio Olympics, 27 world records were broken.
- At the 2012 London Olympics, 32 world records were broken.

This suggests a baseline of around 20-30 world records per recent Summer Olympics.

2. Specific predictions for Paris 2024:
- Multiple articles mention 5-6 world records likely to be broken in swimming and athletics.
- Additional records are predicted in pole vault, weightlifting, and rock climbing.

3. Factors that could increase record-breaking:
- Technological advancements in equipment and training methods.
- The post-pandemic return to full training and competition schedules.
- The introduction of new events like breakdancing.
- Strong competition in established events pushing athletes to new heights.

4. Factors that could decrease record-breaking:
- Increased anti-doping efforts.
- Some records (like Usain Bolt's) are considered extremely difficult to break.
- Potential weather conditions in Paris affecting outdoor events.

5. Recent trends:
- Several articles mention multiple world records being broken in lead-up events to the Olympics.
- Some athletes like Armand Duplantis have been consistently breaking their own world records.

6. Additional considerations:
- The definition includes records broken in qualifiers and finals separately.
- Some sports (like rowing) have "world bests" rather than world records and don't count.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a good chance of reaching or exceeding 24 world records, but it's not certain. The historical data and specific predictions for Paris suggest we're likely to see at least 20 records broken, with a reasonable chance of exceeding 24.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, with 72.50% being the most likely. Probability: 72.50%.

1. Historical data: 
- The articles don't provide specific numbers for world records broken at previous Olympics. This is a significant gap in our information.

2. Expectations for Paris 2024:
- Several articles mention multiple world records that could be broken, suggesting a high potential.
- Specific events highlighted include swimming, athletics (track and field), pole vault, and speed climbing.

3. Individual athlete predictions:
- Multiple articles mention athletes like Armand Duplantis (pole vault), Sydney McLaughlin (400m hurdles), and others who are expected to break their own world records.
- The swimming events are particularly highlighted as having potential for multiple record breaks.

4. Factors that could increase record-breaking:
- Home advantage for French athletes
- Improvements in training and technology
- The prestige of the Olympics often leads to peak performances

5. Factors that could decrease record-breaking:
- Some records are already very difficult to break
- Pressure of the Olympics can sometimes lead to underperformance
- Weather conditions could be unfavorable

6. Recent trends:
- The articles suggest that world records have been falling frequently in recent competitions, indicating a trend towards more record-breaking performances.

7. Number of events:
- There will be 329 events at the Paris Olympics, providing many opportunities for records to be broken.

Balancing these factors, it seems likely that a significant number of world records will be broken. However, 24 is a high bar.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical data: 
- The articles don't provide specific numbers for world records broken at previous Olympics. This is a significant gap in our information.

2. Expectations for Paris 2024:
- Several articles mention multiple world records that could be broken, suggesting a high potential.
- Specific events highlighted include swimming, athletics (track and field), pole vault, and speed climbing.

3. Individual athlete predictions:
- Multiple articles mention athletes like Armand Duplantis (pole vault), Sydney McLaughlin (400m hurdles), and others who are expected to break their own world records.
- The swimming events are particularly highlighted as having potential for multiple record breaks.

4. Factors that could increase record-breaking:
- Home advantage for French athletes
- Improvements in training and technology
- The prestige of the Olympics often leads to peak performances

5. Factors that could decrease record-breaking:
- Some records are already very difficult to break
- Pressure of the Olympics can sometimes lead to underperformance
- Weather conditions could be unfavorable

6. Recent trends:
- The articles suggest that world records have been falling frequently in recent competitions, indicating a trend towards more record-breaking performances.

7. Number of events:
- There will be 329 events at the Paris Olympics, providing many opportunities for records to be broken.

Balancing these factors, it seems likely that a significant number of world records will be broken. However, 24 is a high bar. Given the multiple mentions of potential record-breaking performances across various sports, and the large number of events, I believe there's a good chance of reaching or exceeding 24 world records.

However, we must be cautious about overconfidence. The lack of specific historical data on the number of world records broken at previous Olympics is a significant limitation. We also need to consider that not all predicted record-breaking performances will materialize.

Given these considerations, I would estimate a range that leans towards the possibility of 24 or more records being broken, but with a significant chance of falling short.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.
