**Brandenburg Election Poll: SPD Closes Gap, AfD Remains Ahead**
The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the Brandenburg AfD state association as a suspected case of right-wing extremism. A new state parliament will be elected in Brandenburg on September 22. According to a representative ARD survey, 1,513 eligible voters in Brandenburg were questioned this week. The Free Voters, Greens, and Left Party are currently below five percent. The AfD and SPD are currently at a similar level, as they were five years ago at the last state election. The CDU, currently in coalition with the SPD and Greens, is at 16 percent in the latest survey, down two percentage points from last week's survey.

**Brandenburg's Landtagspräsidentin Warns of Thuringian Scenarios**
Brandenburg's Landtagspräsidentin Ulrike Liedtke (SPD) has warned voters about the potential for a difficult government formation after the upcoming state election. She said, 'I see big problems in Thuringia.' Liedtke emphasized that the ability of the state to act is the top priority. In the upcoming election on September 22, a coalition between the CDU, BSW, and SPD is considered the most likely solution. However, this coalition does not have a majority and relies on at least one vote from the Left. Liedtke sees no ability to act with a strong AfD. She hopes that voters will make a decision to secure the state's ability to act, saying, 'As citizens of our country, you can now think about who or what you want to vote for to secure this ability to act.' Liedtke criticizes the AfD's goals, saying, 'Remigration is not acceptable to me.' She advocates for finding solutions for better integration of newcomers, such as job creation. The Brandenburg Verfassungsschutz has classified the AfD's state association as a right-wing extremist suspicion. The AfD plans to start a massive deportation program and dissolve the Verfassungsschutz in its current form after the election. A recent survey by Infratest Dimap shows the AfD with 27% and the SPD with 23%. The CDU has 18%, the BSW has 15%, and the Greens have 5%. The Left has 4%, and the BVB/Freie Wähler have 3%. A study by the Bertelsmann-Stiftung suggests that the AfD could potentially gain more than a third of the seats in the Landtag with an assumed result of over a quarter of the second votes. This could lead to the AfD being able to block decisions that require a two-thirds majority, such as constitutional changes. Liedtke does not share these concerns, saying, 'I see it optimistically.' However, she also thinks that the electoral law needs to be revised, saying, 'We need to take the electoral law and probably shape it similarly to the federal level.' She also asks, 'How big should the parliament be?'

**AfD and SPD Gain Ground in Brandenburg State Election**
A recent poll by Infratest Dimap for the RBB shows that the AfD and SPD are gaining ground in the upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22. The AfD is leading with 27% of the vote, a 4% increase from the previous poll. The SPD is close behind with 23%, also a 4% increase. The CDU is in third place with 18%. The Greens are struggling to reach the 5% threshold, with 5% of the vote, and the Left and BVB/Freie Wähler are not expected to enter the parliament. Dietmar Woidke, the Minister-President of Brandenburg, is leading the SPD in the election. He has been in a coalition with the CDU and Greens, but it remains to be seen if this will continue after the election. As Woidke said, 'It's a tough competition, but we're confident that our message will resonate with the voters.'

**Brandenburg State Election: SPD Leads, but AfD Remains in First Place**
According to a recent poll by Infratest Dimap, the SPD is leading in the Brandenburg state election, but still in second place. The AfD has gained support and remains in the lead. The SPD has also gained support, but its lead as the second-placed party has not decreased. The poll was conducted on September 3-4 and involved 1207 voters in Brandenburg. If the election were held today, the AfD would receive 27% of the vote, followed by the SPD with 23%. The CDU would receive 18%, while the BSW would receive 15%. The Greens would receive 5%, and the Left and BVB/Freie Wähler would not receive enough votes to enter the parliament. However, the parties could still enter the parliament through the 'Grundmandatsklausel' rule. Ministerpräsident Dietmar Woidke has announced that he would step down if the SPD does not win the election. The voters in Brandenburg are divided on the possibility of a BSW government, with 42% in favor and 42% against. 61% are against an AfD government.

**Brandenburg State Election 2024: Everything You Need to Know**
The state parliament of Brandenburg will be elected on September 22, 2024. The election is significant as it determines the 88 members of the parliament, who in turn elect the Minister-President and make important decisions for the state. The parliament's tasks include legislation, controlling the government, and deciding on the budget. This means that the parliament decides how the government's money is spent, an important point for all citizens. To be eligible to vote, one must be a German citizen, at least 16 years old, and have a permanent residence in Brandenburg for at least a month. People with mental disabilities in full care are also eligible to vote since 2018. To vote, one must be registered in the voter register, which can be found in the voting notification sent by post. On election day, a personal ID and the voting notification are required. If you are eligible to vote but still undecided, try the Wahl-O-Mat to get an assessment of which party best represents your views.

Compared to the 2019 election, the SPD is expected to lose significantly, while the CDU is expected to gain slightly. The BSW is expected to gain the most votes, but it was only founded in January 2024 and did not participate in the 2019 election. The top candidates for the upcoming election are: SPD - Minister-President Dietmar Woidke, CDU - [not specified], AfD - [not specified], and BSW - Sahra Wagenknecht.

**Brandenburg Election Poll: SPD Closes Gap with AfD**
A new poll in Brandenburg, 10 days before the state election on September 22, shows a close race between the SPD and the AfD. The SPD, led by Minister-President Dietmar Woidke, has gained 3 percentage points to 26%, closing the gap with the AfD, which remains at 27%. The AfD is considered a right-wing extremist suspect by the Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution. The poll was conducted by Infratest dimap for ARD, interviewing 1,513 eligible voters in Brandenburg from Monday to Wednesday of this week. As Ministerpräsident Woidke said, 'It is a great day for the SPD, we are closing the gap with the AfD.'

**Brandenburg Election: SPD Closes Gap with AfD in New Survey**
Ten days before the Brandenburg state election, a new survey by the Infratest dimap institute for ARD shows the SPD closing the gap with the AfD, with 26% of the vote, just behind the AfD's 27%. This is an improvement of 3 percentage points for the Social Democrats under Minister-President Dietmar Woidke, unlike in the federal trend. The AfD remains unchanged in the survey. The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD's state association as a suspected right-wing extremist organization. On September 22, a new state parliament will be elected in Brandenburg. For the representative ARD survey, Infratest dimap interviewed 1,513 eligible voters in Brandenburg from Monday to Wednesday of this week. A two-horse race is emerging between the AfD and the SPD, similar to five years ago. The CDU, currently in coalition with the SPD and Greens, comes in at 16% and loses 2 percentage points compared to the previous week's survey. The Greens and BVB/Freie Wähler each reach 4.5%, while the Left Party comes in at 4%. According to the survey, all three would fall below the 5% hurdle. However, due to a clause, it is possible to enter the parliament with at least one direct mandate even if the threshold is not reached. While BVB/Freie Wähler gain 1.5 points compared to the previous survey, the Greens lose slightly, and the Left Party remains stagnant. The alliance led by Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) comes in at 13%, two points lower than the previous week. The majority of respondents want the SPD to lead the next state government, with 40% in favor, followed by 25% for the CDU and 20% for the AfD. The SPD has been ruling in Brandenburg since 1990 with changing partners, and since 2019 with the CDU and Greens. Woidke has announced that he will leave politics if the SPD does not come out on top in the election. The AfD had more than 30% in the state elections in Thuringia and Saxony on September 1, with the AfD becoming the strongest force in Thuringia.

**Brandenburg Election: AfD Leads in Polls, SPD Launches New Campaign**
The upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, 2024, is expected to be a significant event in German politics. According to Alice Weidel, the leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a win for the AfD in Brandenburg would be a 'watershed moment' for the country. Weidel stated, 'What we need are new elections.' The AfD is currently leading in polls, with 27% of the vote, ahead of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) with 23%. The SPD, however, is trying to counter the AfD's momentum with a new campaign featuring a digital animation of Ministerpräsident Dietmar Woidke, which says 'Wenn Glatze, dann Woidke' ('If baldness, then Woidke'). SPD-Generalsekretär David Kolesnyk said, 'We want to show that we are not 'rechte Glatzen' (right-wing bald men), but rather 'Wenn Glatze, dann Woidke'.' The SPD is trying to appeal to younger voters and those who are not typically interested in politics, while also emphasizing the importance of not electing right-wing extremists to office.

**AfD Leads in Brandenburg State Election Polls, Weidel Hopes for 'Watershed Moment'**
The upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, 2024, is expected to be a significant event in German politics. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently leading in the polls, with 27% of the vote, according to a recent survey by Infratest dimap. AfD leader Alice Weidel hopes that a strong showing in Brandenburg will lead to a 'watershed moment' in German politics. Weidel stated, 'What we need are new elections.' If Minister-President Dietmar Woidke (SPD) loses the election, Weidel predicts that the SPD will suffer a significant setback, potentially leading to new national elections. The SPD, however, is not giving up, and has launched a new campaign featuring an animated video of Woidke's bald head, with the slogan 'Wenn Glatze, dann Woidke' (If bald, then Woidke). The campaign aims to appeal to younger voters and those who are not typically interested in politics. SPD General Secretary David Kolesnyk stated, 'We can't use right-wing extremists in government.' The AfD has been classified as a right-wing extremist group by the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.

**Brandenburg State Election: AfD Poised to Become Strongest Force**
The upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, 2024, will determine the political landscape in the state capital Potsdam. According to current polls, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) is likely to become the strongest force in the state, while the Social Democratic Party (SPD) may lose significant support. The SPD, led by Minister President Dietmar Woidke, is currently seen as the second-strongest force in the state, with around 23% of the vote. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is expected to receive around 16-18% of the vote. The Greens and Left Party may lose further support, with the Greens potentially falling below the 5% threshold. The Free Voters' Association (BVB/Freie Wähler) is also expected to play a role in the election. Woidke has announced that he will resign if the AfD wins the election, and has ruled out a coalition with the new BSW party. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the turnout and the performance of the different parties.

**Brandenburg State Election 2024: What You Need to Know**
The state election in Brandenburg, Germany will take place on September 22, 2024. The election will determine the composition of the Landtag, which will then elect the Minister-President. The current government, led by Minister-President Dietmar Woidke (SPD), has been in power for five years. To be eligible to vote, one must be at least 18 years old and have lived in Brandenburg for at least three months. Voters can choose between two candidates in each of the 44 electoral districts, and the party with the most votes in each district will receive a direct mandate. The remaining 44 seats will be allocated based on the proportional representation of the parties' votes. If a party receives more direct mandates than it is entitled to based on the proportional representation of the second votes, it will retain these 'overhang mandates.' The other parties will receive 'balance mandates' to ensure a proportional distribution of seats. A party must receive at least 5% of the second votes to be represented in the Landtag. The current leading candidates are Dietmar Woidke (SPD), Jan Redmann (CDU), and Benjamin Raschke (Bündnis 90/ Die Grünen). Robert Crumbach, the BSW leader, has stated that his party will not be a 'cheap majority provider' and will only participate in a government if they have a significant role. The election outcome is uncertain, with the AfD potentially becoming the strongest party. The current government, a coalition of SPD, CDU, and Grüne, may struggle to maintain power. Possible coalition options include a coalition between SPD, CDU, and BSW, or a coalition between SPD and Grüne. However, a coalition with the AfD has been ruled out by all established parties.
