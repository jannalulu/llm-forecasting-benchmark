*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered. A digital screen behind them displays headlines.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Will Alexandre de Moraes cease to be a minister of the Supreme Federal Court before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the controversies, including the clash with Elon Musk over the X platform and the alleged election influence, the impeachment process in Brazil is complex and rare.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. His lifetime appointment and the political dynamics made it unlikely. The noise was loud, but the numbers always spoke differently.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Precisely. His role in Brazil's democratic landscape remains intact, at least for now. 

*The screen shifts to a graphic of de Moraes, with "Status: Active" in bold letters.*

**NATE SILVER:** And so, the forecast holds.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Alexandre de Moraes leave the Supreme Federal Court before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.75%. Despite the controversies and calls for impeachment, the political landscape just didn't support his removal.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The impeachment process in Brazil is complex, and de Moraes still had strong backing. Our models accounted for that.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Even with international pressure, like Musk's involvement, it wasn't enough to tip the scales.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, another prediction in the books. On to the next challenge.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other at a table, surrounded by newspapers and laptops.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the big question: Did Alexandre de Moraes cease to be a minister before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 28.73%. Despite the controversies and calls for impeachment, the probability was always low.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The political climate was volatile, but his removal required more than just public outcry. Our models factored in the lifetime appointment and the lack of substantial legislative momentum.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Even with international pressure and figures like Elon Musk in the mix, the structural barriers were significant.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.32%. Despite the political tension and calls for impeachment, the structural and procedural barriers were too significant to overcome in such a short timeframe.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, the political landscape in Brazil is complex. While de Moraes faced significant pressure, our data indicated that the likelihood of him stepping down was minimal.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The lifetime appointment and the lack of a confirmed successor reinforced our low probability estimate.

Well, Philip, here we are. The day after the deadline, and Alexandre de Moraes is still a minister of the Supreme Federal Court. Our models had it at 25.67% that he would cease to be a minister by now.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(nodding)  
Yes, Nate. Despite the controversy surrounding his actions and the calls for impeachment, the likelihood of him stepping down was always low. The political landscape in Brazil, the lifetime appointment, and his age made it unlikely.

**NATE SILVER**  
And let's not forget, the mandatory retirement age is still two decades away for him. Our models accounted for all these factors accurately.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The noise around the event was significant, but the underlying probabilities told a different story. As always, the data doesn't lie.
