Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any specific public forecasts for this exact question on platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket. There isn't one on Metaculus either at the time of writing. This means I'm starting with a clean slate and need to build my analysis from the ground up.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question revolves around a year-over-year increase in TSA passenger volume on the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving. This can be broken into several sub-problems:
    *   **Base Rate:** What is the typical year-over-year fluctuation in TSA passenger numbers on these specific days? This requires looking at historical data on growth rates around this period.
    *   **Underlying Travel Demand:** How strong is the general travel demand in the US currently, as evidenced by recent TSA data?
    *   **Thanksgiving-Specific Factors:** Are there specific factors that might either boost or reduce travel this Thanksgiving? This includes travel price trends, election uncertainty, airline capacity management, and any other factors unique to the period.
    *   **Capacity Limitations:** Are there potential bottlenecks in the system that could limit the number of people who can fly, irrespective of demand?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Absent specific information, the base rate assumption would be that passenger traffic grows with population increases. There have been modest growth rates (around 2-3%) over recent years in that regard (even during non-Covid times). I'll use that as a rough starting base rate, recognising that travel can sometimes grow faster than population. I'll look at past Thanksgiving growth to help dial this in better.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**  I will then factor in the specific information gleaned from the provided news articles. I'll pay attention to the most recent IATA reports, price trends, airline actions and other travel-related news that is provided.

**4. Balancing Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:**  I must not ignore significant trends and information from IATA and other reports. The aviation industry is dynamic, and I need to give weight to recent data.
*   **Overreacting:** I will not assume that any single factor guarantees an outcome. For example, lower airfares might not necessarily translate directly into increased travel if other factors (like election anxiety) dampen demand.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

Several factors could push travel volumes up, or down:
*   **Upsides:**
    *   **Strong Underlying Demand:**  IATA reports indicate record-high demand, at least until the end of September. Recent travel trends have shown an increase over pre-pandemic levels.
    *   **Lower Airfares:** Some articles point to lower airfares compared to last year for the Thanksgiving period.
    *  **Economic Growth:** Positive GDP and improvements in fuel efficiency are good for the industry.
*   **Downsides:**
    *  **Election Anxiety:** News reports suggest potential for a "pause" in travel due to election-related uncertainty.
    *  **Capacity Constraints:** There are concerns about capacity crunches and supply chain issues.
    *   **"Holiday Tax" Talk:** Some articles mention potential APD (Air Passenger Duty) increases, which could discourage travel.
    *  **Increased hotel costs:** May reduce overall travel if people can't afford it overall.

**6. Linear Extrapolation of Current Trends:**

The most recent IATA data (through September 2024) shows strong passenger demand increases. If this pattern were to continue linearly, it would suggest higher volumes this Thanksgiving. However, this is unlikely given the countervailing factors of election anxiety and potential tax increases.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

Given the various conflicting forces, it is hard to predict with 100% certainty whether there will be a year-over-year increase. I must maintain a sense of appropriate doubt.

**8. Balancing Confidence/Prudence:**

I am moderately confident that the increase will happen, but I need to also account for any negative surprises related to election anxiety, capacity constraints, or an unexpected large increase in APD.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   **Hindsight Bias:** I'll be careful not to assume I "knew it all along" after the resolution.
*   **Overconfidence:** I need to accept that my forecast could be wrong, given the complexities.

**Analysis & Forecast:**

The most recent IATA reports and the Bank of America report point to a strong underlying demand for air travel. There are multiple factors pushing up travel demand in general; the decrease in airfares is also positive for passenger volume. Countering these are a number of negative factors. The major ones are the election-related pause that is expected in travel bookings, and the very real risk of some sort of "holiday tax" being introduced which could reduce demand (both of which are largely unique to this time period). This leaves me to conclude that the most recent IATA reports probably don't give the best insight into potential traffic numbers for *this* time period. The election related anxiety will likely cause a dip in travel, as will an increase in APD. The articles do suggest that the Wednesday after Thanksgiving is also less crowded than the Wednesday before, further suggesting that people prefer not to travel on Wednesday if possible. 

Given all this information, I lean towards a *slightly* increased passenger volume this year. I expect the lower prices will encourage some extra travel, but the election anxiety and holiday tax concerns will prevent a very large jump. I'm going to weight the base rate as more important than the more volatile and contradictory specific evidence. I am leaning slightly more positive than neutral, but I can't rule out a marginal decrease in passenger volume.

My initial guess is 60% for the outcome being positive. Given the contradictory evidence that pushes this down to a more modest level. I'll adjust my forecast down accordingly.

**My Prediction:** Between 45.00% and 70.00%, but 58.00% being the most likely. Probability: 58.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any relevant predictions for this specific question from major forecasting platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket. Metaculus does not have a similar question so I can't use their data. I need to rely on the information that is available.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical year-over-year change in passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving? Is there a usual growth rate that I can use to build a baseline?
*   **Current Trends:** What do the most recent air travel demand figures indicate? Are there signs of acceleration or deceleration?
*   **Thanksgiving-Specific Factors:** Are there specific trends or events impacting Thanksgiving travel in 2024?
*   **Capacity Issues:** Are there capacity constraints that might limit passenger growth despite demand?
*   **Economic Factors:** What is the overall economic picture and how could it affect travel?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** The outside view here is that typically, air travel has generally been increasing over the past few years (with the exception of the COVID pandemic period), and therefore a positive change year-on-year is a decent base-rate expectation.
*   **Inside View:** I need to carefully consider the specific factors unique to the 2024 Thanksgiving travel period.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I must be careful not to overreact to single data points or news articles, but also not to underreact to significant shifts in the travel landscape.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Increase:**
    *   **Strong overall demand:** Multiple articles mention strong and increasing passenger demand globally. IATA reports show strong growth in passenger numbers throughout the year, with records being broken in recent months. The US has seen strong demand too.
    *   **Economic Recovery:**  General economic recovery and spending is likely to be leading to increased travel.
    *   **"Revenge Travel"**:  Pent-up demand after the pandemic may still be influencing travel decisions.
    *  **Population increase**: The population of the US has also grown year over year, increasing the overall pool of travellers.
*   **Forces for Decrease:**
    *   **Capacity Constraints:** Several articles mention potential capacity crunches in the aviation industry, which may limit passenger numbers. Also some articles highlight reduced capacity in some areas. This could mean prices rise instead of volumes rising.
    *   **Fuel prices**: Although fuel prices have dropped recently, if there is a reversal of this trend it could also impact travel numbers.
    *   **Potential political unrest**: Some articles mentioned that some people are concerned about the political climate and will therefore not travel over the election period.
    *   **Economic concerns**:  Inflation and other economic concerns could lead to some people choosing not to travel.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   Extrapolating recent trends would suggest continued growth in passenger numbers. However, I need to be cautious of potential saturation, capacity constraints, and the possible effects of the election.
    
**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   Given the multitude of factors involved, there's a degree of uncertainty. However, the available information strongly suggests continued growth.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*  I need to balance the strong recent growth trends against potential capacity issues, economic anxieties, and election concerns, and assign probabilities to each accordingly.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   After resolution, I will examine any discrepancies between the forecast and the actual outcome, while being cautious not to engage in hindsight bias.

**Reasoning and Justification:**

The overall picture suggests a high likelihood that US airline passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 will be up year over year.

*   **Strong Base Rate:**  Passenger volume tends to increase year-over-year, barring major disruptions. 
*   **Strong Demand:** Multiple sources confirm that global and US air travel demand is currently very high, and has been consistently breaking records during the year. IATA data shows significant increases in passenger traffic on an international and domestic level.
*   **Positive Economic Environment (to some extent)**:  Despite inflation, consumers seem to be willing to spend on travel.
*   **Thanksgiving Travel**: The articles highlight that the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving are traditionally the busiest travel days.
*   **Reduced Capacity** There are some articles stating that airlines are lowering capacity in some areas to boost margins - however, the overall trend shows the number of passengers is still rising.

There are some factors which point against that outcome however:

*  **Capacity constraints**: I am aware that there is the potential for capacity constraints in the aviation industry. This would mean that passenger volume might not grow as much as demand suggests and prices may be pushed up rather than passenger numbers increasing.
*   **Election concerns**: Concerns about political unrest or unease surrounding the election could cause some people to change or reduce travel plans.
*   **Economic concerns**: Despite some high level spending, there are concerns about the economy and inflation, which could reduce the likelihood of people travelling.
*   **Fuel price reversal**: If fuel prices increase again this could reduce the numbers flying.

Balancing these factors, the strong positive demand trends outweigh the potential negative impacts. I think the capacity constraints will be noticeable but not enough to reduce total passenger numbers below the prior year. Therefore I think a positive outcome is more likely than not.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 90.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem step-by-step.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't see any directly comparable forecasts on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or a similar specific Metaculus question. So I cannot rely on external predictions for the exact question.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is: will TSA passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 exceed that of 2023?  To answer this, we need to consider factors that might influence air travel demand and capacity on those specific days, which means that we will need to consider both the likely direction of effect of these factors, and also their likely magnitude. Some key factors include:

*   **Overall demand for air travel:** Is it generally increasing or decreasing?
*   **Thanksgiving travel specifics:** Are there any trends affecting Thanksgiving travel specifically?
*   **Capacity constraints:** Are there factors that might limit the number of available flights?
*   **Economic factors:** Are there any changes in consumer spending or economic conditions that might affect travel?
*   **External events:** Are there any significant events that could affect travel? (e.g. elections)
*   **Pricing**: Has airfare increased or decreased?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside view:** Historically, air travel has generally trended upwards over the long term. Thanksgiving is a reliably busy travel period. 2023 was a strong year for air travel recovery. Given no major systemic shocks, it is reasonable to assume some growth over the prior year.
*   **Inside View:** Let's examine specific factors influencing the outcome and adjust from this base rate.

**4. Balancing Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I need to avoid overreacting to individual articles or short-term fluctuations, focusing on consistent patterns and overall trends. At the same time, I should also avoid anchoring too tightly to the past and be willing to adapt to new information.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing for increased travel:**
    *   Strong overall demand for air travel, exceeding pre-pandemic levels (IATA reports of record September demand, high load factors, general growth in air passenger numbers, air travel expected to break all records in 2024, passenger numbers predicted to double by 2042)
    *   Generally positive economic trends supporting discretionary spending (as per some articles)
    *   Airlines improving efficiency and capacity (though still facing some challenges)
*   **Forces potentially limiting travel:**
    *   Potential capacity crunch and infrastructure limitations (IATA warnings)
    *   Rising costs of air travel due to inflation, fuel prices, and other factors (reported increases in airfare)
    *   US Election anxiety causing some to avoid travel around the election (though potentially boosting travel the week after the election).
    *   Potential effects of Air Passenger Duty in the UK, although this will not directly affect US domestic travel.
    *   GTF engine issues affecting some aircraft availability and delaying deliveries.
    *  Lower prices this year, which should promote more travel.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**
* Overall the trends point to increasing air passenger volume. This should continue in the leadup to Thanksgiving. Although, some potential disruptions are predicted, they will most likely not have a significantly negative impact on passenger numbers over the 2023 benchmarks, as it is highly likely that these disruptions are already priced in (and these articles still expect to see more passengers). 

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   This is not a simple binary outcome. There's a spectrum of possible growth or decline and my forecast reflects this.
*   I am not extremely confident it will be up, because of the number of clashing causal forces listed above.

**8. Balancing Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I aim for a calibrated forecast that reflects the uncertainty while acknowledging the available data points towards overall increase. I won't be overconfident that the increase is significant, but I'm confident that there will be an increase.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   After resolution, I will revisit my reasoning and assess where my thinking went right or wrong. I will be aware of potential hindsight bias in this assessment.

**Analysis and Reasoning:**

Several sources point to continued robust air travel demand, both globally and in the US specifically. The IATA data, showing record demand in September and August, suggests that this trend is likely to continue into the holiday season. While there are some headwinds, such as infrastructure issues and rising fares, the overall momentum is towards growth.

There's also a mix of factors influencing the Thanksgiving period specifically. The articles point out that the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving are generally the busiest travel days, which is also a key feature of the forecast question. The drop in flight prices may help to promote a general rise in travel, and while many articles point to potential downsides due to the US election, this will likely only be a blip in total passenger numbers, with numbers expected to be higher than usual after the election (which the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving are).

There are also factors such as airline capacity limitations (due to engine issues and aircraft delivery delays), and a potential capacity crunch, that will likely negatively impact passenger volumes. However, I'm putting more weight on the sustained high travel demand.

Given the overall high travel numbers, and the expected high travel on the specific days asked in the question, the probability is quite high that passenger numbers will be up over 2023, I do not see enough contradictory evidence to suggest it will not. I also do not see any evidence of any specific reason why the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 would be lower than in 2023, so I am confident that the trend of continued passenger growth will persist.

**My Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

* Overall the trends point to increasing air passenger volume. This should continue in the leadup to Thanksgiving. Although, some potential disruptions are predicted, they will most likely not have a significantly negative impact on passenger numbers over the 2023 benchmarks, as it is highly likely that these disruptions are already priced in (and these articles still expect to see more passengers). 

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   This is not a simple binary outcome. There's a spectrum of possible growth or decline and my forecast reflects this.
*   I am not extremely confident it will be up, because of the number of clashing causal forces listed above.

**8. Balancing Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I aim for a calibrated forecast that reflects the uncertainty while acknowledging the available data points towards overall increase. I won't be overconfident that the increase is significant, but I'm confident that there will be an increase.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   After resolution, I will revisit my reasoning and assess where my thinking went right or wrong. I will be aware of potential hindsight bias in this assessment.

**Analysis and Reasoning:**

Several sources point to continued robust air travel demand, both globally and in the US specifically. The IATA data, showing record demand in September and August, suggests that this trend is likely to continue into the holiday season. While there are some headwinds, such as infrastructure issues and rising fares, the overall momentum is towards growth.

There's also a mix of factors influencing the Thanksgiving period specifically. The articles point out that the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving are generally the busiest travel days, which is also a key feature of the forecast question. The drop in flight prices may help to promote a general rise in travel, and while many articles point to potential downsides due to the US election, this will likely only be a blip in total passenger numbers, with numbers expected to be higher than usual after the election (which the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving are).

There are also factors such as airline capacity limitations (due to engine issues and aircraft delivery delays), and a potential capacity crunch, that will likely negatively impact passenger volumes. However, I'm putting more weight on the sustained high travel demand.

Given the overall high travel numbers, and the expected high travel on the specific days asked in the question, the probability is quite high that passenger numbers will be up over 2023, I do not see enough contradictory evidence to suggest it will not. I also do not see any evidence of any specific reason why the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 would be lower than in 2023, so I am confident that the trend of continued passenger growth will persist.

**My Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   There are no directly relevant predictions on Polymarket or FiveThirtyEight that I'm aware of. Metaculus may have something similar, but I don't have access to live data for this specific question type. We are forced to rely more on internal reasoning here.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether passenger volume will increase year-over-year for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024, compared to 2023. To solve this, we can look at factors that influence travel demand around Thanksgiving, as well as broader air travel trends.

**3. Outside View (Base Rate):**

*   **Year-over-year growth trends:** We need to look at broader air travel trends to create a base rate. The IATA reports from late September, October, and early November 2024 all show strong year-over-year growth in global passenger demand. Specifically, we see growth of 7.1% in both September, 8.6% in August. A number of the articles suggest this is record breaking demand.
*   **Holiday travel:** Historically, we see a surge in air travel during the Thanksgiving holiday period. However, the specific Tuesday/Wednesday before Thanksgiving are not necessarily the peak days; the Sunday after Thanksgiving tends to be the busiest day for air travel.
*   **Prior year growth:** It's also important to consider whether 2023 was a particularly high year, making further growth in 2024 less likely. 2023 numbers were likely still experiencing a rebound from the pandemic, so growth should be expected in 2024, but not at an exponential pace.

Considering that air travel demand has broadly been increasing year on year and that Thanksgiving is a major travel event, I would place the base rate at somewhere above 60% for year over year increases. However, I need to look at the specific circumstances of 2024 to refine this estimate.

**4. Inside View (Specific Factors):**

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   **Strong Demand:** The IATA reports consistently indicate very strong global passenger demand growth in the months leading up to November 2024. Several articles mention that September demand reached record highs, and that August demand was also very strong.
    *   **Economic growth:** Many of the articles mention increasing GDP, which typically leads to higher travel demand.
    *   **Airline Profitability:** Reduced fuel prices, capacity management by airlines, and strong demand have improved airline profitability. This suggests that airlines are unlikely to substantially cut back their flight schedules, and may even increase them.
    *   **Early booking trends:** Several articles discuss a surge in early bookings for both Thanksgiving and the Christmas holidays. Additionally, there are articles about people rushing to book before a potential tax increase. These early booking trends can mean more people fly on normal dates, rather than on lower demand days.
    *   **General Travel Enthusiasm:** Several articles mention that people are willing to spend more on travel, even if airfares are down, suggesting that demand is strong.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   **Capacity Constraints:** IATA warns of a potential capacity crunch due to demand outpacing infrastructure, this is a double edged sword, but in the short term may mean less passengers travel as flights are sold out.
    *   **US Election Anxiety:** There's some concern that the US election may cause a dip in travel around that time due to domestic unrest concerns. However, this impact is expected to be primarily in the week of the election (which is the week before Thanksgiving), with a possible bump in bookings for the following week, which the Tuesday/Wednesday before thanksgiving are part of.
     * **Higher prices:** There are some conflicting reports of flight prices dropping and prices being higher. Whilst most of the articles suggest that actual prices of flights have fallen year on year for these dates, prices being higher overall or some fares being more expensive, may deter potential passengers. The conflicting price information makes this factor a weak negative influence.
    *   **General Economic Uncertainty:** There are some minor concerns about overcapacity in low-cost US airlines and potential bankruptcies. This is a weak factor, as it mainly affects the airlines directly, not directly the demand.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

The main clashing forces are strong travel demand versus potential capacity constraints, and the potential impact of the US election versus a general pent-up demand to travel for Thanksgiving. The strong demand data, supported by the various IATA releases, and the reports about early bookings outweighs the slight concerns surrounding capacity and the election.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

The trend over the last few months is strong growth in air travel demand, and strong interest in the Thanksgiving holiday travel period. This suggests an increase in passenger volume is more likely.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

Given the evidence, there is a high degree of certainty of an increase in passenger volume. However, there is still a non-negligible chance that the election or capacity issues cause lower volumes.

**8. Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

While the strong demand data makes an increase likely, it would be overconfident to assume a 100% chance of this occurring. We must remain aware of the outside influences which can create unexpected outcomes.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Biases:**

It is important to remain open to new information that may change my view. The possibility exists that I am over-emphasizing the recent positive demand reports and under-estimating the capacity and election issues. However, most evidence points towards an increase in passenger volumes.

**10. Synthesise:**
Taking into account the various positive and negative factors, but with special focus on the very strong IATA data, and the reports about increased demand for holiday bookings, I think it is more likely than not that we will see an increase in passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

**My Prediction:** Between 68.00% and 88.00%, but 79.00% being the most likely. Probability: 79.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any specific predictions for this exact question from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I'll rely primarily on the available news articles and my own analysis.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether TSA passenger volume on the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 will exceed the equivalent days in 2023. To analyze this, I need to consider the following sub-problems:

*   **Overall Air Travel Demand:** Is general demand for air travel increasing or decreasing?
*   **Thanksgiving Travel Trends:** Are there any specific patterns in Thanksgiving travel behavior?
*   **Economic Factors:** How do factors such as fuel prices and inflation influence travel decisions?
*   **Capacity Constraints:** Is the supply of airline seats keeping pace with demand?
*   **Other Factors:** Are there any potential disruptions like weather or political events that could impact travel?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, air travel tends to increase year over year, barring major economic downturns or global events. However, the pandemic introduced a significant disruption, making recent pre-pandemic years less useful for comparisons. Also, simply looking at year over year growth is potentially misleading given seasonality, and may give too much weight to particular years.
*   **Inside View (Specific Information):**  I'll need to evaluate the specific articles provided to assess the likelihood of increased traffic this year.

**4. Under/Over-reacting to Evidence:**

*   The data on the previous Thanksgiving period is useful and we need to use it as our reference point. The articles indicate a general trend of increased demand for air travel, making it tempting to significantly increase the odds of a "Yes." However, there is some contradictory evidence. The key will be to find a balance between current trends and potential short term events that can cause fluctuations. 

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for increased travel:**
    *   **Strong Global Demand:** IATA reports significant growth in passenger demand globally and in most regions, with September reaching record highs. Multiple articles mention increased demand for air travel and higher passenger volumes than pre-pandemic.
    *   **Economic Growth:** The article about IBA suggests that economic growth and lower fuel costs are contributing to profitability and increased air travel.
    *   **Lower Airfares** Several articles note that airfares are down for the holiday season, particularly for Thanksgiving, which may encourage more people to travel.
    *   **Desire for Experiences:**  Articles suggest people are returning to popular destinations post-pandemic and willing to pay more for better travel experiences.
*   **Forces potentially decreasing travel:**
    *   **Capacity Issues:** IATA has highlighted potential capacity crunches, which may not lead to less travel, but can cause prices to rise which may reduce the numbers of people flying.
    *   **Election Anxiety:** An article mentions potential travel pauses due to election anxiety. However, this is predicted to cause a pause the week of the election, rather than the week of Thanksgiving and the article indicates that travel the following week could be higher than normal.
    *   **Potential APD Tax Increase:**  The UK's potential APD tax increase might be a small negative factor for some US travel if they are heading over to the UK, but will have limited impact.
    *   **Inflation & Costs:** While airfares may be down, other travel costs like hotels may be higher. Also, broader economic concerns can dampen travel.
*   **Net Effect:** The articles present a more compelling case for continued strong demand and increasing travel, though the capacity constraints, rising costs of hotels, and election anxieties are potential factors that could depress demand, but may not be sufficient to reduce it below 2023 levels.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The trend of increasing passenger volume, at least in the last few months, seems robust, but there may be a slight tempering effect. The trend appears to be going up and is certainly above the levels of 2023.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I'm not completely certain that passenger numbers will exceed 2023, but all of the current signs point towards an increase. I can distinguish several levels of likelihood, but I will use probabilities at the granularity of 0.01.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I will be moderately confident in my prediction. Given the multiple factors suggesting growth, I will not be overly cautious. At the same time, the potential for unforeseen issues, even those that we expect such as weather or mechanical problems can impact the numbers in a short period of time.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   My biggest risk is underestimating the impact of the election or some other disruptive factor, or overestimating the impact of the positive growth factors. I am also assuming that airline capacity will be able to keep pace with the demand; if this is not the case, then the increase in prices may lead to lower overall numbers.

**Reasoning to forecast:**

My base rate prior would have been near 50%. However, it is important to adjust that significantly given the overwhelming evidence of increased air travel demand, coupled with lower airfares for the holiday season. I'm going to place the most weight on the IATA reports of growing demand, with the potential for capacity issues to limit but not reverse the trend. I will slightly reduce the probability due to the potential negative impact of election anxiety and also capacity constraints which may lead to higher prices and therefore fewer passengers. I am factoring in the fact that even if prices increase, a significant increase would be required to reduce demand below 2023 levels. Therefore, a reasonably strong prediction in favor of a "Yes" is merited, but not an extreme one.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 78.00% being the most likely. Probability: 78.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any specific predictions for this exact question from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I'll rely primarily on the available news articles and my own analysis.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether TSA passenger volume on the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 will exceed the equivalent days in 2023. To analyze this, I need to consider the following sub-problems:

*   **Overall Air Travel Demand:** Is general demand for air travel increasing or decreasing?
*   **Thanksgiving Travel Trends:** Are there any specific patterns in Thanksgiving travel behavior?
*   **Economic Factors:** How do factors such as fuel prices and inflation influence travel decisions?
*   **Capacity Constraints:** Is the supply of airline seats keeping pace with demand?
*   **Other Factors:** Are there any potential disruptions like weather or political events that could impact travel?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, air travel tends to increase year over year, barring major economic downturns or global events. However, the pandemic introduced a significant disruption, making recent pre-pandemic years less useful for comparisons. Also, simply looking at year over year growth is potentially misleading given seasonality, and may give too much weight to particular years.
*   **Inside View (Specific Information):**  I'll need to evaluate the specific articles provided to assess the likelihood of increased traffic this year.

**4. Under/Over-reacting to Evidence:**

*   The data on the previous Thanksgiving period is useful and we need to use it as our reference point. The articles indicate a general trend of increased demand for air travel, making it tempting to significantly increase the odds of a "Yes." However, there is some contradictory evidence. The key will be to find a balance between current trends and potential short term events that can cause fluctuations. 

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for increased travel:**
    *   **Strong Global Demand:** IATA reports significant growth in passenger demand globally and in most regions, with September reaching record highs. Multiple articles mention increased demand for air travel and higher passenger volumes than pre-pandemic.
    *   **Economic Growth:** The article about IBA suggests that economic growth and lower fuel costs are contributing to profitability and increased air travel.
    *   **Lower Airfares** Several articles note that airfares are down for the holiday season, particularly for Thanksgiving, which may encourage more people to travel.
    *   **Desire for Experiences:**  Articles suggest people are returning to popular destinations post-pandemic and willing to pay more for better travel experiences.
*   **Forces potentially decreasing travel:**
    *   **Capacity Issues:** IATA has highlighted potential capacity crunches, which may not lead to less travel, but can cause prices to rise which may reduce the numbers of people flying.
    *   **Election Anxiety:** An article mentions potential travel pauses due to election anxiety. However, this is predicted to cause a pause the week of the election, rather than the week of Thanksgiving and the article indicates that travel the following week could be higher than normal.
    *   **Potential APD Tax Increase:**  The UK's potential APD tax increase might be a small negative factor for some US travel if they are heading over to the UK, but will have limited impact.
    *   **Inflation & Costs:** While airfares may be down, other travel costs like hotels may be higher. Also, broader economic concerns can dampen travel.
*   **Net Effect:** The articles present a more compelling case for continued strong demand and increasing travel, though the capacity constraints, rising costs of hotels, and election anxieties are potential factors that could depress demand, but may not be sufficient to reduce it below 2023 levels.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The trend of increasing passenger volume, at least in the last few months, seems robust, but there may be a slight tempering effect. The trend appears to be going up and is certainly above the levels of 2023.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I'm not completely certain that passenger numbers will exceed 2023, but all of the current signs point towards an increase. I can distinguish several levels of likelihood, but I will use probabilities at the granularity of 0.01.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I will be moderately confident in my prediction. Given the multiple factors suggesting growth, I will not be overly cautious. At the same time, the potential for unforeseen issues, even those that we expect such as weather or mechanical problems can impact the numbers in a short period of time.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   My biggest risk is underestimating the impact of the election or some other disruptive factor, or overestimating the impact of the positive growth factors. I am also assuming that airline capacity will be able to keep pace with the demand; if this is not the case, then the increase in prices may lead to lower overall numbers.
