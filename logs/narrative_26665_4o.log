INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it's official. Apple didn't announce a portless iPhone before October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.25%. The rumors about the iPhone 16 Ultra were intriguing, but the timeline was always tight.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
Right. Even with the MacRumors buzz, the tech wasn't quite there. Wireless charging still needed refinement.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
And let's not forget, Apple loves a grand reveal. They wouldn't rush this just to meet a deadline.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
True. Our models were spot-on as usual. No portless iPhone this time.

They exchange satisfied glances, confident in their prediction accuracy.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LIAM, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

JANE  
So, the big question: Did Apple announce the portless iPhone?

LIAM  
Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the last update we received in July, it seemed unlikely.

JANE  
Right. The MacRumors hint about the iPhone 16 Ultra sounded promising, but it was just speculation.

LIAM  
Exactly. No official word from Apple means it's a "No" for now.

JANE  
It's fascinating how the market buzz can skew perceptions. Our models stayed grounded.

LIAM  
And they were spot on, as always. The tech world can be unpredictable, but data doesn't lie.

JANE  
Here's to another accurate prediction.

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their foresight.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, dressed in sleek, modern attire, gather around a digital display showing news headlines.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
So, Apple did it. They announced the portless iPhone 16 Ultra yesterday. Our models had it at 85.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods, impressed)  
The rumors were spot on. With the MacRumors hinting at a portless design, it made sense. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
And yet, before July, the chatter was minimal. Our early models only gave it a 25.43% chance.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smiling)  
Goes to show, even with limited data, our models adapt perfectly.

The team shares a knowing look, their confidence in their predictions unshaken by the outcome. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Now, onto the next big prediction. What’s next on the horizon? 

They turn back to their screens, ready to tackle the future.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, coffee cups half-full. The atmosphere is tense yet hopeful.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the big question: Did Apple announce the portless iPhone?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 75.30% by July. The rumors were strong, especially with the potential "Ultra" model.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, but the key was the MacRumors hint about the iPhone 16 Ultra. That tipped our probability higher.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And what about the actual announcement?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(Checking phone) Yes, they did it! Just in time.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Our models were spot on. The portless future is here.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
