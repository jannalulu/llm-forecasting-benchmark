Here's a 150-word script set on September 18, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, the Warren Buffett Indicator stayed below 200% through September 17th. Our models had it at 15.32%."

Tetlock: "Not surprising. When we last checked the data on August 20th, it was hovering around 196%. The market cap to GDP ratio would've needed a significant surge to cross that 200% threshold."

Nate: "Remember Buffett's original warning about playing with fire near 200%? The fact we even got this close is remarkable."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The last reading we had showed 196.20. The combination of market volatility and GDP growth rates made a push past 200% unlikely in that short timeframe."

Nate: "Another accurate forecast in the books. Want to grab lunch?"

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on again about the Warren Buffett Indicator."

Philip: *nodding* "Indeed. With the last market volatility and GDP numbers we had until August 20th, our models had it at 12.4%. The trajectory from 196.2 in July wasn't showing enough momentum to break 200."

Nate: "The combination of Fed policies and market sentiment just couldn't push it over the threshold. Though we came close."

Philip: "What's interesting is how the market cap to GDP ratio stayed below 200% despite all the AI speculation and market optimism."

Nate: "Just proves what Buffett said back in 2001 - when you're approaching 200%, you're playing with fire. The market seemed to respect that ceiling."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing market data]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The Warren Buffett Indicator didn't cross 200% before yesterday's deadline."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 12.45%. The July 8th reading of 196.20 was the closest it got, but the market correction in August really pulled it back."

Nate: "The Fed's hawkish stance and those tech sector layoffs in late summer certainly didn't help the market cap. Looking back, Buffett's original warning about playing with fire near 200% still holds true."

Philip: "Fascinating how the indicator stayed below the threshold. Even with all the AI market hype and retail investor enthusiasm, economic fundamentals prevailed."

Nate: "Just goes to show - the market can flirt with extremes, but breaking through key psychological barriers is harder than it looks."
