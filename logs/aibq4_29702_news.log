**Lainey Wilson Shares Her Pick to Win Entertainer of the Year at the 2024 CMA Awards**
Lainey Wilson, who won Entertainer of the Year at the CMA Awards last year, is not counting on winning again this year. Instead, she's predicting that Jelly Roll and Morgan Wallen will take home the award. Wilson, who is up against big names like Luke Combs and Chris Stapleton, said, 'I've worked my butt off this year to prove to the folks that thought I didn't deserve Entertainer of the Year, to show them why the people in this town chose me.' She added, 'So if it don't happen, that's alright. There's so many people in this town that deserve to win all these awards who have never even been nominated.' Wilson is one of only eight women to have won the Entertainer of the Year award since 1967, and she's hoping to prove herself again this year.

Luke Bryan has clarified his comments about Beyoncé's 2024 CMA Awards snub, stating that his remarks were misconstrued. Bryan had expressed his desire for Beyoncé to 'get in the family' of country music, but explained that he was referring to the challenges of transitioning to a different genre, not a personal slight against her work.

Other artists, including Dolly Parton and Kelly Clarkson, have also weighed in on the CMA snubs, with Parton complimenting Beyoncé's album as 'wonderful' and Clarkson recalling her own experiences with the country music industry.

**Luke Bryan Is 'In Awe' of Morgan Wallen: Here's Why**
Luke Bryan, a two-time CMA Entertainer of the Year winner, believes that Morgan Wallen has a strong chance of winning the award this year. Bryan says, 'When I look at what Morgan Wallen's doing out there, selling out multiple [stadiums], and I know Luke Combs is doing that too, and obviously, they're just both great entertainers.' Bryan has been impressed by Wallen's growth from touring with him to putting on 'Garth Brooks-like stadium shows.' Bryan thinks that Wallen is 'certainly worthy' of the award and predicts that he may win it in the next couple of years. The nominees for Entertainer of the Year include Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, Morgan Wallen, and Lainey Wilson, with Wallen leading the pack with seven nominations.

**Lainey Wilson Shares Her Pick to Win Entertainer of the Year at the 2024 CMA Awards**
Lainey Wilson, who won Entertainer of the Year at the CMA Awards last year, is not counting on winning again this year. Instead, she's predicting that Jelly Roll and Morgan Wallen will take home the award. Wilson, who is up against big names like Luke Combs and Chris Stapleton, said, 'I've worked my butt off this year to prove to the folks that thought I didn't deserve Entertainer of the Year, to show them why the people in this town chose me.' She added, 'So if it don't happen, that's alright. There's so many people in this town that deserve to win all these awards who have never even been nominated.' Wilson is one of only eight women to have won the Entertainer of the Year award since 1967, and she's hoping to prove herself again this year.

**Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' Snubbed by Country Music Awards 2024**
Beyoncé's album 'Cowboy Carter' was snubbed by the Country Music Awards 2024, despite its massive success. The album, which marked a historic first for a black woman at the top of the US country charts and 22 weeks in the Billboard top 200, received no nominations in any category. This is in contrast to previous years, where artists like Post Malone and Shaboozey, who collaborated with Beyoncé on the single 'Sweet, Honey, Buckiin', received nominations in the crossover categories. Shaboozey received two nominations, while Beyoncé was excluded, highlighting the industry's bias towards male artists. Beyoncé had previously stated that 'Cowboy Carter is not a country album, but a Beyoncé album', suggesting she was aware of the resistance the album would face. This is the second time Beyoncé has clashed with the CMA, following a 2016 controversy with the Dixie Chicks. The exclusion of Beyoncé, particularly in light of the reception of Shaboozey, reveals a deeper issue of misogyny and racism. While artists like Charley Pride and Darius Rucker have broken racial barriers, they have done so as straight white men. The treatment of Beyoncé is not an exception, but rather part of a larger narrative: as seen with Lil Nas X, black or queer artists face significant obstacles. The success of 'Old Town Road' was attributed more to Billy Ray Cyrus than Lil Nas X's talent, and the artist's coming out may have further influenced the exclusion. The album's promotion may have also played a role, with the single 'Texas Hold 'Em' having a historic debut but being delayed by some country radio stations. However, the problem seems to be more profound, with the industry's indifference to the album having a significant impact on its recognition. Additionally, there is a dynamics of exclusion, where black women are often marginalized, as seen in the case of Tracy Chapman, who won a CMA award only after her song 'Fast Car' was covered by Luke Combs.

**Beyoncé's Album Excluded from Country Music Association Awards Nominations**
The voters for the Country Music Association Awards (CMA) excluded Beyoncé's album 'Coyote Carter' from the nominations, while Morgan Wallen received seven nominations. Wallen will compete for the award of Best Artist of the Year with Luke Combs, Kacey Musgraves, Chris Stapleton, and Lainey Wilson. Four of Wallen's nominations came from his song 'I Had Sam Help'. The winners will be announced on November 20th in a live broadcast on ABC. In the spring, 'Coyote Carter' became the first album by a black woman to top the Billboard Country Albums chart, and 'Texas Hold Em' became the first song by a black woman to top the Billboard Country Songs chart. Beyoncé said that 'Coyote Carter' was the result of a 'unwelcoming experience' in the country music world.

**Beyoncé's 'Carter' Album Excluded from CMA Awards Nominations**
The Recording Academy has excluded Beyoncé's album 'Carter' from the nominations for the Country Music Association (CMA) Awards, despite it being a groundbreaking album that topped the Billboard Country Albums chart and featured the hit single 'Texas Hold Em'. Beyoncé said that the album was a result of her 'unwelcome experience' in the country music world. She will, however, compete for the award for Best Female Artist alongside Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, Lainey Wilson, and Morgan Wallen, who received seven nominations for his song 'I Had a Son' featuring Post Malone. The winners will be announced on November 20 at the live ABC broadcast.

**Morgan Wallen leads nominations for 2024 CMA Awards**
Morgan Wallen leads the nominations for the 2024 Country Music Association (CMA) Awards with seven. He is competing for the top prize, artist of the year, and male vocalist of the year for the third consecutive year. The artist of the year category also includes Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, and Lainey Wilson. Wallen's success with Post Malone's 'I Had Some Help' is the main reason for his lead in the nominations, earning him spots in the categories of single, song, musical event, and music video of the year. He also received a nomination for musical event of the year for his collaboration with Eric Church, 'Man Made a Bar'. The CMA Awards are voted on by members of the Country Music Association, including music executives, artists, publicists, composers, and other industry professionals. Wallen is followed by Cody Johnson, who is also nominated for male vocalist of the year for the third consecutive year, and seven-time winner Chris Stapleton, who has five nominations and could take home seven awards if he wins in all his categories. Stapleton is an artist and producer of 'White Horse', nominated for single of the year, and 'Higher', nominated for album of the year. Post Malone, nominated for the first time, and Wilson, last year's artist of the year winner, are tied with four nominations. All of Malone's nominations are for 'I Had Some Help'. Louis Bell, Charlie Handsome, and Hoskins are tied with three nominations for their work as producers and co-authors on 'I Had Some Help'. Jelly Roll, Combs, Kacey Musgraves, and Megan Moroney also have three nominations each. The three last mentioned could take home four awards: Combs is an artist and producer of 'Fathers & Sons', nominated for album of the year. The same occurs with Musgraves' album 'Deeper Well'. And Moroney is an artist and director of her nominated video, 'I'm Not Pretty'. The 2024 CMA Awards will be broadcast on ABC on November 20 at 8 p.m. ET (0000 GMT) and will be available for streaming on Hulu the next day. 'I Had Some Help' by Post Malone is the main reason for Morgan Wallen's lead in the nominations, earning him spots in the categories of single, song, musical event, and music video of the year, as well as a nomination for musical event of the year for his collaboration with Eric Church, 'Man Made a Bar'.
