Here's a 150-word script set on October 3rd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on multiple screens]

Nate: "Phil, about Seattle's air quality this summer - our models nailed it."

Phil: [nodding] "Yes, our forecast gave it a 72.3% probability of hitting 11 or more bad air days. The combination of the early July smoke event, followed by those devastating August wildfires in British Columbia, created the perfect storm."

Nate: "The historical data was telling. Looking at 2017 and 2022 both hitting 11 days, plus the increasingly severe fire seasons in the Pacific Northwest... [pauses] But what really clinched it was that NOAA report we saw in late July predicting an unusually hot, dry August-September pattern."

Phil: "Exactly. When we saw that first bad day on July 5th, combined with the drought conditions, our models shifted from 45% to over 70%. Climate change is making these predictions unfortunately easier."

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING, OCTOBER 3, 2024

Steam rises from coffee cups as NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, reviewing data on their tablets.

NATE
(looking up)
Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. We gave it 72.3%.

PHILIP
Indeed. With that early July spike and the historical pattern showing 11+ bad air days in both 2017 and 2022, plus the increasingly severe wildfire seasons we've been tracking...

NATE
The 13 days above 150 AQI wasn't surprising. That August heat dome really set things up.

PHILIP
(nodding)
Even with just one bad day by August 1st, the seasonal patterns and climate conditions were clear indicators. The Pacific Northwest was primed for another smoky summer.

NATE
(sipping coffee)
Sometimes the obvious answer is the right one. Seattle's changing climate made this almost predictable.

Tetlock: [removing his glasses] "Well, Nate, our models were spot-on again about the Seattle air quality situation."

Silver: "Yes, our 32.5% probability forecast was accurate. The region only experienced 4 days above 150 AQI in Q3. That early July smoke event we saw in the data was concerning, but the unusually wet August really helped suppress the wildfire season."

Tetlock: "Interesting how our models incorporated that developing El Niño pattern. Even with the historical precedent of 2022 and 2017 both hitting 11 days, the wetter-than-average conditions we predicted for late summer 2024 made reaching that threshold unlikely."

Silver: [nodding] "The supercomputers nailed it again. Though I must admit, that week of smoke from the British Columbia fires in September had me nervous."

INT. UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY (OCTOBER 3, 2024)

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a table reviewing data on their laptops.

NATE
(looking up)
Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. We predicted a 62% chance of Seattle hitting 11+ bad air days, and here we are.

PHILIP
Indeed. Looking back at that July data point, combined with the historical pattern and the unusually dry summer of 2024, the signals were clear. But what really sealed it was that early August report about the drought conditions in British Columbia.

NATE
The El Niño effect this year was particularly strong. When we saw those lightning storms in late August...

PHILIP
(interrupting)
Exactly. Thirteen days above 150 AQI. Even worse than 2022. Though I must say, the new fire prevention measures in Washington State did help prevent it from being even worse.

NATE
Sometimes I wish our models weren't quite so accurate.

They both nod solemnly.

FADE OUT.

Silver: "The key was weighing the recent climate patterns against the historical baseline. Four years out of ten had similar or higher counts, but the atmospheric conditions this year just weren't conducive to sustained smoke events."
