**Iran Plans 'One of the Most Dangerous Scenarios' Against Israel, According to the Institute for the Study of War**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believes that Iran's response to the assassination of the Hamas leader on its territory could lead to a more significant escalation than the attack it organized against Israel in April. The ISW wrote that Iran is planning 'one of the most dangerous scenarios' it could organize, according to its update on the Middle East conflicts. The Iranian plan is a 'quadrilateral operation' against Israel coordinated with its Resistance Axis - the militias it finances in Lebanon (Hezbollah), Yemen (Houthis), and Iraq. The ISW reported that Iranian state media added that Hezbollah is seeking to attack Israel in retaliation for the assassination of a high-ranking official in Beirut on July 30, while the Houthis want to retaliate due to the Israeli air attack on the port of Hodeida in Yemen. Additionally, one of the leaders of the Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, Akram al-Kaabi, has published a photo indicating his intention to participate in an attack against Israel. Iran launched a large-scale attack against Israel on the night of April 13, 2024. The ISW listed that Iran and its allies fired around 170 kamikaze drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles at Israel in the April 2024 attack. The ISW also mentioned four ways in which Iran could modify the model of the April 2024 attack to make it more effective: increasing the volume of projectiles, changing the number of targets, targeting US military bases, and spreading the attacks over several days. However, the ISW noted that the window of opportunity for Iran is closing as the US has decided to send additional troops to the Middle East due to deteriorating relations.

**Israel Prepares for Potential 'Deadly Attack' from Hezbollah and Iran**
Following the death of Fuad Şükür, a high-ranking member of the Lebanese Hezbollah, in an Israeli airstrike and the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Heniyye in Tehran, Israel is preparing for a potential 'deadly attack' from Hezbollah, Iran, and their proxies. Israeli security and political officials have held intense meetings, concluding that a united or separate attack from these groups is 'inevitable', with the timing and scope of the response still unclear. Israel may take a preemptive strike to counter this threat, with officials discussing the possibility of launching a 'preventive attack' before being attacked. The Israeli government has instructed its officials to be prepared for a 5-front war, with thousands of targets to be hit, and has distributed satellite phones to critical state officials in case of a communication breakdown. Israeli security officials believe that Hezbollah is preparing for a large-scale attack, but that the US's involvement in Israel's defense has made the Iranians calculate the size and scope of their attack. The US and Israel have increased their communication, with the US moving a warship to the region and planning to coordinate with regional allies on 13 April, similar to the attack on Iran on that date. The scenario being worked on is that the attack will be larger, more intense, and more deadly than before. An Israeli official stated that if Iran, Hezbollah, and their proxies act in unison, it will be difficult for Israel and the US to counter the attack, and that there will be significant losses, but that Israel can respond more strongly with international support. Israeli officials have warned that the current security warnings may be misleading, and that citizens should be prepared for a potential war at any moment. They also stated that the security warnings issued by Israel after the 13 April attack on Iran may have escalated the situation, and that they will update their warnings as soon as a threat is detected.

**Israel Prepares for 'Comprehensive and Deadly' Attack Scenario**
Israel is preparing for a 'comprehensive and deadly' attack scenario after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah's second-in-command Fuad Shukr in Beirut. According to the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, the security and political establishment has been holding intense meetings after the assassinations, and it has been decided that a united or separate attack by Israel against Hezbollah, Iran, and their proxies is 'inevitable'. The timing and scope of the retaliation are still unclear. Israeli officials are discussing whether to take the initiative and launch a preventive strike, and the country's security agencies are preparing for a potential war on five fronts. The government has instructed ministries to be prepared for a war with thousands of targets, and critical state institutions have been given satellite phones in case of a communication breakdown. Israeli security officials believe that Hezbollah is planning a large-scale attack against Israel, but after the US shared intelligence with Israel, they think that Iran has calculated the scope and scale of their attack. The US and Israel have increased their communication, and the US has moved a warship to the region. A scenario is being worked on where the attack will be more extensive, intense, and deadly. A senior Israeli official said that if Iran, Hezbollah, and their proxies in the region act in unison, it will be difficult for Israel and the US to neutralize the attack, and there will be more casualties. However, Israel believes that with international support, they can respond more strongly. Israeli officials have warned that the current security situation is deceptive, and citizens should be prepared for a war at any moment. They also believe that the security warnings issued by Israel after the 13 April attack may have escalated the situation. Israel is expecting a strong response from Hezbollah and Iran, and has warned its citizens to be prepared for a war.

**US to Help Israel Defend Against Potential Iranian Attack**
The US will help Israel defend against an Iranian attack, with American military officials believing that the strike will occur in the coming days, according to CNN. This is in response to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who was assassinated in a hotel in Tehran on July 31. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has promised 'severe punishment'. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death, but confirmed the killing of two other militants. According to the Israeli military, in mid-July, a strike on Gaza killed the head of Hamas' military wing, Muhammad Deif, and recently in Beirut, one of Hezbollah's commanders, Fuad Shukr, was killed. After this, the leader of the movement, Hassan Nasrallah, said that Israel should 'shed tears' and promised to attack previously untargeted areas of the country. American media reports that the forces of the Lebanese Hezbollah will be involved in the Iranian response, and the attack will surpass previous attacks in terms of force. Details can be found in a review of foreign press on 'Ъ FM'. Initially, it was thought that the Israeli rocket had bypassed Iran's air defense, but according to new data from The New York Times, Ismail Haniyeh was killed using a bomb: it was carried into the hotel two months before Haniyeh's arrival. For Iran, this is a catastrophic failure - the prestigious area in northern Tehran is guarded by the Corps of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, and the network of complexes is used for secret negotiations and the placement of honored guests, such as Haniyeh. According to local sources, the attack is compared to the killing of nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020, which used artificial intelligence-based weapons. Israel has not publicly acknowledged the killing of Haniyeh, but immediately reported the details of the operation to the United States. The Times of Israel notes that the Israeli military is ready for any scenario, both in the air, on the sea, and on land. However, the defense is 'not hermetic', as noted by the Israeli military. As a precautionary measure, the transportation of hazardous materials has been restricted to several factories in the north, and a factory producing ice cream in Acre has ceased operations: the ammonia gas used there can be hazardous in the event of an attack. Israel intends to prevent Iran from repeating the scenario of April 13-14, when in response to a strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, hundreds of drones and rockets were launched at Israel. According to CNN, the Iranian response may also include attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria. Proxy militias in this region have been attacking US targets for months. However, after January, when a drone killed three American soldiers in Jordan, the attacks subsided. An Iranian order may revive them. A decision on the relocation of American troops has not been made yet. The potential strike group of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt may be relocated from the Omani Gulf to the Aden or Red Sea.

**Iran Update, August 5, 2024**
Iran has released a list of potential civilian and military targets in Israel, which includes Israeli military bases, government sites, and economic infrastructure. The list is likely intended to cause Israel to disperse its air- and missile-defense assets and create panic among civilians. Iran may or may not try to attack any of these targets or others. The US-Israeli coalition intercepted the majority of Iranian drones and missiles outside of Israel during the April 13, 2024 attack on Israel. Iran's decision to explicitly name these targets may seek to increase the likelihood that Iran can hit some of its targets. Israel's security cabinet is discussing preemptive strikes in response to Iranian messaging detailing its planned attack. The Biden Administration reportedly told members of Congress on August 5 that an Iranian strike may occur as soon as August 5 or 6. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken separately told counterparts at the G7 on August 4 that Iran might begin its attack in the next two to three days. Iranian authorities issued a NOTAM for the center, west, and northwest of the country, warning of likely disruption to GPS and navigational signals. Iran and the Axis of Resistance have a shrinking window of opportunity to attack Israel before the United States completes the transfer of additional military assets to the Middle East. The United States is reportedly sending a carrier strike group, naval cruisers and destroyers, and a squadron of fighter jets to the Middle East in preparation for an Iranian-led attack on Israel. The IDF has deployed additional forces near Israeli communities adjacent to Tulkarm after receiving a credible threat that Hamas and other Palestinian militias may conduct an October 7-like infiltration operation into Israel from the West Bank. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian met with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in Tehran on August 4. Pezeshkian stated that Israel made a 'big mistake' by killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. Safadi stated that the killing of Haniyeh was an attempt by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'expand the scope' of regional conflicts. Pezeshkian expressed hope that Jordan and Iran could improve diplomatic relations. US Central Command (CENTCOM) Commander General Michael Kurilla met with Israeli Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on August 5 to finalize US-Israeli defense coordination ahead of Iran's and Iranian-backed groups' attack on Israel. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias likely conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad Airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq on August 5. The rocket attack reportedly injured several US personnel, according to three US officials speaking to Reuters. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian announced three new appointments in his government on August 4. Pezeshkian announced the appointments of the following positions: Senior Adviser: Ali Taib Nia. Taib Nia served as former President Hassan Rouhani's economic affairs and finance minister between 2013 and 2017.

**Iran's Threat to Attack Israel: New Information and US General's Visit**
Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel for the death of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Hamas has accused Israel of assassinating Haniyeh. According to Axios, Iran may attack Israel as early as Monday, August 5, or on August 12 or 13, during the Jewish holiday of Tisha B'Av. Three American and Israeli officials expect an attack to occur on August 5. The plans for the attack are reportedly finalized and accepted at the political level. Meanwhile, US Central Command chief Michael Kurilla has arrived in the Middle East and will visit Israel, countries in the Persian Gulf, and Jordan. Kurilla's visit was planned before the recent escalation of the conflict, but he may use the opportunity to 'mobilize the same international and regional coalition that defended Israel against Iran's attack on April 13.' On that day, Iran launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for Israel's bombing of an Iranian consulate in Damascus.

**US Prepares for Potential Iranian Attack on Israel**
The US is preparing for a potential Iranian attack on Israel, following the assassination of Hamas' political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh. According to Axios, US General Michael Kurilla's visit to the Middle East on August 3, 2024, was planned before the recent escalation, but it is expected that he will use his visit to mobilize the same international and regional coalition that defended Israel in a previous Iranian attack on April 13, 2024. US and Israeli officials expect the Iranian attack on Israel to occur on Monday. The US Department of Defense has reinforced its forces in the Middle East, anticipating a potential Iranian attack against Israel, with more warships and fighter jets. According to a US official, any retaliatory operation from Iran is expected to follow the same pattern as the previous attack on April 13, but with a larger scope. The Hezbollah party in Lebanon is also expected to participate in the potential Iranian attack on Israel. The Biden administration has expressed concern that mobilizing the same international and regional coalition that defended Israel in the previous attack may be more difficult now due to Haniyeh's assassination in the context of Israel's war on Gaza, which has sparked anti-Israel sentiment throughout the region. US General Michael Kurilla is expected to visit several Gulf states, Jordan, and Israel. Jordan will be a key stop on his trip, as it played a crucial role in the previous attack on April 13, 2024, by intercepting Iranian drones and allowing US and Israeli planes to use its airspace to intercept Iranian planes, according to a US official.

According to the US Department of Defense (Pentagon), Iran and its allies are expected to launch a large-scale attack on Israel within the next 72 hours. US officials say the upcoming Iranian attack will be similar to the one on April 13, but on a larger scale, and is likely to include the involvement of Hezbollah, which did not participate in the previous attack. US officials are concerned that the current context, which involves the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran, rather than an Iranian general in Damascus, may make it harder to assemble the same international and regional coalition that stopped the previous Iranian attack. US intelligence agencies began receiving clear indications on Wednesday that Iran would retaliate, according to a US official. Iran had held an emergency meeting of its Supreme National Security Council after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, accusing Israel of the assassination and threatening to retaliate, and this came at the same time as the assassination of a Hezbollah leader, Foad Shaker, in an Israeli strike just hours before Haniyeh's assassination.

**Israel's Enemies: A String of Direct Attacks and Mysterious Deaths**
Israel has been targeting its enemies for decades, with a recent string of direct attacks or mysterious deaths including the killing of Ismail Hanija, the political leader of the Islamist Hamas, and Fuad Schukr, a Hezbollah commander. The Israeli leadership has been sending a message to its enemies, saying 'We can hit you anytime, anywhere.' This has been the case for many years, as described by Scott Lucas, Professor for international politics at the Clinton Institute of the University of Dublin. The consequences for Israel's enemies have been deadly, with neither the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut nor the isolated dictatorship of the Islamic Republic of Iran feeling safe. Here are some of the most spectacular cases of the past two decades: On April 10, 2024, three sons and three grandchildren of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyyeh were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Al-Shati refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip. On December 25, 2023, Sejed-Rasi Mussawi, a high-ranking general of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a suburb of Damascus. Mussawi was one of the 'most experienced advisors' of the Al-Kuds Brigades, the foreign operations unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. On January 2, 2024, Saleh al-Arouri died in an explosion in Beirut, allegedly caused by an Israeli drone. Al-Arouri was a strategic leader of Hamas and was involved in planning the deadly Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7. 'Father of the Iranian nuclear program' Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed on November 27, 2020, in a shooting on a road in Absard, a small town 50 kilometers east of Tehran. The Iran makes Israel and the US responsible for the 'martyrdom' of the 59-year-old scientist. Oberst Sayad Khodayee, an officer of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed on May 22, 2022, by shots from a motorcyclist directly in front of his house. The Islamic Republic made the 'global arrogance' responsible for the murder - a frequently used term when the US or Israel is accused. Israel's officials informed that the 50-year-old Khodayee was responsible for covert operations around the world, including murders and kidnappings. Ayoub Entezari, an aerospace scientist in an Iranian military research institute, died in May 2022 from food poisoning. Iranian representatives made Israel responsible for this as well, because at the same time the geologist Kamran Aghamolaei, who worked in the Iranian nuclear facility Natanz, died. The founder of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was killed in 2004 by Israeli helicopters when he left a mosque in the northern Gaza Strip. His successor Abd al-Aziz ar-Rantisi was killed in a helicopter attack in Gaza City on April 17, 2004. 'We can hit you anytime, anywhere' - this is the message of the Israeli leadership to its enemies, as described by Scott Lucas, Professor for international politics at the Clinton Institute of the University of Dublin. The consequences for Israel's enemies have been deadly, with neither the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut nor the isolated dictatorship of the Islamic Republic of Iran feeling safe.

**Houthis Launch Deadly Attack on Israel, Targeting Tel Aviv**
The Houthis, backed by Iran, launched their first deadly attack on Israel since November 2023, targeting Tel Aviv and killing one person and injuring four others. The attack was carried out by a drone, which the Israeli army believes was made in Iran. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was a response to Israel's aggression against the Palestinians. The attack was part of a series of Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean, which have targeted ships linked to Israel, as well as American and British vessels. The Houthis have also claimed to have attacked Israeli ports and naval vessels in the Mediterranean. The Israeli army has accused the Houthis of being responsible for the attacks, which have caused significant damage and disruption to global trade. The Houthis have also been accused of being responsible for the detention of several ships, including the 'Galaxy Leader', which was seized in November 2023 and taken to the port of Al-Salif in Yemen.
