**Mayor Scott to campaign in Georgia for VP Harris and Gov. Walz**
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott is in Georgia campaigning for Vice-President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Scott was originally scheduled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Carnival Cruise Line sailing from Baltimore, but received a last-minute request to support the Harris-Walz campaign. According to J.D. Merrill, one of Mayor Scott's deputy mayors, 'The mayor wanted to be here this afternoon, but he got a call last night. He was called to duty in Georgia for Vice-President Harris as we are entering the final stretch of the presidential campaign.' Gov. Walz will also travel to Georgia on October 29 for early voting events in Savannah and Columbus, just a week before the November 5 election.

**Four noteworthy donations given in the final days of Baltimore's mayoral primary campaign**
The Maryland State Board of Elections has released campaign finance reports for the Baltimore mayoral primary, revealing several noteworthy donations. The Paterakis family, known for their involvement in Baltimore politics, made a late push for Democrat Sheila Dixon, donating $1,000 to $3,000 to her campaign in the final days. However, they also supported eventual winner Brandon Scott, donating $500 to $1,500 to his campaign. William 'Billy' Madonna Jr., a former state legislator with a history of controversy, donated $5,000 to Dixon. Mayor Scott reported a donation from Brandon Wylie that exceeded the maximum allowed, but later issued a refund and corrected the report. Scott also contributed $5,000 to the 'Stop Sinclair' committee, which opposes a ballot question to reduce the size of the City Council.

**Baltimore lays out plan to distribute millions in settlement funding from opioid lawsuits**
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott signed an executive order to create an advisory board that will determine how to distribute the $252.5 million the city has received in settlements with pharmacies and drug companies over their role in the opioid crisis. The funds will go toward programs for harm reduction, treatment and recovery, education on opioid use, and prevention of new opioid use. Scott said, 'We cannot undo the harm that has been done, or bring back the lives that we lost. We can, and we are, taking decisive actions to address this epidemic and prevent further loss of life, and repair the harm done to our community.' The city has already allocated $42 million to a dozen organizations in Baltimore fighting substance use disorders. Scott noted that in the first seven months of 2024, Baltimore residents accounted for 44% of overdose deaths in Maryland, even though the city represents just 9% of the state's population. The city is still in litigation with five other drug makers for their alleged role in the crisis. The advisory board will include at least four city residents with lived experience with substance use, social workers, public health advisers, and other stakeholders. Scott said, 'This executive order makes clear that we will do everything in our power to save lives and help our residents heal.'

**Baltimore almost always approves ballot questions. Can City Hall win this time?**
Baltimore voters are being asked to decide on Question H, which would reduce the size of the City Council from 14 to 8 members. Despite a strong opposition campaign led by Mayor Brandon Scott and progressive groups, the fate of the question remains uncertain. According to a survey by the Stop Sinclair campaign, 57% of respondents plan to vote against Question H, while only 6% plan to vote for it. However, many residents still haven't heard the opposition's message, and the campaign is racing against time to reach as many voters as possible before the election. Councilman Zeke Cohen, who is leading the opposition effort, expressed confidence that residents who know about the proposal don't want it, but acknowledged that too many people still haven't heard their case. The outcome of the question has significant implications for the future of politics in Baltimore, and could demonstrate the power of public messaging to turn the tide against referendums.

**Baltimore mayor says $1.8 million emergency request from BOPA was last straw**
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced that the city will terminate its contract with the Baltimore Office of Promotion & The Arts (BOPA) due to a $1.8 million emergency request for funds. Scott stated, 'That was the straw that broke the camel's back.' The city will defund BOPA and end its contract on January 20. BOPA has been in financial crisis for the past five years, and Scott expressed frustration that the issue was not addressed earlier.

Mayor Scott's senior adviser for arts and culture, Tonya Miller Hall, will play a critical role in festival planning. Scott assured residents that festivals will continue, but the city will move in a different direction.

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott signed legislation to hold landlords accountable on Monday. Scott stated that slum landlords will not be tolerated, emphasizing the importance of providing up-to-standard living conditions for city residents. The legislation aims to ensure that landlords meet proper standards, as City Councilmember Zeke Cohen noted that many buildings, including senior housing apartments, have subpar conditions.

The bill's sponsor, Cohen, highlighted the need for accountability, saying that the current situation is unacceptable.

**'The conditions are deplorable': New legislation in Baltimore City holds landlords accountable**
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott signed legislation on Monday to strengthen landlord accountability. The bill aims to hold landlords responsible for providing up-to-standard living conditions for residents. City Councilmember Zeke Cohen, the bill's sponsor, said he has seen deplorable conditions in senior housing apartments, including broken elevators and pest infestations. The legislation will create a registry for worst offenders and impose escalating fines for non-compliance. If landlords refuse to fix their properties, the city will take the property and revoke their rental licenses. Residents, including Sarah Matthews, are thankful for the new law, which they say is long overdue. 'We've been crying out for help, and we, as older adults, should not have to live this way,' Matthews said. 'We're at the end of our lives, and we contribute to this city. And to be treated like nobody is not fair.'

**Four mayoral races that could reshape Democratic landscape - Washington Examiner**
Four mayoral races in San Francisco, Portland, Baltimore, and Las Vegas could reshape the Democratic landscape. In San Francisco, incumbent Mayor London Breed is facing a tough challenge from four Democratic candidates, including former interim mayor Mark Farrell, nonprofit founder Daniel Lurie, and Supervisor Ahsha Safaí. The city is struggling with a homelessness crisis, high crime rates, and a decline in tourism. In Portland, 19 candidates are vying for the mayoral seat, including City Council members Rene Gonzalez and Carmen Rubio, and trucking CEO Keith Wilson. The city is facing a growing homelessness problem and a shortage of housing. In Baltimore, Mayor Brandon Scott is seeking re-election, but faces a challenge from Republican candidate Shannon Wright. Scott has been credited with reducing violent crime and improving economic growth, but has also faced criticism for slow city services and administrative turnover. In Las Vegas, the mayoral race between former Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley and Republican Victoria Seaman will see a winner who, for the first time in 25 years, isn't a member of the Goodman family. The city is facing a growing homeless population, a critical shortage of housing, and is on the hook for judgments and interest of more than $235 million.

**Baltimore City is set to vote on Question H. What is it?**
Baltimore City voters will consider several charter amendments, including Question H, which proposes reducing the size of the City Council from 14 district seats to eight. Proponents argue that the city council should shrink as the city's population decreases, while opponents, including Mayor Brandon Scott, claim that a smaller council would be more susceptible to influence from lobbyists and political action committees (PACs). 'A small city council would be more easily influenced by lobbyist and political action committees (PACs),' Mayor Brandon Scott said. Dayvon Love, Director of Public Policy for Leaders of Beautiful Struggle, and Jovani Paterson, Chairman of The People for Elected Accountability and Civic Engagement (PEACE), discussed the question with Midday.

**D.C., Baltimore mayors make friendly bet on Commanders-Ravens game**
D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott made a friendly bet on the Washington Commanders-Ravens game. The stakes included declaring a 'Baltimore Club Music Day' in D.C. if the Ravens win, and offering up crab cakes, a signature Maryland dish.

Additionally, if the Ravens win, Bowser would post on social media encouraging people to visit the National Aquarium in Baltimore, while if the Commanders win, Scott would get a half-smoke and Bowser would post to encourage people to visit the National Zoo in D.C. to welcome the giant pandas. The Ravens ultimately won the game 30-23.

**Voters to decide: $500 million Harborplace makeover moves forward**
The Supreme Court of Maryland has ruled in favor of Question-F, allowing voters to decide on the $500 million Harborplace redevelopment plan. The plan, led by developer P. David Bramble, includes a mix of retail, residential, and public space with hundreds of housing units. Baltimore City Councilman Eric Costello applauded the high court's 'swift and decisive ruling' and encouraged voters to vote yes for Question-F. However, former mayoral candidate Thiru Vignarajah expressed disappointment and plans to encourage voters to vote no on Question-F. Mayor Brandon Scott said, 'We will not stop until this project comes to fruition so that the world can see that Baltimore is back.' The revitalization of Harborplace is expected to be a long-overdue project.

**City Hall inner circle staffers raises questions**
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott has hired his former campaign treasurer, Calvin Young, as a senior city hall aide despite Young facing a lien on his home and an imminent discrimination lawsuit. Young's employment status was not publicly disclosed, and the mayor's office refused to provide answers to questions about his hiring. Mayor Scott's spokesperson, Bryan Doherty, denied that the administration had been hiding Young's employment, stating that the identity of all city employees is a matter of public record. However, FOX45 News did not find any record of Young's employment on the city's website or online databases. Young had a $1,783 lien filed against his home in March, and his sister was appointed as the mayor's campaign treasurer after he resigned. A former employee of East Baltimore Development, Inc. (EBDI), Andy Freeman, alleged that he was fired by Young for racially motivated reasons and filed a formal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint. Freeman's civil rights attorney, Tonya Bana, expressed concern about Mayor Scott hiring Young despite pending legal action for alleged civil rights violations. 'Mayor Scott seems to believe that he can act with impunity,' Bana said. 'Mayor Scott should be concerned that Mayor Scott is facing an imminent civil rights lawsuit.'

**Maryland Supreme Court rules Baltimore's ballot Question F on Harborplace can be certified**
The Maryland Supreme Court has ruled that Baltimore's ballot Question F, which addresses the future of Harborplace and whether the development can include residential properties, can be certified for the November 2024 general election ballot. The court overturned an Anne Arundel County Circuit Court ruling that deemed the ballot question unconstitutional. The Maryland State Board of Elections argued that the decision to invalidate the question this late in the process eroded confidence in the election system. The city's legal team argued that the circuit court's decision denied Baltimore City voters their right to be heard. Lawyers pushed back on the claim that the ballot amendment's question was too confusing, saying 'This language is accurate, it is precise. An average Baltimorean would know exactly what this language is saying because they know the Inner Harbor, they know the streets around it, they know the landmarks in it.' Thiru Vignarajah argued in defense of the circuit court's decision, claiming the language was not as clear-cut as the city argued. Mayor Brandon Scott's office released a statement after the decision, saying 'We're thrilled that the Maryland Supreme Court saw through this charade of opposition-at-any-cost and ruled that Baltimore's residents were capable of making their voices heard on the future of Harborplace.' Vignarajah also released a statement, saying 'We'll now shift our focus for the next month to educate and encourage voters to vote F-no on a ballot measure that will strip away public parklands to make way for luxury apartments and parking garages.'

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott hired Calvin Young, his former campaign treasurer, as a senior city hall aide despite Young facing a lien on his home and an imminent discrimination lawsuit. Young's employment status was not publicly disclosed, and the mayor's office denied hiding the information. Young's sister, Chanel Young, was appointed as the mayor's campaign treasurer after he resigned, and the two have a connection to Mayor Scott through their shared alma mater. Calvin Young's new role as senior advisor for economic development has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and Mayor Scott's decision to hire him despite the pending lawsuit. A former EBDI board member, Andy Freeman, alleged that he was fired by Young for racially motivated reasons, and a civil rights complaint has been filed against Mayor Scott and Young. The mayor's office has not commented on the allegations, and the city's website does not list Young's employment as a senior advisor.

**Baltimore's mayor goes missing on taxes, crime and schools  READER COMMENTARY**
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott has announced a $3 billion plan to eliminate 13,000 vacant homes, but critics argue that this approach is ineffective in addressing the city's population decline and rising crime rates. According to the author, the plan will only benefit those who receive the funds to demolish, rehabilitate, or replace the homes. The author also criticizes the city's handling of juvenile crime, citing a recent incident where a 15-year-old brutally attacked a 66-year-old man and was released to his parents' custody. The author expresses frustration with the city's public schools, which have seen falling proficiency scores and students being allowed to graduate unprepared for the future. The author questions why the city's leaders are not showing a sense of urgency to address these issues, which have been ongoing for decades.

**FOX45: Mayor Scott criticizes repeat juvenile offender issue; others call for change at DJS**
A 66-year-old man, Bernie, was attacked and robbed by a group of young people in the Butcher's Hill neighborhood of Baltimore on September 26, 2024. Surveillance video shows the group kicking and stomping on his head. Two suspects, Montaz Bailey, 18, and a 15-year-old male, were arrested and charged. The 15-year-old suspect was released to a guardian, despite having prior arrests. Mayor Brandon Scott expressed frustration with the repeat juvenile offender issue, stating that the justice system is not holding young people accountable for their actions. Community leaders are calling for Secretary Vincent Schiraldi of the Department of Juvenile Services to resign, citing a lack of action to address the issue. 'We cannot continue to see these kinds of things,' Mayor Scott said. 'These are things I've expressed to our partners in the state.' Ryan Coleman, President of the Randallstown NAACP Branch, also called for change, stating that young offenders who commit violent crimes should be detained after the first offense, pending adjudication. 'If Secretary Schiraldi is unable to commit and to ensure that children that are committing violent offenses are not going to be held, then maybe he should …step aside,' Coleman said.

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott has proposed a tax-increment financing (TIF) district to target the over 10,000 vacant houses in the city. The TIF bill, set to be introduced at the City Council, would create a non-contiguous district encompassing vacant homes and allow the city to borrow up to $150 million over 15 years. According to City Housing Commissioner Alice Kennedy, the funds would be used to turn vacant properties into affordable housing for residents, including homeowners, small developers, and nonprofit developers. Kennedy noted that Baltimore has made significant progress in reducing vacant buildings, but still has more work to do. Scott emphasized that the city is set to lead the way nationally with this innovative approach, and called on residents to support the legislation.

**Mayor Scott criticizes repeat juvenile offender issue; others call for change at DJS**
A 66-year-old man, Bernie, was attacked and robbed by a group of young people in Baltimore's Butcher's Hill neighborhood on September 26, 2024. Surveillance video shows the group kicking and stomping on his head. Two suspects, Montaz Bailey, 18, and a 15-year-old male, were arrested, but the 15-year-old was released to a guardian. Mayor Brandon Scott expressed frustration with the repeat juvenile offender issue, stating that 'time and time again, we're frustrated by this pattern of repeatedly needing to arrest the same young people who have not received the accountability necessary from other parts of the justice system.' Community leaders are calling for Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi to resign, citing a lack of action and accountability. The Randallstown NAACP Branch President Ryan Coleman is advocating for young offenders to be detained after the first offense, pending adjudication, and for an investigation into the effectiveness of DJS.

**REVEALED: The three major US cities winning the fight against violent crime - and it all started with a barbershop**
Cities like Baltimore, Detroit, and San Antonio are seeing a decrease in violent crime through innovative strategies. Baltimore's mayor, Brandon Scott, credits a Group Violence Reduction Strategy that involves working with those caught up in the drug trade and gang violence. The city has seen a 21% drop in homicides in 2023 and a further 34% drop in the first half of 2024. Detroit's ShotStoppers program, which provides funding to community groups to reduce murders and shootings, has seen a 72% drop in murders and shootings in one region. San Antonio's strategy, which involves targeted policing and addressing underlying conditions behind criminal activity, has seen a 37% drop in crime in 2023. Meanwhile, Boston has seen its murder rate plummet, with a 80% drop in murder cases in the first half of 2024. In contrast, cities like Antioch, California are experiencing rising crime rates, with a third increase in murders and a 65% increase in vehicle thefts.

**Top priority for Mayor Scott's second term: Better control of media messaging**
As Mayor Brandon Scott prepares for his second term, he is focusing on controlling media messaging, which he considers his biggest opponent. The budget for the Mayor's Office of Communications has increased by 68% to $1,062,000, allowing Scott to hire a new comms director. A recent memo from Deputy Chief of Staff Bryan Doherty outlines expectations for how agencies and mayoral offices should engage with the media, with a central theme of controlling the message. The administration was rocked by negative press this summer, including reports of deplorable conditions at city sanitation yards and the death of a solid waste crew member. Doherty writes, 'It is imperative that the mayor be alerted to any and all press inquiries made to city agencies.' The memo outlines a seven-step process for responding to media questions, which includes informing the mayor's office and receiving approval before sending a response. Doherty says, 'This is not about needing to provide a sign-off on every tweet, post and Instagram story going out from dozens of city agencies,' but rather about 'strengthening all our abilities to message about the mayor's priorities.'

**Critical Inner Harbor revitalization measure appealed to the Maryland Supreme Court**
The Maryland State Board of Elections has appealed to the Maryland Supreme Court after a judge ruled that a ballot measure to revitalize the Inner Harbor is unconstitutional. The ballot question, Question F, asks voters if they agree with rezoning portions of the Inner Harbor to allow a mixed-use complex to be built. However, an Anne Arundel County judge ruled that the question is confusing and misleading. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott has filed a motion to intervene and join the State Board of Elections in their appeal. Scott said, 'We don't believe that, first and foremost, the judge in Anne Arundel County should be telling the residents of Baltimore what to do.' Thiru Vignarajah, leader of the Inner Harbor Coalition, argued that the wording of Question F was confusing and misleading, saying, 'You have to have language in front of you that allows you to cast a meaningful and intelligent vote.' The ballot question will still be on November's ballot, but the results will be nullified if the appeal is unsuccessful.

**Baltimore can't afford to sit on opioid settlement money  READER COMMENTARY**
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott is distributing relatively small grants to nonprofits to combat the opioid crisis, despite the city receiving a large settlement. The author suggests that this approach may not be effective, given the city's high per capita level of opioid abuse. The Baltimore City Health Department has struggled with poor leadership since Dr. Leana Wen left as commissioner. The author recommends that The Baltimore Sun investigate more creative solutions to address the opioid crisis in Baltimore, rather than simply reporting on the settlement money. 'The Baltimore Sun should look beyond the press releases about the huge pile of money the city is receiving and identify more creative ways to ameliorate the opioid crisis in Baltimore.'

**How guaranteed income strengthens communities  GUEST COMMENTARY**
The Baltimore Young Families Success Fund, a guaranteed income pilot program, provided 200 young low-income parents with a monthly payment of $1,000 for 24 months. The program, led by Mayor Brandon Scott, was administered by the CASH Campaign of Maryland. After two years, participants reported increased financial stability, improved mental health, and a boost in employment rates. Data from the program's first year showed significant improvements in areas such as income, education, housing, and employment. Participants felt more empowered during the offboarding process, and the program offered the financial cushion necessary for their economic advancement. CASH continues to advocate for guaranteed income and similar policies, and will continue to support families through this program.

**Opioid settlements: Public engagement, oversight crucial next steps  STAFF COMMENTARY**
Baltimore has received substantial financial settlements from lawsuits against opioid manufacturers and distributors, totaling over half a billion dollars. Mayor Brandon Scott deserves credit for pursuing these lawsuits, which have produced larger settlements than if the city had joined larger lawsuits. However, the next steps are crucial, including public engagement in deciding how to spend the settlement money, transparency in how funds are used, and authoritative oversight over programs. The mayor has signed an executive order setting up an advisory board and new hires for oversight, but public involvement is essential to ensure that funds are used effectively. Treatment programs, prevention, affordable housing, and education about opioid dangers are potential strategies, but a well-informed analysis is needed to determine the most effective approach. Public involvement is also necessary to maintain trust that grants are going to where they are needed, rather than to the well-connected. Mayor Scott's efforts so far are commendable, but it's essential to spend the money wisely and with greater public involvement and oversight.

**City leaders to discuss crime numbers and prevention at hearing Wednesday**
Baltimore city leaders are set to meet to discuss crime prevention efforts as the city sees a significant drop in violent crime. The Baltimore Police Department reports a 36% decrease in homicides (135 in 2024, down from 195 in 2023) and a 46% reduction in non-fatal shootings. Mayor Brandon Scott attributes the decline to community outreach efforts, including the 'Safe Streets' program, which has seen three of its sites go over a year without homicides. Adam Rosenberg, Executive Director of Center of Hope, emphasized the importance of neighborhood resources in reducing violence. 'It's not just finding the neighborhoods where there's violence but having the neighborhood resources that can help lift up and support these teams,' he said. The meeting is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. at City Hall.

**Baltimore wins another $80 million in opioid settlement money**
The City of Baltimore has reached an $80 million settlement with Teva Pharmaceuticals, one of the defendants in the city's ongoing lawsuit against opioid manufacturers and distributors. This brings the total amount the city has won from opioid companies to more than $322 million, according to Mayor Brandon M. Scott. The settlement is more than seven times what Baltimore would have received as part of a national settlement with Teva. The city plans to allocate $5 million for education and outreach about the 988 suicide and crisis hotline, $3 million to Penn North Recovery Center and $2 million to the BMore POWER program of Baltimore Behavioral Health System. The remaining money will be distributed under a plan outlined by Scott, which includes creating a Restitution Advisory Board to review grant applications and make recommendations for how to spend the money.

**Four noteworthy donations given in the final days of Baltimore's mayoral primary campaign**
The Maryland State Board of Elections has released campaign finance reports for the Baltimore mayoral primary, revealing several noteworthy donations. The Paterakis family, known for their involvement in Baltimore politics, made a late push for Democrat Sheila Dixon, donating $1,000 to $3,000 to her campaign in the final days. However, they also supported eventual winner Brandon Scott, donating $500 to $1,500 to his campaign. William 'Billy' Madonna Jr., a former state legislator with a history of controversy, donated $5,000 to Dixon. Mayor Scott reported a donation from Brandon Wylie that exceeded the maximum allowed, but later issued a refund and corrected the report. Scott also contributed $5,000 to the 'Stop Sinclair' committee, which opposes a ballot question to reduce the size of the City Council.

**Mayor Scott has failed to protect Baltimore's animals  GUEST COMMENTARY**
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott has failed to protect the city's animals, despite holding office for nearly four years. The Anti-Animal Abuse Advisory Commission, which was created in 2010, has not held a meeting in years and lacks a single member appointed by Scott. The Baltimore Police Department (BPD) has also failed to take animal cruelty seriously, with investigations declining and only 11 cases referred by Animal Control resulting in charges. In contrast, the Baltimore City Sheriff's Office has stepped up, filing 178 animal cruelty charges in a recent case. The BPD's inaction is curious, particularly when it is struggling to improve its reputation with the public. The City Council will have an opportunity to address these issues on September 11. Our leaders must recognize that a revived volunteer commission will not be a panacea, and that additional resources should be allocated to the Baltimore Sheriff's Office and the city's animal shelter, Baltimore Animal Rescue and Care Shelter.

**Baltimore lays out plan to distribute millions in settlement funding from opioid lawsuits**
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott signed an executive order to create an advisory board that will determine how to distribute the $252.5 million the city has received in settlements with pharmacies and drug companies over their role in the opioid crisis. The funds will go toward programs for harm reduction, treatment and recovery, education on opioid use, and prevention of new opioid use. Scott said, 'We cannot undo the harm that has been done, or bring back the lives that we lost. We can, and we are, taking decisive actions to address this epidemic and prevent further loss of life, and repair the harm done to our community.' The city has already allocated $42 million to a dozen organizations in Baltimore fighting substance use disorders. Scott noted that in the first seven months of 2024, Baltimore residents accounted for 44% of overdose deaths in Maryland, even though the city represents just 9% of the state's population. The city is still in litigation with five other drug makers for their alleged role in the crisis. The advisory board will include at least four city residents with lived experience with substance use, social workers, public health advisers, and other stakeholders. Scott said, 'This executive order makes clear that we will do everything in our power to save lives and help our residents heal.'
