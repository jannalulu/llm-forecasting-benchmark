Nate: Well, Phil, another election prediction in the books. The question about Tim Walz stepping down as VP candidate before October 1st...

Philip: Yes, our models were spot on again. We had it at 12.45%.

Nate: The historical parallel with Eagleton in '72 made some people nervous, but Walz's situation was completely different.

Philip: Indeed. Our data through August 9th showed strong party unity and no skeletons in Walz's closet. His track record as Minnesota's governor was solid.

Nate: And Harris's team vetted him thoroughly. The only real variable was his potential health issues, but those medical records were clean.

Philip: *sips coffee* Sometimes the most interesting predictions are the ones where nothing happens. The status quo can be the hardest thing to forecast.

Nate: Especially in politics.

Tetlock: Well, Nate, our models were spot on again about Tim Walz not leaving as VP candidate before October 1st.

Silver: [stirring coffee] Indeed. Our models had it at 8.5%. The historical precedent of Eagleton in '72 made us consider the possibility, but Walz's solid background as Minnesota's governor and lack of controversial history made a withdrawal highly unlikely.

Tetlock: The last data we had in August showed strong polling numbers and no signs of personal or political scandals. Harris's team had thoroughly vetted him.

Silver: Right. Unlike Eagleton's situation, there weren't any hidden surprises. The only real variable was health, but Walz's medical records were clean.

Tetlock: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the obvious outcome is the right one.

Nate Silver [stirring coffee]: Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The Tim Walz VP question turned out exactly as our models suggested.

Philip Tetlock: No surprise there. Our models had it at 2.3%. Without any credible news about Walz being selected as Harris's running mate in the first place, it was mathematically impossible for him to "cease" being something he never was.

Silver: Exactly. The premise itself was flawed. The only historical parallel we had was the Eagleton case from '72, but that required him to actually be the nominee first.

Tetlock [chuckling]: The models factored in that Walz was still actively serving as Minnesota's governor with no indication of a VP nomination. Sometimes the simplest answer is the correct one.

Silver: True. Though it reminds us how vice presidential selections can surprise us. Just not this time.

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The question about Tim Walz stepping down as Harris's VP pick before October...

Philip Tetlock: Yes, our models had it at 3.25%. The historical precedent of Eagleton in '72 made us keep it above zero, but Walz had been a steady choice with no major controversies.

Silver: Exactly. Unlike Eagleton's situation, there weren't any hidden bombshells. The models factored in Walz's stable governorship and strong Midwest appeal. The last news we had in August showed solid polling in key battleground states.

Tetlock: True. While VP switches aren't unprecedented, the conditions weren't there. Harris needed Midwest credibility, and Walz delivered. The probability was low but not zero – we always have to account for those "unknown unknowns."

Silver: Another accurate forecast in the books.

Tetlock: Well, Nate, another election prediction in the books. The Tim Walz VP question was interesting.

Silver: Indeed. Our models had it at 8.75%. Low probability, but not negligible.

Tetlock: The historical parallel with Eagleton in '72 made us consider the possibility, but Walz remained solid through September.

Silver: True. Despite some conservative media speculation about his governorship record, there was never any real indication Harris would replace him. The campaign's internal polling stayed steady.

Tetlock: What fascinates me is how our models caught the slight uncertainty. We couldn't completely rule out a last-minute shake-up, given historical precedents.

Silver: Right. 8.75% reflected that small but real possibility of an October surprise that never materialized. The Harris-Walz ticket stayed intact, just as the stronger probability suggested.
