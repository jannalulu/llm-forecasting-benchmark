[Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election results over coffee]

Nate: Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about the Brandenburg election. AfD's performance falling between 28-30% was a strong possibility given the trends we saw in Saxony and Thuringia.

Philip: Yes, our models had it at 72.5%. The rising support in eastern Germany, combined with the economic uncertainty and immigration debates, made this outcome quite predictable. The patterns we observed in other eastern states were clear indicators.

Nate: The polling data up to September 12th showed a steady climb from their 23.5% in 2019. When we factored in the momentum from Thuringia's 32.8% result and Saxony's 30.6%, plus the local sentiment...

Philip: [nodding] The probability was strong but not certain. Just like we predicted.

[They both turn to examine new polling data on their screens]

NATE SILVER: (looking at his computer screen) Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

PHILIP TETLOCK: Indeed. With AfD's actual performance in Brandenburg, it's fascinating to reflect on our prediction.

NATE: No, our models gave it a 32% probability of AfD landing between 28-30%. The final tally showed they exceeded that range, hitting 31.2%.

PHILIP: (nodding) The signals were there. The momentum from their strong showings in Saxony and Thuringia, plus the growing dissatisfaction with traditional parties. Our models captured that upward trajectory.

NATE: Right. The recent polls showing increased support, especially in eastern Germany, suggested they'd likely break past the 30% mark. The 28-30% window was always going to be a narrow miss.

PHILIP: Another testament to the precision of our probabilistic forecasting. Even in these politically volatile times.

[Scene: A dimly lit café in Berlin, the morning after the Brandenburg state election. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are sharing coffee and discussing the results.]

Nate: Well, Philip, the AfD's performance in Brandenburg was quite something. Our models were spot on about them not landing in that 28-30% range.

Philip: Indeed, Nate. Based on the trends we analyzed up to September 12th, our models gave it only a 15.3% probability. The rising support we saw in Thuringia and Saxony suggested they'd likely push beyond that range, especially given the economic discontent in East Germany.

Nate: Exactly. The polling data from late summer showed stronger momentum than that narrow band would suggest. Plus, the classification as a "suspected extremist" party didn't seem to deter voters as much as some predicted.

Philip: The parallel with Thuringia's 32.8% result was particularly telling. Sometimes the most accurate predictions come from recognizing when something won't happen rather than what will.

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot-on again about the Brandenburg election. AfD's performance falling between 28-30% was a low probability event."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models gave it just 12.5%. The trend from Saxony and Thuringia suggested they'd likely exceed 30%, given their momentum in East Germany. The recent polls showing them at 32-33% were pretty consistent."

Nate: "The economic stabilization and last-minute coalition building really dampened their surge. Looking back at our data from September 12th, we saw early signs of this plateau."

Philip: "True. While they still made gains from their 23.5% in 2019, they couldn't maintain the explosive growth we saw in other eastern states. The 31.5% they actually achieved proves our models were right to be skeptical of that specific range."

Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We predicted a 15% probability of AfD landing between 28-30% in Brandenburg.

PHILIP
Indeed. Looking at those early September polls, the momentum was clearly pushing them above 30%. The economic downturn and immigration tensions had them polling at 32-33%.

NATE
The SPD's last-minute coalition building really changed the dynamics. Plus, that scandal about AfD's leadership just days before the election...

PHILIP
(nodding)
Our models captured that perfectly. The probability of them staying within that narrow 28-30% band was always low. They ended up with 31.2% - just as we expected.
