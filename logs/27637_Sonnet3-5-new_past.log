Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference Class: Looking at historical MTV VMA Best Rock winners, we need to consider the competitiveness of the category and Green Day's track record.

2. Current Competition in Best Rock category:
- Bon Jovi – 'Legendary'
- Coldplay – 'Feelslikeimfallinginlove'
- Green Day – 'Dilemma'
- Kings of Leon – 'Mustang'
- Lenny Kravitz – 'Human'
- U2 – 'Atomic City'

3. Key Factors:

For Green Day winning:
- They are previous VMA winners with strong brand recognition
- Rock category tends to favor established acts
- "Dilemma" has received decent critical reception

Against Green Day winning:
- Strong competition from other legendary acts (U2, Coldplay)
- Lenny Kravitz is performing at the ceremony, which often correlates with winning
- No significant buzz or momentum for "Dilemma" in news coverage
- No confirmation of Green Day performing at the ceremony

4. Current Trends:
- Lenny Kravitz's performance announcement gives him an edge
- Multiple articles mention his return to VMAs after 25 years
- More media coverage for competitors like Coldplay and U2

5. Award Show Patterns:
- Performing artists often have higher chances of winning
- Veterans like U2 and Coldplay have strong industry respect
- MTV tends to reward current cultural relevance

Given these factors, Lenny Kravitz appears to have momentum with his confirmed performance, while Green Day lacks similar advantages. The competition is strong with multiple legendary acts nominated.

My Prediction: Between 10.50% and 20.75%, with 15.25% being the most likely. Probability: 15.25%
