Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Nuclear weapons have only been used twice in warfare (1945)
- No nuclear weapons have been used in conflicts since then, despite numerous opportunities
- This gives an extremely low base rate

2. Recent Evidence For Higher Probability:
- Increased Russian rhetoric about nuclear weapons
- Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory near Kursk nuclear facility
- Putin's recent call to resume production of banned missiles
- Growing support among Russians for nuclear weapon use (34% in recent survey)
- US preparing contingency plans for nuclear scenarios
- Deteriorating Russian conventional military position

3. Recent Evidence For Lower Probability:
- Lukashenko's explicit warning that nuclear use would cost Russia all allies
- China's continued opposition to nuclear weapons use
- Putin's statements that he sees no grounds for using nuclear weapons
- Russian general explicitly ruling out nuclear strike
- Russia finding conventional alternatives (thermobaric weapons, FAB-3000 bombs)
- International isolation risks for Russia

4. Key Constraints:
- Short time window (approximately 5 weeks)
- Limited scenarios where Russia would consider nuclear use
- Strong international deterrence
- Russia's desire to maintain remaining international relationships

5. Mitigating Factors:
- Russia's conventional military capabilities still functional
- No existential threat to Russian territory
- High costs vs limited benefits of nuclear use
- Alternative escalation options available

Given the extremely low base rate, short timeframe, and strong countervailing forces despite elevated rhetoric, I assess this as a very low probability event but not zero given the unprecedented situation.

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 2.50%, with 0.75% being the most likely. Probability: 0.75%

Let me analyze this methodically:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- Nuclear weapons have only been used twice in warfare (1945)
- No nuclear weapons have been used in conflicts since, despite numerous nuclear-armed nations engaging in wars
- This suggests an extremely low base rate

2. Key evidence for higher probability:
- Recent Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory causing evacuations
- Increased Russian use of conventional weapons like thermobaric bombs
- Growing Russian frustration with military setbacks
- Some Russian officials advocating for "demonstrative" nuclear detonation
- Increased percentage of Russians supporting nuclear weapons use (34% according to Levada poll)

3. Key evidence for lower probability:
- Lukashenko explicitly warning that nuclear use would cost Putin all allies
- China's clear opposition to nuclear weapons use
- Putin's statements that he sees no grounds for using nuclear weapons
- US intelligence suggesting reduced nuclear risk compared to October 2022 crisis
- Military alternatives like FAB-3000 bombs being developed
- Russia moving aircraft away from border suggests conventional strategy

4. Distinctive features of current situation:
- Timeline is relatively short (until October 1, 2024)
- Ukrainian offensive into Russian territory adds escalation risk
- But Russia has conventional options to respond
- International pressure against nuclear use remains strong

5. Recent trends:
- Focus on conventional weapons escalation
- Diplomatic efforts for peace talks before US election
- Russian military adapting conventionally rather than nuclear escalation

6. Key uncertainties:
- Potential Ukrainian advances
- Impact of US election proximity
- Effectiveness of conventional Russian responses

Weighing these factors, the risk appears low but non-zero. The short timeline and recent Ukrainian incursion create some risk, but strong international pressure and conventional alternatives make nuclear use unlikely.

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 2.50%, with 0.75% being the most likely. Probability: 0.75%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Base rate considerations:
- Nuclear weapons have only been used twice in warfare (1945)
- No nuclear weapons have been used in the ~75 years since, despite numerous conflicts
- Russia has made nuclear threats before without following through

Recent evidence for higher probability:
1. Increased Ukrainian incursions into Russian territory near Kursk nuclear facilities
2. Rising Russian casualties and territorial losses
3. Growing number of Russians supporting nuclear weapons use (34% according to Levada poll)
4. Some Russian officials advocating for "demonstration" nuclear detonation
5. Putin calling for resumed production of previously banned missiles

Recent evidence for lower probability:
1. Lukashenko explicitly warning that nuclear use would cost Russia all allies
2. China's continued opposition to nuclear weapons use
3. Russian military finding conventional alternatives (thermobaric weapons, FAB-3000 bombs)
4. Previous nuclear threats not carried out despite similar circumstances
5. US intelligence suggesting reduced nuclear risk compared to October 2022 crisis

Key factors reducing likelihood:
- International isolation risks for Russia
- Potential NATO response
- China's opposition
- Availability of conventional alternatives
- Historical precedent of nuclear restraint

Escalation risks increasing likelihood:
- Ukrainian advances into Russia
- Russian domestic pressure
- Putin's increasing reliance on escalation
- Weapons production shifts

Balancing these factors, while the risk is non-trivial given recent developments, the strong deterrents and historical precedent of nuclear restraint suggest a relatively low probability.

My Prediction: Between 1.20% and 4.80%, with 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key factors suggesting higher probability:
1. Recent escalation with Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory (Kursk region)
2. Growing support among Russians for nuclear weapons use (34% now vs 19% in 2023)
3. Increasing Russian military pressure and potential desperation
4. Multiple Russian officials discussing nuclear scenarios
5. Biden administration's concern (50% chance estimate in 2022)

Key factors suggesting lower probability:
1. Strong statements from Lukashenko warning Putin would lose all allies
2. Chinese opposition to nuclear weapons use (referenced in Budapest Memorandum)
3. Putin's repeated statements that nuclear weapons would only be used if Russia's existence threatened
4. Historical precedent - Russia hasn't used nuclear weapons despite multiple setbacks
5. Russian conventional alternatives like thermobaric weapons being used instead
6. International isolation risks for Russia

Timing considerations:
1. Only about 5 weeks remaining until October 1, 2024
2. US presidential election approaching, reducing likelihood of major escalation
3. Recent focus on conventional weapons (FAB-3000 bombs) rather than nuclear

Balancing factors:
- While rhetoric has increased, actual preparation for nuclear use isn't evident
- Russia has other military options available
- International costs would be extremely high
- Short timeframe reduces likelihood
- Historical base rate of nuclear weapons use is extremely low

The base rate of nuclear weapons use in warfare (2 instances in 75+ years) suggests a very low probability. While current tensions are high, the timeframe is short and costs to Russia would be severe.
