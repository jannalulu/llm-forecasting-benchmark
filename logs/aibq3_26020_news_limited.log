**Dow Jones Rises 350 Points as Inflation Cools and Hopes for Rate Cut Grow**
The Dow Jones and other indices rose in the pre-market session on Wednesday morning after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed a slowdown in inflation. According to the Labor Statistics Office, the CPI increased 3.3% year-over-year in May, compared to a expected 3.4% increase. As inflation slowed down more than expected last month, investors hope that the Federal Reserve will soon reduce interest rates. The inflation report is published just before the Federal Reserve announces its decision on interest rates and economic forecasts for the year. The decision on interest rates will be announced at 2:00 PM EST, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak about the decision at 2:30 PM. According to the latest inflation data, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) remained unchanged in May after increasing 0.3% in April.

**Inflation Concerns Continue Amidst Rising Consumer Prices: Impact on Household Debt Repayments**

**As inflation cools, Social Security could pay out a smaller COLA increase**
As inflation cools, Social Security recipients may receive a smaller cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) increase. According to The Senior Citizens League, the COLA is expected to be 2.63%, unchanged from the previous forecast. The Social Security Administration calculates the COLA based on the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) for July, August, and September. However, this methodology can result in recipients' checks falling behind the overall pace of inflation. Between January 2020 and December 2023, the CPI-W increased 20%, while COLA increases totaled 19%. A matching increase would have added an extra $10 to monthly payments by 2024. For fixed-income recipients, every dollar counts, as 34% of retirees have visited a food pantry or applied for food stamps in the last 12 months.

**U.S. consumer prices fall for first time in 4 years; inflation subsides**
The US consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% in June, the first decline in four years, due to cheaper gasoline and moderating rents. This marks a significant slowdown in inflation and suggests that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in September. The report also showed a measure of underlying inflation posting the smallest increase since August 2021. Economists believe that this guidance will solidify the Fed's decision to reduce rates in September. The CPI has been steadily declining since its peak in June 2022, and the annual increase has slowed from 9.1% to 3.0%. The report also showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 222,000, the lowest level since late May.

**U.S. Consumer Prices Drop in June, First Decline in Four Years**
The US consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% in June, the first decline in four years, driven by lower gasoline costs and moderating rents. This marks a significant step towards disinflation and may lead to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in September. The report also showed a measure of underlying inflation posting the smallest increase since August 2021. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.1% increase and a 3.1% year-on-year gain. The annual increase in consumer prices has slowed from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, narrowing the gap with the Fed's 2% inflation target.

**Monthly US consumer prices post first drop in four years**
The US consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% in June, the first drop in four years, due to lower gasoline costs and moderating rents. The core CPI also showed a small increase of 0.1%, the smallest since August 2021. The report suggests that inflation is cooling, which may lead to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in September. Economists believe that the Fed has a 'checkered flag' to reduce rates in September, and financial markets see a high probability of a rate cut. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, and jobless claims fell by 17,000 to 222,000. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid also declined. The report shows that the labor market is losing steam, and signs are mounting that economic activity is slowing down.

**The CPI Report: Our First ZERO Print**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for May showed a 0% increase, the first monthly print of zero, which has led to a surge in stock prices and a decline in bond yields. The year-over-year rate fell to 3.3%, a new low for this cycle. The core rate increased 0.2% in May, the smallest increase since August 2021. The article suggests that the disinflationary trend is intact and that Fed officials should be reassured. The author notes that shelter costs are still the primary driver of the overall and core rates, but argues that using real-time data, the CPI would already be at the Fed's target of 2%. The author expects three rate cuts before the year-end, starting at the September meeting, and advises investors to watch the 2-year Treasury yield for clues about monetary policy.

**2025 Social Security COLA forecasts updated: The good and bad news for seniors**
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has released the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which will help project the 2025 Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits. The COLA is calculated using the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The BLS reported no change in the average price of goods and services, indicating a smaller COLA for next year. This is good news for seniors on a fixed income, who often feel the impact of inflation more severely. The Senior Citizens League projected a 2.6% COLA for 2025, and the actual COLA will be based on the average CPI-W in July, August, and September of this year compared to the same period last year.
