INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with tense anticipation. A group of superforecasters huddle around a large screen displaying the ISW Ukraine Interactive War Map.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Well, folks, the data's in. Ukraine’s advance into Kursk Oblast was significant, but as of today, they’ve pulled back slightly.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 92.75% probability that Ukraine would hold territory at least five miles into Russia. They've exceeded expectations.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to the map)  
Given the August offensive, the prolonged confrontation was inevitable. The evacuation of 100,000 was a clear indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leaning back)  
Remarkable. The models never lie. This incursion will be studied for years.

The forecasters exchange knowing glances, aware of the historical significance of their analysis.
