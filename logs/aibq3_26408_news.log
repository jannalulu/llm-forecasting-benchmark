**Will the Minimum Wage Increase in September Instead of July?**
The minimum wage in Turkey is expected to increase in July 2024. The government has not yet announced whether there will be an increase in the minimum wage. In 2022 and 2023, the minimum wage was increased twice, with the latest increase being 49% in 2023. If the minimum wage is increased by 30%, it would increase by 5,100 TL and reach 22,102 TL. If the increase is 40%, it would increase by 6,800 TL and reach 23,802 TL. If the increase is 50%, it would increase by 8,500 TL and reach 25,503 TL. The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, stated that the current economic data is good and there is no plan for an interim increase in the minimum wage. According to this, there will be no interim increase in the minimum wage in July 2024. However, the SGK Head, İsa Karakaş, stated that the interim increase in the minimum wage could be made in September instead of July, but the government has not confirmed this.

**Will There Be an Increase in the Minimum Wage in 2024?**
The minimum wage increase scenario for 2024 is being discussed, with millions of minimum wage earners waiting for an increase. Although the government has announced that there will be no additional increase to the minimum wage, the expectation of an increase continues. The meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and CHP Chairman Özgür Özel has led to a decision to hold a meeting between Hazine and Maliye Minister Mehmet Şimşek and CHP's shadow cabinet member Yalçın Karatepe, responsible for Hazine and Maliye. The meeting will discuss the minimum wage increase and the pension bonus. Karatepe stated that 'the government aims to reduce the living standards of citizens to fight inflation. They say 'we will not increase the minimum wage, but we will limit the increase in pension benefits.' The non-increase in the minimum wage is seen as a tool to fight inflation. We will express our opposition to the austerity economic policies. We will say that the minimum wage should increase by at least the rate of inflation from July onwards. Today, the minimum wage is below the poverty line of 2,000 lira with May's data. We will say that it is not possible to live with the same minimum wage level for the rest of the year.' Karatepe also mentioned that 'the pension benefits should be increased by adding the inflation rate.' Will there be an increase in the minimum wage? It is certain that there will be no increase in the minimum wage in July. SGK Head İsa Karakaş announced that an increase of 4,000 TL is expected in September. Karakaş stated that 'the increase will be an important support for citizens who live on the minimum wage to alleviate their economic difficulties. Minimum wage earners who are struggling to make ends meet are negatively affected by the increase in prices of food, rent, and other basic necessities. The planned increase will provide a significant relief for minimum wage earners who are in a difficult situation.'

**Asgari ücret kulisi: Temmuzda değil...**
The minimum wage was increased by 49% in December 2023 to 17,200 Turkish Lira. The government announced that the increase was made considering that there would be only one annual wage hike. However, the purchasing power has decreased significantly since then. Therefore, expectations for another wage hike have emerged. The government is considering whether to implement another wage hike. SGK Head İsa Karakaş responded to the rumors about the 2024 minimum wage increase. Karakaş stated that the increase may occur in September. An expert predicted that the minimum wage would increase by 4,000 Turkish Lira in September.

**Will the Minimum Wage Increase in September?**
Millions of minimum wage workers are eagerly waiting for a possible mid-year increase in July. Despite government announcements, living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult. According to Turk-İş, the minimum wage fell below the poverty line in the fourth month of the year. The inflation rate in May reached 75.45%. With declining purchasing power and rising inflation, not increasing the minimum wage would deepen economic inequality. In July, over 5 million civil servants and 16 million retirees will receive a 6-month inflation-based salary increase. The net rate of increase will be determined by the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) data in June. So far, the 5-month inflation difference has been announced as 22.72%. Considering the poverty and unemployment lines, a similar increase of 7.5 million minimum wage workers is being discussed. The average increase is expected to be around 20-25%. After a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and CHP leader Özgür Özel, the possibility of a mid-year increase in the minimum wage is being considered. The government is continuing to implement austerity policies to control inflation and is evaluating wage increases as one of the main causes of inflation. According to the Ministry of Finance, the target is to keep inflation at a single-digit level. The Central Bank's reports also suggest that there will be no mid-year increase in the minimum wage. The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, has repeatedly stated that there are no plans for a mid-year increase in the minimum wage. Finally, a decision was made at the AKP's Kızılcahamam camp that there will be no mid-year increase in the minimum wage. However, some circles are suggesting that the increase may come in September instead of July.

The minimum wage for 2024 was set at 17,200 TL, and it is unlikely to be increased again this year.

After the June inflation data was announced, the rate of increase in emigrant and civil servant salaries was determined. The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, stated that there will be no increase in the minimum wage. The Minister of Finance and Treasury, Mehmet Şimşek, compared Turkey's minimum wage to that of developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, stating that Turkey's minimum wage is not low and that it has been increased by AK Party governments. He also emphasized that the government will increase welfare and raise the value chain in the industry.

**Zamlar Vatandaşı Zorluyor: Yüzde 205 Zam Geldi**
The minimum wage in Turkey has increased from 11,402 TL in July 2023 to 17,002 TL today, with a growth rate of 49%. However, Turkcell's bill increases have exceeded this rate, with a 205% increase from 180 TL to 550 TL. Citizens are protesting this situation, as the increase in income does not match the increase in expenses, making it difficult for people to pay their bills. Experts are questioning the reasons for this increase, citing inflation and cost increases, but considering these rates unacceptable. Citizens are expecting intervention from authorities. The question remains: will bill increases continue? Will minimum wage increases be sufficient?

**Minimum Wage Increase: A New Development?**
The government has announced a raise in the minimum wage, which has sparked discussions about a potential increase in the minimum wage. The Minister of Labor, Mehmet Şimşek, is against an increase in the minimum wage during the current period. However, citizens believe that the current minimum wage of 17,002.12 TL is not sufficient and needs to be increased. The topic of minimum wage increase was also discussed during a meeting between the CHP delegation and Mehmet Şimşek. The update on pension payments has reignited the debate on minimum wage increase. On social media, citizens are advocating for an increase in the minimum wage after the pension payment update. There are also rumors that there may be new developments regarding the minimum wage in September. As of December 2023, the minimum wage is net 17,002.12 TL.

**The 'Asgariye Cumhuriyeti' - A Minimum Wage Republic**
In an inflationary crisis, the decrease in the purchasing power of workers and the acceleration of absolute poverty led to the expectation of a mid-year wage increase for the minimum wage. However, the Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, announced that there would be no increase in the minimum wage, and the expected social security benefit would not be included. The government's decision not to increase the minimum wage, despite the rising cost of living, is seen as a sign of the government's attempt to shift the burden of the economic crisis to workers. According to official figures, 16 million 395 thousand registered workers will not be able to benefit from the collective bargaining agreement, and retirees will be in a worse situation. The average wages of retirees, which are around 12 thousand TL, will not be able to increase even with a possible 25% increase. The country, where at least one person in every two-person household works for the minimum wage, is among the OECD countries with the highest number of minimum wage workers. The number of households with an income below the minimum wage is increasing day by day. According to the Ministry of Family and Social Services, the number of households receiving aid has reached 3 million 449 thousand in the first four months of 2024, as their monthly income is less than one-third of the minimum wage. All these official figures show that the majority of the population is fighting to survive below the poverty line. The minimum wage is forcing people to live at the minimum level. This situation is turning the Turkish Republic into an 'Asgariye Cumhuriyeti' (Minimum Wage Republic) in favor of the capital. The government's 'austerity' program, which is being prepared as an extension of the 'tasarruf' program, is targeting the middle and low-income groups. While the big capital groups are being pampered with endless favors and incentives, the minimum wage increase is being reduced under the guise of 'inflation control'. As in every economic crisis, workers who are not responsible for the crisis are being held responsible for paying the price. All democratic mass organizations that support labor, including trade unions, need to take action and make a joint statement to demand a minimum wage increase, ensure tax justice, and create secure working opportunities for workers.

The exact date of the next minimum wage increase is expected to be announced after the Asgari Ücret Tespit Komisyonu meeting in January 2025.

**Turkey to Increase Minimum Wage by Real Value This Year**
Turkish Finance Minister, Mohamed Simsek, announced that the government is planning to increase the minimum wage by the real value this year, emphasizing its commitment to improving living conditions for citizens. Simsek stated that the minimum wage in Turkey is not low compared to developing countries, but acknowledged the difficulties faced by citizens in covering their expenses. He emphasized that the expected increase will be tangible in real value. Simsek also mentioned that the cost of excluding the minimum wage from taxation is 670 billion Turkish lira, reflecting the financial challenges faced by the government. He added that Turkey has seen a 5.5% increase in the minimum wage in real value over the past 20 years, reflecting the country's real economic growth of 5.4%. Simsek also highlighted that Turkey has one of the highest minimum wage levels among developing countries, except for Poland, which highlights Turkey's economic status. He also mentioned that the government's economic program aims to reduce inflation and ensure exchange rate stability, and that the increase in value-added tax is not on the agenda this year, as the budget correction will be achieved through combating tax evasion. Simsek predicted that inflation will drop to the forties in October, and possibly in September, with expectations that it will drop to less than 30% by the end of next year.

**No Increase in Minimum Wage, Says Labor Minister**
Despite President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's statement that there will be no increase in the minimum wage in 2024, millions of workers and opposition parties are demanding an increase. However, Labor and Social Security Minister Vedat Işıkhan and AK Party deputies continue to say that there will be no increase in the minimum wage in July. Işıkhan stated that there will be no increase in the minimum wage, citing positive indicators, and that they will determine the minimum wage in December. There will be no additional benefit for retirees. Minister of Finance Mehmet Şimşek stated that the minimum wage is not low and that demands for an increase in the minimum wage and retirement benefits are populist. According to Turkish Union of Labor (Türk-İş), the minimum wage is 17,000 TL, while the poverty line is 61,788 TL and the subsistence level is 18,969 TL.

**No Increase in Minimum Wage, Retirees to Wait Until End of Year**
The Minister of Labor announced that there will be no increase in the minimum wage and no additional allowance for retirees. Millions of workers and low-income retirees will have to wait until the end of the year without a salary increase. The government's 'price stability' target will lead to a worsening of the purchasing power of the poor. Despite the annual inflation rate exceeding 75%, the Minister stated that the minimum wage, which is 17,000 Turkish lira for 65% of workers, will not be increased, and there will be no additional allowance for retirees. According to the Central Bank's forecast, the minimum wage will decrease by an average of 1.7% per month, and by the end of the year, its purchasing power will be around 12,500 lira. The gap between the minimum wage and the poverty line will widen, and the purchasing power of the poor will continue to decline.

**Will the Minimum Wage Increase in July? Will Retirees Receive a Welfare Payment?**
The Turkish government is discussing the possibility of increasing the minimum wage and providing a welfare payment to retirees. Labor and Social Security Minister Vedat Işıkhan announced that there will be no increase in the minimum wage in July, citing positive indicators. He also stated that the goal is to provide long-term welfare, not temporary relief, and that the effects will be seen at the end of the year when inflation decreases. The minimum wage will be determined by a commission consisting of employer, employee, and government representatives, and the new minimum wage will be decided in January 2025. The commission is expected to start discussing the new minimum wage in December. In the absence of an increase, inflation is expected to decrease to a range of 35-40% annually, and the maximum increase in the minimum wage is expected to be around 35-40%. If the minimum wage is increased by 30%, those earning 17,200 TL would receive 22,102 TL, a 35% increase would bring it to 22,952 TL, and a 40% increase would bring it to 23,802 TL.

**Will There Be an Additional Increase in the Minimum Wage?**
The topic of minimum wage increase is still on the agenda in Turkey, affecting millions of workers. The government has made statements on the issue, with AK Party Deputy Chairman Hamza Dağ saying that there will be no process for a minimum wage increase in July. This suggests that the government is not currently considering an additional increase. Dağ also stated that the government's main goal is to reduce inflation. This implies that the priority of economic policies is price stability. The opposition and labor unions have responded to these statements, with CHP Deputy Chairman Yalçın Karatepe saying that the government has not made a clear decision on increasing the minimum wage. Turkish Labor Union President Ergün Atalay emphasized the need for improvement in the minimum wage, calling for the inflation to be stopped and the minimum wage to be increased. These statements reflect the expectations of the working class. The future scenarios and predictions for the minimum wage are uncertain, with different increase scenarios being discussed. If there is no additional increase, the current minimum wage of 17,002 TL will remain valid until the end of 2024. However, different increase scenarios are being discussed, including a 30% increase, which would raise the minimum wage to 22,102 TL, a 40% increase, which would raise it to 23,802 TL, and a 50% increase, which would raise it to 25,503 TL. These scenarios show the effects of possible increase rates. However, since there is no official announcement, these figures are only predictions. The minimum wage issue is at the intersection of economic conditions and policy decisions, and the government needs to balance its inflation-fighting target with the need to protect workers' purchasing power. It is expected that the discussions and statements on this topic will continue in the coming days.

**Minimum Wage Decrease: A Threat to Workers' Livelihood**
The minimum wage has decreased by approximately 4,000 TL since the beginning of the year, reaching 17,200 TL. With the minimum wage becoming almost the average salary, around 10 million workers are expected to face difficult times in the coming period. Despite this, the government and employers are resisting demands for a raise. The Turkish Union of Workers (Türk-İş) and the Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions (DİSK) are demanding a 25% increase in the minimum wage, while the Istanbul Workers' Unions Platform is planning a rally on June 26 to demand a raise. A survey by Eleman.net found that 82% of workers believe the minimum wage should be increased, while 52% said they would change jobs if there is no raise. Employers, on the other hand, are concerned about the impact on their businesses and are resisting the demands. Prof. Dr. Aziz Çelik warns that if the minimum wage is not increased by January 2025, there will be a significant loss of purchasing power. He also notes that the government's program is too rigid and that the minimum wage increase is not the cause of inflation.

If there is no increase in the minimum wage, the current wage will remain at 17,200 TL until the end of 2024.

**Is the minimum wage coming? Expert reveals...**
The minimum wage, which is expected to increase, has been announced by SGK Head İsa Karakaş. According to Karakaş, the increase will not be in July, but in September. With this increase, the minimum wage is expected to rise by 4,000 TL. The government had previously stated that the 49% increase in December 2023 was a one-time annual increase and did not expect another increase. However, due to high inflation and rising living costs, a new increase is expected. The purchasing power of minimum wage earners has significantly decreased since December, and the increase in food, rent, and other basic necessities has left them in a difficult situation. Karakaş stated that the planned increase in September will be an important step to alleviate the economic difficulties of minimum wage earners and improve their living standards.

**Will There Be an Increase in the Minimum Wage in 2024?**
The minimum wage increase scenario for 2024 is being discussed, with millions of minimum wage earners waiting for an increase. Although the government has announced that there will be no additional increase to the minimum wage, the expectation of an increase continues. The meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and CHP Chairman Özgür Özel has led to a decision to hold a meeting between Hazine and Maliye Minister Mehmet Şimşek and CHP's shadow cabinet member Yalçın Karatepe, responsible for Hazine and Maliye. The meeting will discuss the minimum wage increase and the pension bonus. Karatepe stated that 'the government aims to reduce the living standards of citizens to fight inflation. They say 'we will not increase the minimum wage, but we will limit the increase in pension benefits.' The non-increase in the minimum wage is seen as a tool to fight inflation. We will express our opposition to the austerity economic policies. We will say that the minimum wage should increase by at least the rate of inflation from July onwards. Today, the minimum wage is below the poverty line of 2,000 lira with May's data. We will say that it is not possible to live with the same minimum wage level for the rest of the year.' Karatepe also mentioned that 'the pension benefits should be increased by adding the inflation rate.' Will there be an increase in the minimum wage? It is certain that there will be no increase in the minimum wage in July. SGK Head İsa Karakaş announced that an increase of 4,000 TL is expected in September. Karakaş stated that 'the increase will be an important support for citizens who live on the minimum wage to alleviate their economic difficulties. Minimum wage earners who are struggling to make ends meet are negatively affected by the increase in prices of food, rent, and other basic necessities. The planned increase will provide a significant relief for minimum wage earners who are in a difficult situation.'

**Will the Minimum Wage Increase in September?**
Millions of minimum wage workers are eagerly waiting for a possible mid-year increase in July. Despite government announcements, living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult. According to Turk-İş, the minimum wage fell below the poverty line in the fourth month of the year. The inflation rate in May reached 75.45%. With declining purchasing power and rising inflation, not increasing the minimum wage would deepen economic inequality. In July, over 5 million civil servants and 16 million retirees will receive a 6-month inflation-based salary increase. The net rate of increase will be determined by the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) data in June. So far, the 5-month inflation difference has been announced as 22.72%. Considering the poverty and unemployment lines, a similar increase of 7.5 million minimum wage workers is being discussed. The average increase is expected to be around 20-25%. After a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and CHP leader Özgür Özel, the possibility of a mid-year increase in the minimum wage is being considered. The government is continuing to implement austerity policies to control inflation and is evaluating wage increases as one of the main causes of inflation. According to the Ministry of Finance, the target is to keep inflation at a single-digit level. The Central Bank's reports also suggest that there will be no mid-year increase in the minimum wage. The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, has repeatedly stated that there are no plans for a mid-year increase in the minimum wage. Finally, a decision was made at the AKP's Kızılcahamam camp that there will be no mid-year increase in the minimum wage.

**Minimum Wage Hike: What's Next?**
Millions of minimum wage earners are eagerly waiting for the possible increase in July. Despite government statements, living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult. In April, the minimum wage was below the poverty line. According to Turk-İş, the poverty line in April was 17,725 TL, while in May it increased to 18,969 TL. In May, inflation also reached its peak, with an annual inflation rate of 75.45%. Under these conditions, if there is no increase in the minimum wage, economic inequality may deepen. In July, a raise for civil servants and pensioners will be determined based on June's TÜFE data. So far, the 5-month inflation difference has been recorded as 22.72%. Meanwhile, a similar raise is being discussed for approximately 7.5 million minimum wage earners, with an average increase rate of 20-25% expected. CHP leader Özgür Özel's proposal has brought the minimum wage increase to the agenda. The topic was discussed with AKP Chairman and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and an optimistic approach was shown. However, Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek and Labor and Social Security Minister Vedat Işıkhan are taking limited approaches to wage increases within the framework of current economic targets. According to the Central Bank's reports, it is assumed that there will be no increase in the minimum wage, and steps are being taken towards the targets. Labor and Social Security Minister Vedat Işıkhan has repeatedly stated that there are no plans for a minimum wage increase. Finally, the AKP's Kızılcahamam camp concluded that there will be no increase in the minimum wage. Some sources suggest that there will be no increase in July, but a regulation may be made in September.

**Minimum Wage and Poverty Line: A Critical Situation**
The minimum wage and pensioners, who have limited income, have been affected by inflation. The minimum wage was increased by 49% at the beginning of the year to 17,002 TL. Although it was expected that there would be an interim increase in July due to the post-pandemic inflationary environment, the government closed the door after the increase at the beginning of the year. A significant data was announced after the meeting between President Erdoğan and CHP leader Özgür Özel, which will affect the interim increase. The Bureau of Labor Research (BESAR) announced that the poverty line for a four-person family has exceeded 25,000 TL. According to the report, a single person's living expenses are calculated as 30,211 TL. The critical data has left the minimum wage 8,000 TL behind. Despite the government's expectation of a decline in inflation from July, the increase in the poverty line has strengthened the expectation of an interim increase. Although the government has closed the door to interim increases in the minimum wage, Social Security Expert İsa Karakaş drew attention to the poverty line. Karakaş said, 'We won't make adjustments to the minimum wage, but only to the minimum wage earners. We will make adjustments to the minimum wage in September.'

**Asgari Ücrette Büyük Tehlike**
The Turkish government, which implemented minimum wage increases during the 2022 and 2023 election periods, has announced that it will not increase the minimum wage this year, citing the four-year period without elections. Despite the official inflation rate reaching 75.5% in June, the Minimum Wage Determination Commission has not been convened. The Turkish Confederation of Employers' Associations (TİSK) President Özgür Burak Akkol is also following the developments silently. The minimum wage increase has not been made and the expected inflation rate by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB) may lead to a decrease in all real wages. According to Turkish Confederation of Labor (Türk-İş), the monthly food expenditure for a family of four in Ankara has increased to 18,969.22 TL, exceeding the minimum wage of 17,200 TL. The total monthly expenditure for food, clothing, housing, transportation, education, health, and other necessary expenses has increased to 61,788.99 TL. Despite this critical situation, Türk-İş has not made any calls for a minimum wage increase. Turkish Confederation of Labor President Ergün Atalay has repeated the government's statement, saying 'You can fill the cup as much as you want, but there is no value left when the cup is empty.' The government plans to reduce all wages, including the minimum wage, to combat inflation, which will please the employers who are uneasy about high credit interest rates and the flat currency. If the minimum wage is not increased this year and the expected inflation rate is achieved, the minimum wage will be 17,200 TL in 2024 and 19,382 TL in 2025.

**Will the Minimum Wage Increase? How is the Process Working?**
The minimum wage in Turkey is determined by negotiations between workers, employers, and the government. The minimum wage is currently being reviewed, and a possible increase of 25-26% is expected. The inflation rate is expected to be around 25-26% in June, and the minimum wage may increase accordingly. However, the Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, has announced that there will be no increase in the minimum wage this year. In the absence of an increase, the inflation rate is expected to drop to 35-40% annually, and the maximum increase in the minimum wage is expected to be around 35-40%. This would result in a minimum wage of around 22,102-23,802 lira. For the next year, minimum wage earners are expected to receive an increase of 15-20% based on inflation estimates, bringing their average salary to around 26,400 lira by 2027.
