Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timeline: We're looking at a prediction window until September 30, 2024 - about 2 months from now.

2. Key criteria:
- Must involve >100 Venezuelan troops
- Must be on Guyanese territory (as of Oct 2023 borders)
- Must be ordered by Venezuelan government
- Must be without Guyana's permission
- Must be confirmed by either Venezuela or 2 UNSC permanent members

3. Context analysis:
- Venezuela has historical claims to Guyana's Essequibo region
- Recent tensions have increased over oil discoveries
- December 2023 referendum showed Venezuelan popular support for claiming the region
- International pressure and mediation efforts have helped maintain stability
- Both countries agreed to avoid force in St. Vincent declaration

4. Risk factors:
- Short timeframe (2 months) reduces likelihood
- Recent diplomatic efforts decrease probability
- Venezuela's military capabilities and internal issues make large operations challenging
- International community strongly opposes military action

5. Mitigating factors:
- Maduro regime could use external conflict to distract from internal problems
- Oil resources make territory more valuable
- Venezuela has shown increasing assertiveness

Given the short timeframe, recent diplomatic progress, and international deterrence, but accounting for continued tensions and potential for rapid escalation:

My Prediction: Between 2.50% and 7.50%, with 4.25% being the most likely. Probability: 4.25%.
