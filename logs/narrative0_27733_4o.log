*The studio is bustling with activity. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the anticipation was high, but here we are. Will there be a US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris held on September 10, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 32.75%. The signs were there—Trump's history of skipping debates and the recent disputes over the rules.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, despite the last-minute agreement, the probability was never strong. The August 28th news cut-off limited our data, but the models were clear.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It's a reminder of how volatile political events can be. Even with all the data, some outcomes are just improbable.

*They nod in agreement, the buzz of the newsroom continuing around them.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a news desk, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, did the debate happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.42%. Trump’s history of skipping debates and his recent social media posts were key indicators.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Despite the scheduled event and Harris’s willingness, Trump's agreement seemed shaky. The microphone dispute didn't help.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models accounted for the unpredictability factor. The 2020 and 2016 cancellations were significant precedents.

**NATE SILVER:** With the debate off, how does this impact the campaigns?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It reshapes strategies. Harris loses a platform to challenge Trump directly, while Trump avoids potential pitfalls.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. As always, the models reflect reality.

*They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**FADE OUT.**

**Nate Silver**: Well, Philip, the much-anticipated showdown between Trump and Harris didn't happen last night.

**Philip Tetlock**: Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.42% probability. The signs were there—Trump's history of skipping debates and the microphone disputes.

**Nate Silver**: Right. The last-minute social media posts were classic Trump, but not enough to sway our predictions.

**Philip Tetlock**: Harris's commitment was clear, but the lack of consensus on rules was a big red flag. 

**Nate Silver**: So, we were spot on. No debate on September 10th.

**Philip Tetlock**: Yes, and it seems the political landscape remains as unpredictable as ever.

*They both nod, understanding the complexities of forecasting in such turbulent times.*

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered before them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, about last night's anticipated debate between Trump and Harris—did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the agreement Trump announced, his history of cancellations was a red flag.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The microphone dispute and his social media outbursts hinted at instability. Harris was ready, but Trump's unpredictability prevailed.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Our models factored in past behavior and recent tensions with ABC. The probability of a debate was always low.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how predictive analytics can foresee even the most volatile political events. Let's see how this impacts the campaigns moving forward.

*They exchange knowing glances, nodding in agreement.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The road to November will be quite the spectacle.

Well, Philip, the debate between Trump and Harris was the talk of the town—though not for the reasons ABC hoped.
