Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, September 28, 2024]

NATE SILVER: (looking at data screens) Well, Phil, our models nailed it again.

PHILIP TETLOCK: Indeed. With Starmer's rocky start handling the cost-of-living crisis and that NHS workers' strike in August, it was clear which way the winds were blowing.

NATE: Our models had it at 82.45%. The public's honeymoon period with Labour was destined to be brief.

PHILIP: (nodding) The Reform UK's surge in local by-elections didn't help. And that leaked memo about potential tax hikes...

NATE: Classic case of high expectations meeting harsh reality. When you promise "national renewal" but inherit an economy in shambles...

PHILIP: The approval rating falling below 60 was practically inevitable. Though I must say, seeing it drop to 48% was even more dramatic than expected.

NATE: (smirking) The numbers don't lie, Phil. They never do.

INT. LONDON THINK TANK - SEPTEMBER 19, 2024 - MORNING

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in leather chairs, reviewing data on their tablets. Morning light streams through windows overlooking the Thames.

TETLOCK
(sipping tea)
Well, our models were spot on again. Had Starmer's approval at 42.15%.

SILVER
Not surprising. The honeymoon period was brief. That Reform UK surge in the polls really hurt him.

TETLOCK
The cost-of-living crisis and NHS waiting times didn't help. Even with Labour's majority, he couldn't deliver quick enough on those campaign promises.

SILVER
(nodding)
The public's expectations were sky-high after that landslide. But governing during an economic downturn...

TETLOCK
At least he's still doing better than his predecessor. Though that's a low bar.

They share a knowing laugh as they turn back to their data screens.

FADE OUT.

INT. CAFE - SEPTEMBER 28, 2024 - MORNING

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, newspapers scattered around them.

NATE
(sipping coffee)
Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. Had Starmer's approval at 47.23%.

PHILIP
The signs were there in August. That Reform UK surge really hurt him. The promises of "national renewal" couldn't overcome the economic reality.

NATE
The lowest turnout in decades should've been our first clue. Hard to maintain high approval when you're governing with such a fragmented mandate.

PHILIP
(picking up newspaper)
Look at this headline from mid-August: "PM Starmer Faces Backlash Over Immigration Policy." Our models caught that downward trend early.

NATE
Even with Labour's parliamentary majority, public sentiment was clear. Below 60% approval was practically inevitable.

PHILIP
Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the least surprising.
