INT. STRATEGY ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, papers and laptops scattered. The air is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
As of yesterday, Korenevo remains under Russian control. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the August advances and the strategic importance of the region, it seemed plausible. But the Russian defenses held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The destruction of bridges in Tetkino and the heavy artillery around Korenevo played a critical role.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And the situation near the Kursk Nuclear Plant added another layer of complexity.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. Our models accounted for these variables, but the probability never exceeded 20%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The Ukrainian forces made significant progress, but the odds were always against a full capture by October.

They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions, as the scene fades.

Yesterday, we confirmed that Ukrainian forces have not captured Korenevo.

Our models had it at 15.25%. The August incursions made significant progress, but the resistance was stronger than anticipated.

SUPERFORECASTER C, an expert in geopolitical dynamics, nods thoughtfully.

SUPERFORECASTER C  
The destruction of bridges in Tetkino and the defensive measures near the Kursk Nuclear Plant were pivotal.

SUPERFORECASTER A

The team exchanges determined glances, aware that their work is far from over. The screen flickers, highlighting the contested regions.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
Let’s update our models. The next few months could change everything.

The August advances in Kursk Oblast were promising, but the Russian countermeasures in Korenevo and the surrounding areas were formidable.
