**Mass Production of iPhone SE 4 to Start in October, Budget Model Delayed Until January 2025**
Apple plans to start mass production of iPhone SE 4 in October 2024, but the budget model may not be available until January 2025. The company aims to prevent the threat to the sales of the latest iPhone model by delaying the release of the budget version. The iPhone SE 4 will have a new design and improved internal components, including a processor A18 SoC, OLED screen, Face ID support, and USB-C port. However, to reduce costs, Apple will only install one camera on the rear and front panels. The report also mentions other changes in the iPhone family, including internal changes to prevent overheating, and a foldable iPhone, which is expected to be released in 2026. Apple also plans to use 48-megapixel sensors from Samsung in iPhone 18 and subsequent models, breaking Sony's monopoly in this area.

**Apple to Significantly Expand Vision Pro Content Library**
Apple has announced plans to significantly expand the library of content for its new product Vision Pro. Starting with the Boundless video, users will have access to over a dozen new immersive video clips. This decision is a response to user criticism about the lack of content after the launch of Vision Pro in February this year. The Boundless video allows viewers to take a virtual walk on an air balloon above breathtaking landscapes. In the fall, the Arctic Surfing video will be released, which will send viewers on a cold adventure. The Elevated series will premiere in September, with the first episode dedicated to traveling over Hawaii. In October, another episode of Wild Life, dedicated to elephants, is expected to be released. Additionally, by the end of the year, users can expect the release of various content, including Red Bull's Big-Wave Surfing, a musical experience with The Weeknd, and a look inside the 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend. Furthermore, the library will feature the action-packed Submerged, set on a World War II-era submarine.

**Apple May Launch New iPad Models Before the End of the Year**
Apple has not yet announced the release of new iPad models, but a report from Digital Trend suggests that the company may launch more iPad devices before the end of the year. The report is based on some backend codes that were discovered recently, which suggest that Apple is working on four new iPad models. The codes were found by Nicolás Álvarez and published on X. The new iPad models are expected to feature the A16 chip, while the iPad mini may feature the A17 chip. The report also suggests that the new iPad mini may feature the M2 chip instead of the A17 chip, which is used in the iPad Air (2024). The codes also indicate that Apple may discontinue some iPad models, including the iPad (11th generation) and the iPad Pro M3. The report suggests that Apple may launch new iPad models in October, after the announcement of the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to happen in September.

**Apple Intelligence Delayed: No Longer Expected to Launch with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18**
Apple Intelligence, a new feature announced this year, is expected to be delayed and will not be released with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. According to Bloomberg, insiders familiar with Apple have stated that Apple Intelligence will miss its original September launch date. Mark Gurman, a well-known and reliable leaker, first announced the existence of Apple Intelligence before its official announcement. Apple is concerned about the stability of its AI assistant and is asking developers to test the feature and find any errors, which will take several weeks, pushing the release date to October 2024. This means that Apple Intelligence will not meet its original launch date alongside iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. Apple has treated iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence as two separate technologies since its debut at WWDC in June 2024. The delay may mean that the first deliveries of the next iPhone 16 models will come with iOS 18 but without Apple Intelligence. This will need to be confirmed in the coming weeks.

**Apple will reportedly release artificial intelligence features in October, weeks after iOS 18 update**
Apple's artificial intelligence features, announced during WWDC2024, will be released in October, delayed from the initial iOS 18 update. The delay is due to concerns over stability and the need for wider testing. The features will be available on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer, and will include ChatGPT integration, Siri improvements, and other capabilities such as proofreading, custom emojis, and summarizing phone calls. Developers will have early access to the features in the iOS 18.1 beta this week.

**iPhone 16 series may miss out on Apple's ‘big AI announcement' at launch**
Apple's highly anticipated AI features, Apple Intelligence, will be delayed until October, missing the initial launch of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 in September. The new iPhone 16 models were expected to leverage these AI features as a key selling point. According to Mark Gurman, Apple plans to introduce Apple Intelligence through software updates by October, with some features missing from the initial release. The complete set of Apple Intelligence features is expected to roll out gradually through multiple updates to iOS 18 from late 2024 through the first half of 2025.

Apple's highly anticipated AI features, Apple Intelligence, will be delayed until October, missing the initial launch of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 in September. The new iPhone 16 models were expected to leverage these AI features as a key selling point, but the delay means that the first iPhone 16 models shipped to consumers may lack the new AI features, requiring a software update weeks after purchase. Apple Intelligence encompasses a range of capabilities, including enhanced notification prioritisation, web page and voice note summaries, improved writing tools, a revamped Siri, and integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The complete set of Apple Intelligence features is expected to roll out gradually through multiple updates to iOS 18 from late 2024 through the first half of 2025.

**Apple Intelligence: Delayed Launch for Bug Fixes and Future Updates**
Apple has announced its generative artificial intelligence platform, Apple Intelligence, during the World Wide Developer Conference 2024 in June. Initially, the company stated that Apple Intelligence would be available for the launch of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, scheduled for autumn. However, according to Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, Apple Intelligence will not be launched with the new OS during the September event. This means that people who buy the next iPhone 16 models will not have access to Apple Intelligence immediately. Instead, the report states that the AI platform will be part of the first major update for iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, which is expected to be available for supported iPhone and iPad users in October. The delay in the release of the AI platform is due to Apple's desire to eliminate new bugs before the public launch. Apple Intelligence will not be fully functional when it is initially released in October, but new features will be added between the end of 2024 and 2025, including an important update to the digital voice assistant Siri.

**Gurman: iOS 18.1 beta with Apple Intelligence launching as soon as this week**
According to Mark Gurman from Bloomberg, Apple will delay the release of Apple Intelligence features until iOS 18.1, which is expected to be released in October. A developer beta with some features will be available as soon as this week. However, some features like the new Siri are not expected until next Spring. This means that iPhone 16 models will not have Apple Intelligence features at launch in September, but they will be available a few weeks later. Apple's strategy this year is unusual, as they usually don't release developer betas for upcoming versions before the final release of the prior version.

**iPhone SE 4: Mass Production to Start in October 2024, Release in January 2025**
According to a report from The Information, Apple's suppliers are planning to start mass production of the iPhone SE 4 in October 2024. The device is expected to be released in January 2025, rather than alongside the iPhone 16 series in September. The iPhone SE 4 is expected to have a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a physical button, and a USB-C port. The design is likely to be similar to the iPhone 14 base model, but with a single rear camera and possibly sharing the same rear panel production process as the iPhone 16. The reason for the change in strategy is unknown, but it's possible that Apple is adopting its latest rear panel production process for the SE model to take advantage of economies of scale in production, given that iPhone 14 production is nearing its end.

**New iPads Flee, Including Two That Will Arrive Soon**
Apple may be releasing new iPad models, including two that will arrive soon. A recently discovered backend code may have revealed several iPad models coming from Apple. The code, found by Nicolás Álvarez and published by Aaronp613 on X, lists four iPad models. The code suggests that the new iPad (11th generation) will have an A16 processor, while the iPad mini (7th generation) may have an A17 processor. The new Apple Intelligence features require a processor A17 Bionic or newer, so it would be logical for the new iPad mini to have at least this processor to support the new technology. However, the next iPad mini may instead have an M2 processor, present in the iPad Air (2024). The code also mentions tablets that Apple has likely decided to discontinue, including an updated standard iPad that goes beyond the recently discontinued (9th generation) and an iPad Pro M3. The current iPad was introduced in October 2022, while the last iPad mini was unveiled in October 2021. If Apple decides to release new versions of these models, it will likely happen in October, following the announcement of the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to take place in September.
