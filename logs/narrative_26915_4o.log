A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a digital display, sipping coffee. The screen shows Kamala Harris's net favorability rating: -7.5.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smugly)  
Our models had it at 73.25%. Harris's favorability nudged up slightly.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Trump's recent controversies didn't help him. Harris's campaign capitalized on Biden's withdrawal smoothly.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(leaning back)  
The media's focus on Harris's policies over Biden's fitness was a game-changer.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how public perception shifted post-August. The debates really swung her numbers.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. Our models were spot on, as always. The data never lies.

They all chuckle, the tension of the past months finally dissipating.

FADE OUT.
