**NATE SILVER:** So, "Woman's World" by Katy Perry didn't quite make it, huh?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 23.45%. The song peaked at 42nd on the Billboard Hot 100.

**NATE SILVER:** Despite the buzz around Kamala Harris using it in her campaign?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The initial flop was hard to overcome. The "girl boss" vibe didn't resonate as expected.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how cultural moments can shift expectations but not always outcomes.
