Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, another fascinating quarter for Starship launches. Our models were spot-on again."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at what we knew in July, with just the IFT-3 success and Musk's ambitious tweet about six more launches, our models had it at 23.45%."

Nate: "The technical challenges were just too significant for two successful launches in that timeframe. Even with the March success reaching 234 kilometers, the rapid iteration needed for multiple launches was optimistic."

Philip: "Exactly. The regulatory hurdles and the complexity of getting these massive vehicles past 160 kilometers... our models factored in SpaceX's impressive track record but also their realistic development timeline."

Nate: "And here we are, October 2nd, and history has proven our probability assessment correct once again."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at what we knew in July, with just the IFT-3 success and Musk's ambitious tweet about six more launches, our models had it at 23.45%."

Nate: "The technical challenges were just too significant for SpaceX's aggressive timeline. Even with their March success reaching 234 kilometers, scaling up to multiple launches in such a short window was optimistic."

Philip: "Exactly. The regulatory hurdles alone were substantial. And while our models incorporated Musk's typical optimism factor, the historical data suggested two successful launches reaching 160 kilometers in that specific window was unlikely."

Nate: "And here we are, proven right again. Sometimes the most valuable forecasts are knowing what won't happen."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at what we knew in July, with just the IFT-3 success and Musk's ambitious tweet about six more launches, our models had it at 12.35%."

Nate: "The technical challenges were just too significant. Even with the March success reaching 234 kilometers, the rapid launch cadence needed for exactly two successful flights in that window was improbable."

Philip: "Exactly. The combination of regulatory hurdles, technical complexities, and SpaceX's history of launch delays made three launches too ambitious and one launch too conservative. Getting exactly two to 160 kilometers was a precise target."

Nate: *nodding* "And here we are, October 2nd, confirming what our models predicted. The probability was low, but not negligible."
