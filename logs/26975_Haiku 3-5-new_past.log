Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Resolution Criteria Analysis:
- Specific timeframe: Before September 17, 2024
- Must be after August 5, 2024
- Must be an actual reduction in federal funds rate upper limit

Evidence Analysis:
Strong Arguments FOR Emergency Rate Cut:
1. Multiple economists calling for cut (Jeremy Siegel, Paul Krugman)
2. Weak jobs report (114,000 jobs vs expectations)
3. Stock market volatility
4. Bank of America economists say September cut is "virtual lock"
5. Market pricing 50-84% probability of September cut

Arguments AGAINST Emergency Rate Cut:
1. Fed traditionally hesitant about inter-meeting cuts
2. Austan Goolsbee urging caution
3. Stock market still positive year-to-date
4. Unemployment still at 4.3%
5. Potential political sensitivity near election

Historical Context:
- Fed has made 11 emergency meetings in 30 years
- Last emergency cut was March 2020 (COVID)
- Typically requires significant economic/financial stress

Probability Calculation:
Base rate: Low (historically rare)
Current evidence: Moderate pressure
Adjustment: Slightly higher probability

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.75%, but 24.30% being the most likely. Probability: 24.30%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Resolution Criteria Key Points:
- Must be a rate cut before September 17, 2024
- Cut must occur after August 5, 2024
- Must reduce upper limit of federal funds rate target range

Base Rate Analysis:
- Fed has made emergency inter-meeting rate cuts 9 times in 30 years
- Typically reserved for extreme situations (pandemic, financial crisis, 9/11)
- Last emergency cut was March 2020 during COVID-19

Current Context Evidence:
Supportive of Emergency Cut:
- Weak July jobs report (114,000 vs expectations)
- Rising recession fears
- Stock market volatility
- Some economists (Siegel, Krugman) calling for urgent cut
- Bank of America sees September cut as "virtual lock"

Against Emergency Cut:
- Fed officials (Goolsbee) urging caution
- Stock market still positive year-to-date
- Unemployment at 4.3% not catastrophic
- Fed prefers scheduled meetings
- Risk of seeming panicked

Market Expectations:
- Initial 60% chance of emergency cut, now down to ~30%
- ~95% probability of 50bp cut in September

Balancing Considerations:
- High bar for emergency action
- But growing economic uncertainty
- Political sensitivity near election

Probability Assessment:
- Base rate of emergency cuts: ~3-5% historically
- Current conditions slightly elevate probability
- But still requires extraordinary circumstances

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 27.50%, but 19.75% being the most likely. Probability: 19.75%.

- Last emergency cut was during COVID in March 2020
- Historically rare to cut between scheduled meetings

4. Fed's Stated Position:
- Powell signaled potential September cut

Calibration of Probability:
- Base rate of emergency cuts: Very low (<10%)
- Current unique circumstances: Slightly elevated probability
- Political sensitivity around presidential election year

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 27.50%, but 18.75% being the most likely. Probability: 18.75%.
