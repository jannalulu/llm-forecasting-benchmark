Tetlock: [removing his glasses] "Well, Nate, our models were spot on again about Seattle's air quality this summer."

Silver: "Yes, our 65.3% probability for exactly one bad air day proved accurate. That July 5th spike to 166 AQI ended up being the only occurrence."

Tetlock: "Interesting how the models incorporated that early July smoke event. The relatively mild fire season in the Pacific Northwest and the unusually wet August and September really played out as our algorithms suggested."

Silver: "The historical pattern of the last decade showed high variability, from zero to eleven bad air days. But the early monsoon patterns we saw in the forecast data by August 1st strongly suggested limited fire activity for the remainder of the quarter."

Tetlock: "Another win for superforecasting. Shall we tackle tomorrow's predictions?"

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models nailed it again. One day above 150 AQI in Seattle's third quarter, exactly as predicted."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 72.3%. The July 5th spike to 166 turned out to be the only significant event. Looking back, the early July data was crucial."

Nate: "The historical pattern suggested multiple bad air days were possible - I mean, look at 2022 with eleven days. But the unusually wet summer this year really suppressed the wildfire risk."

Philip: "What's fascinating is how our models incorporated that El Niño weather pattern data by August 1st. The wetter-than-usual conditions in the Pacific Northwest significantly reduced the probability of additional smoke events."

Nate: "Another win for probabilistic forecasting."

[Both nod, satisfied with their prediction]

Silver: "Yes, our forecast gave it a 72.3% probability of exactly one bad air day in Q3, and that's precisely what happened. That July 5th spike to 166 AQI was the only occurrence."

Tetlock: "The historical pattern suggested multiple days were possible, but the unusually wet summer and early fall rains really helped contain the wildfire risk. Looking back at our July analysis, we correctly weighted the El Niño weather pattern's impact."

Phil: [nodding] "Yes, our models had it at 52.3%. The early July smoke event from that small wildfire near Mount Rainier was concerning, but the unusually wet August and September really helped keep additional fires at bay."

Nate: "Fascinating how the La Niña conditions this year created such a different pattern from previous years. Looking at the historical data from 2014-2023, having exactly one bad air day is relatively rare."

Phil: "Indeed. The wetter-than-average summer in the Pacific Northwest was the key factor our models caught. Though we had that early July spike to 166 AQI, the rest of the quarter stayed remarkably clean."

NATE
(looking at charts)
Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. We predicted exactly one bad air quality day for Seattle's Q3, and that's precisely what happened - July 5th with an AQI of 166.

PHILIP
Yes, our models had it at 52.3%. The key factors were the unusually wet summer and the successful wildfire prevention measures in Washington state. Looking back at that July data we had, the conditions just weren't right for multiple smoke events like in 2022.

NATE
The historical pattern suggested multiple days were possible, but the early monsoon season in California really helped keep the smoke away from the Pacific Northwest.
