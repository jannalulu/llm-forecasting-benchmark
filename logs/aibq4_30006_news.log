Several ski resorts in Colorado are opening quickly due to a multi-day snowstorm. Eldora Resort opened on Thursday, while Breckenridge, Winter Park, and Copper Mountain opened on Friday. Loveland Ski Area opened today. Wolf Creek has the best base depths at nearly 3 feet, with 95% of its terrain open. Conditions are early season thin at other resorts, but the recent storm has improved conditions significantly. 'I would not call conditions for them at this point early season,' said the report. 'Those base depths plus the recent new powder are solid conditions we'd hope to see in late December at other locations.' Light snow will wrap up on Saturday afternoon, with clear and cold conditions on Sunday, making it the pick of the weekend.

**Will multiple systems allow B.C. ski resorts to open early?**
An active weather pattern is expected to bring favorable conditions to British Columbia's ski resorts, potentially allowing them to open early. Multiple systems are forecasted to sweep through the region, bringing abundant moisture and snow to the alpine areas. This year's conditions could be similar to those in 2022, when resorts like SilverStar opened earlier than expected. Whistler Mountain Resort has already received 38 cm of snow in the past 7 days, with similar totals at Revelstoke. The tentative opening dates for Whistler, Big White, and Revelstoke are Nov. 22, Nov. 28, and Nov. 30, respectively, while Kicking Horse is scheduled to open on Dec. 6. As one observer noted, 'This year could echo the conditions we saw back in 2022 as several systems are on track to bring abundant moisture to the region.'

**Ski Resorts in Bavaria Prepare for the Upcoming Season**
The ski season is approaching in and around Munich, with many ski resorts preparing for the upcoming season. The Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain, plans to open on November 29, 2024, while Brauneck and other resorts are set to open on November 30, 2024. However, these dates are weather-dependent and may be postponed if conditions are unfavorable. The 'Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau' will open on December 6, with the 'Garmisch-Classic' following in mid-to-late December, depending on the weather and snow conditions. Many ski resorts are investing in artificial snowmaking to ensure a successful season, with Brauneck's Antonia Asenstorfer saying, 'We are well-prepared, thanks to our powerful technical snowmaking equipment.' The Alpbachtal Wildschönau has invested 1.5 million euros in new snowmaking equipment, which has increased efficiency by 20% and reduced energy consumption. However, some resorts, like the Zugspitze, rely solely on natural snow, while others, like the 'Garmisch-Classic', are limited by the volume of their snow storage lakes.

**Snowmass Ski Resort's Lynn Britt Cabin to reopen**
Snowmass Ski Resort's Lynn Britt Cabin, also known as 'The Cabin,' is set to reopen in December after a summer-long renovation. The renovation increased the deck capacity from 115 to 260 guests, supporting 200 outdoors and 60 indoors. According to Aspen Snowmass, Snowmass lacks a total of 460 to 650 seats to meet the increased on-mountain dining demand. The Cabin's increased capacity will better disperse the high volume of dining guests across the mountain, as stated in the Snowmass 2022 master Development Plan. The renovated Cabin will offer creative comfort food and European-inspired dishes, and will feature live entertainment, aprés parties, and snowcat dinners. 'The project has been approved as construction has been happening all summer and it is set to open in December,' said SkiCo Director of Communications Hannah Dixon. 'The planned changes to The Lynn Britt Cabin and the Spider Sabich Picnic/Race Arena areas will increase utilization of those areas, taking pressure off of other restaurants,' SkiCo wrote in the plan.

**California ski season: What’s new at Tahoe, Mammoth for winter 2024-25**
California mountain resorts are gearing up for the 2024-25 ski season with improved snowmaking and grooming, as well as new pass options, lesson programs, and special events. According to Mike Reitzell, head of the nonprofit Ski California group, last year's warm weather was a challenge, but good storms in February and March saved the season. This year, resorts hope to open between late November and early December. Palisades (formerly Squaw Valley) is celebrating its 75th anniversary, while Boreal and Mt. Rose mark their 60th seasons. New developments include the ASC XC Training Center, offering Alpine, Nordic, biathlon, and snowboarding programs, and Bear Valley Mountain Resort, which has new ownership, two new lifts, revamped food service, and improved grooming.

**Deux Alpes Ski Resort to Stay Open Until July 2025**
The Deux Alpes ski resort in Isère plans to keep its slopes open to the public until July 2025, a bold move by the resort's management. This decision comes as other ski resorts are hesitant to open their slopes to the public during the summer months. The resort's director, Fabrice Boutet, explains, 'We notice that tourists no longer come in the spring. It's up to us to regain the attractiveness of the mountains.' The resort will keep most of its slopes open until the summer, and Boutet assures that there is no reason to delay the opening of the slopes in December, as the high-altitude sectors already have snow in November. The resort plans to open its slopes on November 30, 2024, in time for the Christmas holidays.

**Ski season has officially started: First US ski resort is now open**
The 2024-2025 ski season has officially started with the opening of Ski Ward in Massachusetts on October 19, but it's not the first resort to offer a full mountain experience. Wolf Creek Ski Area in Colorado is the first larger resort to open with chairlift service seven days a week, on October 22, after receiving 26 inches of total snow. The early season is not beginner-friendly due to limited terrain, but many other resorts in the west are expected to open soon, with Keystone and Arapahoe Basin aiming to open sooner rather than later. Breckenridge, Brian Head, and Copper Mountain have announced an opening date of November 8, while Vail, Mammoth, Winter Park, and others plan to open by mid-November. On the East Coast, ski resorts are expected to open in mid-November or December. Season passes are now available, with prices ranging from $100 to $300 per day, and discounted ski days can be obtained through 'ski passport' programs for children in certain grades.
