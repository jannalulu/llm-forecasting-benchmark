Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Historical Patterns & Base Rates:
- Multiple news articles suggest numerous world records are expected to be broken across different sports
- World records are increasingly being broken as training, technology, and athlete performance continue to improve

2. Specific Events with High Probability of Records:
Swimming:
- Léon Marchand in 400m individual medley
- Kaylee McKeown in multiple events
- Mollie O'Callaghan in 200m freestyle

Athletics:
- Armand Duplantis in pole vault (consistently breaking his own records)
- Sydney McLaughlin in 400m hurdles
- Noah Lyles targeting sprinting records
- Yaroslava Mahuchikh in high jump

Sport Climbing:
- Multiple records expected in speed climbing according to news sources

3. Favorable Factors:
- Home crowd advantage for some athletes
- Modern facilities and conditions
- Multiple opportunities in heats/finals to break records
- Strong competition pushing athletes to peak performance

4. Limiting Factors:
- Weather conditions could affect outdoor events
- Pressure of Olympics can affect performance
- Some current records are particularly challenging
- Anti-doping measures may limit performance enhancement

5. Specific Evidence:
- Multiple athletes are currently in peak form
- Recent competitions show record-breaking trends
- Several athletes have explicitly stated their aims to break records

Given the numerous specific events where records are likely to be broken, the strong current form of multiple athletes, and the historical trend of records being broken at Olympics, but also accounting for the pressure and unpredictability of the Olympic environment, I can make a reasoned forecast.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 78.40%, with 71.80% being the most likely. Probability: 71.80%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Looking at historical patterns and base rates:
- News articles mention multiple potential world records across different sports
- Swimming and athletics appear to be the main sources of potential records
- Speed climbing is specifically mentioned as likely to see records broken

2. Specific records likely to be broken:
Swimming:
- Léon Marchand in 400m medley
- Multiple opportunities in freestyle events
- Kaylee McKeown in backstroke events

Athletics:
- Armand Duplantis in pole vault
- Sydney McLaughlin in 400m hurdles
- Noah Lyles targeting sprint records
- Yaroslava Mahuchikh in high jump

Speed Climbing:
- Multiple records expected in speed climbing according to articles

3. Favorable factors:
- Home crowd advantage for some athletes
- New facilities and technology
- Strong competition in multiple events
- Multiple attempts possible in qualifying rounds and finals

4. Limiting factors:
- Pressure of Olympic environment
- Weather conditions could affect outdoor events
- Some records are very longstanding and difficult to break

5. Quantitative analysis:
- Articles specifically identify 15-20 high-probability record attempts
- Additional records often come from unexpected performances
- Multiple opportunities in qualifying rounds and finals
- Historical pattern suggests 20-30 records at major Olympics

Given the specific mentions of multiple likely records across swimming, athletics, and speed climbing, plus the possibility of unexpected records, and considering the multiple opportunities in qualifying rounds and finals, there appears to be a strong likelihood of reaching 24 records.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.80%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Tokyo 2020 Olympics saw 22 world records broken
- Rio 2016 Olympics saw 19 world records broken
- London 2012 Olympics saw 25 world records broken

Evidence for Higher Number (≥24):
1. Multiple news articles identify specific records likely to be broken:
- Swimming: Multiple records expected in freestyle events
- Athletics: Records expected in pole vault (Duplantis), women's 400m hurdles (McLaughlin-Levrone), women's 200m
- Sport Climbing: Speed climbing records "have not stopped falling recently"
- Several athletes like Marchand, Titmus, O'Callaghan specifically targeting records
2. Technological advances in equipment and training
3. Post-pandemic return to full training capacity
4. Home advantage for European athletes

Evidence for Lower Number (<24):
1. Recent records are getting harder to break
2. Anti-doping efforts are more stringent (mentioned in articles about 1000+ testing agents)
3. Some sports like rowing don't count for world records
4. Weather conditions in Paris could be challenging
5. High pressure of Olympics can affect performance
6. Many predictions in articles are optimistic but not all materialize

Key Considerations:
- Multiple articles consistently mention 5-6 "likely" record breaks
- Speed climbing alone could contribute multiple records
- Swimming traditionally produces multiple records
- Athletics has several strong candidates

Given the base rate and the evidence presented, breaking 24 records would be above historical average but appears achievable given the specific opportunities identified.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%
