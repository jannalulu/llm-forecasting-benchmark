There has been a resurgence of measles cases in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, with over 150 cases reported since September 2023, compared to only one case in 2021 and one case in 2022.

The ARS is urging people born after 1980 to check their vaccination status and be vigilant for symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also sounded the alarm, warning that the number of measles cases in Europe could exceed the high threshold of 2023.

**Measles Cases Increase in Europe, WHO and UNICEF Warn of Devastating Impact**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, there has been an increase in measles cases in Europe. In the first three months of 2024, 45 countries in the WHO European Region reported 56,634 measles cases and 4 deaths. In 2023, 41 countries reported 61,070 cases and 13 deaths. The report highlights the devastating impact of measles on children's health, with serious complications being more common in young children. The report also emphasizes the need for urgent action, stating that even a single measles case is a call to action. The WHO European Region Director, Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge, emphasized that the majority of reported cases in 2023 were in children under the age of five, which reflects the accumulation of missed routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the slow improvement in vaccination coverage in 2021. The report also notes that there were over 300,000 measles cases worldwide in 2023. It is emphasized that unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals are at high risk of contracting the virus, and that countries without measles cases should take proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The report concludes that countries with ongoing outbreaks should continue to vaccinate all vulnerable individuals, intensify case detection and contact tracing, and identify vaccination gaps to prevent future outbreaks.

**Measles Returns to Italy, Says Bassetti: 'The Problem is Not the Obligation, But the Lack of Enforcement'**
According to Matteo Bassetti, director of Infectious Diseases at the Policlinico San Martino hospital in Genoa, measles has returned to being a problem in Italy. The numbers show that cases have increased from May to June, with over 700 cases reported in the first six months of 2024, a 10-15 fold increase compared to 2023. Bassetti notes that most of those affected are unvaccinated individuals, which suggests that something is not working in the country, as some regions have not reached the 95% vaccination coverage rate. He proposes that instead of removing the vaccination obligation and replacing it with a recommendation, the law should be enforced more strictly to improve coverage. Bassetti emphasizes that children's health should be protected by a strong national healthcare system, not by individual parents' intelligence or decisions.

Of these, 2,755 (40.9%) were under the age of five, and 2,044 (30.3%) were 15 years or older. The highest notification rates were observed in infants under one year (186.5 cases per million) and children aged 1-4 years (119.7 cases per million). Of the 5,649 cases with known age and vaccination status, 4,887 (86.5%) were not vaccinated, 427 (7.6%) were vaccinated with one dose of vaccine containing measles, 308 (5.5%) were vaccinated with two or more doses, and 18 (0.3%) were vaccinated with an unknown number of doses. Four deaths (0.1%) attributed to measles were reported to the ECDC during the 12-month period from Romania (three) and Ireland (one).
