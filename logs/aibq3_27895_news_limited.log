**Mandato de Alexandre de Moraes no STF vai até 2043**
Minister Alexandre de Moraes, of the Supreme Court of Brazil, has 19 years left in his position, as per the Constitution, which states that judges must retire compulsorily at the age of 75. Moraes, who is currently 55 years old, will have to leave the STF in December 2043, when he reaches the age limit. He has over 7,000 days left as a magistrate of the Supreme Court. Moraes was appointed by former President Michel Temer in 2017, and has been a key figure in several high-profile cases, including the decision to order Elon Musk to appoint a new representative for Twitter in Brazil within 24 hours, under penalty of suspending the social media platform. According to Moraes, he took 'measures against the platform after successive non-compliance with judicial decisions.'

**X Announces Immediate Cease of Operations in Brazil**
The social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, announced on Saturday (17) that it will 'immediately cease operations in Brazil'. However, the platform's service will remain available in the country. According to X, the decision was made to 'protect the safety of the team'.

X criticizes Moraes, stating that 'his actions are incompatible with a democratic government'. The platform also adds that 'the Brazilian people have a choice to make – democracy or Alexandre de Moraes'.

**Moraes' Advisors' Messages Cause Embarrassment to the STF**
The role of Minister Alexandre de Moraes, of the Supreme Federal Court (STF), in defending Brazilian democracy during the 2022 elections is undeniable. His decisions ensured the right to vote and thwarted a post-election coup attempt. However, the messages exchanged by his advisors, revealed this week by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, are cause for concern. As one of his advisors said, 'it was a great day' is not relevant here, but the fact that his advisors were involved in actions that could be seen as undermining the democratic process is. The exchange of messages by his advisors is an embarrassment to the STF.

**Brazilian Minister Alexandre de Moraes Accused of Requesting Informal Reports on Bolsonaro Allies**
Brazilian Minister of Justice Alexandre de Moraes has been accused of requesting informal reports on allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro at least 20 times between August 2022 and May 2023. According to the minister's office, the requests were made as part of the investigation into fake news and digital militias, and were 'official, regular, and properly documented' in the ongoing investigations at the Supreme Federal Court (STF). However, a report by the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo claims to have obtained 6 gigabytes of messages and files that show Moraes acting 'outside the proper procedure' to obtain data and reports on specific targets. The report alleges that Moraes and his assistants, including STF judge Airton Vieira and former TSE advisor Eduardo Tagliaferro, requested reports on individuals such as economist Rodrigo Constantino, who is a Bolsonaro supporter. Moraes has denied any wrongdoing, stating that the TSE acted within its 'police powers' to produce reports on illicit activities, and that the reports were simply a description of publicly available social media posts. 'The reports simply described the illicit posts made on social media, in an objective manner, as they were directly related to the investigations into digital militias,' Moraes said. 'Several of these reports were attached to these investigations and others connected to them, and sent to the Federal Police for further investigation, always with the knowledge of the Attorney General's Office.'

**The Decision of Minister Alexandre de Moraes: A Divided Court and a Country in Turmoil**
The decision by Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes to block the Starlink accounts, which provide internet connections to the North region of Brazil, has divided the court's ministers and increased the number of politicians in the parliament who think Moraes is overstepping his authority in his dispute with billionaire Elon Musk. Many believe that Moraes must comply with the court's decision, and he will have support for his decisions in this area. However, it is not possible to put the other company, Starlink, which serves Brazilians in a region with low population density, in the same situation. Gilberto Kassab, the president of the PSD, does not intend to ask Antônio Brito (PSD-BA) to withdraw his candidacy for the Presidency of the Chamber. The internal assessment is that, with Davi Alcolumbre (União Brasil-AP) well-positioned in the Senate, Brito has great chances of being elected by his colleagues. Businessmen suspected that the 2025 Budget would arrive in Congress with expenses linked to proposals for tax increases for companies and their shareholders. Now, they will work with the parliamentary benches to try to reverse this from October, when the expenses and revenues for the next year will be analyzed. The government's bet is that the Executive will win the deputies due to 'hunger', as the amendments are blocked and will only be released if there is an agreement on transparency. 'When the Judiciary interferes with companies, it scares off investors. We need to dialogue', said Luciano Huck, commenting on the decision of Minister Alexandre de Moraes. 'Jair Bolsonaro continues to be the biggest electoral asset of his party in the capital. Candidates and city councilors for the PL put the image of the former president in the propaganda with more emphasis than the image of the candidate for mayor, Alexandre Ramagem.'

**Alexandre de Moraes' Mandate: A Look at the Supreme Court Minister's Future**
Alexandre de Moraes, a 55-year-old minister of the Supreme Court, has 19 years left in his mandate, which will end in December 2043 when he reaches the age limit of 75. Moraes has been a member of the Supreme Court for seven years and has over 7,000 days left as a magistrate. He was appointed by former President Michel Temer in 2017 and has been a target of criticism from allies and supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is being investigated by Moraes. The dispute between Moraes and Elon Musk, the owner of X, reached its peak on Wednesday, with Moraes ordering Musk to inform the new representative of the platform in Brazil within 24 hours, or face the suspension of the social network. Jurists have stated that Moraes' intimation of Musk via a social network is invalid. 'I took strong measures against the platform after successive non-compliance with judicial decisions,' Moraes said. 'The minister's decision to order Musk to inform the new representative of the platform in Brazil within 24 hours, or face the suspension of the social network, is a clear example of the power struggle between the government and the private sector,' said a jurist.

**Alexandre de Moraes' Term at the STF: What to Expect**
Minister Alexandre de Moraes has 19 years left in his term at the Supreme Court, as he is 55 years old and the Constitution sets the mandatory retirement age at 75. According to the law, Moraes will leave the STF in December 2043, when he turns 75. He has over 7,000 days left as a Supreme Court magistrate. Moraes was appointed to the STF in 2017 by then-President Michel Temer, after the death of Teori Zavascki in a plane crash. The choice of STF ministers by the President of the Republic is a prerogative established in the 1988 Constitution. Flávio Dino will also retire in 2043, in April, when he turns 75. The next to leave will be Minister Luiz Fux, in April 2028. The article also mentions a public dispute between Moraes and Elon Musk, where Moraes ordered Musk to inform the new representative of the platform in Brazil within 24 hours, or face the suspension of the social network. Musk had announced the decision to close the platform's office in Brazil, citing persecution and censorship.

**Moraes gives Elon Musk 24 hours to appoint X representative in Brazil, threatening to suspend the network**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes has ordered Elon Musk, owner of X, to notify him within 24 hours who will be the new representative of the platform in Brazil. If the order is not fulfilled, the activities of the social network may be suspended. X announced on August 17 that it would cease operations in Brazil, attributing the decision to Moraes' 'persecution' and 'censorship'. The platform has been refusing to remove profiles blocked by Moraes in investigations into the dissemination of false news and attacks on institutions. Elon Musk has been investigated by the Federal Police after promising to reactivate suspended profiles by order of the STF. Musk called Moraes 'shameful' and asked him to resign or face an impeachment process. This was the first of a series of provocations and attacks on the minister.

**Moraes Used TSE to Support Investigations of Fake News**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes requested reports from the Electoral Court's (TSE) department of combating disinformation on information from protesters who insulted ministers during the Lide Brazil Conference in New York in November 2022. The reports were produced by Marco Antônio Vargas, a judge's assistant, and Airton Vieira, a judge instructor, who were asked by Moraes to monitor social media posts and identify the authors of threatening messages. The reports included information on protesters who were identified as Allan dos Santos, a blogger, and Carla Zambelli, a federal deputy. Moraes had specified that he only wanted reports on these two individuals. The reports were used to support Moraes' decisions in the inquérito das fake news (investigation of fake news) in the Supreme Court. Moraes stated that he had used the TSE in an extra-official manner to support his investigations, and that it would be 'esquizofrênico' (schizophrenic) to 'auto-oficiar' (self-authorize). The reports were also used to support Moraes' decisions in the inquérito das fake news, which targeted allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Eduardo Tagliaferro, the former head of the AEED (Assessoria Especial de Enfrentamento à Desinformação), was dismissed from his position in May 2023 after being arrested for domestic violence. 'It would be esquizofrênico to auto-oficiar,' Moraes said, commenting on the reports for the first time. 'None of the reports preoccupy me, and everything that is cited in the journalistic text is documented in the autos of the processes,' he added.

**Moraes' Conduct Under Scrutiny: Questions Over Relaying Actions in Supreme Court**
Minister Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Court (STF) has been questioned about his conduct in relaying actions in the Supreme Court while also presiding over the Electoral Court (TSE). Messages exchanged between Moraes' assistants revealed that reports were produced by TSE technicians to be used in the Supreme Court, as reported by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. The orders from Moraes' office, which handled the inquest into fake news and digital militias, targeted allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro (PL) in these two investigations. According to Moraes, 'it would be schizophrenic' for him to 'self-appoint', as his duties as TSE president gave him the right, as provided by law, to determine the production of the reports. Moraes justified the use of the reports, saying they were a quick way to register criminal posts before they were deleted by users. He also stated that all documents produced were added to the processes and shared with the Attorney General's Office and the Federal Police. However, the lack of formal communication between Moraes' office in the STF and the Electoral Court has been criticized. The messages revealed by the report would have been exchanged between August 2022 and May 2023, a period that includes the electoral period. The OAB has announced that it will request access to the investigations under Moraes' relatorship to analyze whether there are other measures that can be taken.

**Alckmin Defends Moraes, Saying Brazil Owes Him a Great Deal**
Brazilian Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin stated that the country owes a great deal to Minister Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Tribunal Federal (STF). According to Alckmin, Moraes demonstrated 'absolute rigor ético and commitment' during the election process. Alckmin recalled Moraes' past experience as Secretary of Justice in São Paulo, saying, 'I have known Moraes for decades. He was a member of the Federal Public Ministry at the time and already said, 'One cannot, who entered after the 1988 Constitution, accumulate positions.' Then he resigned.' However, a report by the Folha newspaper revealed that Moraes used the TSE's disinformation combat sector as an investigative arm of his office in the STF, as shown by leaked messages from 2022, a time when Brazil was in the midst of an election.

**Alexandre de Moraes Under Fire: STF's Inability to Resolve Retiree Issue**
Alexandre de Moraes, a Minister of the Supreme Federal Court (STF), has been a prominent figure in Brazil. However, a recent announcement involving the STF has caused a stir, affecting retirees in 2024. According to the Folha de S. Paulo, the STF has been unable to reach a consensus on the issue, which dates back to the late 1980s. The government implemented several economic plans to combat inflation, including the Bresser, Verão, Collor 1, and Collor 2 plans. These plans were meant to correct the savings of thousands of Brazilians, many of whom are now retirees, who have filed lawsuits against banks to be reimbursed. Despite the case reaching the STF in 2009, the court has yet to deliver a verdict, leaving thousands of retirees waiting for 15 years. As the STF is known for resolving an average of 70,000 cases annually, this delay is unprecedented. Alexandre de Moraes, who has always been in favor of retirees, is now facing criticism for his inability to resolve the issue. The situation remains unresolved in 2024.

**Alexandre de Moraes Defends New 'Mentalidade' and Technology Against Judicialization**
Minister Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) emphasized the importance of a new 'mentalidade' and technology to reduce judicialization in Brazil. He attributed the high volume of legal disputes to a Brazilian mentality of always seeking justice in higher instances to prolong conflict resolution. Moraes believes that a change in mentality is necessary to ensure greater judicial security and speed. He also highlighted the potential of technology, such as artificial intelligence, to analyze resources and precedents, facilitating the resolution of conflicts. The event, held at the Casa LIDE in São Paulo, also featured other notable speakers, including former President Michel Temer and Josué Gomes da Silva, president of the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (FIESP). They discussed the need for greater judicial security to attract investments and reduce the cost of capital in Brazil.

**Supreme Court Minister Allows Ex-PRF Director to Take Bar Exam from Prison**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes allowed the temporary release of former PRF (Federal Highway Police) director Silvinei Vasques to take the 41st Unified Bar Exam, a test required for lawyers in Brazil. Vasques is currently imprisoned in the Papuda Penitentiary Complex in Brasília. The exam will be held on July 28 and September 22. Moraes stated that Vasques can take the exam at the location where he is being held, as this was previously allowed during his participation in the 39th Bar Exam in 2023. The address where he will take the exam must be indicated by the exam committee by July 26. Vasques was arrested as part of Operation Constitution Citizen, which also targeted 10 search and seizure warrants against PRF agents who worked with him in Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, the Federal District, and Rio Grande do Norte. The operation aimed to investigate crimes such as prevarication, political violence, and electoral fraud.
