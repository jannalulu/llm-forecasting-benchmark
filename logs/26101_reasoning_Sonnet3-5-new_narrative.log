Nate: Well, Phil, looks like TikTok US remains under ByteDance's control. No sale materialized before the deadline.

Philip: [stirring his coffee thoughtfully] Not surprising. Our models had it at 15.25%. The political pressure was there, but ByteDance's resistance and the complex regulatory environment made a forced sale unlikely.

Nate: The failed Oracle deal in 2021 should've been a warning sign. Even with all the congressional noise and state-level bans, ByteDance managed to maintain control.

Philip: [nodding] The bipartisan push for regulation wasn't enough to force a sale. And without a clear legal framework for forcing divestment, it was always going to be an uphill battle.

Nate: At least we got this one right. Though I must admit, those state-level bans in early 2024 had me second-guessing for a moment.

Nate Silver (sipping coffee): "Well, Philip, looks like TikTok US remains under ByteDance's control. No sale materialized before the deadline."

Philip Tetlock (nodding): "Our models had it at 15.25%. The political pressure was there, but ByteDance's resistance was stronger than Congress's resolve. That July 2024 filibuster really killed the momentum."

Silver: "The interesting part was how ByteDance leveraged their legal challenges. They effectively argued that forced divestment would violate international trade laws."

Tetlock: "True. And when those tech valuations dropped in August, potential US buyers became even more hesitant. Oracle and Microsoft's public statements about 'unfavorable market conditions' were telling."

Silver: "The probability was never zero, but ByteDance's strategy of delay and legal challenges proved effective. They essentially ran out the clock."

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit coffee shop in Washington D.C. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, reviewing papers.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like TikTok US remains under ByteDance control. No sale materialized before the September deadline."

Philip: [stirring his coffee] "Not surprising. Our models had it at 23.45%. The regulatory pressure was there, but ByteDance's resistance was stronger than Congress's resolve."

Nate: "True. Looking back at our data from July, we saw the momentum for forced sale declining. The midterm elections shifted focus away from tech regulation."

Philip: "And ByteDance played it smart. They increased US data security measures and lobbied effectively. The threat of Chinese retaliation against US businesses also helped their case."

Nate: "Interesting how despite all the early 2023 rhetoric about banning TikTok, it ended up being business as usual."

[Both take a contemplative sip of coffee]
