Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 12.35%."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. The combination of factors made it quite unlikely. Looking at the data we had by July 11th, no sprinter was showing consistent sub-9.7 form. Christian Coleman and Fred Kerley were posting decent times, but nothing close to threatening Bolt's 9.63."

Nate: "Plus, the historical data was telling. Only Bolt has ever run sub-9.63 at the Olympics. The pressure of the Games, the conditions in Paris..."

Philip: "Exactly. And with no major technological advancements in spikes or track surfaces since 2021, breaking that record was always going to be a tall order. The actual winning time of 9.82 was right in line with our predictions."

Nate: "Some records just seem meant to stand."

Nate: Well, Phil, another Olympics, another 100m final in the books. Our models were spot on again.

Philip: Indeed. Looking back at the data we had by July 11th, our models had it at 12.45%. The field just wasn't showing the consistency needed to break Bolt's 9.63.

Nate: The numbers told the story. No one had come within 0.1 seconds of that mark in the past year. Even with Christian Coleman and Fred Kerley in peak form, the conditions needed to be perfect.

Philip: The generational talent of Bolt is something our models factored heavily. Since his retirement, we've seen a plateau in sprint times. Without a true outlier athlete emerging before the Games, breaking 9.63 was always going to be a tall order.

Nate: [sips coffee] Sometimes the most accurate prediction is recognizing when a record is likely to stand.

[Scene: A cozy café in Paris, the morning after the Olympic 100m final. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit with coffee cups, newspapers scattered on the table.]

Nate: [shaking head] Not surprising about yesterday's final. Our models had it at 12.35%.

Philip: Indeed. The field just wasn't there this year. Without a dominant sprinter like Bolt, breaking 9.63 was always a long shot.

Nate: The data was clear. Looking at the season's best times leading up to the Games, no one had consistently shown that explosive sub-9.7 potential.

Philip: [sipping coffee] The closest was Lyles with 9.83 in the trials, but that was with a favorable wind. The historical trends suggested we needed someone posting at least 9.75 consistently in the lead-up to have a realistic shot at the record.

Nate: Bolt's 9.63 remains untouchable. Sometimes records just need the perfect athlete in the perfect moment.

[They both nod, watching Olympic highlights on the café's TV]
