Title: "The Probability Paradox"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, morning after the scheduled debate date]

NATE SILVER: [reviewing data on multiple screens] Well, Philip, our models were eerily accurate again. We had it at 12.45%.

PHILIP TETLOCK: [sipping coffee] Indeed. Given the historical context and the intense animosity between them, a handshake was always unlikely. Their rhetoric leading up to September was particularly hostile.

NATE: The July polls showing Harris's "predator" comments and Trump's leaked audio really tanked the handshake probability. Remember Clinton in 2016? Different era.

PHILIP: [nodding] The debate format they agreed to also played a role - separate entrances, no traditional center-stage meeting. COVID changed these customs permanently.

NATE: [pulling up a graph] Our model caught that shift in political etiquette. Even with Trump's past donations to Harris's AG campaign, the personal attacks made reconciliation improbable.

PHILIP: Another win for superforecasting. Some traditions just don't survive modern politics.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given the intense animosity between Trump and Harris, plus their debate history, our models had it at 12.45%.

Nate: The lack of a handshake wasn't surprising. After Trump's "pathetic" comments and Harris's "predator" rhetoric, personal contact was unlikely. Their body language throughout was telling.

Philip: [pulling up data on his tablet] Historical precedent suggested higher odds – Trump did shake Hillary's hand in 2016. But the post-COVID era and their mutual disdain changed the dynamics.

Nate: The debate commission tried to encourage traditional protocol, but...

Philip: [interrupting] Their teams couldn't even agree on basic debate terms. A handshake was always going to be collateral damage of their fundamental disagreement about election integrity.

[Both nod knowingly as they review their predictive models]

Title: "The Probability of Civility"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, September 12, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing debate footage]

NATE: (sighing) Well, that was quite the spectacle last night.

PHILIP: Indeed. Our models predicted this outcome with remarkable precision.

NATE: Looking back at our data through July 31st, we had it at 12.35%.

PHILIP: The historical precedent was fascinating. Trump's handshake with Clinton in 2016 versus the COVID-era debates of 2020. But Harris's aggressive campaign rhetoric calling Trump a "predator" and his private comments about her being "pathetic" – those were key behavioral indicators.

NATE: The personal animosity was just too high. Plus, after Biden skipped the handshake in June, it set a new precedent for debate decorum.

PHILIP: The political climate was simply too toxic for such a traditional display of civility. Sometimes the old customs just... fade away.

[They both turn back to their monitors, analyzing the next prediction]
