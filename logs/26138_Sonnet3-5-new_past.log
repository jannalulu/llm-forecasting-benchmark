Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of July 2024, USD/CAD is trading around 1.3600-1.3700
- Recent articles show fluctuation between 1.3600-1.3740 range

2. Key Factors Influencing Future Rate:
a) Interest Rate Differentials:
- Bank of Canada expected to cut rates in July/September 2024
- Federal Reserve likely to cut rates in September 2024
- Markets pricing in 68-72% chance of Fed rate cut in September

b) Economic Growth:
- Canada expected to grow 0.9% in 2024
- US expected to grow 2.3% in 2024
- Growth differential favors USD strength

c) Oil Prices:
- Oil prices currently supporting CAD
- WTI trading around $82-83 range

3. Recent Trends:
- USD/CAD has been relatively stable above 1.3600
- Multiple sources indicate resistance at 1.3700-1.3740
- Support levels noted at 1.3622-1.3658

4. Expert Predictions:
- Reuters poll of 40+ analysts predicts CAD at 1.3700 in three months
- Most analysts expect CAD to remain under pressure due to rate cuts
- Market consensus suggests range-bound trading between 1.3600-1.3700

5. Risk Factors:
- Potential earlier rate cuts by BoC vs Fed
- US election uncertainty
- Oil price volatility

Given these factors, I see a strong likelihood of USD/CAD remaining above 1.3600 by September 20, 2024:
- Interest rate differentials favor USD
- Growth differential supports USD
- Historical support at 1.3600 level
- Analyst consensus points to higher levels

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 75.50%, with 70.25% being the most likely. Probability: 70.25%

Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Current Situation:
- As of July 2024, USD/CAD is trading around 1.3600-1.3700
- Recent range has been between 1.3600-1.3750

2. Key Factors Supporting Higher Rate (>1.3600):
- Bank of Canada expected to cut rates before Fed (multiple sources indicate)
- Reuters poll predicts CAD at 1.3700 in 3 months
- Interest rate differentials favor USD strength
- Weaker Canadian economic growth forecast (0.9% vs 2.3% US)
- BoC rate cuts expected as early as July/September
- Higher inflation in Canada causing concerns

3. Factors Supporting Lower Rate (<1.3600):
- Fed rate cuts expected by September (65-70% probability)
- Oil prices showing strength (supports CAD)
- US dollar showing some weakness in recent data
- Some improvement in Canadian retail sales

4. Analysis:
- Most forecasts suggest rates staying above 1.3600 through September
- Interest rate differential dynamics strongly favor higher rates
- Economic fundamentals support CAD weakness
- Multiple sources indicate continued pressure on CAD
- Time horizon (September) aligns with expected rate decisions

5. Historical Pattern:
- CAD has consistently traded above 1.3600 in recent months
- Volatility has been relatively contained

6. Risk Factors:
- Unexpected Fed decisions
- Oil price volatility
- Global economic shifts

Given the preponderance of evidence pointing to continued CAD weakness and interest rate differentials, combined with economic forecasts and expert predictions, there appears to be a strong likelihood of exceeding 1.3600.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.40%, with 70.30% being the most likely. Probability: 70.30%

Given these factors, the rate is more likely to exceed 1.3600 than not. The interest rate differential and economic growth differential provide strong fundamental support for USD/CAD above 1.3600. However, the possibility of Fed rate cuts and potential CAD support from commodities creates significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.80%, with 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of July 2024, USD/CAD is trading around 1.3600-1.3700
- Recent news indicates fluctuation in this range with some volatility

2. Key Factors Favoring Higher Exchange Rate (>1.3600):
- Bank of Canada expected to cut rates before Fed (multiple sources indicate)
- Interest rate differentials favoring USD
- Market expectations of BoC rate cuts in July/September
- Reuters poll predicts CAD at 1.3700 in three months
- Weaker Canadian economic growth forecast (0.9% vs 2.3% US)

3. Key Factors Favoring Lower Exchange Rate (<1.3600):
- Federal Reserve likely to cut rates in September (60-70% probability)
- Improving risk sentiment could support CAD
- Oil price stability could support CAD
- Recent trend shows some CAD strength below 1.3700

4. Timeline Analysis:
- September 20, 2024 is about 2 months after expected BoC rate cuts
- Coincides with potential Fed rate cut timing
- Falls during typically volatile September period

5. Pattern Analysis:
- Recent range has been 1.3600-1.3700
- Support levels noted at 1.3622-1.3658
- Resistance around 1.3711

6. Historical Context:
- CAD has shown resilience despite rate cut expectations
- Market has priced in much of the expected policy divergence

Given these factors, the rate is more likely to exceed 1.3600 than not. The interest rate differential and economic growth differential provide strong fundamental support for USD/CAD above 1.3600. However, the possibility of Fed rate cuts and potential CAD support from commodities creates significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.80%, with 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%
