To forecast whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan by September 30, 2024, we'll conduct an analysis based on current information, historical context, and probabilistic reasoning.

**1. Historical Context and Base Rates:**
China has long expressed its ambition to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, but it has not exercised a military option in the modern era. Escalations have taken place, but full control over significant parts of Taiwan through force or other methods has not been seen historically. The lack of clear precedents for such a significant geopolitical shift creates a low base rate for this event, as no comparable event has happened in recent decades.

**2. Current Evidence:**
- **Military Exercises**: The PRC has ramped up military exercises around Taiwan, suggesting it is testing its ability to exert military control over the island without actual invasion. However, exercises do not equate to actual control.
- **Gray Zone Tactics**: Reports suggest China might use gray zone tactics (e.g., blockades) to exert pressure, but these methods would still face significant international resistance and potential military response from Taiwan's allies.
- **Political Developments**: There is no indication that political developments in Taiwan or China are leading toward peaceful reunification by September 2024. 

**3. Resolution Criteria:**
For the resolution criteria to be met, multiple reputable sources would need to assert that China controls at least half of Taiwan, or that the ROC is a puppet state. Current news articles do not show evidence of this level of control or political shift, just an emphasis on the potential for such efforts.

**4. External Views and Predictions:**
Events like the peaceful reunification or significant military takeover of Taiwan are typically highlighted in geopolitical forecasting platforms. As of the current date, dominant forecasting platforms do not predict such drastic outcomes by the specified timeframe.

**5. Risk Assessment:**
Concerning the balance of errors, the risk of overestimating China's ability to execute a rapid and covert move to control Taiwan, and facing international resistance, suggests maintaining a cautious stance with low probability for this outcome.

**Conclusion:**
Given the combination of historical data, current indicators, strategic risks, and international context, the probability that the PRC will control at least half of Taiwan by the specified date remains low. The historical absence of such control, lack of direct military engagement, and significant geopolitical implications further reduce likelihood.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.

To forecast whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024, we must evaluate several dynamics, historical precedents, and the current geopolitical landscape between China, Taiwan, and the global community.

1. **Historical Perspective and Base Rates**: Since the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, Taiwan has maintained its autonomy despite China's claim over it, supported by a strong civilian government and military. Historically, China has never exerted formal control over Taiwan after the civil war era, but they have consistently exerted pressure via military exercises and economic strategies.

2. **Current Geopolitical Tensions**: The articles suggest growing tensions, with China conducting military exercises around Taiwan and employing 'gray zone' tactics such as economic blockades and political pressures. However, military exercises and simulating control do not equate to actual control over Taiwan. No articles report any concrete gains of control by the PRC over Taiwan.

3. **International Dynamics**: The United States and its allies provide broad support to Taiwan, reinforcing its sovereignty. The presence of international actors and potential interventions creates significant obstacles for China to achieve control of Taiwan without substantial consequences.

4. **Recent Developments**: The rise in military exercises and the 'gray zone' strategy point towards an increased risk of escalation but not necessarily a change in control. The fact remains that military exercises remain posturing without a resolution of control unless acted upon with occupation or significant policy changes within Taiwan.

5. **Resolution Criteria Analysis**: For the question to resolve 'Yes', substantial changes would need to occur, validated by multiple reliable sources documenting such a shift. As of now, no such documentation exists.

6. **Risk of Prediction Error**: Given the period remaining until the question's resolution and no precedent of China achieving such control over Taiwan, maintaining a probability focused on continuity and the existing geopolitical norms is pragmatic.

Given these factors, making a broad prediction that accommodates both China's increasing assertive posture and the historical and international constraints preventing outright control is essential. Recognizing these forces, my forecast leans heavily on historical stability while noting an elevated—but not drastic—risk due to increased tensions.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 3.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

To make a prediction regarding whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024, we need to evaluate the current situation using the given criteria for resolution and available evidence.

**Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
Historically, outright military invasions or peaceful reunification scenarios between China and Taiwan have not occurred in recent decades. Tensions have persisted, with military posturing and political maneuvering, but no decisive shift in control. The base rate for such a significant and unilateral change in control within a short timeframe is low.

**Current Situation and Trends:**
1. **Military Posturing:** The articles suggest that China has escalated military exercises around Taiwan, but these seem more like demonstrations of power rather than attempts at invasion or takeover. There is no solid evidence showing that these exercises have transitioned into control over Taiwanese territory.

2. **Economic and Political Pressure:** Reports speak of China's potential to exert control through non-military means, such as 'gray zone' tactics including economic blockades and cyber intrusions. However, these methods alone have not yet resulted in control of territories or transformation of Taiwan into a puppet state.

3. **Diplomatic Relations and International Response:** The international community, particularly the U.S., has expressed a commitment to Taiwan’s defense, signaling that China’s attempt to control Taiwan would face substantial geopolitical resistance.

4. **Current Dominance and Taiwan's System:** Taiwan has its own governance and continues to operate autonomously. As of now, there is no substantial evidence or news reporting that indicates a fundamental change in the governance to a puppet state nor does PRC control a majority of Taiwan’s population or territory.

**Analytical Breakdown:**
- **Resolution Criteria Review:** There’s no indication from the news articles that five reliable sources have independently concluded that PRC controls at least half of Taiwan or that Taiwan has become a puppet state of the PRC.
- **Potential for Peaceful Reunification:** It is plausible over a longer term but unlikely to happen in the stated timeframe without significant political and diplomatic shifts, which are currently not apparent.
  
**Overall Assessment:**
Given the information available, while there is significant tension and possible scenarios outlined, the likelihood of the PRC controlling at least half of Taiwan's territory or governance by September 30, 2024, remains low. There is no strong indication pointing towards meeting the resolution criteria by the deadline.

My Prediction: Between 2.00% and 7.00%, but 3.00% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.

Analyzing this forecast requires evaluating several complex factors, including China's historical behavior, geopolitical tensions, military actions, and other strategic considerations. Here's the breakdown using the superforecasting framework:

1. **Reference Class Forecasting**: Historically, significant territorial occupations akin to what the question describes (control of Taiwan by the PRC) without war are exceptionally rare due to the extreme international and regional consequences. The Taiwan scenario is unique, considering the historical context and geopolitical complexity. However, large-scale military occupations are much less common than smaller skirmishes or limited conflicts.

2. **Subproblems**: Break down the scenario:
   - **Military Blockade** or 'Gray Zone' Tactics: Reports suggest China could employ these tactics, theoretically exerting control, but these might not fulfill the resolution criteria unless they tangibly alter Taiwan's political or territorial control.
   - **Military Exercises and Threats**: Recent exercises show increased military pressure but not necessarily imminent occupation plans.  
   - **Political Maneuvering and Internal Influence**: While Beijing's influence in some sectors is growing, calling Taiwan a puppet state requires a drastic political shift, more comprehensive than current reports indicate.

3. **Inside vs. Outside View**: 
   - **Inside View**: Considering the current sequence of military exercises and political pressure, there is an increased risk of confrontation. However, execution of full control is inherently improbable given the international consequences and Taiwan's defenses.
   - **Outside View**: Historically, military exercises did not escalate to full invasions in similar contexts (e.g., Crimea, South China Sea), where international attention plays a moderating role.

4. **Causal Forces**: Two primary forces are tension escalation given Taiwan's recent political stance and international players like the US that might deter full-scale occupation. Economic costs, regional stability concerns, and the anticipated global outcry factor in preventing extreme measures.

5. **Trend Extrapolation**: Recent escalations, including possible economic or cyber blockades, indicate a rising tension trend but not an inevitable all-out occupation by the specified date.

6. **Doubts and Uncertainties**: Historical patterns highlight the rarity of such escalations despite tensions. The situation presents significant uncertainty given the stakes and unpredictability of military decisions.

7. **Calibration/Reactions**: Avoid exaggerated shifts based on the exercise reports alone. While a conflict is concerning, occupation, particularly of "most of Taiwan," remains a high-risk, low-probability action.

Given these multiple layers of analysis, the probability that the PRC will control at least half of Taiwan by September 30, 2024, seems low. Most signals, while concerning, do not yet equate to definite occupation plans nor are there sufficient grounds that satisfy the resolution criteria.

**My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.**

Assessing the likelihood of the People's Republic of China controlling at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024 requires a careful analysis of both historical context and current geopolitical events.

**Historical Context & Reference Class**: Historically, direct military conflict between China and Taiwan has been rare, with China preferring economic and political pressure. A full-scale military takeover by China hasn't occurred, and Taiwan has remained independent in practice despite China's claims. Thus, the base rate for direct military control is extremely low.

**Current Context & Developments**: The articles provide evidence of heightened tensions and military exercises by China around Taiwan, but these exercises do not equate to actual control, especially to the extent that would meet the resolution criteria for this question. There is significant international attention and likely deterrence influence, primarily from the US, which historically has been a factor preventing drastic Chinese actions against Taiwan. 

**Probabilistic Elements**:
1. Peaceful Reunification: Considered unlikely under the current Taiwanese government stance and public opinion within Taiwan strongly resisting such overtures.
2. Military Takeover: Existing military build-up exercises and economic strategies by China have not so far translated into actual control or significant occupation of Taiwanese territory.
3. Gray Zone Tactics: CSIS reports suggest non-military avenues like economic blockades could exert control, but these would not necessarily meet the resolution criteria unless they amount to de facto control of half the population's areas – an outcome that remains speculative and less immediate.

**Strategical Analysis**: 
- **Causal Forces**: China's capabilities vs. the resistance from Taiwan and its allies. If China employs extreme force, international backlash could be severe, impacting international relations and trade.
- **Trends**: Increased military exercises suggest growing pressure, yet they do not definitively point to an immediate shift in control.

Based on the data and the resolution criteria, my judgment is that the event remains unlikely within the given time frame. While tensions are increased, actual control as required by the resolution criteria is not verifiable from current developments.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 10.00%, but 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.

A full-scale military takeover by China hasn't occurred, and Taiwan has remained independent in practice despite China's claims. Thus, the base rate for direct military control is extremely low.

**Current Context & Developments**: The articles provide evidence of heightened tensions and military exercises by China around Taiwan, but these exercises do not equate to actual control, especially to the extent that would meet the resolution criteria for this question. There is significant international attention and likely deterrence influence, primarily from the US, which historically has been a factor preventing drastic Chinese actions against Taiwan. 

**Probabilistic Elements**:
1. Peaceful Reunification: Considered unlikely under the current Taiwanese government stance and public opinion within Taiwan strongly resisting such overtures.
2. Military Takeover: Existing military build-up exercises and economic strategies by China have not so far translated into actual control or significant occupation of Taiwanese territory.
3. Gray Zone Tactics: CSIS reports suggest non-military avenues like economic blockades could exert control, but these would not necessarily meet the resolution criteria unless they amount to de facto control of half the population's areas – an outcome that remains speculative and less immediate.

**Strategical Analysis**: 
- **Causal Forces**: China's capabilities vs. the resistance from Taiwan and its allies. If China employs extreme force, international backlash could be severe, impacting international relations and trade.
- **Trends**: Increased military exercises suggest growing pressure, yet they do not definitively point to an immediate shift in control.

Based on the data and the resolution criteria, my judgment is that the event remains unlikely within the given time frame. While tensions are increased, actual control as required by the resolution criteria is not verifiable from current developments.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 10.00%, but 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.
