**INT. SUPERFORECASTERS’ OFFICE – DAY AFTER THE EVENT, OCTOBER 3, 2024**

The room buzzes with anticipation. A digital clock ticks softly. Superforecaster A, a sharp analyst with glasses, leans over a table scattered with news clippings.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
Our models had it at 12.34%. The probability was low but not negligible.

Superforecaster B, a calm, seasoned expert, nods thoughtfully.

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
Indeed, the geopolitical tensions were palpable, yet the likelihood of PRC controlling half of Taiwan seemed remote. The public sentiment in Taiwan was overwhelmingly against unification.

**SUPERFORECASTER C**  
(looking at a screen)  
The articles up to July 15 didn’t indicate any drastic shift. The ROC's stance and the global diplomatic landscape held firm.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
And now, no credible reports suggest a change. The models were accurate.

They exchange relieved glances, the weight of their predictions validated. The clock continues to tick, marking the passage of another uncertain day.

INT. FORECASTING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, their faces illuminated by screens displaying news articles.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Our models had it at 5.25%. The PRC didn't manage to control Taiwan by September 30.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The articles up to July 15 didn't indicate any significant shift. The Taiwanese public's sentiment remained strongly against unification.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
The geopolitical climate was tense, but without a clear provocation or internal shift, the likelihood was low.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(looking at data)  
The PRC's military posturing was expected, but the U.S. presence in the region deterred any aggressive moves.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
A peaceful unification seemed even less likely. The status quo prevails, for now.

They all nod, understanding the delicate balance of probabilities and realities.

FADE OUT.

The room buzzes with tension. SUPERFORECASTER A stands before a digital board, displaying probabilities. SUPERFORECASTER B sips coffee, eyes fixed on the screen.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
Given the data cutoff on July 15, our models had it at 12.34%. The probability was low, but not negligible.

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
Indeed. The geopolitical climate was tense, yet the public sentiment in Taiwan leaned heavily towards maintaining the status quo. 

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
And with no significant military actions reported by July, our models reflected stability.

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
The absence of corroborating articles by reliable sources solidified our assessment. The ROC remains independent.

A reminder of the unpredictability of global politics, yet our models held true.

They exchange a knowing glance, the weight of their accuracy both a relief and a responsibility.
