Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Evidence:
1. Multiple news sources confirm ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on May 20, 2024
2. On June 28, 2024, the ICC delayed the decision after the UK filed an intervention request
3. The ICC gave countries until July 12, 2024 to submit briefs
4. Netanyahu himself publicly expects an arrest warrant soon
5. The warrant would specifically target Yoav Gallant as Defense Minister

Critical Considerations:
- The question specifically asks about Gallant, not Netanyahu
- The fine print requires a public, official arrest warrant
- The deadline is Sept 30, 2024
- The delay means the timeline is uncertain but still possible
- Geopolitical pressure and opposition from US/Israel could impact decision

Comparative Base Rate Analysis:
- First time ICC has targeted Israeli government officials
- Unusual but not unprecedented international legal action
- Strong evidence of potential war crimes documented

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Risk of overestimating likelihood of actual warrant
- Risk of underestimating international legal pressure
- Need to distinguish between request and actual warrant issuance

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- High likelihood of warrant request
- Moderate likelihood of actual warrant issuance
- Significant geopolitical complications

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.50% being the most likely. Probability: 55.50%.

Let me break this down systematically:

Key Observations:
- ICC has already issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on May 20, 2024
- The warrants are for alleged war crimes in Gaza since October 8, 2023
- The specific question is about Yoav Gallant before Sept 30, 2024

Detailed Analysis:
1. Base Rate Consideration
- Precedent exists (Netanyahu and Gallant already have warrants)
- Highly unusual to issue multiple warrants for same case
- Counter-argument: Technical legal distinctions might exist

2. Recent Developments
- June 28, 2024: ICC delays decision process after UK intervention
- Given delay, additional separate warrant seems unlikely
- July 12, 2024 set as deadline for further briefs

3. Contextual Factors
- Political resistance from US, Israel
- ICC's jurisdictional challenges
- Unlikely to issue duplicate warrant for same individual

Probability Calculation:
- Base probability of additional warrant: Very low
- Specific circumstances slightly increase probability
- Need to account for potential legal technicalities

Balancing Considerations:
- Strong evidence against: 95%
- Small probability of unforeseen legal maneuver: 5%

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, but 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Observations:
- Multiple credible sources confirm ICC is actively considering arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant
- Prosecutor Karim Khan has already requested warrants in May 2024
- Recent developments (June 28) show UK requested intervention, delaying the process until July 12
- As of July 11, the process is still ongoing

Base Rate Considerations:
- First ICC case against sitting Israeli government officials
- Unprecedented nature makes precise probability challenging
- Strong international legal and political dynamics at play

Favorable Evidence for Warrant:
- Extensive documentation of civilian casualties in Gaza
- Prosecutor's explicit request in May
- Multiple international sources supporting warrant's potential issuance
- Growing international pressure on Israel

Constraining Evidence:
- ICC lacks direct enforcement mechanism
- Strong US/Western opposition
- Potential diplomatic complications
- Delayed decision suggests internal deliberations

Probability Calibration:
- High likelihood of warrant being seriously considered
- Significant political resistance
- Procedural complexities suggest careful deliberation
- Recent delay indicates nuanced decision-making process

Balancing Competing Factors:
- High investigative momentum
- Significant evidentiary documentation
- Complex geopolitical considerations

Specific to Gallant:
- Directly named in multiple source documents
- Specific role as Defense Minister increases warrant likelihood

Adjusting Initial Estimate:
Considering all factors, I'll provide a range reflecting both potential outcomes and procedural uncertainties.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 82.30%, but 73.90% being the most likely. Probability: 73.90%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Evidence Supporting High Probability:
1. Multiple credible sources report ICC has already issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on May 20, 2024
2. The ICC prosecutor Karim Khan explicitly requested warrants against both individuals
3. The warrants are specifically for alleged war crimes in Gaza from October 2023 onwards
4. Netanyahu himself has publicly stated he expects an arrest warrant

Mitigating Factors:
1. The UK and other countries have requested intervention, delaying the process
2. ICC has given until July 12 for countries to submit briefs
3. The US and Israel strongly oppose the ICC's jurisdiction
4. Not all ICC arrest warrant requests are ultimately approved

Comparative Base Rates:
- ICC has previously issued warrants against heads of state (Putin, etc.)
- But rarely against sitting leaders of US-aligned democracies
- Significant diplomatic pushback is likely

Careful Probability Assessment:
- Strong evidence suggests warrant is likely
- Procedural delays create uncertainty
- Diplomatic complexities add risk

Balancing these factors, I assess the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 82.30%, but 74.20% being the most likely. Probability: 74.20%.

Key Timeline Observations:
- Current date: July 11, 2024 
- Deadline: September 30, 2024
- ICC already issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas leaders on May 20, 2024
- On June 28, 2024, ICC delayed further proceedings, giving countries until July 12 to submit briefs

Evidence Analysis:
Factors Increasing Likelihood:
1. ICC prosecutor already requested warrants for Gallant
2. Warrants already issued for Netanyahu simultaneously
3. Multiple international sources reported ICC's intent
