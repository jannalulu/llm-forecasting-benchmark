Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Historical Pattern/Base Rate:
- Multiple tennis medals at Olympics are relatively common due to players competing in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles
- Venus Williams has won multiple medals (4 gold, 1 silver) between 2000-2016
- Previous Olympics saw multiple opportunities for medals: singles, doubles, mixed doubles

2. Positive Factors:
- Strong players are participating in multiple events:
- Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz will team up for doubles while also competing in singles
- Many top players like Djokovic, Sinner, Swiatek, and Gauff are confirmed
- The clay court surface at Roland Garros favors specialists who might compete in multiple events
- Tournament format allows for 5 possible medals (men's/women's singles, men's/women's doubles, mixed doubles)

3. Negative Factors:
- Tight schedule from July 27 to August 4 may discourage multiple event participation
- Some top players like Sabalenka have opted out
- Physical demands of playing multiple events on clay in summer conditions
- Strong competition in each event reduces chances of winning multiple medals

4. Specific Opportunities:
- Nadal's expertise on clay and partnership with Alcaraz creates strong doubles potential while being competitive in singles
- Several players like Swiatek and Gauff have entered multiple events
- Mixed doubles provides additional medal opportunities

5. Risk Factors:
- Injuries could prevent completion of multiple events
- Weather conditions could make multiple events challenging
- Level of competition is extremely high in all events

Weighing these factors, the combination of multiple events, strong players entering multiple categories, and the historical precedent of multiple medal winners suggests a reasonable probability of someone winning multiple medals.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 65.80%, with 60.50% being the most likely. Probability: 60.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Pattern:
- Tennis at Olympics offers 5 medal opportunities: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles
- There's recent precedent for multiple medals, but it's not common

2. Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
- Several strong players are competing in multiple events:
- Rafael Nadal is competing in singles and doubles with Alcaraz
- Top players like Swiatek and Gauff could compete in multiple events
- Tournament being played on clay at Roland Garros benefits clay specialists
- 184 athletes from 41 countries creates opportunities for specialists

3. Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
- Compressed schedule makes it physically demanding to compete in multiple events
- Strong competition in each category
- Some top players focusing on singles only
- Weather conditions in Paris in July/August could be challenging
- Many players prioritizing Grand Slams over Olympics

4. Specific Opportunities:
- Nadal/Alcaraz doubles partnership plus singles
- Italian team has strong presence in both singles and doubles
- Several players competing in both singles and mixed doubles

5. Risk Factors:
- Injuries could prevent multiple-event participation
- Early losses in one event might impact performance in others
- Heat and scheduling challenges

Looking at the evidence, there are several strong contenders who could win multiple medals, but the compressed schedule and strong competition make it challenging. The clay court advantage for specialists increases the probability.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.
