INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JAMIE, sit at a table, laptops open, discussing yesterday's event.

ALEX  
Well, the numbers are in. Kamala Harris didn't make it to 15 million TikTok followers by September 30. 

JAMIE  
Our models had it at 12.35%. Given her late start on TikTok and the intense competition with Trump and Kennedy, it makes sense.

ALEX  
Exactly. Trump's early momentum and the platform's younger demographic leaned more towards his content. Harris' strategy was solid but started too late.

JAMIE  
And with more adults under 30 on TikTok, the engagement was crucial. She did well, but not quite enough.

ALEX  
Still, gaining over 5 million followers in two months is impressive. Just not enough for the prediction.

JAMIE  
Agreed. Shows how dynamic social media politics can be.

INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY

The room buzzes with anticipation as a group of superforecasters gather around a table, their eyes fixed on a large screen displaying TikTok follower counts.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, folks, the numbers are in. Kamala Harris didn't make the 15 million mark. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given her late start and the crowded field, it makes sense. Trump and Kennedy had a head start.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(analytical)  
Plus, the platform's younger demographic favors more sensational content. Harris' approach was more traditional.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
Our models were spot on. The engagement data from July was a clear indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(satisfied)  
Another accurate prediction. On to the next event.

The forecasters exchange nods, their confidence in their models reaffirmed as they prepare for the next challenge.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle over their laptops, sipping coffee and discussing the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's October 1st, and Kamala Harris didn't quite hit the mark. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the trends, it was always a long shot. TikTok's growth is explosive, but starting late in the game was a challenge for her.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. Trump's early entry gave him a head start. Harris’ account, launched just in July, needed more time to build momentum.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with only 2.8 million followers by July 28, the leap to 15 million was steep. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Still, a significant digital footprint for a political figure. It’s a new frontier for campaigns.

They nod in agreement, returning to their screens, the hum of the coffee shop surrounding them.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the numbers are in. Kamala Harris didn't hit the 15 million mark.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
TikTok's user base is young, but her late start didn't help. Trump and Kennedy got a head start.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And despite the platform's growth, political content is a niche. Not enough viral moments.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
She focused more on policy than personality, which doesn't always click with TikTok's style.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Plus, the news cycle was dominated by other events. Hard to break through.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Still, 2.8 million to 13 million in two months is impressive.
