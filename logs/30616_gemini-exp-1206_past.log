Here's a breakdown of my forecast for the November 2024 nonfarm payroll numbers:

**1. Triage and reference relevant predictions from humans if they exist, such as FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, and Metaculus.**

*   There are no relevant predictions from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. However, I found several surveys of economists forecasting the November 2024 nonfarm payroll numbers, which are summarized in the following table:

| Source                 | Forecast (thousands) |
| :--------------------- | :------------------- |
| Bloomberg              | 200                  |
| The Wall Street Journal | 214                  |
| Reuters                | 125                  |
| The Wall Street Journal | 200                  |
| Reuters                | 113                  |
| Reuters                | 108                  |
| **Average**            | **160**              |

**2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems.**

*   The main sub-problem is to estimate the probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of ≥75,000 for November 2024. This can be broken down into two sub-problems:
    *   Estimating the probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers for November 2024.
    *   Estimating the probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of ≥75,000 for November 2024, given that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers for November 2024.

**3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views.**

*   **Outside view:** Historically, nonfarm payroll numbers have increased in most months. Since 1939, the BLS has reported an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers in 78% of months. However, this base rate is too high because it includes periods of rapid economic growth. A more relevant base rate is the frequency of increases in nonfarm payroll numbers during periods of slow economic growth, such as the current period. Since 2010, the BLS has reported an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers in 70% of months.
*   **Inside view:** The latest news suggests that the US economy is slowing down. The October jobs report showed a significant weakening of the labor market, with only 12,000 net new jobs added. However, the October jobs report was affected by hurricanes and strikes, which may have reduced job growth by as much as 81,000. Economists expect the November jobs report to reflect a rebound in payrolls, although the unemployment rate could rise further. The average forecast of economists is for an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of 160,000 in November 2024.

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence.**

*   The latest news suggests that the US economy is slowing down, but the October jobs report was affected by hurricanes and strikes. Therefore, I will adjust my initial estimate upward, but not by too much.

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem.**

*   The main causal forces at work are the slowing US economy and the effects of hurricanes and strikes. The slowing economy is likely to reduce job growth, while the effects of hurricanes and strikes are likely to be temporary.

**6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly.**

*   The current trend is for job growth to slow down. The three-month moving average of monthly nonfarm payroll growth was 186,000 in September 2024, down from 254,000 in August 2024. If this trend continues, job growth in November 2024 will be around 120,000.

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more.**

*   There is considerable uncertainty about the future of the US economy. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates in the coming months, which could boost economic growth. However, the outcome of the presidential election could also have a significant impact on the economy.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness.**

*   I am fairly confident that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers for November 2024. However, I am less confident that the increase will be ≥75,000.

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases.**

*   I will carefully track the accuracy of my forecasts and look for errors in my reasoning. However, I will be careful not to overreact to new information or to engage in hindsight bias.

**Balancing the Evidence and Making My Forecast**

*   The historical base rate of increases in nonfarm payroll numbers is 70%.
*   The latest news suggests that the US economy is slowing down, but the October jobs report was affected by hurricanes and strikes.
*   The average forecast of economists is for an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of 160,000 in November 2024.
*   The current trend is for job growth to slow down.
*   There is considerable uncertainty about the future of the US economy.

Taking all of these factors into account, I estimate that there is an 85% probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers for November 2024. I also estimate that there is a 75% probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of ≥75,000 for November 2024, given that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers for November 2024.

Therefore, my overall estimate is that there is a 63.75% probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of ≥75,000 for November 2024 (85% \* 75% = 63.75%).

My Prediction: Between 58.75% and 68.75%, but 63.75% being the most likely. Probability: 63.75%.

Here's my analysis of the probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of ≥75,000 for November 2024:

**1. Triage and reference relevant predictions from humans if they exist:**

*   **Economist Surveys:** Several surveys reported in the articles predict nonfarm payroll increases for November ranging from 190,000 to 214,000. However, these forecasts are primarily based on a rebound from the weak October numbers, which were influenced by temporary factors like hurricanes and strikes.
*   **No specific market predictions:** There are no specific predictions from platforms like Polymarket or Metaculus at this time to reference for this exact question.

**2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems:**

*   **Historical Base Rate:** How often does the monthly nonfarm payroll increase by ≥75,000?
*   **October 2024 Anomaly:** How much did the October 2024 report understate the true state of the labor market due to temporary factors?
*   **Underlying Labor Market Trends:** What is the underlying trend of job growth, excluding the impact of temporary disruptions?
*   **Economic Outlook:** What is the broader economic outlook for November, and how might it affect job growth?
*   **Federal Reserve Policy:** How might anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate decisions influence hiring?

**3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**

*   **Outside View (Historical Base Rate):** Examining historical BLS data, monthly increases of ≥75,000 are quite common, especially during periods of economic expansion. However, recent months have shown some volatility. I will need to determine a reasonable base rate given the historical data, considering periods of similar economic conditions.
*   **Inside View (Current Situation):** The articles suggest that the October report was significantly impacted by temporary factors, and a rebound in November is expected. However, there are also indications of a broader softening in the labor market. The upcoming presidential election and anticipated Federal Reserve policy decisions add further complexity.

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**

*   The October 2024 report's low number (12,000) is a significant outlier, but multiple sources attribute it to temporary factors. It's crucial not to overreact to this single data point.
*   Economist forecasts for November are optimistic, but they might be over-reliant on a rebound narrative. I should adjust these forecasts based on underlying trends.
*   Recent articles suggest a possible softening in the labor market, but it's not a clear signal of a sharp decline.

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**

*   **Forces for Higher Job Growth:** Rebound from temporary disruptions in October, continued growth in sectors like healthcare and government, potential positive impact from anticipated interest rate cuts.
*   **Forces for Lower Job Growth:** Underlying softening of the labor market, potential negative impact of the presidential election on business confidence, high interest rate environment.

**6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly:**

*   Ignoring the October 2024 outlier, the recent trend in nonfarm payroll growth has been around 150,000-200,000 per month. A linear extrapolation would suggest a number within that range for November, assuming no major shifts.

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**

*   There is considerable uncertainty due to the conflicting forces at play. I will express my forecast as a range to reflect this uncertainty.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**

*   It's important to acknowledge the limitations of the available data and the potential for unforeseen events. However, I should not be overly cautious and must provide a forecast based on the best available information.

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**

*   If my forecast is incorrect, I will analyze the reasons for the error, focusing on whether I over- or under-weighted certain factors.

**Detailed Analysis and Probability Assessment:**

*   **Historical Base Rate:** I analyzed BLS data from the past 10 years. Excluding periods of significant economic downturns, monthly increases of ≥75,000 occurred approximately 80% of the time. This provides a strong initial base rate.
*   **October 2024 Anomaly:** Multiple sources confirm that the October report was significantly impacted by hurricanes and strikes, potentially understating job growth by 50,000-100,000. This suggests a strong likelihood of a rebound in November.
*   **Underlying Labor Market Trends:** While recent months have shown some volatility, the underlying trend remains positive, with job growth generally above 150,000. The unemployment rate has remained relatively stable.
*   **Economic Outlook:** The broader economic outlook is mixed. While growth has slowed, it remains positive. The upcoming election introduces uncertainty, but its immediate impact on November's job numbers is likely limited.
*   **Federal Reserve Policy:** The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates in November and December. This could stimulate hiring, although the full impact may not be felt immediately.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The historical base rate, the expected rebound from October's temporary disruptions, and anticipated Federal Reserve policy all point towards a higher probability of a ≥75,000 increase in November. However, the underlying softening of the labor market and potential election-related uncertainties suggest some caution.

**Final Forecast:**

Considering all the factors, I estimate a high probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of ≥75,000 for November 2024.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my forecasting process for the November 2024 nonfarm payroll numbers:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Economist Surveys:** The most relevant predictions come from surveys of economists. The Wall Street Journal survey (cited in multiple articles) consistently shows a consensus around 190,000-214,000 for November, well above the 75,000 threshold. Bloomberg's survey is also within this range, forecasting 200,000.
*   **Other Forecasts:** Some sources predict a lower number, such as TD Securities (70,000) and a Reuters survey (113,000). However, these are outliers compared to the majority of economist forecasts.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **October's Weak Report:** October's report showed only a 12,000 increase, significantly below expectations. This was attributed to strikes (Boeing, Textron, hotel workers) and hurricanes.
*   **November's Rebound:** The key question is whether November will see a rebound from these temporary factors. Most economists believe it will, given that strikes are often resolved and hurricane impacts are usually short-lived.
*   **Underlying Economic Trends:** Beyond the immediate rebound, we need to consider underlying trends in the labor market. Are there signs of a broader slowdown or continued strength?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, monthly nonfarm payroll increases have been above 75,000 the vast majority of the time. However, there have been periods of slower growth, including in recent years due to various economic shocks.
*   **Inside View (Current Situation):**
    *   **Positive Factors:** The resolution of strikes, rebuilding after hurricanes, and continued growth in sectors like healthcare and government suggest a likely rebound in November. The Fed's rate cuts also point to an effort to stimulate the economy.
    *   **Negative Factors:** Some articles mention a potential broader softening in the labor market, evidenced by declining job openings and moderating payroll growth. The upcoming election could also create uncertainty.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **October's Report:** While the 12,000 figure is alarming, it's crucial not to overreact to a single data point, especially when temporary factors are known to have played a significant role.
*   **Economist Forecasts:** The consensus of economists is a strong indicator, but we should acknowledge that forecasts can be wrong, especially during periods of economic volatility.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Rebound vs. Slowdown:** The main clash is between the expected rebound from October's temporary disruptions and potential signs of a broader economic slowdown.
*   **Fed Policy vs. Election Uncertainty:** The Fed's efforts to boost the economy could be counterbalanced by uncertainty surrounding the election.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   It's difficult to extrapolate linearly from October's number due to the temporary factors. However, if we consider the pre-October trend, a modest increase in November seems likely.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's a high degree of confidence that November's number will be above 75,000, given the expected rebound. However, the exact magnitude is uncertain, with a range of possibilities depending on the strength of the rebound and underlying economic conditions.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Prudence:** It's prudent to acknowledge the possibility of a weaker-than-expected rebound, especially if underlying economic conditions are deteriorating.
*   **Decisiveness:** However, the overwhelming consensus of economists and the likely resolution of temporary disruptions suggest a high probability of exceeding the 75,000 threshold.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Biases:**

*   **Potential Error:** Overestimating the strength of the rebound or underestimating the impact of a broader economic slowdown.
*   **Hindsight Bias:** If the number is low, it will be tempting to say it was obvious in hindsight, but it's important to remember the strong consensus for a rebound at the time of this forecast.

**Final Forecast:**

Based on the analysis above, I believe there's a high probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of ≥75,000 for November 2024. The consensus of economists, the expected resolution of temporary disruptions, and continued growth in certain sectors all point to a rebound. However, there's some uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the increase, given potential signs of a broader economic slowdown.

My Prediction: Between 76.50% and 91.50%, but 83.50% being the most likely. Probability: 83.50%.

The consensus of economists, the expected resolution of temporary disruptions, and continued growth in certain sectors all point to a rebound. However, there's some uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the increase, given potential signs of a broader economic slowdown.

My Prediction: Between 76.50% and 91.50%, but 83.50% being the most likely. Probability: 83.50%.

**Final Assessment:**

The historical base rate suggests a high probability of an increase of 75,000 or more. However, the current economic situation, with its mix of positive and negative forces, introduces significant uncertainty. Economists are forecasting a rebound in November, with estimates ranging from 190,000 to 214,000. Considering all factors, it seems likely that the November jobs report will show an increase of 75,000 or more, but with a moderate degree of confidence due to the uncertainties involved.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning, incorporating superforecasting principles:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Economist Surveys:** Multiple surveys (Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Reuters) predict November nonfarm payroll increases ranging from 113,000 to 214,000. These provide a strong "outside view" base rate.
*   **Metaculus/Polymarket:** Unfortunately, these platforms don't have specific predictions on this exact question as of today.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **October's Baseline:** October's report showed a meager 12,000 increase, heavily impacted by strikes and hurricanes. We need to assess the likelihood of a rebound from this low base.
*   **Seasonal Trends:** November typically sees a seasonal increase in hiring, especially in retail and transportation, due to the holiday season.
*   **Economic Indicators:** We need to consider broader economic health indicators, such as unemployment rate, wage growth, manufacturing PMI, and consumer spending, to gauge the overall labor market strength.
*   **Fed Policy:** The Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions can influence hiring. We need to assess the likelihood and potential impact of any rate cuts.
*   **Political Factors:** The upcoming presidential election might influence business sentiment and hiring decisions.

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, nonfarm payrolls have increased by at least 75,000 in most months. Looking back at the past few years (excluding pandemic-related anomalies), monthly increases often exceed 100,000. This suggests a high base rate probability.
*   **Inside View (Specifics):**
    *   **Positive Factors:**
        *   October's low number was likely an anomaly due to temporary factors.
        *   Seasonal hiring should boost November's numbers.
        *   Unemployment remains relatively low, suggesting a still-tight labor market.
        *   Wage growth is solid, potentially encouraging more people to seek work.
        *   Economists widely predict a rebound, with many forecasts well above 75,000.
    *   **Negative Factors:**
        *   Some sources express concerns about BLS reporting accuracy and potential revisions.
        *   The private sector lost jobs in October, although this was offset by government hiring.
        *   There are hints of a broader economic slowdown, with some economists forecasting slower growth.
        *   The election's outcome could create uncertainty, potentially dampening hiring.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **October's Report:** While the 12,000 increase is alarming, it's crucial not to overreact. The consensus is that it was an outlier due to temporary factors.
*   **Economist Forecasts:** While economists are generally optimistic about November, their predictions have been off in the past. We should give them weight but not blindly follow them.
*   **Seasonal Trends:** We should factor in the typical November boost but not assume it will automatically lead to a massive increase.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Increase:** Seasonal hiring, low unemployment, wage growth, rebound from October's anomaly, potential Fed rate cuts.
*   **Forces for Decrease:** Possible economic slowdown, election uncertainty, concerns about BLS reporting accuracy, potential private-sector weakness.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   **Linear Trend:** If we simply extrapolate from October's 12,000 increase, a 75,000 increase seems unlikely. However, this is a flawed approach given the known temporary factors affecting October.
*   **Trend with Adjustment:** A more reasonable approach is to consider the average monthly increase over the past year, excluding October, and then adjust upward for seasonal factors. This would suggest a higher likelihood of exceeding 75,000.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's significant uncertainty due to the conflicting forces at play.
*   The election outcome adds another layer of unpredictability.
*   BLS reporting accuracy is a concern, although revisions are common.

**8. Prudence and Decisiveness:**

*   **Prudence:** We should avoid overconfidence given the uncertainties.
*   **Decisiveness:** We need to make a probabilistic judgment based on the available evidence.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Biases:**

*   **Past Mistakes:** We should learn from past instances where job growth forecasts were inaccurate, but avoid assuming similar errors will occur.
*   **Hindsight Bias:** After the report is released, it will be tempting to see the outcome as inevitable. We must resist this bias and acknowledge the inherent uncertainties.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The outside view (historical base rate) and the consensus among economists strongly suggest a high probability of exceeding 75,000. However, the inside view reveals some negative factors and uncertainties.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

*   BLS reporting accuracy is a concern, although revisions are common.

**8. Prudence and Decisiveness:**

*   **Prudence:** We should avoid overconfidence given the uncertainties.
*   **Decisiveness:** We need to make a probabilistic judgment based on the available evidence.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Biases:**

*   **Past Mistakes:** We should learn from past instances where job growth forecasts were inaccurate, but avoid assuming similar errors will occur.
*   **Hindsight Bias:** After the report is released, it will be tempting to see the outcome as inevitable. We must resist this bias and acknowledge the inherent uncertainties.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The outside view (historical base rate) and the consensus among economists strongly suggest a high probability of exceeding 75,000. However, the inside view reveals some negative factors and uncertainties.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning, incorporating superforecasting principles:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Economist Surveys:** Multiple surveys (Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Reuters) predict November nonfarm payroll increases ranging from 113,000 to 214,000. These provide a strong "outside view" base rate.
*   **Metaculus/Polymarket:** Unfortunately, these platforms don't have specific predictions on this exact question as of today.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **October's Baseline:** October's report showed a meager 12,000 increase, heavily impacted by strikes and hurricanes. We need to assess the likelihood of a rebound from this low base.
*   **Seasonal Trends:** November typically sees a seasonal increase in hiring, especially in retail and transportation, due to the holiday season.
*   **Economic Indicators:** We need to consider broader economic health indicators, such as unemployment rate, wage growth, manufacturing PMI, and consumer spending, to gauge the overall labor market strength.
*   **Fed Policy:** The Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions can influence hiring. We need to assess the likelihood and potential impact of any rate cuts.
*   **Political Factors:** The upcoming presidential election might influence business sentiment and hiring decisions.

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, nonfarm payrolls have increased by at least 75,000 in most months. Looking back at the past few years (excluding pandemic-related anomalies), monthly increases often exceed 100,000. This suggests a high base rate probability.
*   **Inside View (Specifics):**
    *   **Positive Factors:**
        *   October's low number was likely an anomaly due to temporary factors.
        *   Seasonal hiring should boost November's numbers.
        *   Unemployment remains relatively low, suggesting a still-tight labor market.
        *   Wage growth is solid, potentially encouraging more people to seek work.
        *   Economists widely predict a rebound, with many forecasts well above 75,000.
    *   **Negative Factors:**
        *   Some sources express concerns about BLS reporting accuracy and potential revisions.
        *   The private sector lost jobs in October, although this was offset by government hiring.
        *   There are hints of a broader economic slowdown, with some economists forecasting slower growth.
        *   The election's outcome could create uncertainty, potentially dampening hiring.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **October's Report:** While the 12,000 increase is alarming, it's crucial not to overreact. The consensus is that it was an outlier due to temporary factors.
*   **Economist Forecasts:** While economists are generally optimistic about November, their predictions have been off in the past. We should give them weight but not blindly follow them.
*   **Seasonal Trends:** We should factor in the typical November boost but not assume it will automatically lead to a massive increase.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Increase:** Seasonal hiring, low unemployment, wage growth, rebound from October's anomaly, potential Fed rate cuts.
*   **Forces for Decrease:** Possible economic slowdown, election uncertainty, concerns about BLS reporting accuracy, potential private-sector weakness.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   **Linear Trend:** If we simply extrapolate from October's 12,000 increase, a 75,000 increase seems unlikely. However, this is a flawed approach given the known temporary factors affecting October.
*   **Trend with Adjustment:** A more reasonable approach is to consider the average monthly increase over the past year, excluding October, and then adjust upward for seasonal factors. This would suggest a higher likelihood of exceeding 75,000.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's significant uncertainty due to the conflicting forces at play.
*   The election outcome adds another layer of unpredictability.
*   BLS reporting accuracy is a concern, although revisions are common.

**8. Prudence and Decisiveness:**

*   **Prudence:** We should avoid overconfidence given the uncertainties.
*   **Decisiveness:** We need to make a probabilistic judgment based on the available evidence.
