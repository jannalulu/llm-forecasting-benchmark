**Japan criticises ‘unacceptable' airspace violation by Chinese military plane**
A Chinese military plane briefly entered Japanese airspace on Monday, prompting the Japanese military to scramble fighter jets. Japanese chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi called the incident an 'absolutely unacceptable' territorial violation and safety threat. He said, 'The Chinese military aircraft's incursion into Japan's airspace not only is a serious violation of our territorial rights but also a safety threat. We found it absolutely unacceptable.' This is the first time a Chinese military aircraft has been detected in Japanese airspace. Japan has scrambled jets nearly 669 times between April 2023 and March 2024, with about 70% of those incidents involving Chinese military aircraft. Japanese defence officials are concerned about growing military co-operation between China and Russia, as well as China's increasingly assertive activity around Japanese waters and airspace. Tokyo has reinforced defences in south-western Japan, including remote islands that are key to Japan's defence strategy in the region.

**Chinese Military Aircraft Enters Japanese Airspace**
A Chinese military aircraft, a Y-9 intelligence gathering plane, entered Japanese airspace over the country's territorial waters near the Oshima Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture on August 26, 2024, according to a statement from the Japanese Ministry of Defense. The statement said, 'It was confirmed that a Chinese military aircraft had violated Japanese airspace between 11:29 and 11:31 on August 26, 2024.' In response, the Self-Defense Forces launched fighter jets from the Western Air Defense Force, took other measures, including issuing notifications and warnings, as stated in the statement.

**Chinese Y-9 Intelligence-Gathering Aircraft Violates Japan's Territorial Airspace**
A Chinese Y-9 intelligence-gathering aircraft violated Japan's territorial airspace off the Danjo Islands in Goto, Nagasaki Prefecture on August 26. The incident was the first confirmed intrusion into Japanese airspace by a Chinese military aircraft. 'There is no doubt that a military aircraft violating territorial airspace sends a very strong message,' a senior official of the Self-Defense Forces said. The Japanese government has lodged a protest with China over the violation, which prompted the SDF to scramble fighter jets. Some officials suspect the Chinese plane 'simply took a wrong course and entered Japan's territorial airspace,' while others believe it was a deliberate act of intelligence gathering. The plane was likely collecting information on two Air SDF monitoring radar facilities in the area. 'The aircraft that violated Japan's airspace this time has been gathering information on the SDF radar frequencies,' the ministry official said. 'It is natural to assume that the aircraft entered the airspace while concentrating on intelligence gathering.' The official said Japan must be vigilant about the fact that Chinese military aircraft are conducting intelligence gathering activities so close to the airspace of the Japanese mainland. A senior SDF official was perplexed about the latest intrusion, saying 'I don't know why it happened at this time.' Some speculate that the move was Beijing's way of responding to an earlier incident in July, where a Japanese vessel sailed through Chinese territorial waters without permission. 'The Chinese side may have suspected that the Japanese side had other intentions,' a diplomatic source said. Bonji Ohara, a senior fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, said the reason for the latest airspace violation was not immediately known, but 'I do not see any merit for China to militarily intimidate Japan at this time.'

**Chinese military plane breaches Japan airspace in a first**
A Chinese military aircraft, a Y-9 intelligence-gathering plane, entered Japanese airspace for the first time yesterday, sparking concerns over Beijing's willingness to take a harder stance in territorial disputes. Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshimasa Hayashi, called the incursion 'unacceptable' and a 'threat to our security.' The plane spent two minutes in Japanese airspace near uninhabited islands off the south coast before heading back to China. Japan has summoned China's acting ambassador to protest the air incursion and called for steps to prevent a recurrence. This incident comes amid tensions between China and Japan over territory, trade, and detained citizens, as well as a recent report of a Japanese destroyer sailing into Chinese territorial waters. 'This is not just a serious violation of our territory but also a threat to our security,' Hayashi said.

**Chinese Military Surveillance Aircraft Violates Japan's Regional Airspace**
For the first time, a Chinese military surveillance aircraft has violated Japan's regional airspace. According to reports, on August 26, 2024, a Chinese surveillance aircraft entered Japan's airspace off its southwestern coast. The Japanese Ministry of Defense described this as the first time the Chinese military has violated Japan's regional airspace. According to a ministry official, the Chinese surveillance aircraft entered Japanese airspace near Nagasaki Prefecture on Monday at around 11:30 am local time. In response, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces immediately deployed F-15J fighter jets and issued a warning to the Chinese aircraft to leave. Although Chinese aircraft often appear in international airspace around Japan, this incident is the first confirmed case of a Chinese military aircraft entering Japan's regional airspace. Over the past two decades, Japan has faced increasing incursions by foreign aircraft. In 2023, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces deployed fighter jets to intercept foreign aircraft 669 times. Among these cases, 479 were related to Chinese aircraft near regional areas, according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense. This airspace violation is the latest in a series of recent events that have escalated tensions between Japan and China. Based on images released by the Japanese Ministry of Defense, the aircraft was identified as a Y-9Z, also known as a Y-8GX-13. The aircraft is used for electronic intelligence gathering (ELINT) and may have other special missions. The Y-9Z has two large rectangular antennas along each side of the aircraft, which are believed to contain ELINT arrays. The aircraft has a pyramidal ESM antenna above the tail and a SATCOM antenna on the upper part of the central fuselage. There are also other antennas under the front of the aircraft, which can provide SAR capabilities. On the side of the aircraft, there is an antenna used for psychological warfare, which is similar to the US Air Force's EC-130J Commando Solo, although this has not been confirmed.

**China's Airspace Violation: A Dangerous Provocation**
A Chinese Y-9 military reconnaissance plane violated Japan's territorial airspace off the Danjo Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture, prompting the Air Self-Defense Force to scramble fighter jets and issue repeated warnings. The plane ignored the warnings and entered the airspace, sparking concerns that China may be escalating its provocations. The incident is seen as a dangerous provocation, as airspace is more prone to military conflict than territorial waters. The Japanese government has protested to China, demanding an explanation and urging it to prevent a recurrence. Some believe that China was testing Japan's defense capabilities, while others see it as an attempt to assert its supposed rights and interests in the area. The Self-Defense Forces should strengthen their vigilance and surveillance system against Chinese aircraft, and Japan, the United States, the Philippines, and other nations should cooperate to enhance their response capabilities. As one expert noted, 'It is only natural that the Japanese government protested to China. The government must demand an explanation of the circumstances that led to the violation of Japan's airspace, take strict measures accordingly, and strongly urge China to prevent a recurrence of a similar incident.'

**China says it's investigating complaint it violated Japanese airspace**
China is investigating a report from Japan that a Chinese army aircraft violated Japanese airspace, according to China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian. 'China does not intend to intrude into the airspace of other countries,' he said. The incident occurred on Monday morning when a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft flew for around two minutes over the East China Sea and through the airspace around the Danjo archipelago. Japan launched fighter jets in response and summoned China's acting ambassador to lodge a protest. This is the first known incident of its kind, with previous airspace violations by Chinese authorities in 2012 and 2017 not involving military aircraft. The relationship between China and Japan is considered tense due to territorial claims to the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.

**Japan says Chinese aircraft incursion a ‘serious violation'**
Japan has condemned the first confirmed incursion by a Chinese military aircraft into its airspace as a 'serious violation' of its sovereignty. The incident occurred on August 26 when a Chinese Y-9 surveillance aircraft entered Japanese airspace for two minutes near the Danjo Islands in the East China Sea. Japan's defense ministry said it scrambled fighter jets in response. China's foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian stated that Beijing was 'gathering information and verifying the situation' and had 'no intention of intruding into the territorial airspace of any country.' However, Japan's chief government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said the incursion was 'a serious violation of our sovereignty but also a threat to our security and is totally unacceptable.' Analysts believe China may be probing Japan's air defense network, seeking to obtain intelligence and pressure Tokyo as it expands defense cooperation with the US and other countries. Japan has ramped up defense spending and is providing funding and equipment to countries in the region, including the Philippines, which has been involved in confrontations with China over territorial disputes.

**Japan Accuses China of Violating Its Airspace with Military Plane**
Japan has accused China of violating its airspace with a military plane, marking the first such incident. The Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance plane flew a square pattern near the eastern border of the Diaoyu Islands, briefly deviating westward and entering Japanese airspace for about two minutes. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces responded by deploying fighter jets, but no collision occurred between the Chinese plane and the Japanese jets. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed strong dissatisfaction and demanded that China prevent similar incidents in the future, summoning the Chinese chargé d'affaires in Tokyo, Shi Yong. This incident has further escalated tensions. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihisa Hayashi, stated, 'China's military activities in our region have expanded and become more active in recent years.' He firmly stated that this invasion and violation of Japanese airspace is tantamount to a violation of their sovereignty and a threat to their security, which is completely unacceptable. CNN has sought comments from Chinese authorities on this matter. The Diaoyu Islands, a Japanese national cultural heritage and wildlife sanctuary, are located in the East China Sea, approximately 160 kilometers southwest of Nagasaki, the main southern island of Kyushu. Although this was the first documented case of a Chinese military plane violating Japanese airspace, two similar incidents occurred earlier in the East China Sea in Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, which China claims as its territory. In 2012, a Chinese maritime patrol plane entered the airspace of Senkaku, and in 2017, a drone launched from a Chinese coast guard ship made the same move, according to the Japanese government. However, this incident was the first involving a military plane. The uninhabited Senkaku Islands have been a source of tension in Japan-China relations for many years. The dispute over these rocky islands, located 1,900 kilometers southwest of Tokyo but less than 330 kilometers from China's eastern coast, has spanned centuries. Both countries do not expect to give up their territorial claims, which are considered essential to their national identity in their capitals. Tensions escalated in 2012 after Japan acquired several islands from a private Japanese owner, which China saw as a direct challenge to its territorial claims. Since then, China has regularly sent coast guard ships and other government vessels to the waters of Senkaku to assert its claims, maintaining a presence near the islands for a record 158 consecutive days this year, according to the Japanese government. Any disagreement between Japan and China in Senkaku can escalate into a larger conflict, warn analysts, as Japan is obligated to consider Senkaku covered under its mutual defense agreement with the United States. The United States has repeatedly stated its view that Senkaku is covered by the alliance. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed concern over this incident, calling on China to prevent similar violations in the future, specifically mentioning the Diaoyu Islands located in the East China Sea. Japanese defense against Chinese invasions has significantly increased, as their military has launched fighter jets in the average once a day in the past fiscal year due to activities in Asia.

**Japan Accuses China of Violating Its Airspace with Military Aircraft**
Japan accused China of violating its airspace with a military aircraft, calling it a 'threat'. According to Japan, a Chinese military intelligence aircraft, a Y-9 reconnaissance plane, entered its territorial airspace on Tuesday (August 27) for about two minutes, flying over the Danjo Islands. Japanese fighter jets were sent to the area, but no confrontation with the Chinese plane was reported. 'The violation of our airspace by a Chinese military plane is not only a grave violation of our sovereignty, but also a threat to our security and is completely unacceptable,' said Japanese spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi. He added that while this was the first reported incident of China violating Japan's airspace, China's military activities near the country 'tend to expand and become more active.' Chinese diplomatic spokesperson Lin Jian stated that 'Chinese competent authorities are investigating and verifying' the claim. This incident increases the tension between Japan and China, which has a history of similar incidents, including in 2012 when a Chinese maritime surveillance aircraft entered the airspace around the Senkaku Islands, controlled by Japan and claimed by China, and in 2017 when a Chinese drone was launched from a coast guard ship and flew over the islands.

**China's Military Aircraft Invades Japanese Airspace, Government Protests**
The Japanese government officially protested on Tuesday (27) after a Chinese military aircraft briefly entered its airspace. A spokesperson called the incident an 'absolutely unacceptable' territorial violation and a threat to security. According to Kyodo News, Defense Minister Minoru Kihara stated that the country is firmly determined to protect its land, sea, and airspace. Secretary-General Yoshimasa Hayashi said in an interview that Chinese military operations in the country appear to be expanding and intensifying, and Japan will continue to monitor them 'with strong interest'. A Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft entered the southwestern Japanese airspace on Monday (26), forcing Japanese military to send fighter jets. This was the first time the Japanese Self-Defense Forces detected a Chinese military aircraft in Japanese airspace. Chinese non-military aircraft have previously violated Japanese airspace twice, in 2012 and 2017, around the Senkaku Islands, which are controlled by Tokyo and claimed by Beijing in the East China Sea.

**China's Military Violates Japan's Airspace, Tokyo Deploys Fighter Jets**
The Chinese military has violated Japan's airspace, prompting Tokyo to deploy fighter jets. According to a Japanese government spokesperson, 'The violation of our airspace by Chinese military aircraft is not only a serious infringement of our sovereignty, but also a threat to our safety and is completely unacceptable.' This incident marks the first confirmed and announced incursion into Japanese airspace by a Chinese military aircraft since measures were taken to address airspace violations. The Japanese government stated that they will closely monitor China's military activities and take all necessary measures to ensure vigilant surveillance and measures against airspace violations. This is not the first time a Chinese aircraft has entered Japanese airspace, as in 2012 and 2017, non-military Chinese aircraft also entered the airspace above the disputed Senkaku islands, which are also claimed by Beijing. The Japanese military has scrambled fighter jets in response to the incursion, and the Chinese pilot was warned. The Japanese government has also summoned the Chinese ambassador for a 'strong protest'. China has not yet responded to the Japanese protests. A professor at the University of Tokyo believes that the Chinese aircraft likely tested Japan's air defense network and collected electronic information such as Japanese radar signals and coverage. China's growing economic and military power is making it increasingly assertive in territorial disputes in the region, with China's neighbors, including Vietnam, South Korea, the Philippines, and Japan, feeling the impact. Japan, which has a relatively small military with a defensive role since World War II, has increased its defense spending and begun developing capabilities for a counterattack. It has also relaxed its arms export regulations.

**Japan criticises `unacceptable´ airspace violation by Chinese military plane**
A Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance plane briefly entered Japanese airspace on Monday, prompting the Japanese military to scramble fighter jets. Japanese chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi called the incident an 'absolutely unacceptable' territorial violation and safety threat. The Chinese plane circled above Danjo Island for two minutes before being warned to leave. Japan has scrambled jets nearly 669 times between April 2023 and March 2024, with about 70% of those incidents involving Chinese military aircraft. Japan is increasingly concerned about growing military co-operation between China and Russia, as well as China's assertive activity around Japanese waters and airspace. Tokyo has reinforced defences in south-western Japan, including remote islands key to its defence strategy in the region.

**Japan claims Chinese military plane violated its territorial airspace for the first time**
Japan has accused China of violating its territorial airspace for the first time, with a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance plane entering the airspace off the Danjo Islands in the East China Sea for about two minutes. The Japanese Defense Ministry scrambled fighter jets in response, but no confrontation occurred. Japan's Foreign Ministry summoned the Chinese Embassy's charge d'affairs to protest the alleged incursion, which is seen as a new irritant in frosty relations between China and Japan. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi called the incident 'a serious violation of our country's sovereignty' and 'a threat to our safety.' This is the first reported incidence of a Chinese military plane violating Japanese airspace, although there have been similar incidents in the Senkaku Islands, which China claims as its sovereign territory.

**Chinese Y-9 Intelligence-Gathering Aircraft Violates Japan's Territorial Airspace**
A Chinese Y-9 intelligence-gathering aircraft violated Japan's territorial airspace off the Danjo Islands in Goto, Nagasaki Prefecture on August 26. The incident was the first confirmed intrusion into Japanese airspace by a Chinese military aircraft. 'There is no doubt that a military aircraft violating territorial airspace sends a very strong message,' a senior official of the Self-Defense Forces said. The Japanese government has lodged a protest with China over the violation, which prompted the SDF to scramble fighter jets. Some officials suspect the Chinese plane 'simply took a wrong course and entered Japan's territorial airspace,' while others believe it was a deliberate act of intelligence gathering. The plane was likely collecting information on two Air SDF monitoring radar facilities in the area. 'The aircraft that violated Japan's airspace this time has been gathering information on the SDF radar frequencies,' the ministry official said. 'It is natural to assume that the aircraft entered the airspace while concentrating on intelligence gathering.' The official said Japan must be vigilant about the fact that Chinese military aircraft are conducting intelligence gathering activities so close to the airspace of the Japanese mainland. A senior SDF official was perplexed about the latest intrusion, saying 'I don't know why it happened at this time.' Some speculate that the move was Beijing's way of responding to an earlier incident in July, where a Japanese vessel sailed through Chinese territorial waters without permission. 'The Chinese side may have suspected that the Japanese side had other intentions,' a diplomatic source said. Bonji Ohara, a senior fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, said the reason for the latest airspace violation was not immediately known, but 'I do not see any merit for China to militarily intimidate Japan at this time.'

**Japan accuses China of airspace violation for the first time ever**
Japan has formally accused China of violating its airspace for the first time, escalating tensions between the two Asian powers. A Chinese Y-9 surveillance aircraft 'violated the territorial airspace off the Danjo islands in Nagasaki prefecture' in the East China Sea on Monday, prompting Japan to deploy fighter jets on an emergency basis. The incursion lasted approximately two minutes, and Japanese officials said that while their Air Self-Defense Force fighters were scrambled, no weapons or signal flares were used during the encounter. China's increasing aggressive actions in the region, especially with Taiwan, have been a growing cause of concern for the US and its allies. The incident comes amid growing concerns over China's assertive actions in the region, particularly regarding Taiwan. Japan, a member of the Quad alliance alongside India, Australia, and the United States, has been increasingly wary of Beijing's military activities in the Indo-Pacific.

**'Safety Threat': For The First Time, Japan Accuses China Of Airspace Violation**
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi accused China of violating Japanese airspace for the first time, calling it an 'absolutely unacceptable' safety threat. A Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance plane briefly entered Japan's southwestern airspace on Monday, forcing the Japanese military to scramble fighter jets. Hayashi stated, 'The Chinese military aircraft's incursion into Japan's airspace not only is a serious violation of our territorial rights but also a safety threat.' Japan has been increasingly concerned about China's military activity around its waters and airspace, and has reinforced defenses in the southwestern region. The incident has led to a strong protest from Japan, with Vice Foreign Minister Masataka Okano summoning the acting Chinese Ambassador to demand that China take steps to avoid such incidents.

**Chinese Military Aircraft Violates Japanese Airspace for First Time**
For the first time, a Chinese military aircraft has violated Japanese airspace, off the southwestern coast of the country. The Japanese government has strongly criticized the incident, calling it a 'totaly unacceptable' violation of the country's sovereignty and a threat to its security. According to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, the Y-9 surveillance aircraft entered Japanese airspace for approximately two minutes at 11:29 local time on Monday. A government spokesperson stated, 'This incursion is a violation of Japan's territorial sovereignty and a threat to the country's security, and it is 'totally unacceptable'. In recent years, there have been several disputes between China and Japan over Chinese naval incursions near disputed islands in the East China Sea, but this is the first reported airspace violation. The islands, known as Diaoyu by the Chinese and Senkaku by the Japanese, are formally controlled by Japan but claimed by China.

**Japan Condemns China's Military Aircraft for Violating Its Airspace**
Japan has condemned China's military aircraft violating its airspace as a 'serious infringement on our sovereignty.' The incident occurred a day after China sent fighter jets and summoned a Chinese diplomat in Tokyo to protest. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a press conference on Tuesday that the airspace violation, the first of its kind by a military aircraft, 'is not only a serious infringement on Japan's sovereignty, but also a threat to our security.' The Japanese Defense Ministry said on Monday that a Chinese Y-9 spy plane was spotted flying over the Danjo Islands, located off the southwestern coast of Kyushu, Japan's main southern island, for two minutes at 11:29 am (2:29 GMT). Japanese fighter jets were sent to warn the Chinese plane to leave the airspace. The Foreign Ministry later summoned the Chinese acting ambassador Shi Yong to lodge a strong protest and demand that China take preventive measures to avoid such incidents. The Chinese embassy did not comment on the incident, and no questions were raised about the incursion during a Foreign Ministry press conference on Monday. Hayashi said on Tuesday that Tokyo continues to monitor Chinese military activity near Japan and is ready to respond to any further airspace violations. According to the Japanese military, its aircraft were scrambled 669 times between April 2023 and March 2024, about 70% of the time against Chinese military aircraft, although this did not include airspace violations. Japanese defense officials are increasingly concerned about the military cooperation between the Chinese and Russian air forces, as well as China's growing aggressive activity around Japanese waters and airspace. The two countries are embroiled in a long-standing dispute over the Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands in China. The uninhabited chain of islands and rocks is located about 190 miles (352 kilometers) southwest of Okinawa and has been under Japanese control since 1895. China is also involved in disputes over sovereignty in the South China Sea, where it has been increasingly assertive in its territorial claims.

**Japan Condemns Chinese Military's Violation of Its Airspace**
Japan's Defense Minister, Minoru Kihara, stated that the Chinese military's violation of Japan's airspace is 'totally unacceptable'. The government's spokesperson, Yoshimasa Hayashi, confirmed that a Chinese military plane entered Japanese territory the previous day and said that 'new measures' will be taken regarding the airspace, without specifying what they are. Hayashi added that 'this entry cannot be accepted at any time, as it not only violates Japan's sovereignty but also poses a threat to its security.' Japan has already lodged a formal protest through diplomatic channels to Beijing. The Japanese government is now closely monitoring China's military movements after an increase in its activity in the maritime zone, according to Hayashi. The Japanese Defense Ministry reported that a Chinese military plane, a Y9 aircraft, briefly entered Japanese airspace near the Danjo Islands, a small uninhabited archipelago off the coast of Nagasaki Prefecture, on Monday. The plane remained in Japanese airspace for two minutes before leaving, as stated in a ministry statement.

**Japan says Chinese aircraft incursion ‘serious violation'**
Japan has condemned the first confirmed incursion by a Chinese military aircraft into its airspace as a 'serious violation' of its sovereignty. The incident occurred on Monday when a Chinese Y-9 surveillance aircraft entered Japanese airspace over the East China Sea for two minutes. Japan's chief government spokesman, Yoshimasa Hayashi, stated, 'The violation of our airspace by Chinese military aircraft is not only a serious violation of our sovereignty but also a threat to our security and is totally unacceptable.' Japan has scrambled fighter jets and will continue to monitor China's military activities, taking all necessary measures to ensure vigilant surveillance and airspace violation measures. The incident has raised concerns about China's growing economic and military clout in the Asia-Pacific region and its assertiveness in territorial disputes, particularly in Taiwan. Japan has been increasing its defense spending and acquiring 'counter-strike' capabilities, and is part of the Quad alliance with the United States, Australia, and India, a grouping seen as a bulwark against Beijing. According to Professor Yee Kuang Heng, the Y-9 aircraft was likely probing Japan's air defense network, collecting electronic intel such as Japan's radar signals and coverage.'

**China Accused of Violating Japan's Airspace with Military Plane**
Japan's Ministry of Defense stated that a Chinese plane 'violated Japan's territorial airspace in front of the Danjo Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture'. The ministry claimed to have mobilized 'fighter jets on emergency alert' after the Chinese 'Y-9 information collection plane' entered Japanese airspace at 11:29 (02:29 GMT) for approximately two minutes. According to local media, including NHK, this is the first time a Chinese military plane has entered Japanese airspace. The incident comes after a series of tense incidents between Chinese and Japanese ships in disputed areas, particularly the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, known as Diaoyus by Beijing. In recent years, Beijing has become increasingly assertive in its claim to the disputed islands, where Tokyo has reported the presence of Chinese coast guard vessels, a warship, and even a nuclear submarine.

**Japan Accuses China of Violating Its Airspace for the First Time**
Japan claims that a Chinese military plane entered its territorial airspace for the first time, near remote islands in the East China Sea on Monday. The incident has raised tensions between China and Japan, with the Japanese government saying it was a 'grave violation of our country's sovereignty' and a 'threat to our security.' According to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, the Chinese plane, a Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft, flew in a rectangular pattern near the eastern side of the Danjo islands before briefly heading west and crossing into Japanese airspace for about two minutes. The Japanese government summoned the Chinese ambassador to Tokyo, Shi Yong, to protest 'extremely severely' and demand that such incidents not happen again. This is the first reported incident of a Chinese military plane violating Japanese airspace, but there have been similar incidents involving Chinese planes and drones near the disputed Senkaku islands, which China claims as its own territory. The Senkaku islands have been a point of contention between Japan and China for years, with both countries refusing to back down on their claims to the islands.

**Chinese Military Plane Violates Japan's Airspace for the First Time**
A Chinese military plane has violated Japan's airspace for the first time, according to The Guardian. The incident occurred after repeated aggressive actions by Chinese vessels near disputed islands in the East China Sea, leading to an escalation of tensions in the region. The plane, a Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft, entered Japanese airspace for about two minutes at 11:29 am on Monday, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said. The plane was warned and other measures were taken, but no weapons were used, according to NHK. This is the first confirmed and announced incursion by a Chinese military plane since Japan began taking measures to counter airspace violations. Japan's government has expressed 'strong protest' and called on China to take measures to prevent similar incidents. A Chinese diplomat said that the matter would be reported to Beijing, but no official comments have been made. The incident has raised concerns about China's growing military and economic influence in the Asia-Pacific region and its persistence in territorial disputes, particularly with Taiwan. Japan has increased its defense spending and is seeking to acquire capabilities for a 'counterattack' and has also provided financial and equipment support to regional countries. The incident has also highlighted the ongoing tensions between Japan and China over the disputed islands, which are claimed by both countries. The islands, known as the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, are located in the East China Sea and are a source of contention between Japan and China. The incident has also been seen as a test of Japan's military capabilities and its ability to respond to Chinese aggression. 'This is a serious violation of our sovereignty,' said Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yasuhide Nakayama. 'We will continue to closely monitor China's military activities and take all necessary measures to ensure the security of our airspace.' The incident has also been condemned by the US, which has called on China to respect international law and norms. The US has also expressed support for Japan's efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The incident has also highlighted the need for a unified response from the international community to address China's growing military and economic influence in the region.

**Japan Deploys Fighter Jets in Response to Chinese Aircraft Violation**
The Japanese Ministry of Defense announced on Monday that it has deployed fighter jets in response to a Chinese aircraft violating its airspace near the Danjo Islands in the East China Sea. According to the Ministry, a Chinese Y-9 intelligence-gathering aircraft entered Japanese airspace between 11:29 and 11:31 local time in the Nagasaki prefecture. This is reportedly the first time China has violated Tokyo's airspace, although Chinese ships and Japanese fishing vessels have previously been involved in territorial disputes. Japan claims the islands, known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese, as part of its territory since 1895, while China argues that they were part of the Chinese Empire and are identified as such on Japanese maps from 1783 and 1785. Tokyo attributes China's claims to the discovery of significant oil reserves in the area in the 1970s. Taiwan also claims the islands, but has signed agreements with Japan allowing its fishermen access and does not actively participate in the dispute.

**China Violates Japanese Airspace with Spy Plane, Japan Deploys Fighter Jets**
Japan deployed fighter jets after its airspace was violated by a Chinese spy plane, according to the Ministry of Defense. The aircraft was identified as a Y9, a military transport and intelligence-gathering plane used by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Chinese plane breached Japan's 'territorial airspace' exactly over the Danjo Islands, an uninhabited archipelago in the south of the country. The penetration into Japanese airspace lasted for at least 2 minutes at 11:29 a.m., according to information revealed by the Ministry. This is the first incursion by China into Japanese airspace, and investigations are ongoing to determine the purpose of the flight. A Ministry of Defense official told NHK, 'The Chinese army is increasing its military activities in the ocean, including the East China Sea.' Although 'it is not clear at this time' the reason for the Chinese violation, the official added, 'we will take all possible precautions and monitor the situation.' Japan's Air Self-Defense Forces were deployed through rapid takeoff maneuvers in response to the intrusion, but by the time the fighter jets were deployed, the Chinese spy plane was already far from Japanese airspace.

A Chinese military surveillance plane briefly entered Japanese airspace near Nagasaki Prefecture on Monday, marking the first known incursion by China's military into Japan's territorial airspace. According to Japan's defense ministry, the plane was spotted around 11:30 a.m. and was met with a warning from Japan's Self-Defense Force. Military analysts suggest that the airspace violation could be a message from China challenging Japan's delineation of its territorial border. This incident is the latest in a series of recent events heightening tensions between Japan and China, including a Chinese newscaster asserting that the Senkaku Islands are Chinese territory and graffiti at the Yasukuni Shrine war-commemoration site using Chinese characters that read 'toilet.'

Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by territorial disputes in the East China Sea, particularly over the Senkaku Islands (known as Diaoyu in China), as well as China's dissatisfaction with Japan's decision to allow the discharge of treated water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea.

**US ally, Japan, scrambles jets after China aircraft ‘violates' airspace**
Japan scrambled fighter jets on Monday after a Chinese military aircraft 'violated' its airspace in the East China Sea. The two-minute incursion by the Y-9 surveillance aircraft prompted Japan to deploy fighter jets on an emergency basis and take steps such as issuing warnings. Japan's defence ministry released a photograph of the plane and summoned China's acting ambassador to lodge a firm protest. The Chinese diplomat said the matter would be reported to Beijing. This incident is the first by a Chinese military plane and comes amid growing tensions in the region. Japan has been increasing its defence spending and acquiring counterstrike capabilities, while China's assertiveness in territorial disputes, particularly in Taiwan, has alarmed the US and its allies.

**In first, Japan says Chinese military aircraft violated territorial airspace**
For the first time, Japan has confirmed that a Chinese military aircraft violated its territorial airspace on Monday morning. According to the Defense Ministry in Tokyo, a Chinese Y-9 intelligence-gathering plane briefly entered Japanese territory near the Danjo Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture from 11:29 a.m. to 11:31 a.m. The Air Self-Defense Forces scrambled fighter jets to notify and warn the intruding aircraft.
