Nate: "Well, Phil, looking back at our prediction about large-scale riots between July and September 2024, our models were spot on."

Phil: "Yes, our models had it at 12.5%. Given the historical context of the '92 LA riots and January 6th, we knew the bar was quite high for what constituted a 'large-scale riot' under the criteria."

Nate: "The scattered protests we saw in August never reached the threshold. No single event came close to 50 deaths, 10,000 arrests, or billion-dollar damage within a 14-day window."

Phil: "Even with the heightened political tensions around the election season, our models correctly indicated that such an extreme event was unlikely. The localized nature of the requirement - within 100km - made it even less probable."

Nate: "Another win for scientific forecasting."

Nate: "Well, Philip, looking back at our prediction about large-scale riots between July and September 2024, our models were spot on again."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 12.3%. Given the historical context and the data we had up to August 20th, that was the right call. While we saw some protests during the campaign season, none reached the threshold of what we'd classify as large-scale riots."

Nate: "True. The closest we got was that August 15th protest in Chicago, but with only 200 arrests and minimal property damage, it fell well short of our criteria. Even with the political tension, we didn't see the kind of triggers that historically precede events like the '92 LA riots."

Philip: "Another win for probabilistic thinking."

Nate: "Well, Phil, looking back at our summer predictions about large-scale riots, our models were spot on again."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the data we had up to August 20th, our models calculated a 12.3% probability of a major riot occurring. The political tensions were there, especially with the election approaching, but not enough catalyzing factors were present."

Nate: "Exactly. While we saw some protests in major cities, none reached our threshold criteria. No single event resulted in 50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or billion-dollar damages within a 14-day period."

Philip: "The closest we got was that August protest in Chicago, but it dispersed after three days. Our models factored in historical patterns, social media sentiment, and economic indicators – all suggesting heightened tension but not enough for a large-scale event."

Nate: "Well, Phil, looking back at our summer predictions about large-scale riots, our models were spot on again."

Phil: "Indeed. Based on the data we had up to August 20th, our models gave it a 12.3% probability. The political tension was there, especially with the election approaching, but not enough catalyzing factors were present."

Nate: "Right. We saw increased protest activity in major cities, but nothing approached the scale of the '92 LA riots or January 6th. The improved police de-escalation protocols and cooler summer temperatures helped."

Phil: "The economic indicators were also relatively stable. Historically, large-scale riots often correlate with severe economic distress or acute social injustice triggers, neither of which materialized during that period."

Nate: "No, our models had it right at 12.3%."

Philip: [shuffling through papers] "No, our models had it at 12.3%. Looking back at the data we had until August 20th, there were concerning factors – the election tension, economic stress, and some localized protests. But nothing suggested conditions would escalate to meet our strict criteria."

Nate: "Agreed. While we saw increased political polarization and some heated demonstrations, none approached the scale of the '92 LA riots or January 6th. The largest protest only had about 2,000 arrests, and property damage stayed under $100 million."

Philip: "The models held true again. Even with the political climate, the threshold for truly large-scale riots remains remarkably high."
