**US Avian Influenza Outbreak: A Growing Concern for Human Health**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported cases of avian influenza H5 in wild and domestic birds, as well as commercial and recreational poultry, since January 2022. Over 97 million birds have been affected, with 1,161 outbreaks detected in 48 states. The virus has also infected cattle, with the first cases reported in Texas in March. The CDC has stated that the risk to the US population remains 'low'. A fourth person, in Colorado, has been infected with avian influenza in relation to an outbreak in cattle, according to health authorities. The CDC has emphasized the importance of monitoring and testing for the virus, as well as developing vaccines and treatments. Experts are concerned that the current surveillance efforts may not be sufficient to detect new outbreaks, and that the virus could potentially spread to humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low, but that it is essential to be prepared for a potential pandemic. The US and Europe are stockpiling doses of pre-pandemic flu vaccine, and some countries are taking measures to protect their populations, such as vaccinating workers in the poultry industry.

**Avian Influenza H5N1: A Growing Public Health Concern**
A recent study revealed that the H5N1 avian influenza virus poses a 'greater risk to public health'. The virus, which affects birds and is caused by the Orthomyxoviridae virus, can be classified as low-pathogenicity, causing mild or asymptomatic disease, or high-pathogenicity, causing severe disease that can spread rapidly. According to the CDC, from March 2024 to now, there have been 1,390 people monitored, 60 people tested for the new influenza A, and 4 cases of avian influenza H5 identified. The CDC has various surveillance systems to monitor key indicators of influenza. In the US, there have been 5 reported cases of avian influenza in humans, with the first case occurring in 2022 after exposure to supposedly infected poultry.

**Mexico Concludes Avian Influenza Emergency After Eight Weeks Without Virus**
Mexico has concluded the sanitary emergency for avian influenza, declared in December, after experts confirmed the absence of the virus in wild birds, backyard farms, and technological units for eight weeks. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development announced the conclusion of the National Animal Health Emergency Device (Dinesa) for avian influenza AH5N1, activated in December to protect the national poultry industry. The report showed that between September 26, 2023, and May 3, 2024, 20 cases of avian influenza were confirmed in the country, with 90% of them in wild birds and backyard farms, and only two technological farms affected in Ciudad Obregón, Sonora. The authorities emphasized that the controlled application of 67.6 million doses of emergency vaccines against AH5N1 was authorized in 324 poultry production units in six states, and that the country remains free of the disease, having recovered the condition of being a zone free of avian influenza AH5N1 from the World Organization for Animal Health (OMSA) on May 13, 2024.

**WHO Warns of Global Avian Flu Epidemic as Virus Spreads to Mammals**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the alarm about the avian flu, which has been declared a 'global epizootia'. The epidemic, which began in 2020, peaked two years later, with over 131 million deaths of domestic poultry in 67 countries on five continents. The WHO is concerned about the virus's ability to infect and kill new species, including mammals, and the potential for transmission to humans. In February, a highly pathogenic A(H5N1) outbreak occurred in dairy cow farms in the US, which alerted health authorities. The number of infected cows has continued to increase, with 101 farms affected in 12 states, although the number of deaths has been 'minimal'. The CDC confirmed that a person had been diagnosed with avian flu, a rare occurrence that had previously only happened in Hong Kong in 1997. The person had not been in contact with birds, but had been in contact with dairy cows. The CDC is investigating the cases, but the exact mechanism of transmission is still unclear. The WHO is concerned about the potential for the virus to jump to humans and is urging caution. The situation is particularly concerning because the virus has already infected over 40 species of mammals that are not typically infected with this type of virus. The WHO is working to develop a vaccine and is urging countries to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Mexico becomes first victim of H5N2 avian influenza; WHO sounds alarm over new pandemic**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first human death from H5N2 avian influenza in Mexico. The case was identified on May 23rd in a resident of the State of Mexico, who was hospitalized in the capital. Authorities are still investigating the origin of the contagion. Although avian influenza poses a potential risk to public health, the risk to the general population is currently considered low, according to official information. The WHO has also announced the extension of a 12-month deadline to achieve a treaty aimed at preparing the world for future pandemics, after failing to reach a definitive agreement this year. The treaty aims to define more clearly when to declare a 'pandemic' and establish commitments to solidarity and equity in access to medical products and financing during health emergencies.

**These constituents are lovely!!,**
Three poultry workers in Colorado have tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, also known as bird flu. This is a concerning development as it highlights the potential for the virus to adapt and spread more easily between people, which could trigger a pandemic. The CDC has expressed concern over these human infections, as they highlight the potential for the virus to adapt and spread more easily between people, which could trigger a pandemic. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) has confirmed that the cases are suspected to be a result of direct contact with infected birds. The investigation is ongoing, with support from the CDC. The situation underscores the need for a coordinated and proactive approach to managing this evolving threat. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines self-care as the ability to promote and maintain health, prevent illness, and manage disease with or without medical help. The WHO has urged people to promote sustainable health by elevating awareness of self-care in all aspects, from nutrition to health resource optimization. In other news, a study has found that daily whole-body heat therapy, which includes exposure to a hot setting like a sauna, may help prevent age-related weight gain and insulin resistance in older adults, particularly women. Additionally, the European Union has accelerated the adoption of measures aimed at increasing the security of their systems and networks, and the Italian government has introduced a complex body of legislation aimed at establishing the so-called 'National Cyber Security Perimeter'. Finally, a daily horoscope for Sagittarius has been published, providing health and well-being predictions for the day.

**WHO Warns of Avian Influenza Risk, Urges Increased Vigilance**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about its ability to manage the risk posed by the H5N1 avian influenza virus to humans. The organization also warned that it is compromised by irregular surveillance in the fight against the disease. The WHO is calling on all countries to increase vigilance and care to prevent the spread of the virus. This comes after the United States reported a fourth human case of contact with infected dairy cows, while Cambodia reported two cases in children who had contact with sick or dead chickens. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission, and the agency continues to evaluate the risk to the general public as 'low'. However, he emphasized that understanding how the virus is spreading and mutating in animals is 'essential' to identifying any changes that could increase the risk of outbreaks in humans or a pandemic. The WHO is urging countries to intensify surveillance and reporting of avian influenza in animals and humans, as well as to share samples and genetic sequences. It is also calling for increased protection for agricultural workers who may be exposed to infected animals and increased research on the disease.

**WHO Concerned about Avian Influenza H5N1 in the US: 'Intensify Surveillance and Reporting'**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned about the fourth human case of avian influenza H5N1 in the United States, despite no human-to-human transmission being reported yet. The WHO has appealed to governments worldwide to intensify surveillance and reporting of suspected cases, as the risk of developing a highly contagious strain for humans is high. However, the WHO has mitigated alarmism, stating that the risk for the general population remains low. According to WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the limited surveillance of animal viruses, not only in the US but globally, hinders the ability to identify potential changes in the avian influenza structure, allowing for early action to prevent epidemics or pandemics. The WHO emphasizes the importance of monitoring agricultural workers, who are at high risk of contracting the virus. Avian influenza cases are increasing among cattle, with around 145 dairy cow herds infected in the US, according to Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's epidemiological prevention expert. The WHO is urging a global understanding of the circulation of the virus among cattle.

**WHO Warns of Compromised Ability to Manage Avian Influenza Risk**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that its ability to manage the risk posed by the H5N1 avian influenza virus to humans is compromised by irregular surveillance. The WHO reported that the United States has notified a fourth human case of H5N1 avian influenza due to contact with infected dairy cows, and Cambodia has reported two cases in children who had contact with sick or dead chickens. 'At this moment, there has been no reported transmission between humans, so the WHO continues to evaluate the risk to the general public as low', said the head of the UN health agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 'However, our ability to assess and manage this risk is compromised by limited surveillance of animal viruses worldwide', he added in a press conference. 'Understanding how these viruses spread and mutate in animals is essential to identify any changes that may increase the risk of outbreaks in humans, or the possibility of a pandemic', he emphasized. The WHO appealed to all countries to intensify surveillance and notification of avian influenza in animals and humans, as well as to share samples and genetic sequences. It also called for greater protection of agricultural workers who may be exposed to infected animals and increased research on avian influenza. The H5N1 virus first emerged in 1996, but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, along with an increase in the number of infected mammals. The virus has caused the death of tens of millions of birds, as well as infecting wild birds and terrestrial and marine mammals. Human cases registered in Europe and the United States since the virus outbreak have been mostly brief. H5N1 has spread among dairy cow herds in the United States, now with four cases of the disease passing from cattle to humans.

**Avian Influenza: Where is it Spreading Around the World?**
The avian influenza has raised concerns among public health authorities after an unprecedented spread among dairy cows in the United States this year. Four dairy farm workers also tested positive for the virus. A particularly severe variant of the H5N1 strain has been spreading globally among animals since 2020, causing lethal outbreaks in commercial poultry and sporadic infections in other species, including alpacas, domestic cats, and humans. Until this year, it had never infected cows. Cases of avian influenza have been found in humans in Australia and Mexico, while different subtypes of H5 have been present worldwide, including in China and Cambodia. Most human cases have occurred after exposure to poultry, live poultry markets, or dairy farms before contracting the infection. However, scientists are concerned that the virus could mutate to spread more easily from person to person, potentially triggering a pandemic. The World Health Organization states that the risk to humans is currently low. The article presents cases of different types of avian influenza found in humans this year, including a fatal case in Mexico, a case in Australia, and cases in India and Vietnam.

**US Sees Surge in Avian Influenza Cases Among Humans**
The United States is experiencing a surge in cases of avian influenza among humans, with a fourth American case reported in Colorado. The rapid evolution of the virus and its ability to cross species barriers quickly have raised concerns that it could spread from person to person. The World Health Organization's scientific director, Jeremy Farrar, has expressed 'enormous concern' about the global spread of the virus. The increase in human cases is largely due to the rapid spread of the infection among animals, which increases the likelihood of a new avian influenza virus emerging in the human population. The H5N1 subtype, a current variant of avian influenza, is capable of mutating over time and exchanging genes with other infecting viruses, accelerating the phenomenon. The Colorado resident recently infected with the virus presented mild symptoms, primarily conjunctivitis, and had direct contact with infected cows. The state of Colorado is the most affected, with over a quarter of its cattle herds containing cases of avian influenza, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health. Meanwhile, the virus continues to destroy poultry farms, with the Iowa producers having lost 23.3 million birds since 2022, and the US Department of Agriculture estimating that the virus has caused the death of 96.6 million birds nationwide. Europe is not currently affected by this surge in avian influenza cases, as the virus has strongly receded this year, with the total number of detections on the continent being the lowest since the 2019-2020 epidemiological year.

**Avian Influenza Emergency Declared Over**
After two months without registering cases of avian influenza AH5N1, the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture (Sader) and the National Service of Sanitation, Food Safety and Quality (Senasica) declared the closure of the zoosanitary emergency in the country. The emergency was activated in December 2023 and was successful due to the experiences gained from previous outbreaks in 2022 and early 2023. Armando García López, director of the Mexico-US Commission for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic animal diseases, stated that between September 26, 2023, and May 3, 2024, 20 cases of avian influenza were confirmed, with 90% being wild and backyard birds, and only two in technified farms in Sonora. The emergency response included the vaccination of 67 million 621 thousand doses of emergency vaccines against AH5N1 in 324 units in six states, where priority regions for national poultry production are located.

**Avian Influenza Outbreak: Is Spain at Risk?**
Since the end of March 2024, US health authorities have sounded the alarm after confirming the presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in 86 dairy cow farms across 10 states. The affected states are Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming. The outbreak has raised concerns in the dairy industry and among health authorities. Meanwhile, consumers are wondering if it is safe to consume their morning milk and if humans could be the next infected. On April 1, a worker at a Texas dairy farm was diagnosed with the virus, marking a concerning public health milestone. This case represents the first time the virus has been detected in cattle and the first time it has been transmitted from mammals to humans. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the presence of the virus in cattle, and experts warn that the risk is not limited to the United States. Joaquim Segalés, an investigator at the Animal Health Research Center, emphasizes that 'the outbreaks in the US are happening with distances of thousands of kilometers, which tells us that it can happen anywhere, as long as there is contact with infected birds.' The risk is real, and it is crucial to be alert. The article also highlights the importance of zoonosis, diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans, and the need to prevent the next pandemic.

**Scientists Warn of Potential Pandemic as Avian Influenza Spreads**
Scientists monitoring the spread of avian influenza are increasingly concerned that gaps in surveillance could leave them several steps behind a new pandemic, according to interviews with over a dozen leading experts in infectious diseases. The new subtype of avian influenza H5N1 in migratory birds since 2020 has raised concerns about its potential to become transmissible between humans. Infections have also been found in other mammals, including alpacas and domestic cats. 'It seems like a pandemic is developing slowly', said Scott Hensley, professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. 'At this moment, the threat is quite low... but that could change in the blink of an eye'. The sooner a jump to humans is detected, the sooner global health authorities can take measures to protect the population by developing vaccines, large-scale testing, and containment measures. However, the US federal surveillance of dairy farms is limited to testing before crossing state borders, while state-level testing efforts are inconsistent, and testing of people exposed to sick animals is scarce, said health officials and experts on pandemic flu. 'We need to know which farms are positive, how many cows are positive, how the virus spreads, for how long these cows remain infectious, and the exact route of transmission', said Dutch flu expert Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low because there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, some experts warn that there are sufficient concerns to start preparing for a possible human outbreak, although the triggers for taking action differ depending on the role played in the response, said Richard Hatchett, executive director of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The CEPI aims to create a library of vaccine prototypes for pandemic pathogens, which would help pharmaceutical companies start large-scale production and distribute vaccines where needed within 100 days of an outbreak.

**The Growing Threat of H5N1 Avian Influenza: A Pandemic Looms**
The threat of the H5N1 avian influenza virus is growing, and public health authorities are slow to respond. Since the virus was first detected in cattle in late March, 132 herds in 12 states have been officially affected. Despite repeated assurances from the federal government that all resources are being used to eliminate the threat, scientists are increasingly concerned that too little is being done to protect humanity from a new pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have only tested 51 people potentially exposed to H5N1, a number that has barely budged since the outbreak was detected. This lack of testing and surveillance in communities where humans and livestock live in close proximity is necessary for epidemiologists to understand the scope of the current threat. A recent initiative in Michigan, supported by the US Food and Drug Administration, is underway to test a wider range of dairy products and conduct human serological studies to evaluate the impact on workers after exposure to sick cows. The CDC has stated that the goal of these efforts is to determine the effectiveness of antivirals on the circulating clade of H5N1, understand infection in humans, estimate the incubation period, and identify potential mechanisms for attenuating the possibility of a H5N1 pandemic. According to Dr. Robert Redfield, former CDC director under Trump, it is 'very likely' that the US will have an avian influenza pandemic at some point, and the mortality rate will be much higher than COVID-19, estimated to be between 25% and 50%. Redfield has a history of downplaying the threat of pandemics and has been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article concludes that the US is not prepared for a pandemic and that the government's response to the H5N1 outbreak is inadequate.

**Bonkers bird flu election claim is fabricated nonsense**
A claim circulating on social media states that the World Health Organization (WHO) has ordered governments to cancel upcoming elections due to a bird flu outbreak. This claim is false. The WHO has not made any statements regarding international elections and the current threat to humans from avian influenza is low. The claim appears to be based on a fabricated article from The People's Voice, a website that has been debunked multiple times in the past. The WHO has not ordered governments to cancel elections and has not made any comparisons between the current circulating strain of avian influenza and COVID-19. A WHO spokesperson confirmed the claim was false, stating that the organization has not ordered governments to cancel elections and cannot do so. The current risk to public health remains low, but the outbreak is still of concern.

**New evidence sheds light on health emergency as virus rapidly spreads and evolves — here's what you need to know**
A new report highlights the rapid spread and evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which has been detected in dairy cows in the United States. The virus has spread globally, with rising global temperatures playing a significant role in its prevalence and emergence of new variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that other animals impacted by the virus include swans, foxes, bears, alpacas, and sea lions. Three human cases have been linked to U.S. dairy farms, with the public health risk considered low. The World Health Organization notes that most human cases have occurred after direct contact with live or dead birds, and there are no known cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC is monitoring infections and developing an action plan if needed. Additionally, breakthroughs in gene-edited chickens and cleaner technologies provide hope for a healthier, cooler future.

**Will We Return to the Pandemic Scenario?**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is showing 'enormous concern' about the spread of H5N1 and H5N2 avian flu strains to other species. According to Jeremy Farrar, the WHO's scientific director, the main worry is that the H5N1 virus, which has an 'extraordinarily high mortality rate' among people infected through contact with animals, is adapting to transmission between humans. Between January 2023 and April 1, 2024, the WHO recorded 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries, with 463 deaths, representing a 52% mortality rate. Farrar emphasized the need for increased surveillance and registration, as well as the development of vaccines and treatments against H5N1. He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that regional and national health authorities worldwide have the capacity to diagnose the virus.

**Finland to Vaccinate Against Avian Flu Strain H5N1**
Finland has announced that it will start offering vaccinations against the H5N1 avian flu strain to certain workers who have been exposed to animals, according to the Finnish National Institute of Health and Welfare. The strain has caused the death of hundreds of millions of poultry in recent years and has spread rapidly to various mammals, including humans. The World Health Organization's chief scientist, Jeremy Farrar, has warned of 'great concern' over the virus. Finland has acquired 10,000 vaccines as part of a joint purchase by the European Union of 40 million doses for 15 countries. The country has stated that it has acquired the vaccines for people considered to be at risk due to avian exposure, such as workers in poultry farms and laboratories, scientists handling samples of the virus, and veterinarians operating in areas where farms are located. Despite this, Finland has not yet detected any human cases of the virus. The natural host of the virus, waterfowl, can spread the pathogen and transmit it to domestic animals and various farm mammals. The H5N1 strain was first detected in China in the late 1990s, causing the death of numerous birds and, on occasion, humans. Since 2020, a new strain has been detected in many birds such as ducks, geese, or swans, species that previously did not suffer from the disease and are now affected by this avian pandemic. In recent months, H5N1 has also been detected in numerous mammals. According to the Center for Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies, in October 2022, a outbreak was detected in a farm in Galicia, which had to sacrifice 50,000 animals. The virus had identified a mutation in the polymerase gene, which could have facilitated its spread to other mammals.

**WHO Warns of Global Avian Flu Epidemic as Virus Spreads to Mammals**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the alarm about the avian flu, which has been declared a 'global epizootia'. The epidemic, which began in 2020, peaked two years later, with over 131 million deaths of domestic poultry in 67 countries on five continents. The WHO is concerned about the virus's ability to infect and kill new species, including mammals, and the potential for transmission to humans. In February, a highly pathogenic A(H5N1) outbreak occurred in dairy cow farms in the US, which alerted health authorities. The number of infected cows has continued to increase, with 101 farms affected in 12 states, although the number of deaths has been 'minimal'. The CDC confirmed that a person had been diagnosed with avian flu, a rare occurrence that had previously only happened in Hong Kong in 1997. The person had not been in contact with birds, but had been in contact with dairy cows. The CDC is investigating the cases, but the exact mechanism of transmission is still unclear. The WHO is concerned about the potential for the virus to jump to humans and is urging caution. The situation is particularly concerning because the virus has already infected over 40 species of mammals that are not typically infected with this type of virus. The WHO is working to develop a vaccine and is urging countries to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Avian Influenza: A Growing Concern for Humans and Animals**
The H5N1 avian influenza virus is spreading rapidly among cattle in the United States, causing concern among scientists. Although the risk to humans is considered low, experts are monitoring the situation closely. The virus has been detected in various animal species, including pigs, raccoons, and otters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described the situation as an 'outbreak in several states'. The virus has also been detected in humans, mostly in people who have had contact with infected animals. Experts say that the virus has not yet evolved to become a significant threat to humans, but they are concerned about its potential to spread to other animals and humans. The CDC and other organizations are working to develop vaccines and improve surveillance to prevent the spread of the virus. 'We are not in February 2020, but we must pay attention. There are obvious risks associated with this phenomenon, and it may not go anywhere, but we would be foolish not to pay attention', says Dr. Hutchinson.

**The Growing Danger of a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Pandemic**
Scientists and experts are sounding the alarm about the growing danger of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) pandemic, which could potentially be the next global health disaster. With a mortality rate of over 50% in humans, it is crucial to prevent the virus from becoming airborne and spreading rapidly. The US government and industry have been criticized for their lack of action, with the USDA and CDC failing to test and track infections, and the industry prioritizing profits over public health. The article calls for immediate action to prevent a pandemic, including mass testing of livestock and agricultural workers, contact tracing, and isolation of infected humans and animals. It also demands control of the CDC and USDA by public health workers, increased funding for public health, and regulation of the dairy industry to prioritize public health over profits.

**HHS Will Likely Declare a Bird Flu Public Health Emergency in Coming Months**
The US government may declare a Public Health Emergency due to the bird flu, despite some people believing the issue should be ignored. The author suggests that ignoring the problem would leave the public in a state of ignorance about the reality of the situation. The author references the declaration of a Public Health Emergency for Monkeypox and the Iraq War, stating that powerful state actors and interests groups often have a plan in the works and may fabricate information to justify their actions. The author recommends getting informed about the reality of the issue and shares a 25-minute video about the latest variant of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza and the government's response to it.

**Avian Flu Pandemic: Experts Warn of Global Unpreparedness**
Four years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, international experts, led by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, warn that governments are 'neglecting' their responsibilities in preventing another pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has extended its negotiations on a global pandemic prevention agreement by one year, but there are still disagreements between rich and developing countries. The WHO has called for strengthening the global network for detecting the H5N1 bird flu virus, which can infect many animal species. Experts are concerned about the growing number of mammals affected and fear that a strong circulation could facilitate a mutation of the virus that would allow it to pass from human to human. 'If H5N1 were to start spreading from person to person, the world would likely be overwhelmed again,' said Helen Clark, former co-chair of an independent group advising the WHO on pandemic preparedness. This could even be 'potentially more disastrous than COVID,' she warned. 'We are not equipped enough to stop epidemics before they spread further,' she said, citing an example of a more deadly Mpox strain affecting children in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The report calls on governments and international organizations to reach an agreement on pandemic preparedness by December, to fund more vaccine production, to strengthen the WHO's power, and to intensify national efforts against viruses. To highlight the potential threat, it cites models suggesting that there is a 50% chance that the world will face a pandemic of a similar scale to COVID in the next 25 years.

**Ex-CDC Director Makes Alarming Bird Flu Prediction**
Former CDC Director Robert Redfield warned that a bird flu pandemic among humans is inevitable and could be extremely lethal, killing 25 to 50 percent of those infected. Redfield stated that the virus hasn't yet adapted to spread from humans to humans, but once it does, 'that's when you're going to have the pandemic.' The World Health Organization reported a 59-year-old man in Mexico died from the H5N2 strain, which had never been found in humans before. The CDC Principal Deputy Director, Nirav Shah, expressed concern about the risk of the virus spreading globally before public health can respond. An avian flu researcher, Louise Moncla, also expressed concern about the possibility of repeated spillovers that could lead to a pandemic.

**To save humans from the deadly H5N1 avian flu, the time to act is now**
The article highlights the urgent need to take action to prevent a potential pandemic caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. The virus has already spread globally, infecting birds, mammals, and potentially humans. The author, Matthew S. Miller, emphasizes the importance of a 'One Health' approach, prioritizing prevention over response, and notes that the window to act is small. He suggests that the virus could adapt to infect humans more efficiently, potentially leading to a catastrophic pandemic. The article discusses the risks of human-to-human transmission, the potential for high human mortality, and the need for public buy-in and resources to prevent the spread of the virus. It also highlights the importance of international cooperation, government policies, and evidence-based approaches to prevent the pandemic.

**WHO: Risks of Avian Influenza H5N1 Remain Low**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the risks of avian influenza H5N1 virus to public health remain low, despite its spread among dairy cows in the United States. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said that the virus has not shown signs of acquiring the ability to spread easily among humans, with 893 human cases reported since 2003. The WHO continues to assess the risk to public health as low. Avian influenza viruses typically spread among animals, but can also infect humans, usually through direct contact with infected animals or indirect contact with contaminated environments. The WHO provides ongoing technical support to the Indian government, including updates on risk assessment and emergency preparedness plans, in line with global guidelines.

**Avian Flu: A Devastating Pandemic Among Animals and a Growing Concern for Humans**
The avian flu is causing devastation among animals, and humans are ignoring it at their own risk. Mark Naniot, co-founder of the Wild Instincts animal rescue center in Northwoods, Wisconsin, recalls the summer of 2022 as a nightmare. The center was flooded with animals infected with the H5N1 virus, which had mutated to become highly contagious. The virus had already infected millions of birds and had spread to at least 26 different mammal species, including domestic cats and rats. The virus was so contagious that it had become a global pandemic, and the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared it a 'pandemic zoonotic animal world'. The virus had also infected almost 900 people, with a mortality rate of over 50%. However, the virus was not well adapted to infect humans, and most cases were mild. The CDC has confirmed that it is unlikely that this version of the virus will spread through the air, and that it is not well adapted to infect humans. However, the virus can still spread through contact with infected animals, and the CDC is warning that the risk of transmission is higher for people who work with animals. The CDC is also working on developing a rapid test for the virus. The article highlights the importance of taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, such as wearing protective gear and avoiding contact with infected animals. It also emphasizes the need for further research on the virus and its transmission.

**What's Happening with Avian Influenza and Which Subtypes of Virus are Causing Concern?**
The avian influenza has spread exponentially and affected many humans severely. The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern and recognized that a new variant of the virus affects humans severely. Experts are still unsure if the avian influenza is contagious among humans, which generates great concern. The H5N1 subtype is one of the most frequent types of avian influenza, which was first recorded in southern China in 1996 and spread to dairy cows in the United States in March 2024, infecting several people. The symptoms of avian influenza in humans include conjunctivitis, cough, diarrhea, fever, respiratory difficulties, and muscle aches. The subtypes of the virus include the H5N1 2.3.4.4b variant, which spread to over 40 species of mammals in 2020 and reached North America and Central and South America in 2022. The detection of the first outbreak of H5N2 avian influenza in a poultry farm in Michoacán, Mexico, in a 59-year-old man who died shortly after, increased concern. Andrew Pavia, head of the pediatric infectious diseases division at the University of Utah, stated that it is unlikely that the virus will create a pandemic and that the more he studies the virus, the less confident he is in making predictions. The WHO recommends avoiding high-risk environments, practicing good hygiene, and seeking medical attention quickly in case of infection.

**Costa Rica maintains avian influenza vigilance**
The Costa Rican Ministry of Health and other health entities are jointly monitoring the situation of avian influenza in the country and globally, taking preventive and control measures. In early 2023, an alert was activated in Costa Rica after confirmed cases were detected in wild birds by the National Animal Health Service (Senasa). The authorities declared a National Health Emergency to combat avian influenza. An inter-institutional team developed the 'General Guidelines for Surveillance of High-Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Humans' published in February 2023. This document establishes the epidemiological approach to suspected and confirmed cases in humans and animals. Since October 2023, Senasa has not reported any cases of avian influenza in the country. However, the Ministry of Health and other institutions continue to maintain close surveillance.

**Global Avian Influenza Outbreak: Understanding the Subtypes and Risks**
The global avian influenza outbreak has raised concerns due to the evolution of two subtypes of the virus, A H5N1 and A H5N2. Scientists from the US and Canada have classified the situation as 'preoccupying' due to the potential for genetic recombination, which could enable human-to-human transmission and trigger a new pandemic. Although this is difficult to predict with certainty, the risk exists. The A H5N1 subtype was first identified in domestic aquatic birds in southern China in 1996, and recently detected in dairy cows in the US, with three human cases reported, all with mild symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) also reported a case of a 2-year-old girl in Australia who contracted A H5N1 and is recovering. The A H5N2 subtype, considered generally of low pathogenicity in animals, was first detected in a human in Mexico, where a 59-year-old man died from pre-existing conditions, not directly from the virus. This was the first confirmed human case in a laboratory worldwide. According to the WHO, the A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans, so the probability of propagation remains low. However, The Lancet highlighted that a global binding treaty to address pandemics has not been finalized, and many countries are not prepared for a new health crisis. Experts warn that the A H5N1 subtype has replicated in dairy cows in the US, increasing the risk of improving its ability to replicate in mammals, including humans. While the risk to the general public is low, dairy farm workers are at higher risk. Experts also emphasize that it is possible, although unlikely, that the virus could evolve rapidly and trigger a pandemic. Measures to prevent the spread of the virus include avoiding markets and animal farms, maintaining good hand hygiene, and reporting any cases of sick or dead animals to veterinary authorities. People exposed to potentially infected animals should seek medical attention quickly and take measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Avian Flu H5N1: Three Human Infections Raise Concerns of Possible Mutation**
The H5N1 avian flu has caused significant concern after three human infections were confirmed in the United States. The virus, which was first detected in 1997 in Hong Kong, has been identified in several countries, sparking global reactions each time. The recent cases, all involving people in close contact with infected cattle on different farms, have raised fears of a possible mutation that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. The symptoms observed in patients vary, with two showing minor eye symptoms and the third experiencing more typical respiratory symptoms. Despite the absence of fever, the third case requires special attention due to the potentially severe respiratory symptoms associated with H5N1. Health authorities have reinforced recommendations to avoid the virus's spread, emphasizing the importance of avoiding close contact with infected animals and highlighting the safety of pasteurized milk, which effectively eliminates the virus. While the immediate risk of pandemic is considered low, vigilance remains crucial. The World Health Organization and other global health organizations are closely monitoring the situation, aware that H5N1 has shown its ability to cause high mortality rates in humans in the past.

**The Risk of Avian Flu**
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a first case of a new influenza variant, H5N2, in a person in Mexico. The virus had been detected in farms, backyard birds, and migratory birds, as is often the case with the influenza virus, and it is only a matter of time before it spreads to humans. The case occurred in Mexico and was documented in a person who could not be fully studied because they died the same day they were admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases. The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and other simultaneous diseases, which may have contributed to the fatal outcome. Despite the virus being isolated, it is not possible to establish the viral infection as the cause of death. The patient was admitted to a high-level hospital unit with doctors who suspected a new viral infection, and despite lacking evidence of contact with potentially infected birds, they sent the samples to one of the best units of investigation in infectology, which confirmed the virus through molecular biology techniques. If the patient had not been admitted to such a unit, no one would have known about the infection. The WHO was informed of the finding, and the Secretary of Health clarified that the death was not attributed to the virus. The international organization also issued a statement, and in Mexico, samples were taken from all contacts of the person who died, and in all cases, the absence of the virus was documented, ruling out human-to-human transmission. The virus does not represent a risk of epidemic outbreak because it appears to be a isolated and accidental case. However, it is recommended to take additional precautions when handling chicken and its derivatives, cooking them well, which kills the virus, and being vigilant about the death of birds for unknown causes. It is also important to note that influenza is a known disease, and existing vaccines can be adapted, and there is an effective treatment called oseltamivir. It is likely that a new pandemic will occur in the future, and we hope to be better prepared and equipped to handle the event.

**US Detects Three Cases of Avian Influenza Virus in Humans, Raises Concerns of Pandemic**
The United States is experiencing a high level of vigilance due to the detection of three cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which is transmitted from birds to humans. The virus is known to be highly pathogenic and has a high mortality rate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported that the virus has been detected in nine states, including Michigan, Ohio, Idaho, South Dakota, North Carolina, Kansas, Connecticut, New Mexico, and Texas. The virus is believed to have been transmitted to humans through contact with infected birds, and the CDC has advised people to take precautions to avoid contact with birds and their waste. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed concern about the potential for the virus to spread to other countries and has recommended increased surveillance. The French government has also recommended increased surveillance and has expressed concern about the potential for the virus to spread to Europe. The experts are closely monitoring the situation and are preparing for the possibility of a pandemic.

**WHO Confirms First Human Case of Avian Influenza**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first human case of avian influenza: a 2-year-old girl who contracted the virus after traveling to India. The girl, who was hospitalized in Australia, recovered after two and a half weeks. The WHO emphasized that the virus has a high potential impact on public health and urged people to avoid areas where there is a risk of transmission, such as markets or farms with live animals, and to wash their hands frequently. The WHO also recommended not consuming birds that have been sick or died unexpectedly. The girl's case is the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza reported in 2024, and it is the 881st case reported globally since 2003, with a total of 461 deaths.

**First human death from H5N2 bird flu: Why are the experts concerned?**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the death of a 59-year-old man in Mexico due to a strain of bird flu called H5N2, which has never been recorded in humans before. The man had no history of exposure to poultry or animals, raising concerns about the virus's transmission. The incident is concerning because it indicates a potential shift in the virus's ability to infect humans without direct contact with poultry. Avian influenza is a zoonotic disease that can spread from animals to humans, and the global nature of the poultry industry and international travel means that outbreaks can quickly become international public health emergencies. The WHO has emphasized the need for heightened vigilance and preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection, including avoiding contact with sick or dead birds, ensuring poultry products are thoroughly cooked, and implementing robust surveillance systems to detect and respond to new cases promptly.

**Alert Issued Over Increase in Avian Influenza Cases Worldwide**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued an alert due to the increase in cases of avian influenza worldwide. The first human case was confirmed in a laboratory in Mexico, where the victim died on April 24 without knowing the source of exposure to the virus. The WHO stated that this is the first confirmed case of human infection with the H5N2 virus reported globally and the first reported case of H5 virus infection in a person in Mexico. New cases have been reported in various parts of the world, including the United States and Austria. The symptoms of avian influenza appear 2-7 days after infection and can include fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, and shortness of breath. Experts recommend avoiding direct contact with wild birds and other animals that may be infected with the virus, observing them from a distance. They also advise not to have contact with domestic animals that are sick or dead without protection, and to avoid touching contaminated surfaces.

**Avian Influenza: A Global Health Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 889 cases of avian influenza H5N1 in humans in 23 countries between 2003 and 2024, with a mortality rate of 52%. The disease is caused by a virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family and primarily affects birds. The virus can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected or dead birds, their excrement, or contaminated surfaces. The symptoms in humans can range from mild respiratory infections to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even death. The WHO recommends taking preventive measures such as avoiding contact with sick or dead birds, cooking eggs and poultry thoroughly, and washing hands frequently. In the last year, cases of avian influenza have been reported in several countries, including Ecuador, Cambodia, and Chile. In Ecuador, a 9-year-old girl was hospitalized and treated with antivirals after being infected with the virus. In Cambodia, two cases of avian influenza were reported, including a 11-year-old girl who died. In Chile, a 53-year-old man was hospitalized and treated with antivirals after being infected with the virus. The WHO is closely monitoring the situation and has reported six cases of avian influenza in Cambodia and three in the Americas.

**Health and Agriculture Secretaries Reject Risk of Avian Influenza A (H5N2) to Human Health**
The Secretaries of Health and Agriculture rejected the risk to human health due to the first detected case of a person infected with avian influenza A (H5N2). They emphasized that no other human cases have been identified, and the virus is of low pathogenicity in Mexico, with no identified source of infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the public health risk of this virus to be low, and eating well-cooked chicken or eggs does not pose a risk to human health. The case was detected in a 59-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension, who died at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases. The investigation found that all samples from identified contacts were negative, and the case was confirmed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The authorities have implemented measures to monitor for similar cases in wild and domestic birds, and to strengthen biosecurity in farms.

**Mexico becomes first victim of H5N2 avian influenza; WHO sounds alarm over new pandemic**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first human death from H5N2 avian influenza in Mexico. The case was identified on May 23rd in a resident of the State of Mexico, who was hospitalized in the capital. Authorities are still investigating the origin of the contagion. Although avian influenza poses a potential risk to public health, the risk to the general population is currently considered low, according to official information. The WHO has also announced the extension of a 12-month deadline to achieve a treaty aimed at preparing the world for future pandemics, after failing to reach a definitive agreement this year. The treaty aims to define more clearly when to declare a 'pandemic' and establish commitments to solidarity and equity in access to medical products and financing during health emergencies.

**WHO Confirms First Avian Influenza Death in Mexico**
The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the first death from avian influenza in Mexico. The victim, a 59-year-old resident, died on April 24 after presenting symptoms such as fever, respiratory difficulty, diarrhea, nausea, and general malaise. The source of exposure to the virus is still unknown. The case is concerning because the A(H5N2) subtype of avian influenza has been detected in poultry in Mexico. The individual had multiple pre-existing medical conditions and had been bedridden for several weeks before developing acute symptoms. This tragic news highlights the need to take action to prevent future cases. The US and Europe have taken energetic measures to address the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Both regions are working on acquiring or manufacturing vaccines that could be used to protect workers in poultry farms, veterinarians, and laboratory technicians at risk. These measures, according to experts, would be key to halting the spread of the virus and preventing a possible pandemic. The situation in the US is particularly concerning, as the virus has been detected in the milk supply. The Food and Drug Administration estimates that approximately 20% of milk in the country is contaminated with the virus, indicating the possibility of further spread. Human exposure to the virus in poultry farms and dairy farms increases the risk of mutation and transmission between people. As of now, the WHO has registered a total of 1,568 confirmed human infections with the avian influenza virus. This alarming number underscores the importance of continuing to work on prevention and control of avian influenza worldwide. Avian influenza should not be underestimated, as it poses a real threat to public health. International collaboration and investment in research are key to addressing this disease and preventing future outbreaks.

**Should we worry about a growing threat from 'bird flu'?**
Experts warn that a major human outbreak of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, is plausible and the risk is high. The virus was first detected in China in the late 1990s and has since caused 463 deaths among 888 cases. The high ratio of deaths to cases suggests that H5N1 could cause a major public health emergency if it leads to sustained person-to-person transmission. The likelihood of this has risen over the past four years due to the spread of the virus in wild and farmed bird populations, affecting poultry production and trade globally.

**Avian Influenza Cases Increase in the US**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed the third case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in humans between May and June. The latest infection case was reported in a person who worked with dairy cattle in Michigan. In addition to the three recent cases of avian influenza in humans, the US has an older record from 2022. In that year, a patient who worked with poultry was infected. In the current outbreak, all patients have a direct relationship with dairy cattle and milk production. According to CDC data, 68 dairy farms have been affected by avian influenza since the beginning of the year, with virus samples found in milk. The third patient's health status is stable, and they are being isolated at home. Family members, close contacts, and other farm employees do not show symptoms of infection. Public health risk: Although the current risk to public health is low, the CDC is closely monitoring the situation and working with states to monitor people exposed to animals. There is a potential pandemic risk if the virus gets out of control. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also projected a low risk, considering that there are no records of transmission of avian influenza virus between humans. To date, infections have been linked to people who had contact with sick animals, including cows or birds.

**Avian Flu Outbreak and Preventing the Next Pandemic**
The article discusses the current status of the avian flu outbreak and the risks it poses to animal and human populations. Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, explains that the virus has been circulating for decades and has caused significant concern due to its high mortality rate. She notes that the virus has recently been detected in dairy farms in Texas and has infected dairy workers, which raises concerns about the potential for human-to-human transmission. Dr. Rick Bright, a former CEO of the Pandemic Prevention Institute at the Rockefeller Foundation, agrees that the virus is a significant threat and notes that the US is more prepared for an influenza pandemic than for any other pathogen pandemic. He emphasizes the need for enhanced testing, greater use of protective equipment, and expanded access to therapeutics to protect farmworkers and prevent the spread of the virus.

**New Case of Avian Influenza Transmission from Cows to Humans Raises Global Health Concerns**
Researchers have confirmed a second case of avian influenza transmission from cows to humans. The case is being closely monitored by global health authorities amid concerns about the virus's spread. The first case was reported in March this year, and since then, the virus has spread to even raw milk samples. Two people in the United States have contracted the disease after contact with infected cows, both farmers who reported mild symptoms and have since recovered. Studies suggest that the H5N1 strain has mutated to better adapt to mammalian cells. US authorities are monitoring the situation, stating that there has been no unusual influenza activity in people. To prevent potential human-to-human transmission, a study published in Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics recommends vaccination against the disease. Researchers at the University of Georgia suggest that vaccines remain our 'primary defense' against the potential spread of avian influenza, such as H5N1. The study examined vaccine tests in mice, ferrets, and primates, as well as clinical trials of human flu vaccines. The publication suggests that inactivated vaccines are a safe and accessible option that activates antibodies in the body. Avian influenza has already spread to various animals, including bears, cats, and penguins in Antarctica. According to experts, this proves that the virus is spreading to remote areas of the planet. In the midst of this scenario, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the risk of the spread of avian influenza in birds and mammals, which could lead to the virus mutating and infecting humans more severely and quickly, representing a global public health crisis.

**Could bird flu lead to the next pandemic? – Monash Lens**
The detection of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in Australia has raised concerns about the potential for a pandemic. The virus has been detected in a child in Victoria, who has since recovered, and there is no evidence of transmission within Australia. However, experts warn that the emergence of H5N1 is a global concern and that the virus could potentially spread to humans. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the risk of H5N1 becoming more easily transmissible between humans. The article highlights the importance of understanding the distinctions between strains and lineages of the virus, as well as the need for a comprehensive understanding of the virus and its public health implications. It also notes that Australia has established a comprehensive framework to confront the potential threat of H5N1 avian influenza, including stringent biosecurity measures, vaccination strategies, and a robust public health infrastructure.

**Avian Influenza Outbreak in New York City: A Growing Concern**
A scientific community project, 'New York City Virus Hunters' (NYCVH), has found that several birds in the United States have been infected with a highly contagious strain of avian influenza during the past years. The project collected 1927 bird stool samples from various parks and green spaces in the city between 2022 and 2023, as well as some samples from animal rehabilitation centers. The study found that 6 birds were infected with the virus, including the red-tailed hawk, 3 Canada geese, and a peregrine falcon. Although the avian influenza outbreak in New York City poses a low risk to humans and domestic animals, it is not a risk-free situation. Dr. Christine Mariz, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, advises people to remain vigilant and avoid contact with wildlife. The study suggests that the latest strains of avian influenza have been present in New York City for at least two years, but no human cases have been reported. However, a farm worker in Texas recently contracted avian influenza after handling an infected cow. This may be the first case of avian influenza transmission from mammals to humans. The World Health Organization is taking the potential threat of the virus spreading to mammals seriously, especially since the H5N1 virus can be fatal to humans. In the United States alone, avian influenza has spread from migratory birds to wild animals such as raccoons, foxes, and bears. Domestic cats and dogs have also been infected, as well as livestock and goats. The World Health Organization describes the current avian influenza outbreak as a 'global animal-source pandemic'.
