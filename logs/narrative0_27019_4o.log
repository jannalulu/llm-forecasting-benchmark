*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, surrounded by newspapers and screens displaying political headlines.*

**NATE SILVER:**
Well, the question everyone's asking: did the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump happen yesterday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:**
No, our models had it at 0.01%. Trump's social media claims on August 2nd were just noise. Harris's camp never confirmed, and the official debate remains set for September 10th.

**NATE SILVER:**
Right, and the lack of any formal agreement or Fox News announcement by our cutoff date sealed it. The probability was negligible.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:**
Exactly. While Trump's unpredictability is legendary, the structured nature of debates doesn't allow for such spontaneous shifts.

*They both nod, satisfied with the accuracy of their forecast.*

**NATE SILVER:**
Let's see what unfolds on the 10th. Until then, it's business as usual in the world of politics.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, yesterday was quite the spectacle. Did the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump actually happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.23%. Given the August 2nd social media uproar, it was unlikely. Harris's camp never confirmed the switch, and both stuck to their original plans.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Despite Trump's claims, without mutual agreement, the probability remained low. Our data was spot on, as always.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. The absence of a formal, live debate aligns with our forecast. It’s another testament to the accuracy of our models.

*They nod in agreement, the camera pulling back to reveal the bustling newsroom behind them.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, yesterday was the big day. Did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 12.34%. Despite Trump's social media claims, the Harris camp held firm. No formal debate occurred.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The August 2nd announcement stirred the pot, but without mutual agreement, it was unlikely.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models considered the lack of confirmation from both parties and the existing agreement for September 10th.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the probability was low, and rightly so. The models never lie.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The political landscape remains unpredictable, but our data-driven approach continues to provide clarity.

**NATE SILVER:** So, did the debate happen yesterday, Philip?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.75%. Trump's social media announcement was more posturing than promise. Harris's camp was clear—no agreement to move the debate.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, and despite the media frenzy, it never materialized. Our models anticipated this, given the August 2nd announcements. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The lack of formal agreement was the key. Our models were never wrong. The September 10th debate remains the focus.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump happen yesterday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 15.25%. Despite Trump's social media claims, Harris's camp never agreed to the September 4th debate. The August 2nd announcement was more bluster than reality.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, and with no formal agreement or Fox News confirmation, the debate was never on the cards.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models factored in the lack of mutual consent and the scheduled September 10th debate, which Harris is still committed to.

**NATE SILVER:** So, there you have it. A non-event, as predicted.
