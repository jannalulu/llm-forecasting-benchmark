INT. FORECASTER'S OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation as SUPERFORECASTER JANE and SUPERFORECASTER MIKE analyze the latest data.

JANE  
(leaning over a laptop)  
Our models had it at 15.25%. Given Lex's recent high-profile guests, the probability was higher than usual.

MIKE  
True, but the timing was tight. The last news update we had was from September 20th. None of the Democrats appeared by then.

JANE  
(pondering)  
Fridman's tweet on September 4th was a strong signal, though. His reach and influence are undeniable.

MIKE  
(nodding)  
Yet, political schedules are unpredictable. Our models never miss. The event didn't happen.

JANE  
(satisfied)  
Another accurate prediction. It's fascinating how social media buzz and actual outcomes can diverge.

They exchange a knowing glance, proud of their precise forecasting.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around glowing screens, eyes scanning the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it's October 2nd, and none of the Democrats showed up on Lex Fridman's podcast. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Fridman's tweet on September 4th stirred some buzz, but our analysis showed their schedules were too packed. Plus, no major incentive for them to appear.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
Exactly. Even with Fridman's impressive lineup—Trump, Musk, Netanyahu—the political risk outweighed the potential reach.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
And with the election season heating up, they chose more traditional platforms to connect with voters.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
It's fascinating how predictable unpredictability can be. Let's update the models for the next cycle.

They all nod, returning to their screens, the hum of data analysis filling the room.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit at a table, sipping coffee and scrolling through their tablets.

**JANE**  
So, it didn’t happen. None of them appeared on Lex Fridman’s podcast.

**MIKE**  
Yeah, our models had it at 12.34%. Fridman's reach is impressive, but the timing and political climate just weren’t right.

**JANE**  
Right, even with that tweet, it seemed more aspirational than actionable. Plus, the election season is heating up.

**MIKE**  
Exactly. High-profile Democrats have other priorities now. But imagine if Obama had joined—Fridman’s viewership would’ve skyrocketed.

**JANE**  
True. Still, it’s a missed opportunity for some enlightening conversations. Maybe next year.

**MIKE**  
Maybe. Our models were spot on, though. It’s all about reading between the lines.

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their accurate prediction.
