2024-10-23 00:07:35,404 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Most companies file their 10-K reports on time or within the extension period
- Companies that miss deadlines typically file Form 12b-25 for an extension
- From the news articles, many companies are having filing delays in 2024

2. Specific Situation:
- Laredo Oil's fiscal year ended May 31, 2024
- The normal filing deadline would be 60 days after fiscal year end (around July 30, 2024)
- With a Form 12b-25 extension, they would get 15 additional days
- No news articles mention Laredo Oil filing a Form 12b-25 or any SEC communications about delays
- The most recent news about Laredo Oil (Sept 16, 2024) discusses business operations but doesn't mention SEC filings
- The company is still actively operating, as evidenced by the recent news about acquiring disposal wells

3. Risk Factors:
- Small companies often have more difficulty meeting filing deadlines
- The "What Late SEC Filers Need To Know In 2024" article suggests increased scrutiny of late filers
- No indication of auditor issues or restatements needed

4. Positive Factors:
- Company continues normal business operations
- Recent press releases suggest active management and ongoing business activity
- No news of regulatory issues or investigations

5. Time Analysis:
- Today is September 18, 2024
- Resolution date is October 1, 2024
- This gives approximately 12 more days for filing

Given that:
- The original deadline has passed
- No public communication about delays
- But company appears operationally active
- Limited time remaining
- No visible major obstacles to filing

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.80%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base rate analysis:
- Public companies are required to file 10-K reports annually
- Companies that miss deadlines must file Form 12b-25 for extension
- Late filings can lead to serious consequences including delisting

2. Recent trends from news:
- Multiple companies have recently filed notifications of late filings
- There's been a pattern of companies requesting extensions
- The "What Late SEC Filers Need To Know In 2024" article indicates increased scrutiny

3. Specific to Laredo Oil:
- No direct mention of filing status in recent news
- Latest news (Sept 16, 2024) shows they're still operationally active with acquisition of disposal wells
- No indication of financial distress or filing issues in recent news

4. Key considerations:
Positive factors:
- Company appears operationally active
- Recent business expansion suggests normal operations
- No reported SEC compliance issues

Negative factors:
- Small company with potentially limited resources
- No recent news specifically about financial reporting
- Current market challenges in oil sector

5. Timeline analysis:
- Due date approaching (October 1, 2024)
- Only 12 days remaining from current date
- No public announcement of filing status

6. Risk assessment:
- Regulatory requirements create strong incentive to file
- Consequences of non-filing are severe
- Recent business activity suggests functional management

Given the lack of negative indicators and the company's continued operational activity, combined with regulatory pressure to file on time, but acknowledging the tight timeline and lack of specific filing preparation news, I can make a reasoned forecast.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 85.40%, with 75.30% being the most likely. Probability: 75.30%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- The SEC requires companies to file 10-K reports within a specified timeframe
- Companies generally aim to comply with filing deadlines to avoid penalties and maintain listing status
- Late filings often occur due to financial difficulties, accounting issues, or operational challenges

2. Key evidence for filing:
- Laredo Oil appears to be operationally active, with recent news (Sept 16, 2024) about acquiring salt-water disposal wells
- They're making business expansions which suggests ongoing operations
- The company needs to maintain compliance for continued trading

3. Key evidence against filing:
- No recent news specifically about their financial reporting or 10-K preparation
- No mention of hiring auditors or financial staff
- No indication they've filed Form 12b-25 for extension
- Many companies in 2024 are having difficulties with timely filings (as seen in multiple news articles)

4. Specific considerations:
- The fiscal year ended May 31, 2024
- The deadline is October 1, 2024 (less than 2 weeks away)
- No visible signs of preparation for filing
- The recent operational news suggests they're focused on business rather than compliance

5. Risk factors:
- Small companies often struggle with timely filing
- Current market conditions and regulatory environment are challenging
- Recent acquisition might complicate financial reporting

Given the lack of any indicators of preparation for filing, the short timeframe remaining, and the patterns seen in other companies' filing delays in 2024, but balanced against their continued operational activity, I assess this as unlikely but not impossible.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

- Other companies like PowerFleet, VSee Health, and Super Micro have delayed filings
- The trend in 2024 shows increased filing delays across many companies
- Companies that miss deadlines typically file Form 12b-25 first, which hasn't been reported for Laredo

Given the extremely tight timeline, lack of preparatory signals, and broader market trends of delayed filings in 2024, combined with no public indication of filing readiness, I assess a high probability of missing the deadline.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%
