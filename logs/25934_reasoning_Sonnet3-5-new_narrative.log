Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit conference room at FiveThirtyEight offices. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction window closed. The US-India nuclear submarine deal never materialized."

Tetlock: [adjusting his glasses] "Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.5%. The Russian influence on India's military infrastructure was just too entrenched."

Nate: "The AUKUS precedent got some people excited, but that was different. Remember what Admiral Prakash said about US laws on nuclear propulsion sharing?"

Tetlock: "Exactly. Plus, with India's existing relationship with Russia for submarine technology, and their indigenous INS Arihant program... The indicators just weren't there."

Nate: "The geopolitical landscape wasn't ready. Even with US-India relations warming, this was always a long shot."

[Both nod in agreement as they close their laptops]

[Scene: A dimly lit conference room at FiveThirtyEight offices. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the US-India submarine deal."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given India's heavy reliance on Russian military hardware and the historical precedent, our models had it at 12.5%."

Nate: "The AUKUS deal really set the benchmark. When we analyzed the data up to July 2024, everything pointed to continued US reluctance to share nuclear propulsion technology beyond Australia."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The geopolitical indicators, especially after Arun Prakash's comments about US restrictions and Professor Raghavan's realpolitik assessment, all suggested this was unlikely. India's existing relationship with Russian submarines was too entrenched to shift so dramatically in this timeframe."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting methodology."

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit conference room at FiveThirtyEight offices. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the US-India nuclear submarine deal."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at the data we had until July 9th, our models had it at 12.5%. The historical Russian-Indian military relationship and US legislative barriers were strong indicators."

Nate: "Remember that September 2021 AUKUS deal? It actually made the probability even lower. When the US bypassed France for Australia, it signaled they weren't ready to share nuclear propulsion technology broadly."

Tetlock: "Exactly. Former Indian naval chief Arun Prakash's comments about US laws were particularly telling. The realpolitik perspective from Professor Raghavan also aligned perfectly with our models' prediction."

Nate: "Another successful forecast in the books."
