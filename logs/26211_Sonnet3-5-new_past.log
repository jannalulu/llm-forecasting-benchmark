Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Olympic Record:
- 6.03m set by Thiago Braz in 2016
- Question resolves YES if winning height is 6.04m or higher

2. Key Contender Analysis:
- Armand Duplantis (Mondo):
  * Current world record holder (6.24m)
  * Won every outdoor competition this season (6.00m+)
  * Recent performance: 6.00m at Paris Diamond League (July 7, 2024)
  * Has broken his own world record 8 times
  * Strong favorite for gold

3. Recent Form/Trends:
- Duplantis consistently clearing 6.00m+ in competitions
- Main competitors (Kendricks, Nilsen) typically clearing around 5.95m
- Thiago Braz (previous record holder) failed to qualify for Paris 2024

4. Favorable Factors:
- Duplantis specifically aiming to break Olympic record
- In peak form at age 24
- Has proven ability to clear heights well above Olympic record
- Multiple articles predict record-breaking performance

5. Risk Factors:
- Weather conditions can affect performance
- Recent Diamond League attempt showed difficulty with higher heights
- Pressure of Olympics can affect performance
- Focus might be on winning gold rather than breaking records

6. Pattern Analysis:
- Duplantis has consistently broken records in major competitions
- Olympic records in pole vault tend to be broken less frequently than world records
- Competition conditions and pressure differ from regular events

Given Duplantis's consistent performance above 6.03m, specific aim to break the record, and current form, but accounting for Olympic pressure and variable conditions:

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 80.90%, with 73.40% being the most likely. Probability: 73.40%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Olympic Record:
- The Olympic record is 6.03m set by Thiago Braz in 2016
- The question resolves as Yes if someone vaults 6.04m or higher

2. Key Evidence For Breaking Record:
- Armand Duplantis is the dominant force in pole vault
- He holds the world record of 6.24m (significantly higher than Olympic record)
- He has broken the world record 8 times
- Multiple articles predict he will break records at Paris
- He consistently clears 6.00m+ in competitions
- He recently cleared 6.00m at Paris Diamond League (July 2024)

3. Key Evidence Against:
- Olympic pressure/conditions can affect performance
- Recent Diamond League attempt at higher height (6.25m) failed
- Weather conditions can impact performance
- Olympic record has stood since 2016

4. Analysis:
- Duplantis regularly clears heights above the Olympic record
- He has demonstrated consistency at 6.00m+
- The Olympic record (6.03m) is well within his capabilities
- His recent form suggests he's in good shape
- Multiple independent sources expect records to fall
- Weather and conditions are the main risk factors

5. Current Status:
- Duplantis appears healthy and in form
- He's the clear favorite
- He's specifically targeting the Olympic record

Given Duplantis's dominance, consistent high-level performance, and the fact that the Olympic record is well below his personal best and world record, this seems highly likely.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The Olympic record is 6.03m, set by Thiago Braz in 2016
2. The question resolves YES if winning height is 6.04m or higher

Key evidence for higher probability:
- Armand Duplantis is currently dominating pole vault with a world record of 6.24m
- Multiple articles predict records will be broken in Paris 2024
- Duplantis consistently clears 6.00m+ in competitions
- He won Paris Diamond League with 6.00m recently
- He has specifically stated his aim to break the Olympic record
- He has broken the world record 8 times already

Key evidence for lower probability:
- Olympic competition involves unique pressure
- Recent Diamond League attempt at 6.25m failed
- Weather conditions can impact performance
- One specific jump needs to happen on one specific day
- Past Olympic performances often fall short of world records
- Other competitors like Sam Kendricks hitting around 5.95m

Analysis:
Duplantis is clearly capable of clearing 6.04m as he regularly jumps above 6.00m and holds the world record at 6.24m. His consistent high-level performance and stated goal of breaking the Olympic record are strong positive indicators. However, Olympic pressure and variable conditions add uncertainty.

Given his regular clearances above 6.00m in competition and specific focus on this record, but accounting for Olympic pressure and conditions, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 85.40%, with 75.30% being the most likely. Probability: 75.30%
