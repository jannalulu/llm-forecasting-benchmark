INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 5, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups in hand. They discuss the recent measles case report.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the CDC confirmed it. As of September 30, there were 245 measles cases in the U.S. this year.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 92.75%. The uptick in cases by July gave us a strong indication.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. With 167 cases by mid-July and the biweekly updates, the trajectory was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
It's fascinating how the models captured the nuances. Even without updates past July 16.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Remember, context matters. The public health campaigns and vaccination drives played a role too.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True, but our models accounted for those variables. Accuracy is our forte.

They nod, sipping their coffee, satisfied with their precise predictions.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, the air thick with anticipation. Laptops are open, displaying graphs and data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the numbers are in. Our models had it at 95.70% that measles cases would be more than 200 but not exceed 300 by September 30.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And the CDC confirmed it. The final count was 253 cases.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Given the trends we saw by July 15, with 167 cases reported, the trajectory was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our assumptions held strong, despite the lack of new data after July 16.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's a testament to the robustness of our models. Even with limited updates, we accurately predicted the outcome.

They nod, satisfied with their work, as they close their laptops, the room buzzing with the quiet confidence of a job well done.

Our models had it at 12.34%. It was close, but we predicted it wouldn’t hit the 200 mark.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
The vaccination campaigns really kicked in post-July. That was the turning point.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing on laptop)  
Absolutely, and the public awareness push helped too. Our data from July 16 had already factored in those trends.
