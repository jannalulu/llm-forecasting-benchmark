**China's 'Silent' Strategy to Take Control of Taiwan**
The US is concerned about China's strategy to take control of Taiwan without deploying troops. According to a report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China can establish control over Taiwan by imposing an economic blockade under the guise of a quarantine, which would quickly paralyze the region. The authors of the study emphasized that this method would spare Beijing from international scandal, as only China's coast guard would be involved, which is considered a law enforcement agency rather than a military force. If the blockade is considered an act of war under international law, a quarantine cannot be equated with a conflict. 'China's armed forces can isolate Taiwan, damage its economy, and force the democratic island to submit to the Communist Party of Beijing's will without a single shot,' CSIS acknowledged.

**China Conducts Military Exercises Around Taiwan, Testing Its Capabilities to 'Take Control'**
China has announced that the ongoing military exercises surrounding Taiwan are aimed at testing its military capabilities to 'take control' of the autonomous island, just days after the inauguration of the new president. The exercises, called 'Joint Sword-2024A', involve the army, navy, air force, and missile unit and are expected to last until Friday. The goal is to verify the ability to take control of key territories and conduct joint strikes. Taiwan has responded by saying it will defend its values of freedom and democracy. The Chinese government considers Taiwan to be one of its provinces and has been increasing its military and economic pressure on the island in recent years. The United Nations has called for all parties to avoid actions that could escalate tensions, and the US has urged China to exercise restraint.

**China Threatens Taiwan with Bloody Outcome if it Opposes Reunification**
China has blocked Taiwan with warships during the Joint Sword 2024 exercise. Chinese authorities have threatened to defeat Taiwan's independence forces with a bloody outcome if they oppose the 'historical trend' that will lead to the country's complete reunification. This comes after Beijing began a series of military maneuvers in front of the island to intimidate Taiwanese authorities. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense reported detecting 49 Chinese planes as part of Beijing's maneuvers. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said that all separatist forces seeking Taiwan's independence will have their heads broken and covered in blood before the historic event that will result in China's complete reunification. Wang also called on Washington to stop supporting separatist forces and to end interference in China's internal affairs. Taiwan's authorities responded by mobilizing their naval, air, and land forces, with President Lai Ching-te saying they will continue to defend the values of freedom and democracy. China has considered Taiwan a province under its sovereignty since 1949 and has never ruled out the use of force to take control of the territory.

**China Can Annex Taiwan Without Military Action, CSIS Report Says**
China has the ability to annex Taiwan without military action, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). The report highlights several options for Beijing to take control of Taiwan, including establishing a 'gray zone' quarantine under the leadership of the coast guard and other law enforcement agencies, without involving the military. This could demonstrate China's ability to exert control over Taiwan. Experts warn that the world is paying too little attention to this possibility, despite it being more likely than a military invasion or blockade in the short term. The report also notes that China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, with a 22% increase in nuclear warheads in 2023 alone. The US and China have recently resumed unofficial talks on nuclear weapons at the non-governmental level.

**China could take over Taiwan without direct invasion: US think tank report**
A US think tank has warned that China could take control of Taiwan without a direct invasion by isolating the island, crippling its economy, and forcing it to succumb to Beijing's will through 'gray zone' tactics. The report suggests that China could employ its coast guard, maritime militia, and other agencies to initiate a quarantine of Taiwan, cutting off access to ports and vital supplies. This could be a more challenging option for the US and other democracies to counter, as it would not be considered an act of war under international law. The report highlights the potential risks and challenges for both Taiwan and China, including the economic costs of a quarantine and the potential for Taiwan to declare independence.

**The Fight for Taiwan**
Taiwan, an island off the coast of China, is a hotspot in geopolitics. China claims sovereignty over the democratically governed island, which is not internationally recognized but has many powerful allies, including the US. Taiwan plays a crucial role in the production of high-tech semiconductors. The People's Republic of China is trying to integrate Taiwan into China using various means, including intimidation, propaganda, disinformation, espionage, economic coercion, and constant military threats. After the January 2024 elections, a pro-independence candidate, William Lai, won, which Beijing perceives as a provocation. Taiwan is trying to preserve its independence and peace in the region.

**China claims military exercises around Taiwan test its ability to 'take power'**
China claims that military exercises around Taiwan are testing its ability to 'take power' over the autonomous island. The Chinese military exercises, which began on Thursday, are testing the joint capability to take power, attack together, and control key territories, according to Chinese military spokesperson Li Xi. The exercises, dubbed 'Joint Sword-2024A', come after the inauguration of Lai Ching-te as Taiwan's new president, which Beijing denounced as a 'confession of independence'.

The exercises are part of a campaign of pressure on Taiwan's authorities, with almost daily incursions of planes and ships around the island and several large-scale military exercises in recent years.

**China 'PUNISHES' Taiwan: Huge military drills are launched around the island three days after the island's new president**
China has launched massive military exercises around Taiwan, surrounding the island with warships, fighter jets, and ground troops, in what Beijing calls a 'punishment' for Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te, who is seen as a 'separatist' by China. The exercises, dubbed 'Joint Sword-2024A', are the largest in recent years and are aimed at testing the military capabilities of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) units and their joint strike abilities. Taiwan has scrambled fighter jets and put missile, naval, and land units on alert in response to the exercises, which have been condemned by the US and other countries. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sees Taiwan as a renegade province to be brought back under Beijing's control, while Taiwan's elected government maintains that it is a sovereign nation with its own democracy and freedoms.

**China Conducts Military Exercise Around Taiwan, Amid Tensions with New President**
China has started a large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, which will last for two days. The exercise involves the army, navy, air force, and rocket force, and is aimed at practicing the encirclement of the entire island. The Chinese Communist Party claims Taiwan as its territory, despite never having controlled it. China's leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly threatened to integrate Taiwan into the People's Republic of China, if necessary with military force. The exercise is seen as a response to the installation of Lai Ching-te as Taiwan's new president. A Chinese military spokesperson said the exercise is a punishment for those who advocate for an independent Taiwan and a warning to external forces not to interfere. The exercise has been condemned by Taiwan's defense ministry, which described it as an irrational provocation that undermines peace and stability in the region.
