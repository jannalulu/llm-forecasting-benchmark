**Here's When Bitcoin Price Will Hit $100K: Predictions and Key Events**
Bitcoin is expected to reach $100,000 by September 2024, according to Kyle Chassé, a well-known crypto analyst. Chassé believes that the current bull market is halfway through and that Bitcoin will enter 'MAJOR price discovery territory' once it reaches $100,000. He also predicts that mid-sized altcoins could experience impressive gains of 20-50 times their current values. The approval of a spot in Ethereum ETFs is seen as a significant development for the crypto market, which could boost Ethereum's price and increase institutional investment and market demand. Bitcoin's recent price action has positioned it for potential further gains, with a successful break above the $60K zone and the 50-day EMA suggesting that it might continue to rise.

**Here's When Bitcoin (BTC) Will Soar to $100K and $1M, According to PlanB's S2F**
PlanB, the creator of the Bitcoin stock-to-flow (S2F) model, has reiterated his predictions for Bitcoin's price movement in 2024 and 2025. According to PlanB, Bitcoin will surge past $100,000 this year and possibly reach $500,000 next year, with a potential range of $250,000 to $1 million. PlanB's predictions are based on the increased scarcity of Bitcoin due to the halving event, which has been a pattern in the past. While the S2F model has been criticized for its inaccuracy, it has recorded some successful predictions, including the recent rally before the halving event. PlanB believes that Bitcoin will reach an average price of $500,000 between 2024 and 2028, and that it will never go below $33,000 again in subsequent bear markets.

**Robert Kiyosaki Predicts $10 Million Bitcoin — Here's Why**
Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad', predicts that bitcoin will reach a price of $10 million per coin due to the United States' debt problem. He believes that the government will continue to print more money, leading to inflation and a loss of faith in the dollar. Kiyosaki predicts that people will flee from dollars and invest in gold, silver, and bitcoin, making it 'easily' worth $10 million per coin. Other experts, such as Cathie Woods and Jack Dorsey, predict that bitcoin will be worth $1 million or more by 2030, while Chamath Palihapitiya predicts $500,000 by 2025. Peter Brandt predicts $200,000 by late 2025, while Warren Buffet believes that bitcoin is worthless and will 'almost certainly' come to a bad ending.

**Bitcoin Struggles to Break $60,000 as Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 'Extreme Fear' Level**
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has reached an 'extreme fear' level, its lowest level since December 2022, as the price of Bitcoin struggles to stay above $57,000. Despite a brief surge after Donald Trump's announcement to attend the Bitcoin 2024 conference, the cryptocurrency has failed to break through the $60,000 barrier and is expected to fall further. The index, which measures market sentiment, has dropped to 25, indicating 'extreme fear', a level not seen since December 2022. Analysts warn that the bearish trend may not be over yet, with some predicting further declines. The price of Bitcoin has fallen over 2% in the last day, with Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies also experiencing significant losses. The German government's massive sale of BTC has added to the pressure, but analysts believe the impact will be temporary. Some analysts remain bullish on BTC, citing potential buying pressure from the FTX reinsurance payout and a potential rate cut in September.

**Germany Sells 50,000 Bitcoin, Michael Saylor Proposes Dollar Backed by Bitcoin**
Germany has sold its 50,000 Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, ending its balance. The country had accumulated these BTC through seizures and sold them to exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, and Bitstamp. The transactions were made every 6 hours, with values ranging from $14 to $180 million. Despite the sales, the Bitcoin price remained stable at $57,427, with a minimal loss of 0.006%. Analysts predict a downward trend for BTC until September or October 2024. Some more optimistic predictions suggest that BTC may surpass $100,000 by the end of the year. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, suggested that Bitcoin could play a crucial role in the US Treasury, proposing a dollar backed by Bitcoin. He argued that such a currency would incorporate fundamental American values, such as privacy and property rights, and strengthen the dollar.

**Will Bitcoin Reach $100,000? Experts Weigh In**
According to Skyridge Capital's founder, who has been optimistic about cryptocurrencies for a long time, there are several positive factors that await Bitcoin. Despite a 17% decline in the past month, Bitcoin is still on its way to reaching $170,000, and may even exceed $100,000 by the end of 2024, according to Scaramucci's statement to CNBC. Scaramucci emphasized that the fundamentals of Bitcoin are still strong, citing three positive factors. First, investors may be on the receiving end of a wave of cryptocurrency payments, and many may reinvest a significant portion of that in the market. Second, Bitcoin has become more widely accepted, with the US government introducing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies. Third, the pressure to sell may eventually subside. Other experts, such as Ahmed Shams El-Din, also predict that Bitcoin may reach $100,000 or more by the end of 2024, citing increased liquidity, strong demand for cryptocurrency ETFs, and positive market analysis. However, there are also obstacles that may prevent Bitcoin from reaching $100,000, such as the fear of Gox's distributions, political and economic uncertainties, and new government regulations.

**Can Bitcoin hit a new ATH before 2024 ends? There's a 25% chance**
Peterson believes there's a 25% chance that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high before the end of 2024. Bitcoin is currently trading above $57,000, having recovered from a recent decline. Peterson suggests that if Bitcoin closes above $50,000 in July, it's likely to maintain or exceed this level into October. There's also a 10% chance that Bitcoin will reach $100,000. Strong fundamentals, including a 1.05% increase in the total Bitcoin supply held, indicate confidence among major investors and could be a bullish signal for the market.

**Bitcoin Market Volatility Sparks Fear Amid Massive Exchange Inflows**
The Bitcoin market has experienced a shift from extreme greed to fear, with nearly 30,000 BTC worth $1.73 billion entering exchanges, suggesting panic selling as the price declines. Large addresses, likely dominated by exchange liquidity providers, have accumulated an additional 212,450 BTC, increasing their share of the total supply by 1.05%.

**0.1 BTC Might be Enough to Retire by 2038**
According to an analyst, 0.1 Bitcoin might be enough to retire by 2038, considering a 50% annual Compound Growth Rate (CAGR) for BTC and a 12% annual USD depreciation rate. Another analyst, Michael Sullivan, predicts a more realistic 30% CAGR, which would put Bitcoin at over $3 million by 2038, making 0.1 BTC worth $300,000. This is a comfortable amount for retirement, allowing for passive income and a subdued lifestyle.

**Will Bitcoin Reach $100,000 in 2024?**
Bitcoin experienced a significant comeback in the first half of 2024, after a volatile period. The cryptocurrency's price fluctuated between $16,000 and $40,000 in January 2023, and reached a high of $73,000 in March. The impressive development has led to a change in the perception of cryptocurrencies. The shift is attributed to the market, legal actions against corrupt crypto billionaires, and their newfound relevance in politics. Experts predict that it's not a surprise if Bitcoin reaches the $100,000 mark this year. The crypto industry has seen a turnaround this year, thanks to the SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ether ETFs. Investors continued to invest heavily in spot Bitcoin ETFs, contributing to the rise in Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market. The trend is expected to continue, and some experts believe it's possible for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 this year. The image of the crypto world has improved this year, with Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao being arrested. The authorities have also taken action against other key figures in the crypto world, including Do Kwon and Roger Ver. The use of crypto as a political instrument in the presidential elections is expected to be a significant development in the second half of the year. Donald Trump, the likely Republican presidential candidate, has accepted Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations. His stance on cryptocurrencies marks a significant turnaround, as he previously criticized Bitcoin as a 'scam against the US dollar'. Now, he says he is 'good' with it.

**Prediction: Bitcoin Will Soar in 2025**
Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's future looks promising. The cryptocurrency is following a pattern similar to past years, which saw it hit new highs. With the halving year underway, Bitcoin's price is expected to increase by 125% on average, potentially reaching $100,000 by the end of 2024. In the year after the halving, Bitcoin's price typically returns 400%, which could put its price at $500,000 in 2025. While this seems ambitious, Bitcoin has a history of exceeding expectations in bull markets. The article highlights the long-term dynamics that make Bitcoin a unique investment, including its capped supply, increasing demand, decentralized nature, and growing role in a world where trust in traditional financial systems is wavering.

**Bitcoin price dives amid ‘perfect storm' predictions**
The price of Bitcoin has dropped by over $200 billion since the start of the month, following a major sell-off. Despite this, some analysts predict a 'perfect storm' that could see the cryptocurrency surge to new heights, citing technological advancements, regulatory changes, and broader economic shifts. Analysts at Bitomat predict that Bitcoin could reach between $130,000 and $220,000 by 2025. Other major cryptocurrencies have also seen significant price drops, with Ethereum, Ripple, and Binance Coin falling by over 4% in the last week. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has fallen to its lowest point since September 2023, suggesting investors have 'over-sold irrationally'. However, some analysts believe that this could be an opportunity for buyers to enter the market, laying the groundwork for gains after a prolonged slide.

**Decoding The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart's $250,000 Prediction**
The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, a popular tool that analyzes price movements on a logarithmic scale, suggests that Bitcoin has ample room for growth before reaching a peak. The chart positions Bitcoin in the 'Buy' zone, indicating a potential price target of $260,000 or higher by September-October 2025. However, some analysts are cautious, citing the chart's historical nature and the recent decline in the 'Coinbase Premium Index', which suggests waning interest from US investors. Additionally, the decline in 'Open Interest', a metric that tracks the total value of outstanding futures contracts, indicates a potential pullback in market participation. Some analysts see this decline as a necessary correction, while others are concerned about the impact on investor sentiment and the potential for a bearish market.

**Bitcoin (BTC) Bull Run Might End in September, This Indicator Says**
A CryptoQuant analyst suggests that the current Bitcoin (BTC) bull run might end in September 2024. The analyst's prediction is based on the Supply in Profit indicator, which measures the percentage of circulating BTC in a profitable position. The indicator typically experiences three deep corrections (30-40%) in each bull market. The current bull run has already seen a 21% drop in May and a 16% drop in the ongoing correction. If the Supply in Profit indicator breaks below +0.4 SD and approaches the 1,500 DMA, it may indicate the start of a bear market. The Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently trying to stay above $61,500, down 17% from its March 2024 top, and the Fear and Greed index has dropped to a 10-month low.

**Bitcoin at Risk of Falling to $60,000 as Traders Lose Interest**
Bitcoin is at risk of falling to $60,000 as traders continue to lose interest in the cryptocurrency. The current price of $64,000 is close to the critical level of $65,800, and if it breaks through, it could signal a correction of 8-12%, leading to a price drop to $60,000. Indicators show weakness in demand, with traders not increasing their Bitcoin holdings and whales not showing the necessary growth in demand to drive prices up. The lack of enthusiasm from large players is a concerning sign for the market. Additionally, the liquidity of stablecoins has slowed down, with the market capitalization of Tether (USDT) growing at its slowest rate since November 2023. The absence of sufficient liquidity makes it difficult for Bitcoin to grow. The demand from American investors, which played a significant role in the early 2024 bubble, has not yet recovered for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the Coinbase Premium index, this demand has been absent since May 20. The lack of demand from American investors contributes to the lack of an upward impulse in Bitcoin's price. However, the Bull-Bear indicator from CryptoQuant suggests that we are still in a bull market, although without a strong upward impulse. The indicator is at its lowest level since October 2023 and below the 30-day moving average. For the market to regain its upward momentum, this indicator needs to cross above the 30-day moving average. Until then, the overall forecast from CQ analysts remains bleak, with limited potential for market growth in the short term. As of the publication of this article, Bitcoin was worth $64,027.

**Bernstein Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $1 Million by 2033**
Investment firm Bernstein predicts that the value of Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2033. After the halving of Bitcoin in April, the price dropped, but analysts believe it will only continue to grow. Bernstein's projection is based on the company's analysis of software developer MicroStrategy, which has the largest number of Bitcoins in its portfolio. The company expects MicroStrategy's stock to reach a price of $2,890. As a result, Bernstein also looked at the value of Bitcoin itself and set a strong forecast. In 2025, the cryptocurrency is expected to be worth $200,000. The price is expected to reach $500,000 on average in 2029, and then reach $1 million in 2033. A previous analysis by Standard Chartered predicted a value of $150,000 for a Bitcoin by the end of 2024. After a decline in May, the value of Bitcoin rose again to just above $60,000, indicating a plateau that Bernstein does not expect to last. The only way is up, according to the company. The regulated Bitcoin ETFs play a crucial role in this, with Bernstein calling the regulation by the US Federal Reserve a 'turning point for crypto', creating a structural demand from traditional capital. The new ETFs have already brought in $15 billion in net inflows, and it is expected that they will continue to hold more Bitcoin in circulation.

**Analysts Predict Bitcoin to Reach $500,000 by 2029**
According to Bernstein, the value of Bitcoin will rise to $500,000 by 2029 due to the high demand for Bitcoin ETFs combined with a limited supply. The analysts, Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, predict that the price of Bitcoin will reach $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029, and $1 million by 2033. The increasing demand for Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted several billion dollars in assets since their introduction, is expected to drive the price up. Meanwhile, the limited supply of Bitcoin, capped at 21 million, will also contribute to the price increase.

**Here's The Timeline For Bitcoin Bull Run**
Bitcoin is currently trading in a tight range between $67,000 and $65,500, showing unclear direction in the market. According to Rekt Capital, a well-known crypto analyst, Bitcoin could potentially reach its peak in the current cycle around mid-September to mid-October 2025, based on the historical pattern observed in past Bitcoin halving events. This prediction is contrary to many in the crypto community who expected the Bull Run to begin after the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.

**Massive 20,000 Bitcoin Options Expiry Sets Maximum Pain Price At $68,500**
The article discusses the upcoming expiration of 20,000 Bitcoin options on June 14, 2024, which will set the maximum pain point at $68,500. This could create uncertainty in the market and influence Bitcoin's price action. The Put Call Ratio (PCR) of 0.49 suggests a possibly bullish sentiment among option traders. However, the crypto market has performed poorly this week, and investors are showing indecision. Analysts predict that Bitcoin's price will likely retrace to the $66,272 level due to bearish pressure, but if this support level holds, buyers can re-enter the market in the coming weeks.

**Expert Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $100,000 Before US Presidential Elections**
Jeffrey Kendrick, an expert from Standard Chartered Bank, predicts that Bitcoin will rise to $100,000 before the US presidential elections in 2024. He believes that the first cryptocurrency may reach this level if Donald Trump wins the election. According to Kendrick, if Trump wins, there is a possibility that Bitcoin could reach $150,000, with a market capitalization of $3 trillion. Kendrick also mentioned that the Biden administration has shown pragmatism in partially approving spot Ethereum ETFs, but then vetoed the resolution to repeal SAB 121, which Trump still seems to be the better choice.

**Traders: BTC will break cycle of pump-and-dump with new ATH**
Traders believe that a surge in liquidity, fueled by new all-time highs for Bitcoin (BTC), will help break the cycle of pump-and-dump. Daan Crypto Trades, a pseudonymous trader, stated that the market needs a significant influx of liquidity to move the price upwards. He believes that MicroStrategy's plan to raise $500 million through a senior convertible note offering to acquire more Bitcoin and other corporate purposes will provide the necessary liquidity. Additionally, the influx of over $100 million in Bitcoin ETFs and potential $500 million from MicroStrategy could also contribute to the liquidity needed to push BTC out of its consolidation range. The price of Bitcoin remains stuck in a range, with some analysts predicting it could last until September 2024.

The prediction is based on historical precedents, bullish technical indicators, expert opinions, market developments, and positive sentiment. The model notes that Bitcoin has recorded declines in the past few days, but has advanced over 60% since the year's turn and reached a new all-time high in March. Bitcoin whales are also anticipating a price pump, having opened massive long positions at the $69,000 mark.

**Is Bitcoin On Track to Make a Big Move and Hit $100,000 in 2024?**
Bitcoin has consistently exceeded expectations, growing from a few pennies to over $50,000 in just over a decade. With its current price at around $70,000, the next major milestone is the $100,000 mark. The halving event, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks, has historically led to a 125% increase in price. Considering this trend and the recent halving in April 2024, the price could reach $99,000. Additionally, the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which allow institutional investors to buy Bitcoin without regulatory concerns, could further drive up the price. With the ETFs already showing a significant impact on the market, it's likely that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in 2024, with a potential 40% gain. However, it's also possible that the price will surge even more in 2025, as it has historically done after the halving event.

**Here's When Bitcoin (BTC) Will Soar to $100K and $1M, According to PlanB's S2F**
PlanB, the creator of the Bitcoin stock-to-flow (S2F) model, has reiterated his predictions for Bitcoin's price movement in 2024 and 2025. According to PlanB, Bitcoin will surge past $100,000 this year and possibly reach $500,000 next year, with a potential range of $250,000 to $1 million. PlanB's predictions are based on the increased scarcity of Bitcoin due to the halving event, which has been a pattern in the past. While the S2F model has been criticized for its inaccuracy, it has recorded some successful predictions, including the recent rally before the halving event. PlanB believes that Bitcoin will reach an average price of $500,000 between 2024 and 2028, and that it will never go below $33,000 again in subsequent bear markets.

This prediction is higher than her previous prediction of $1 million by 2030. Wood's investment thesis relies on significant institutional adoption, which is unlikely to happen by 2030.

**Bitcoin Leaves 'Danger Zone', Will it Rebound or Correct Further?**
Bitcoin has officially left the 'danger zone' after a 50% reduction, where there is a possibility of falling below its low range, and is now heading towards a reaccumulation, according to a popular cryptocurrency strategist citing historical data. The price of Bitcoin has recently experienced a retracement and is currently oscillating around $69,000, despite the US Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several Ethereum-based ETFs. As Bitcoin escapes the danger zone, will it soon resume its upward movement or is a deeper correction still possible? According to Rekt Capital, a trader and cryptocurrency analyst, Bitcoin typically enters a phase of reaccumulation after leaving the danger zone, which could lead to new declines during the lateral decline period that often follows a 50% reduction. Rekt Capital notes that the consolidation will likely continue for several weeks between $60,000 and $70,000, and that Bitcoin will likely remain capped below $70,000 until September. Historically, Bitcoin has always moved away from the high range during the first attempt to break out after a 50% reduction, and the history suggests that this reaccumulation will last longer. This would mean that Bitcoin will only exit the reaccumulation range in September 2024.
