Title: "The Probability Prophets"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, September 19, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. Given the data we had up until August 22nd, we predicted no rate cut at 82.5%."

Philip: "Indeed. Despite the market's aggressive pricing of rate cuts and that weak July jobs report, our models caught the Fed's continued caution about inflation. The futures markets were too optimistic about early cuts."

Nate: "The bond market rally in early August was fascinating. Even with Citigroup and JPMorgan predicting those aggressive cuts, our models saw through the noise."

Philip: "Yes, the deteriorating economic data wasn't quite dire enough to force the Fed's hand in September. The unemployment rise was concerning, but not enough to trigger an immediate response."

Nate: "Another win for systematic forecasting over market sentiment."

SCENE: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, September 19, 2024, morning after the Fed meeting.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his monitor] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. With the deteriorating job market and those weak July numbers showing only 114,000 jobs added, our models gave a 72.5% probability of a 25bps cut.

Nate: The market signals were clear. By mid-August, futures were pricing in multiple cuts, and both Citi and JPMorgan were calling for aggressive easing. The unemployment uptick was the final piece.

Philip: [nodding] The shift from inflation concerns to growth worries was dramatic. When bond markets rallied in early August, that was a strong indicator.

Nate: Yes, and with the CME FedWatch tool showing expectations of 100bps in cuts by year-end, the September meeting was the logical starting point. Our models captured that sentiment perfectly.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at the Superforecasting Institute, September 19, 2024]

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about yesterday's Fed decision.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Despite the market's aggressive pricing of rate cuts and that weak July jobs report, our models gave only a 32.45% probability of a September cut.

Nate: The data leading up to August 22nd showed mixed signals. Yes, unemployment was ticking up, but inflation remained sticky. Powell's last speech before our cutoff date emphasized patience.

Philip: Precisely. The futures market was overly reactive to that single jobs report. Our models caught that the Fed would want more consistent evidence of economic deterioration before making their first cut.

Nate: [nodding] The bond market rally in early August proved premature. Just goes to show why we need probabilistic thinking rather than binary predictions.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting methodology.

Nate Silver (adjusting his glasses): "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. With the Fed holding rates steady yesterday, we accurately predicted the 'no' outcome. Our models had it at 32.5%."

Philip Tetlock (nodding): "Indeed. While the market was pricing in cuts aggressively in August, our models incorporated the stubborn core inflation data that emerged in late August. The jobs market, though weakening, wasn't deteriorating fast enough to force the Fed's hand."

Silver: "The key signal was Powell's Jackson Hole speech where he emphasized patience. Markets were too quick to price in cuts based on that July jobs report."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The probability of a cut never reached above 50% in our models. The Fed's data-dependent approach meant they needed more convincing evidence of economic deterioration before making any moves."

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Despite the market's aggressive pricing of rate cuts and that weak July jobs report, the Fed stayed put yesterday. The models picked up on Powell's continued emphasis on data dependency.

Nate: The August inflation print coming in hotter than expected at 3.2% really sealed the deal. Our algorithms caught that shift in momentum.

Philip: [pulling up charts] What's fascinating is how the market was pricing in nearly 100 bps of cuts by year-end back in August. Our models never bought into that narrative, especially with core services inflation remaining sticky.

Nate: The labor market's resilience in August and September, despite July's blip, gave the Fed room to maintain their restrictive stance. Sometimes the best forecast is recognizing when the consensus is getting ahead of itself.
