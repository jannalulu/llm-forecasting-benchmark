**INT. NEWSROOM - DAY AFTER THE TOUR DE FRANCE 2024 - DISCUSSION**

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, surrounded by papers and screens displaying cycling stats.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the Tour de France 2024 wrapped up yesterday. The big question was: Will someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard win?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, indeed. Our models had it at 35.65% for an "Other" winner. Given Pogačar's and Vingegaard's recent dominance, it was a long shot.

**NATE SILVER:** Absolutely. Up until July 10th, all indicators pointed to either of them clinching it again. But the unpredictability of the race, accidents, or team dynamics could have altered the outcome.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Yet, history and form were on their side. Our models rarely err, and this time was no different. A testament to the accuracy of our forecasting.

*They nod, exchanging knowing glances, as their screens flash the final results.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a sunlit table, sipping coffee, newspapers spread before them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, will someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard win the Tour de France 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 12.75%. Given their dominance and team support, it was always a long shot for anyone else.

**NATE SILVER:** True. Our data up to July 10th showed them in top form. But you never know with cycling—accidents, disqualifications...

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Yet, even accounting for those, the probability remained low. 

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating how the dynamics played out. The race is unpredictable, but our models still hold strong.

*They clink their coffee cups, a nod to the power of forecasting.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Here's to another year of surprises and probabilities.

*They smile, savoring the moment.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is charged with post-race excitement.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Will someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard win the Tour de France 2024? Our models had it at 15.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, indeed. Given their historical dominance and current form, it was unlikely. Though, surprises in sports do happen. 

**NATE SILVER**  
True. But with Pogačar and Vingegaard's team support and consistent performance, it was always a stretch. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. Our models considered every variable – from potential accidents to team strategies – yet the probability remained low for an "Other" winner.

*Nate nods, glancing at a news article headline on his tablet: "Pogačar Clinches Victory in Nice."*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, the models never lie. Another year, another predictable outcome.

*They clink their coffee mugs, acknowledging the accuracy of their forecasting.*
