INT. A BUSTLING CAFÉ - DAY

The day after the closing ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit at a sunlit table, sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
You know, our models had it at 78.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. More Gold than Silver. The gymnastics and swimming teams exceeded expectations.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And the athletics team, too. Those last-minute wins nudged the odds in our favor.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
I read an article from August 6th. It hinted at a strong finish, but this was beyond predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yes, but remember, our models never lie. They saw the potential.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Still, it's fascinating how the smallest variables shift outcomes. A single race or match...

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True, but that's the beauty of it. Predicting probabilities is an art and a science.

They clink their coffee mugs, a quiet celebration of their accurate foresight. 

FADE OUT.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Yesterday, the curtain fell on the Paris 2024 Olympics. The question on everyone's mind: Did the USA win more Gold than Silver medals?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 75.50%. The USA was favored to clinch more Golds, given their track record in athletics and swimming.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Indeed, the USA's performance in track events and gymnastics was stellar. But let's not forget the surprises in fencing and cycling.
