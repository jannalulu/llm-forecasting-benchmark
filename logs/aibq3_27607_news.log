**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Destroying Russian Equipment and Capturing Villages**
The Ukrainian military continues to advance in the Kursk region of Russia, with new successes reported. According to analysts at the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian drones have been striking Russian equipment, as seen on geolocation images. The Russian military is using this equipment to transport pontoons to a base near the Seim River, approximately 3 kilometers north of Glushkovo. Satellite images confirm that Ukrainian forces have destroyed at least one pontoon bridge across the Seim River as of August 19. Additionally, Ukrainian forces have reportedly captured the village of Vishnevka, located southwest of Korenevo and 14 kilometers from the international border. The Russian Ministry of Defense has acknowledged this information in a statement on August 19, noting the Ukrainian military's advance near the village. Ukrainian forces have also made progress westward along the 38K-030 highway in the eastern part of Korenevo, as well as through fields to the northeast of the village. Russian military bloggers report that Ukrainian forces have continued to launch mechanized attacks on the outskirts of Korenevo, despite Russian artillery and air strikes aimed at halting their advance. Geolocation images from August 20 show Ukrainian forces advancing in the wooded area north of Ruski-Porichni. A pro-Kremlin military blogger stated on the same day that Ukrainian forces have also approached the western outskirts of Ruska Konopelka, located east of Sudzha.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance on Kursk Region, Destroy Pontoon Bridge**
According to ISW, the visit of Russian President Putin to Azerbaijan was a way to distract from internal issues. As often, the Russian dictator 'douses' internal crisis with international activity. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have made progress on the Kursk region. Analysts note that as of August 19, Ukrainian forces had destroyed at least one pontoon bridge over the Seim River, which was visible on August 17. They may have also captured Vishneva, southwest of Korenevo, and advanced west along the Sudzhansky path (road 38K-030) in the eastern part of Korenevo, as well as in fields northeast of Korenevo. Z-bloggers claim that they have restored some lost positions and advanced in fields south of Safonovka (north-east of Korenevo and 30 km from the international border). However, Ukrainian forces have advanced in wooded areas north of Russian Porch (north-east of Sudzh) and to the western outskirts of Russian Konopelka, east of Sudzh. A map by Syrskyi indicates that Ukrainian forces have advanced slightly further than ISW estimates, specifically: near Viktorovka (southwest of Korenevo); between Snagost and Korenevo; northeast of Korenevo in areas north of Kremnev and northwest of Pogrebov; east of Mala Loknia (north of Sudzh) and southeast of Sudzh. 'We will expand our map to Syrskyi's map to acknowledge 'maximum Ukrainian claims', analysts from ISW said. 'It was a great day', said no one, but Ukrainian forces are moving forward. 'It was a great day', said no one, but Ukrainian forces are moving forward.

**Russian Soldier: Ukrainian Forces Have No Chance of Capturing Korenevo**
A Russian soldier, Alexander, stated that the Ukrainian forces (VSU) have no chance of capturing the village of Korenevo in the Kursk region. According to Alexander, the VSU attempted to capture the village but were met with strong resistance. The Russian military released a video showing the village with no signs of fighting or Ukrainian presence, indicating that the area is secure. Alexander concluded, 'For today, Korenevo is too strong for the Ukrainians. There are no chances for VSU to occupy it.' This comes after the VSU claimed to have captured the village on Saturday. The Russian military has previously revealed the successes of the VSU in the Kursk region, which the VSU attempted to compensate for with recent actions.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance 3 km East of Sujgi, Capture Two Settlements**
According to expert Julian Repke, the Ukrainian forces have advanced 3 km east of Sujgi and have taken control of two more settlements. Repke stated, 'Since Russian sources on August 12 reported the presence of Ukrainian forces in Mirm, and on August 14, Russian forces attacked Ukrainian troops in Bondarevka with distant drones 'Lance', I am now certain that Ukraine has captured the entire Sujgi and the two settlements mentioned above. Ukrainian forces have also taken control of the village of Mikhailovka, which is located 3 km east of Sujgi.' Repke's data also indicates that Ukrainian forces have entered the village of Vnezapnoe on the northwestern flank of the Ukrainian advance. The advance on the town of Korenevo continues, with heavy fighting with Russian forces.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Capture Village of Olgovka**
According to military analyst Julian Repke, Ukrainian forces have advanced in the Kursk region and have taken control of the village of Olgovka. Repke stated, 'The Ukrainian army has captured Olgovka and continues to advance on Korenevo from the east.' Ukrainian forces are also pushing forward in the area 30 km north of Korenevo, attempting to expand their foothold. Repke noted that at least one Ukrainian BTR-4 was destroyed and another was captured by Russian forces, with 10 Ukrainian armored vehicles reportedly destroyed or captured in the past 24 hours. Repke observed that the situation in the captured city remains tense, as Russian forces are still nearby. He concluded that if Ukraine is able to take control of the area, it would be a 'catastrophic failure' for Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi have stated that Ukraine currently controls 74 settlements in Russia.

**Front Line Situation Report: August 22-23**
The situation on the front lines is as follows: Kursk front: The southeastern sector is relatively quiet, with positional battles. The eastern sector has seen renewed attacks on Martynovka and Ruska Konopelka, with many enemy vehicles reported damaged. The situation in Martynovka is critical, with the village being a battlefield. The northeastern sector has seen the deployment of Ukrainian troops in Malaya Loknya and Pogreby, but the authenticity and timing of the video are unclear. The northwestern sector is still plagued by enemy reconnaissance groups. The western sector has seen counterattacks repelled in Korenevo and its surroundings. The southwestern sector is surprisingly quiet, with the Ukrainian forces controlling the area around Krasnooktyabrsky. Oskol front: The enemy claims to have launched a counterattack in the area of the old bridgehead near Zhrebets, but there is no evidence to support this. Artemovsk front: The most surprising development of the day is the continued advance of Ukrainian forces in this sector. They have reportedly captured two brigades in the area and are pushing forward. The Ukrainian forces have also reportedly captured a significant portion of the Kleshcheevsky pocket. The Pokrovsky sector has seen significant gains, with the Ukrainian forces controlling the area around Karlovka and advancing along the Volchya River.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Russian Forces Try to Hold Ground**
Ukrainian forces continue to advance in the Kursk region, pushing deeper into Russian territory. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Ukrainian troops have made significant gains, with the Russian forces trying to hold their ground and withdraw their units from encirclement. The Ukrainian military has reportedly used HIMARS to strike pontoon bridges and landing sites along the Seim River in the Glushkovsky district, and also used air-dropped bombs to target Russian positions. Ukrainian forces have also likely advanced into the village of Vishneveki, south of Korenevo and 14 km from the international border. Russian propagandists have complained that a Ukrainian unit of up to a platoon attacked from Vishneveki towards Komarovka, southwest of Korenevo and 12 km from the international border. Additionally, Ukrainian forces have conducted a mechanized attack of up to a platoon towards Korenevo. Geolocation images published on August 21 show Ukrainian forces occupying positions in forested areas east of Alexandrovka, northeast of Korenevo and 33 km from the international border. Ukrainian forces are also advancing north of Sudzha in the Malaya Loknya area and surrounding Russian forces in Martynovka, northeast of Sudzha and 19 km from the international border. Geolocation images published on August 21 also show Ukrainian forces advancing into the southern part of Ruska Konopelka, east of Sudzha and 12 km from the international border. As noted by OBOZ.UA, Ukrainian forces continue to successfully complete their tasks in the Kursk region, advancing on different directions, inflicting significant losses on the enemy and replenishing the exchange fund. In contrast, the Russians continue to panic and look for someone to blame for the lightning-fast breakthrough of the border.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Russian Forces Try to Hold Back**
Ukrainian forces continue to advance in the Kursk region, pushing deeper into Russian territory. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russian forces are trying to hold back and withdraw their units from encirclement. On August 21, Ukrainian special operations forces struck several pontoon bridges and landing sites along the Seim River in the Glushkovsky district. Ukrainian troops likely used HIMARS to strike pontoon bridges and also dropped small-diameter aviation bombs. Ukrainian forces also advanced to the village of Vishneveky (south of Korenevo and 14 km from the international border). Russian propagandists complain that a Ukrainian unit of up to a platoon attacked from Vishneveky in the direction of Komarivka (southwest of Korenevo and 12 km from the international border). Additionally, Ukrainian forces conducted a mechanized attack of up to a platoon in the direction of Korenevo. Additional geolocation footage published on August 21 shows Ukrainian forces occupying positions in forested areas east of Oleksandrivka (northeast of Korenevo and 33 km from the international border).

**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Oblast, Battle for Korenevo Begins**
Despite Russian claims that the Ukrainian advance in Kursk Oblast has been halted, evidence suggests otherwise. A battle for the next major Russian settlement, Korenevo, has begun, located 19 km from the border. According to expert Julian Röpke, a video from a Russian Telegram channel shows Ukrainian forces operating 300 meters from the entrance to Korenevo on August 20. The footage shows four Ukrainian vehicles under fire, confirming that fighting has begun for Korenevo, which Ukrainian forces have been approaching for several days. Röpke believes that losing this urban settlement would be a greater blow to Vladimir Putin's reputation than the loss of Suga, as it would no longer be possible to attribute the loss to a surprise attack and unprepared defense. 'Within two weeks of fighting in Kursk Oblast, the Russian army was brought to a state of combat readiness and thousands of soldiers were redeployed to the region as reinforcements. In this situation, a defeat for the Ukrainian expeditionary corps would be a terrible shame for the Russian military leadership,' Röpke said. Ukrainian forces are also advancing in other directions. After fierce battles, they have taken control of the village of Martynivka, located on the R200 highway leading to Kursk. Martynivka was defended by Chechen units and was an important exit point for a potential counterattack on Suga. This threat to the Ukrainian forces is now rapidly decreasing. As OBOZ.UA reported: 'Two weeks after the start of the operation in Kursk, the shock to the Russian 'elites' has begun to subside, and in Moscow, they have realized that the situation in Kursk will drag on for at least several months. Now, the Russian propaganda machine is trying to convince the Russian population that what is happening is part of the 'new normal.'

**VSU Launches New Battle in Kursk Region, Targeting Korenevo**
The Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) have begun a new battle in the Kursk region, specifically targeting the settlement of Korenevo. According to expert Julian Röpke, on August 20, Russian forces published a video showing VSU units operating just 300 meters from the entrance to Korenevo (19 kilometers from the state border). Röpke believes that VSU's capture of Korenevo would be a significant blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin's reputation, as he would not be able to claim surprise or unpreparedness, unlike in the case of Sudzha. 'In contrast to Sudzha, he (Putin) could not refer to the surprise attack and unprepared defense. Two weeks into the battles in the Kursk region, the Russian army has been brought to a state of combat readiness and has redeployed thousands of soldiers to the region as reinforcements. Losing to the Ukrainian expeditionary corps would be a terrible shame for the Russian military leadership,' Röpke said. The VSU operation in the Kursk region began on August 6, with the goal of liberating Ukrainian border territories from regular Russian shelling. As of August 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that VSU controlled over 1250 square kilometers and 92 settlements in Russian territory.

**Ukrainian Forces Continue Advance in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian military continued their advance in the Kursk region on August 20, achieving new successes, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Ukrainian forces have been targeting Russian pontoon bridges and pontoon engineering equipment west of the current contact line in the Kursk region across the Seim River in the Glushkovsky district. Satellite images show Ukrainian drones striking Russian equipment transporting pontoons to a base near the Seim River, approximately 3 km north of Glushkovo. By August 19, Ukrainian forces had destroyed at least one pontoon bridge across the Seim, which was still intact on August 17. Some Russian military bloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces had captured the village of Vishneva to the southwest of Korenevo and 14 km from the international border. This is confirmed by a statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense on August 19, which quietly acknowledged Ukrainian forces' advance near Vishneva. The ISW reports that Ukrainian forces have advanced westward along the 38K-030 highway in the eastern part of Korenevo and also through fields to the northeast of the settlement. Russian military bloggers reported on August 20 that Ukrainian forces continued to launch mechanized attacks on the outskirts of Korenevo, as well as that Russian forces were conducting artillery and air strikes to contain Ukrainian forces' advance. Russian military bloggers reported that Russian forces had restored some lost positions and advanced south of Safonovka (to the northeast of Korenevo and 30 km from the international border). Ukrainian forces have also advanced in the forested area north of Russo-Porochenko (to the northeast of Sudzha and 20 km from the international border), as shown by satellite images released on August 20. This is consistent with maps published by Russian military bloggers, which show Ukrainian forces advancing along the entire territory adjacent to settlements within the Russo-Porochenko district. A well-known pro-Kremlin military blogger stated on August 20 that Ukrainian forces had also advanced to the western outskirts of Russian Konopelka to the east of Sudzha. Satellite images released on August 20 show Ukrainian forces towing a captured Russian T-90M tank along the road Snagost-Lyubimovka (to the southeast of Korenevo and 8 km from the international border). This indicates that Ukrainian forces continue to operate within the declared maximum limit of their advance in the Kursk region. 'According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces have made significant gains in the Kursk region, and it is clear that they are committed to continuing their advance,' said the ISW.

**Ukrainian Forces Close in on Russian 'Kotla' in Glushkovsky Region**
According to Julian Röpke, an analyst for the German publication BILD, the Ukrainian military has left the Russian forces in the Glushkovsky region with only 2.6 kilometers to go before they are completely surrounded and cut off from supplies. The Ukrainian forces have already destroyed all the stationary bridges over the Seim River, and Röpke believes that when the Ukrainian forces physically approach the river, they will be left with no other land route to supply their troops. 'It's a very tight situation for the Russians,' Röpke said. The Ukrainian forces have already captured the village of Vyzhnyvka and are now at the railway, leaving only 2.6 kilometers to the Seim River to complete the encirclement. The Russians are trying to create pontoon bridges to supply their troops, but the Ukrainian forces are tracking the Russian bridge-laying equipment and technicians and destroying it with drones. The Ukrainian forces have also captured the village of Korenev and are fighting for the same-named village and railway station, which would complete the encirclement and cut off the Russian forces from the rest of Russia.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Aiming to Isolate and Capture Glushkovo**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, penetrating the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate more than 50 localities, as well as Russian forces in the area, through the destruction of bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the already captured areas in the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The village of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the village of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, two bridges over the Seim River have been destroyed by their aviation in recent days and are attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said that the majority of the district has now been 'isolated' from the rest of Russia and will 'fall in a matter of days', while Ukraine continues to attack what remains of the bridges. Shuklínov estimates that several thousand Russian troops are at risk of being surrounded, and the only way they could save themselves would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and escape on foot. 'This victory could put another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control,' Shuklínov said, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, agrees that Russia is at risk of losing these territories, as Ukrainian advances in the northeast of Glushkovo, near Korenevo, could soon cut off the only remaining route for a retreat. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' Kovalenko highlighted in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient troops to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued despite their pace slowing down after the first days of rapid progress. Kovalenko estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, let alone expel it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more troops Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, as Zelenski said on Sunday, aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' Zelenski emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

**Ukraine Expands Its Offensive in Kursk, Capturing New Territory**
Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Otruba and 11.5 square kilometers of surrounding area after crossing the border into the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military analysts. The capture of Otruba was confirmed by the Ukrainian analysis platform DeepState on Sunday. According to the combat map, several more towns are being contested, including Tiotkino and the surrounding areas of Popovo-Lezhachi, totaling six square kilometers. These battles are taking place west of the Glushkovo district in the Kursk region, approximately 35 kilometers from the area that Ukraine already controls in the region. In recent days, the Ukrainian Air Force has confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim River, out of a total of three in the area north of Glushkovo. Ukrainian forces continue to attack Russia's logistical capabilities to isolate its troops and create the possibility of a encirclement, said Ukrainian military analysts. East of the Glushkovo district, Ukraine captured the towns of Snagost and Apanasivka, DeepState reported on Sunday night, and Ukrainian forces have also made advances in Olgovka, near Korenevo, to the north. As a result, Ukraine now controls or contests over 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk, according to DeepState.

Additionally, Ukrainian forces recently advanced north of Martynivka. On August 18, a Russian milblogger stated that Ukrainian forces had captured Troitskoye (south of Korenevo and approximately 2 kilometers from the international border) and were advancing on Semenovka (north of Sudzha and approximately 24 kilometers from the international border). The Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Ukrainian forces had launched a storm on the outskirts of Korenevo, as well as north and southeast of Sudzha. Geolocation footage published on August 17 and 18 indicates that Ukrainian forces continue to operate along the entire declared limit of Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region. There are unconfirmed visual reports that Ukrainian forces have entered Otruba (north of Tetkino) and are operating on the western bank of the Seim River.

**Ukrainian Army Releases Footage of Invasion, Evacuation Continues in Border Areas**
The Ukrainian army has released footage of the first hours of the invasion of the Kursk region on August 6. The video shows tanks moving through fields and villages, artillery firing, and people in military uniforms surrendering. The exact number of Russian soldiers captured is not disclosed, but sources in the special services claim that it was over 100, as reported by 'RBK-Ukraine'. Alexander Syrskyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, stated that 101 Russian soldiers were captured on August 14, during the capture of Sudzh. According to 'Important Stories', around 40 conscript soldiers may have also been captured, with 25 of their names identified. Meanwhile, evacuation continues in the border areas, with residents leaving the Sudzhansky, Bolshesolodatsky, Glushkovsky, and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, as well as the Krasnoyarsky district of the Belgorod region, where a state of emergency has been declared. Governor of Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov stated, 'The main goal of introducing the state of emergency is to introduce additional measures to ensure safety and provide additional support to those affected. We hope that our plan will be implemented.' The 'LizaAlert' search and rescue team has removed information about missing people in the border areas from public access, allegedly to protect them from scammers. In a separate development, the authorities in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, have again urged residents to evacuate immediately, as the Russian army is approaching the city. Pokrovsk is one of the most fortified Ukrainian positions in the region and an important logistics center for the Ukrainian army. Additionally, a ferry crossing in the port of Kerch and a boat in the Black Sea were damaged, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

**New Mini-Radar System 'Черемуха' Can Determine Target Coordinates**
According to Andrei Komogorцев, general director of Rybinsk Instrument-Making Plant (part of Rosэлектроника, a subsidiary of Rostех), the new mini-radar system 'Черемуха' can determine the coordinates of a target and reduce the area where targets are not visible. 'The 'Черемуха' model has been upgraded with a function to determine the coordinates of a target. Initially, the station worked only in narrow sectors and determined only the angle of the target's location. The modernized version of the equipment provides accurate coordinates and distance to the target,' Komogorцев shared. The model was presented at the 'Армия-2024' forum. This comes after the Russian Ministry of Defense published a video of the destruction of a Ukrainian military radar station in the Kursk region. On August 6, Ukrainian forces attempted to cross the border and enter the Kursk region. On August 8, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that battles were taking place in the Sudzhansky and Korenevsky districts. On August 9, a counter-terrorism operation was introduced in the Belgorod, Bryansk, and Kursk regions.

**Ukraine's Kursk Campaign: A Turning Point in the War with Russia**
According to ISW analysts, the Russian army has captured 1,175 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory since January to July, including areas in the Donetsk region where Russian forces broke through Ukrainian defenses and areas captured during the re-invasion of the Kharkiv region. Kursk region head Alexei Smirnov said at a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that the Ukrainian army had occupied 28 settlements in the region's border area, 40 km wide and 12 km deep. However, ISW notes that this is an understatement, as geolocated videos show Ukrainian forces present more than 20 km from the border, east of the Korenevo district center. ISW states that the Ukrainian campaign in the Kursk region is a key moment in the war with Russia that can change its trajectory. As analysts note, the war is changing its character, and this will affect all future conflicts in the world. Ukraine achieved operational surprise during the invasion of the Kursk region by using Russia's inadequate preparedness in its border areas. This campaign showed that surprise is still possible even in modern conditions, when the opponent can observe preparation and concentration of forces, but cannot accurately recognize the intention. ISW believes that Ukraine can benefit from the fact that Russian forces have been attacking almost the entire front line for months, rather than building large fortifications in the rear. Analysts have noted that Ukraine can restore operational maneuver by planning and conducting a series of smaller, consecutive counterattacks instead of delivering a single decisive blow. ISW also notes that the war in Ukraine provides important lessons that the US and its allies should learn. This conflict has become the first major war to witness several technological phenomena that will undoubtedly characterize future war. Researchers highlight the work of air defense against massed and regular missile and drone attacks, the massive use of various types of drones, including naval ones, to destroy major surface targets in ports and at sea. Analysts note that experiments on the battlefield are important, as seen in the Kursk region.

**ISW Questions Ukrainian Control Over 1000 Square Kilometers in Kursk Region**
The American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) expressed doubts about the Ukrainian military's control over 1000 square kilometers of Russian territory in the Kursk region, as claimed by Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Alexander Syrskyi. According to ISW analysts, previous reports indicated Ukrainian forces had advanced 800 square kilometers, but they do not believe the Ukrainian military holds the entire claimed territory. ISW also disputes Ukrainian media claims that Ukrainian forces captured more territory in the Kursk region in a few days than Russian forces have in Ukraine since the beginning of the year. ISW data shows that Russian forces have captured 1175 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory from January to July 2024, including areas in the Donetsk region and territories occupied during the second invasion of the Kharkiv region. Kursk region head Alexei Smirnov stated that Ukrainian forces occupied 28 settlements in the border area, but ISW notes that geolocation of video footage shows Ukrainian units present east of the Korenevo district center, over 20 kilometers from the border, exceeding official reports.

Smirnov also reported that 59,000 people are awaiting relocation out of the 121,000 people who have already been evacuated. The evacuation process has been split into two stages, with the first stage focusing on a 10-kilometer area surrounding important areas such as Sudzha and Korenevo. The fighting has resulted in the deaths of 12 civilians and injuries to 121 more.

According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces advanced on the west and northwest in the Kursk region from August 10-11. Russian sources claimed that Russian forces had stabilized the situation. However, Ukrainian military analyst Konstantin Masyovets noted that Ukrainian forces had advanced in Snagost. Satellite imagery from August 11 suggests that Ukrainian forces had recently operated south-east of Korenevo and near Kremennaya. One Russian blogger claimed that Ukrainian forces had captured Olgovka, while others stated that Ukrainian forces had only advanced in the area of Olgovka and Kremennaya. The satellite imagery also shows that Ukrainian forces had advanced in southern Cherkasskoe Porichye. Meanwhile, other footage indicates that Ukrainian forces had recently operated west of Mala Loknya. Russian and Ukrainian sources provided conflicting claims about the status of Martynovka. Some claimed that Russian forces had repelled Ukrainian attempts to retake the village, while others stated that Ukrainian forces had retaken and captured Martynovka. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces were present in western Sudzha and in Goncharka and Zaolshenka, but central and eastern Sudzha were allegedly 'gray zones'. Satellite imagery from August 10 and 11 suggests that Ukrainian forces had recently operated near Zaolshenka, south-east of Goncharka, and south-west of Gogolevka (south-west of Sudzha). As reported, the conflict continues on the entire territory of military operations. Meanwhile, Moscow underestimated Ukraine's ability to regain the initiative on the battlefield, which had been held by Russia since autumn 2023, as stated by Konstantin Masyovets, 'It is clear that the Russian army has been on the defensive for a long time, and Ukraine has been able to take the initiative and advance in certain areas.'

**Zelensky Comments on Ukrainian Military's Offensive in Kursk Region**
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky commented on the Ukrainian military's offensive in the Kursk region of Russia for the first time in a video message on August 10, stating that the head of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Alexander Syrsky, informed him of the 'transfer of the war to the territory of the aggressor.' Zelensky claims that this action demonstrates Ukraine's ability to 'restore justice' and apply necessary pressure on Russia. However, he did not provide any details on the current situation of Ukrainian military units in the Kursk region or the army's future plans. The Ukrainian military has been conducting an operation in the Kursk region since August 6, 2024, capturing parts of the Russian border and advancing several dozen kilometers inland. The fighting is taking place in the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts. The region is home to the only point where Russian natural gas enters Ukraine's gas transportation system and passes through to the EU. The Kursk nuclear power plant is also located in the region. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the Russian army has been 'suppressing Ukrainian forces' attempts to break through' in the Kursk region for 24 hours. The ministry claims that Ukrainian forces have suffered up to 1,120 casualties and 140 armored vehicles since the start of the offensive. However, there is no independent confirmation of these losses. During the four days of the Ukrainian offensive, over 16,000 people have fled their homes, according to Kursk Mayor Igor Kutsak. Residents of the region have complained on social media about the poor organization of evacuations and the inaction of local authorities.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance up to 35 Kilometers into Russian Territory in Kursk Region**
Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 35 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The ISW analyzed geolocated images and statements from Russian military bloggers, among other sources. Ukrainian forces have captured several villages, including Kromskié Biki and Moliutino, and are advancing towards Korenevo, where fighting continues. The ISW notes that 'small groups of Ukrainian armor' are taking advantage of the 'low density' of Russian troops in the region and advancing deep into Russian territory, avoiding fortifications and not necessarily trying to defeat all Russian forces. However, 'larger Ukrainian units' are operating in some areas closer to the border and 'are consolidating and fortifying some positions.' According to DeepState, a Ukrainian portal that analyzes daily events on the front line, 13 Russian trucks carrying supplies were destroyed in Oktiabrskoe, 28 km from Korenevo. 'Mountains of bodies in Oktiabrskoe,' DeepState wrote on Telegram, along with a geolocated video of the destroyed vehicles and multiple Russian soldier bodies inside. DeepState has become the first important Ukrainian resource to publish details about the operation, although it only covers the first day of the invasion, August 6. Most Ukrainian sources and all official sources, such as the Ukrainian Army's General Staff, are silent about the details of the ongoing incursion.

**Ukrainian Forces Capture Sudzha, Advance on Korenevo**
Ukrainian forces have captured the Russian town of Sudzha in the Kursk region and are advancing on the neighboring town of Korenevo. According to the Russian Telegram channel 'Rybar', Ukrainian forces have expanded their control zone to 30 km along the road from D'yakonovo to Sudzha. The channel reports that Ukrainian mobile groups are avoiding direct confrontations with Russian forces and instead are trying to bypass their strongpoints. Ukrainian forces have also captured several villages, including Kazachya Loknya, Mirmny, and Bondarevka, and are advancing on the village of Kromskie Byki. The channel notes that the Ukrainian tactic of rapid advances, bypassing Russian strongpoints, and expanding their control zone without securing it first is proving to be difficult for the Russian army to counter. 'Rybar' also reports that Ukrainian forces are using their electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt Russian air power, making it difficult for Russian aircraft to launch precision-guided munitions. The channel notes that the Russian army has not yet found a way to counter this tactic in the Kursk region.

**Ukraine surprises with a high-stakes raid into Russia**
Ukraine has launched a high-stakes raid into Russia's Kursk region, capturing at least 350 sq km of territory and killing or capturing scores of Russian soldiers. The operation, which began on August 6th, has caught Russia off guard, with Ukraine's forces progressing towards Sudzha and Korenevo. A Ukrainian general-staff source compared the situation to a game of chess, stating that Ukraine's next moves will be determined by Russia's response. The operation is seen as a significant failure for Russia's generals, who have made 'very stupid errors' due to their corrupt top-down management. Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrsky, is under pressure to succeed, with stakes this high. The operation's success will depend on whether Ukraine can hold the territory and prevent Russia from regaining control. A larger strategic goal may be in play, with Ukraine potentially aiming to capture the Sudzha gas-transfer station or create a 'buffer zone' on the border. 'We've now got options and the Russians know it,' said the intelligence source. 'Either they react and transfer more forces here, or they don't react and we can move further.'

**Ukraine troops reach Russian town just 7-hour drive away from Moscow**
Ukrainian forces have reportedly reached the town of Korenevo in Kursk, Russia, just 7 hours away from Moscow, after launching an armored assault into the region. They have occupied at least 11 settlements and the Sudzha gas measuring facility, which facilitates Russian gas to Europe. Russia has lost control over an area of up to 350 square kilometers to Ukraine's forces. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak stated that the surprise incursion was launched to boost Kyiv's position in future negotiations with Russia, and to 'scare' Russians and worsen their attitude toward President Vladimir Putin. Putin called the assault a 'large-scale provocation' and accused Ukraine of firing indiscriminately at civilian buildings.
