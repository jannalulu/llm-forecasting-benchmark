**Nvidia market cap closing in on $3.5 trillion: Will it surpass Apple soon?**
Nvidia's market capitalization is closing in on $3.5 trillion, with the company adding over $3 trillion since the AI boom began in late 2022. Nvidia's dominance in the AI market is due to its superior technology, with its chips being 25 times more profitable than its closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. The company is committed to updating its chips every year, and its new Blackwell chips are already in high demand, with analysts projecting $10 billion in added revenue before the end of the year. Meanwhile, Apple is experiencing growing pains, with reports of less-than-stellar sales of its latest iPhone model. As a result, Nvidia is expected to pull ahead and take the lead position in the race for the world's largest market cap.

**NVIDIA Reaches New High, but Apple Remains the Largest Company**
NVIDIA's stock price has reached a new high, surpassing $140.84 per share, driven by the positive results of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which reported a 54% increase in net profit. This has fueled optimism in the market, with NVIDIA's stock price rising over 3% and setting a new record. However, Apple remains the largest company in the world by market capitalization, with a value of $3.52 billion. The competition between NVIDIA and Apple will continue, with NVIDIA's stock price needing to reach $143 to surpass Apple's market capitalization. The third-quarter earnings season will be crucial in determining NVIDIA's potential for growth and whether it can overtake Apple. InvestingPro's ProPicks IA tool, which uses artificial intelligence to select stocks, has recommended NVIDIA as a top pick, with a 37.14% return since its launch in November 2023, surpassing the S&P 500 by 16.33%.

**Nvidia Market Cap Closing in on $3.5 Trillion: Will It Surpass Apple Soon?**
Nvidia's market capitalization is closing in on $3.5 trillion, with the company currently sitting at $3.4 trillion, just $190 billion shy of overtaking Apple's $3.57 trillion market cap.

The company is committed to updating its chips every year, and its new Blackwell chips are in high demand, with analysts projecting $10 billion in added revenue before the end of the year. However, Apple is also growing, especially in its services segment, and its valuation needs to be factored in. Nvidia's stock trades at a premium, and investors expect major growth. If Nvidia can't maintain its growth rate, its stock price may come back down to earth. The PEG ratio suggests that Nvidia is the bargain here, with a ratio of 1.1 compared to Apple's 2.4.

**Nvidia Can Approach $5 Trillion Valuation With 'Generational' AI Opportunity Still Ahead, BofA Says**
Bank of America analysts believe Nvidia's stock has room to grow, with a potential market capitalization of $4.7 trillion, surpassing Apple's current market value. This is due to the company's 'generational' AI opportunity, which has led to significant earnings growth. Nvidia's sales and net income were 350% and 2,400% higher in the quarter ending in July compared to the same period in 2022. Despite being expensive relative to its fundamentals, many remain bullish due to the 'emotional' and 'insane demand' for Nvidia's products, as described by CEO Jensen Huang. 'Generational' AI opportunity is still ahead, according to BofA.

**Nvidia Can Approach $5 Trillion Valuation With ‘Generational’ AI Opportunity Still Ahead, BofA Says**
Bank of America analysts, led by Vivek Arya, have raised their price target for Nvidia from $165 to $190, indicating a 37% upside from the current share price. They argue that a 'generational opportunity' is still ahead for Nvidia in AI accelerators, with the company capturing 80% of the market. The analysts project the total addressable market for AI technology to grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $363 billion by 2030, with Nvidia maintaining a 75% market share. This would translate to $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. The analysts also highlight Nvidia's significantly higher profit margins than its peers, with a free cash flow margin of 50% over the next two years. They also mention Nvidia's 'underappreciated' income streams outside of selling its custom GPUs, including partnerships with Accenture and Microsoft. According to the analysts, Nvidia's market capitalization could reach $4.7 trillion, surpassing Apple's current market value of $3.6 trillion.

**Nvidia's Stock Rises After ASML's Decline**
Nvidia's stock rose 3.13% after the decline of ASML, losing over $60 billion in market value. Nvidia has grown 174% in 2024, compared to the 22% growth of the Nasdaq. The decline of ASML, a semiconductor equipment manufacturer, affected the semiconductor market, causing Nvidia's stock to initially fall 4.7% on Tuesday. However, investors reassessed the implications of the decline, leading to a 3.13% increase in Nvidia's stock to $135.72 on Wednesday. Other semiconductor stocks also experienced a modest recovery, despite fears of decreased demand. Nvidia continues to lead the charge to become the company with the largest market capitalization, although Apple remains in the lead with a market value of $3.56 trillion, surpassing Nvidia by $330 billion.

**Nvidia is set to dominate another Big Tech earnings season**
Nvidia is expected to dominate the upcoming Big Tech earnings season, with its shares up 16% in the last month and on pace to surpass Apple as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said demand for the upcoming Blackwell chip is 'insane', leading to a 18% increase in shares. However, reports of a cap on AI chip shipments to certain countries put the rally on hold. Nvidia's revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion in fiscal Q3 2024, with data center revenue rising 279% to $14.5 billion. Despite this, growth is expected to slow, which could spook investors. The AI trade has also benefited other companies, such as Broadcom, which jumped 59% year to date, and Qualcomm, which climbed 19%. However, Nvidia remains the star of the show, with investors looking for signs of continued AI spending from hyperscalers and information about the Blackwell rollout and supply constraints.

**Apple Becomes the World's Most Valuable Company**
Apple has become the world's most valuable company, surpassing its previous record. The company's stock price rose by 2.7% on Tuesday, reaching a new high of $237.49 per share. This increase in value has pushed Apple's market capitalization to $3.61 trillion, making it the most valuable company in history. The reason for the increase in Apple's stock value is not immediately clear, as other tech companies such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Amazon saw a decline in their stock value, while Alphabet saw only a 0.1% increase. However, experts believe that the positive expectations for the performance of the iPhone 16 and the recent release of the updated iPad mini may have contributed to the increase. Apple has a busy schedule ahead, with the release of Apple Intelligence on October 28 and the announcement of its third-quarter financial results on October 31. Experts predict that Apple's third-quarter revenue will be $94 billion and its net income will be $24 billion.

**Nvidia shares hit record high, challenges Apple as world's most valuable company**
Nvidia's share price has reached an all-time high of $138.07, a 829% increase over the last year and a half, making it the second most valuable company by market capitalization with $3.39 trillion. The company is poised to unseat Apple as the world's most valuable company if the current trend continues. Nvidia's dominance in the AI market, particularly with its upcoming Blackwell GPUs, has led to overwhelming demand and a 12-month backlog.

Despite recent warnings of an AI bubble burst and a $279 billion market cap drop, Nvidia has recovered and is expected to continue its upward trend.

**NVIDIA Surpasses Microsoft in Market Capitalization, Becomes Second Most Valuable Company in the World**
NVIDIA has surpassed Microsoft in market capitalization, becoming the second most valuable public company in the world.

NVIDIA's market capitalization first exceeded $3 trillion on June 5, 2024, and it surpassed Apple to become the second most valuable company in the world.

According to Morgan Stanley, all available stocks of GPU Blackwell have been sold out, and TSMC factories will be fully loaded with work for the next year. Major consumers of the chip include AWS, CoreWeave, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle.

**Nvidia's Stock Price Reaches Record High Amid AI Boom**
Nvidia's stock price reached a record high of $138.07, with a market capitalization of approximately $3.4 trillion. Investors are awaiting reports from major tech companies that are mass-purchasing AI chips from Nvidia, according to CNBC. The company previously stated that there is a 'crazy' demand for its new-generation Blackwell chips. Nvidia's stock price has increased by nearly 180% since the start of 2024 and nine times since the start of 2023, CNBC reports. Nvidia's market capitalization has surpassed Microsoft's, but it still lags behind Apple's $3.5 trillion market value. Nvidia has become the largest beneficiary of the AI boom, which began after the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022, CNBC notes. Large tech companies, including Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, are purchasing Nvidia's chips in large quantities for their AI-related projects, and are expected to release their quarterly results by the end of October. According to Mizuho, Nvidia controls around 95% of the market for AI training and output chips, and a significant portion of the multibillion-dollar spending by tech companies on AI system development. Nvidia's stock price increased in October after CEO Jensen Huang announced that the new-generation Blackwell chip is fully launched and that there is a 'crazy' demand for it. In August, Nvidia reported issues with production due to the chips being more complex to produce than initially thought. 'We have a crazy demand for our new-generation Blackwell chip,' Jensen Huang said, according to CNBC.

This positive sentiment has also been reflected in Asian markets, where the Nikkei index in Tokyo has surpassed 40,000 points, setting positive prospects for European stock markets. Today, several key earnings reports are expected, including Bank of America's expected decline in third-quarter profit, Goldman Sachs' expected increase in advisory and underwriting fees, and Citigroup and Charles Schwab Corporation's financial data releases. Investors are also focusing on the European Central Bank's (ECB) inquiry into bank loans in the eurozone, which will provide information ahead of the ECB's policy review on Thursday. The ECB is expected to implement a new quarter-point rate cut, a decision that had previously caused hesitation among policymakers and was considered unlikely by traders at the last ECB meeting a month ago.

**This company could soon beat Apple to become world's most valuable firm, its market value is Rs...**
Nvidia is on the verge of becoming the world's most valuable company, with its market capitalization reaching USD 3.39 trillion, just below Apple's USD 3.52 trillion. The rise in Nvidia's stock price is due to growing investor optimism about its AI processors, which are in high demand as large tech companies like Microsoft and Alphabet increase their efforts in AI. TD Cowen analysts believe that the competitive environment is a 'prisoner's dilemma', where firms must spend heavily on AI technologies. Despite concerns about the production ramp of Nvidia's new Blackwell chips, the company is confident that its existing products remain popular, driving strong demand for AI-related technologies. Experts estimate that Nvidia's sales will grow to USD 130.6 billion by FY 2025, with a projected compound annual growth rate of 42% in the next ten years.

**Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now**
According to an analyst, Apple's market cap may be surpassed by Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet in the next five years due to Apple's stagnant sales growth. Apple's stock fetches a premium valuation of 30.5 times forward earnings, but the company hasn't grown its sales since 2022. Nvidia is only 5% away from surpassing Apple, with a 42% revenue growth expected for fiscal year 2026. Microsoft is 11% away from the top spot, with a 15% revenue growth over the past year. Alphabet's chances are slightly lower, but it has a 42% upside if it fetches the same premium as Apple. The analyst team at The Motley Fool has a strong track record of outperforming the market, with a total average return of 797%.

**Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now | The Motley Fool**
Apple's stock is trading at a premium price tag despite not growing its sales since 2022. The company's valuation is 30.5 times forward earnings, making it susceptible to other stocks surpassing it. Three companies that could potentially pass Apple in market cap five years from now are Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Nvidia is nipping at Apple's heels, with a 5% difference in market cap, and is expected to have 42% revenue growth in fiscal year 2026. Microsoft is next in line, with a 11% difference in market cap, and has been growing revenue by more than 15% over the past year. Alphabet's chances are slightly lower, but it has 42% upside if it were to fetch the same premium as Apple, which would give it a $2.88 trillion market cap, only 19% away from Apple.

**Nvidia Leapfrogs Microsoft Following Meteoric Rally: Can It Reach All-Time High?**
Nvidia's share price has surged nearly 10% in the past week, pushing its market capitalization to $3.235 trillion, surpassing Microsoft's for the second time this year. The chipmaker's recent rally has been fueled by positive news, including Microsoft's integration of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell system into its AI data centers and TSMC's revenues exceeding forecasts. If Nvidia's stock price rises by another 3.2%, it will reach a new all-time high. However, to reclaim the top spot from Apple, it would need to climb to nearly 6% to $138.2 per share.

**Nvidia's stock surge sent its market cap past Microsoft's and close to a record high**
Nvidia's stock surge has pushed its market capitalization past Microsoft's, reaching $3.26 trillion during Wednesday morning trading. This comes after the AI chipmaker's stock rose almost 1% at the open, to about $134 per share. Nvidia's shares have experienced some turbulence since June, when they briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and reached a record high of $135.58. Despite falling back down, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world, with its stock up 173.4% so far this year and 192% compared to a year ago.

**Nvidia Poised To Overtake Apple As World's Most Valuable Company: How Much Jensen Huang's Company Needs To Gain By Wednesday - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)**
Nvidia has emerged as the second-best performing S&P 500 stock this year, with a nearly two-year run of growth despite market swings. The company's market capitalization is $3.260 trillion, just $169 billion behind Apple's $3.429 trillion. To overtake Apple, Nvidia needs to add $6.8 to its per-share market price, which is not a difficult task given its recent performance. Nvidia's stock has added $5.17 in a single day, and with Federal Reserve officials' speeches and rate-setting meeting minutes potentially influencing sentiment, the possibility of Nvidia becoming the most valuable company by Wednesday cannot be ruled out.

**Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025? | The Motley Fool**
Nvidia is rapidly closing the gap with Apple in terms of market valuation, with a $3.13 trillion valuation compared to Apple's $3.37 trillion. While Apple's revenue is significantly higher at $385 billion compared to Nvidia's $96 billion, Nvidia's growth pace and stronger profit margin make it a strong contender to overtake Apple. Analysts predict Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's 8% growth. If Nvidia maintains its current profit margin, it could quickly catch Apple's profit levels. Additionally, Nvidia's strong brand and growth prospects make it likely to fetch a higher premium than Apple, which could propel it to overtake Apple as the world's largest company by 2025.

**Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?**
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is rapidly closing the gap with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in terms of valuation, with a market cap of $3.13 trillion compared to Apple's $3.37 trillion. While Apple's revenue is significantly higher at $385 billion, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue, with a 122% year-over-year increase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Nvidia's growth potential is driven by its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution, and its upcoming Blackwell architecture, which is expected to unlock massive speed gains. Analysts believe Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projections of 8% growth. However, Nvidia still generates about half the profits of Apple, but with its growth pace and stronger profit margin, it could quickly catch Apple's profit levels. By the end of the next fiscal year, Nvidia could be right there with Apple in terms of profits. Next comes valuation, where Nvidia's strong growth and brand could fetch a higher premium than Apple, potentially propelling it to overtake Apple as the world's largest company.

**1 Stock That Will Be Worth More Than Apple in 10 Years**
Apple's growth has slowed down, with a 5% year-over-year revenue increase in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Analysts expect Apple's revenue to grow 9% to $390 billion by the end of the year, but only 8% in the next fiscal year. This is due to the company's massive revenue base and stagnant growth in the smartphone market. On the other hand, Nvidia is expected to grow much faster, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 52% over the next five years. Nvidia's presence in lucrative and fast-growing end markets, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud gaming, could allow it to overtake Apple's market cap in the coming decade. Analysts predict that the AI chip market will generate $300 billion in revenue by 2034, with Nvidia holding 70-95% of the market. Additionally, Nvidia is diversifying into enterprise AI software and cloud gaming, which could unlock more growth opportunities for the company.

**1 Analyst Says This AI Stock Will Overshadow Nvidia**
Citi analyst Atif Malik predicts that Apple will surpass Nvidia as the top AI stock by 2025. Malik believes that while Nvidia dominated the early stages of the AI era, Apple's new AI-powered iPhones, particularly the iPhone 17, will drive a significant upgrade cycle for the company. Apple is expected to sell 85 million iPhone 16 units in 2024 and 92 million iPhone 17 units in 2025, with total iPhone sales reaching 241 million in 2025. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives also raised Apple's target price to $300, citing expectations that the iPhone 16 launch will increase Apple's market capitalization to $4 trillion by 2025. Analysts predict that Apple's revenue will rise by 1.8% in 2024 to $390.5 billion and 7.6% in 2025, with earnings increasing by 9.1% in 2024 and 10.8% in 2025. Apple's stock is currently a'moderate buy' on Wall Street, with 18 analysts recommending a'strong buy' and four suggesting a'moderate buy'.

**Nvidia's Market Capitalization Surges, but Company's Recent Report Disappoints Investors**
Nvidia's market capitalization has increased by almost $424 billion over the past four trading sessions, making up for some of the losses after the market downturn on August 5. According to Bloomberg, the company's market capitalization has reached a record high of $3.3 trillion on June 18, 2024, surpassing Google, Apple, and Microsoft. The company's stock has risen more than twice this year, closing at $120 per share. Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, stated that the Data Center segment has seen a record increase of 154% compared to last year, driven by demand for the company's Hopper GPU for large language model training and AI applications. CEO Jensen Huang also commented that there will be a significant increase in Blackwell shipments once production picks up. However, the company's recent quarterly report and forecast for the next quarter have disappointed investors, leading to a decline in market value of $200 billion. The market is cautious about the company's prospects, with some analysts predicting a potential bubble in the infrastructure created by companies like Meta and Nvidia.

**NVIDIA Results, Responses and Realities**
Nvidia's market capitalization of $3 trillion is based on high expectations for future growth, rather than current results. The company's revenue and profit have grown rapidly, but it still lags behind established competitors like Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia's gross margin of 75% is higher than its peers, and its revenue grew 195% year-on-year in the past 12 months. However, the company's stock price fell 7% after its last earnings release, leaving CEO Jensen Huang perplexed. Huang believes that the company's future prospects are strong enough to justify the current valuation, but there is a risk that other competitor chip makers could create a winner that outstrips Nvidia's current advantages. For now, Nvidia remains the market leader with a massive cash pile and brand position to trade on.

**Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?**
Nvidia's business has surged since the start of last year, fueled by a boom in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's years of expertise in graphics processing units (GPUs) gave it a head start over rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Intel in AI. As a result, Nvidia's chip sales have skyrocketed, with a 524% jump in data center revenue since Jan. 1, 2023. Nvidia's stock has also risen, climbing 763% since the beginning of last year, which has seen its market cap rise from $360 billion to over $3 trillion. The chipmaker has consistently outperformed Apple in growth over the last decade, with its stock up more than 26,000% compared to Apple's 790% growth. Nvidia looks likely to steal Apple's crown as the world's most valuable company, and it could do it as soon as 2030. The company's growth is driven by its dominance in AI chips, with an estimated 90% of all AI GPUs accounted for by Nvidia. As the AI market expands quickly, Nvidia is positioned to keep seeing gains from the industry for years and could easily surpass Apple's market cap by the end of the decade.

Nvidia has reported a significant increase in revenue, reaching $30 billion in the second quarter, exceeding analyst expectations. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, has announced a buyback of $50 billion. The results have been seen as a positive indicator for the development of artificial intelligence.

The company's market capitalization has reached $2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world after Microsoft and Apple. As noted by Andrew Ye, Investment Strategist at Global X, 'After the great sell-off at the beginning of the month led by the technology sector, Nvidia has recovered and is now again near its historical highs.'
