To forecast whether the maximum weekly rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States between June 1 and August 31, 2024, will exceed 3.5 per 100,000 people, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical trends, current data, and expert insights.

### Step 1: Reference Historical Trends and Base Rates
- **Historical Context**: During the summer of 2023, COVID-19 hospitalization rates peaked at around 2.0 per 100,000 people, significantly lower than the winter peak of 7.7 per 100,000 in December 2023. This suggests a seasonal pattern with lower summer peaks.
- **Base Rate**: Given the historical data, the likelihood of exceeding 3.5 per 100,000 in the summer is relatively low, as summer peaks have consistently been below this threshold.

### Step 2: Analyze Current Data and Trends
- **Current Hospitalization Rates**: As of late June 2024, hospitalization rates were around 2.0 per 100,000, with a slight increase but still far below the 3.5 threshold.
- **Wastewater Data**: Wastewater analysis indicates increasing viral loads in some regions, suggesting a potential rise in cases. However, hospitalizations remain low, indicating that the virus is causing milder infections.
- **Vaccination Rates**: Vaccination rates are relatively low, with fewer than one-quarter of U.S. adults having received the latest COVID-19 shot. This could increase susceptibility to infection but may not necessarily lead to higher hospitalization rates due to residual immunity from previous infections and vaccinations.

### Step 3: Consider Expert Opinions and News Articles
- **Expert Consensus**: Experts like Dr. William Schaffner and Dr. Stanley Plotkin suggest that the virus is weakening over time, and the population has high residual immunity. They predict that COVID-19 will resemble common cold viruses, causing outbreaks but not severe disease.
- **News Articles**: Multiple articles highlight that while cases are increasing, hospitalizations remain low, and the current wave is not as severe as previous ones. The dominant subvariants are described as "very contagious but not more severe."

### Step 4: Balance the Evidence
- **Positive Factors**: Increasing cases, low vaccination rates, and the presence of new subvariants could push hospitalization rates higher.
- **Negative Factors**: High residual immunity, milder virus strains, and low current hospitalization rates suggest that the 3.5 threshold is unlikely to be exceeded.

### Step 5: Make the Forecast
Given the historical trends, current data, and expert opinions, the likelihood of the maximum weekly hospitalization rate exceeding 3.5 per 100,000 between June 1 and August 31, 2024, is low. However, there is some uncertainty due to the potential for new variants and waning immunity.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
- **Historical Context:** The winter peak in December 2023 saw a hospitalization rate of 7.7 per 100,000 people, while the summer of 2023 had rates around 2 per 100,000. The current rate as of late June 2024 is approximately 2 per 100,000, with a slight upward trend.
- **Seasonal Patterns:** COVID-19 typically shows a summer bump followed by a decline and a larger winter surge. The current summer wave is consistent with this pattern, but the magnitude is lower than previous peaks.

### Step 2: Current Trends and Data
- **Hospitalization Rates:** As of late June 2024, the hospitalization rate is around 2 per 100,000, with a gradual increase. The CDC reports that hospitalizations are rising but remain far below the winter peak.
- **Wastewater Data:** Wastewater levels indicate increasing transmission in some regions, but hospitalizations remain low, suggesting that population immunity is mitigating severe outcomes.
- **Variant Impact:** The dominant subvariants (e.g., KP.3) are highly contagious but not more severe, which aligns with expert opinions that COVID-19 is becoming milder over time.

### Step 3: Expert Opinions and Projections
- **Expert Consensus:** Experts like Dr. William Schaffner and Dr. Stanley Plotkin suggest that COVID-19 is evolving into a milder disease, similar to the common cold. They predict that while cases will rise, severe outcomes will remain limited due to high population immunity from prior infections and vaccinations.
- **Vaccination Rates:** Vaccination rates are low, with fewer than one-quarter of U.S. adults receiving the latest shot. This could lead to higher transmission but not necessarily higher hospitalization rates, given the milder nature of current variants.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **Upward Trend:** Hospitalization rates are increasing, but the rate of increase is slow. Extrapolating linearly, the rate would need to more than double from the current 2 per 100,000 to exceed 3.5 per 100,000.
- **Mitigating Factors:** High population immunity and the milder nature of current variants suggest that severe outcomes will remain limited, even as cases rise.

### Step 5: Final Assessment
- **Likelihood of Exceeding 3.5 per 100,000:** Given the current rate of increase and the mitigating factors, it is unlikely that the hospitalization rate will exceed 3.5 per 100,000 during the specified period. However, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if a new, more severe variant emerges or if vaccination rates remain low.

- **Hospitalization Rates:** As of late June 2024, the hospitalization rate is around 2 per 100,000, with a gradual increase. The CDC reports that hospitalizations are rising but remain far below the winter peak.
- **Wastewater Data:** Wastewater levels indicate increasing transmission in some regions, but hospitalizations remain low, suggesting that population immunity is mitigating severe outcomes.
- **Variant Impact:** The dominant subvariants (e.g., KP.3) are highly contagious but not more severe, which aligns with expert opinions that COVID-19 is becoming milder over time.

### Step 3: Expert Opinions and Projections
- **Expert Consensus:** Experts like Dr. William Schaffner and Dr. Stanley Plotkin suggest that COVID-19 is evolving into a milder disease, similar to the common cold. They predict that while cases will rise, severe outcomes will remain limited due to high population immunity from prior infections and vaccinations.
- **Vaccination Rates:** Vaccination rates are low, with fewer than one-quarter of U.S. adults receiving the latest shot. This could lead to higher transmission but not necessarily higher hospitalization rates, given the milder nature of current variants.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **Upward Trend:** Hospitalization rates are increasing, but the rate of increase is slow. Extrapolating linearly, the rate would need to more than double from the current 2 per 100,000 to exceed 3.5 per 100,000.
- **Mitigating Factors:** High population immunity and the milder nature of current variants suggest that severe outcomes will remain limited, even as cases rise.

### Step 5: Final Assessment
- **Likelihood of Exceeding 3.5 per 100,000:** Given the current rate of increase and the mitigating factors, it is unlikely that the hospitalization rate will exceed 3.5 per 100,000 during the specified period. However, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if a new, more severe variant emerges or if vaccination rates remain low.

### Prediction
My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.
