*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers in hand.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the CDC's latest update was quite the revelation. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models had predicted a "no" with a probability of 35.78%. It seems our confidence was well-placed.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. With no reported human-to-human transmission of H5N1, the global health community can breathe a sigh of relief, for now.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. The Texas case back in April had some worried, but the lack of further spread aligns with our forecasts.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a reminder of the unpredictability in these scenarios, despite our models' accuracy.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Agreed. We watch, we learn, and we adjust. Until the next forecast.

*They nod, understanding the gravity of their work.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the CDC hasn't reported any human-to-human transmission of H5N1 before September 30, 2024.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right, and our models had it at 23.45%. Given the data up to July 10, it seemed unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** The Texas case in April raised some eyebrows but didn't lead to further human spread.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The sporadic cases in humans have been concerning, but the lack of transmission is consistent with our predictions.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a relief, but we should remain vigilant. The probabilities can shift with new data.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Agreed. For now, though, it's a "no" for human-to-human transmission, as our models suggested.

*Both nod, acknowledging the weight of their accurate forecast.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the CDC hasn't reported any human-to-human transmission of H5N1. Our models were spot on.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. No, our models had it at 12.34%. The data up to July 10th suggested a low probability, and the situation didn't escalate.

**NATE SILVER**  
The Texas case was a close call, but it remained isolated. The CDC's updates showed no further spread.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
This highlights the importance of monitoring zoonotic diseases, even when probabilities seem low.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. It's a reminder that vigilance and accurate forecasting are crucial in public health.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models were spot-on. No, our models had it at 15.75%. The probability of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 just wasn't there.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, despite the scare in Texas back in April, the CDC never reported a human-to-human case. It was all about managing the poultry and wildlife exposure.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The CDC's vigilance paid off. It's a relief, but it also shows the importance of continuous monitoring.
