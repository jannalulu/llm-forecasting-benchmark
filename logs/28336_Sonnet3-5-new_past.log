Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Key Facts:
- The election is scheduled for September 21, 2024 (in 2 days)
- Tom Iseghohi was the Action Alliance (AA) candidate
- According to multiple news sources from September 16, 2024, Iseghohi has withdrawn from the race and endorsed APC's Monday Okpebholo
- This withdrawal appears to be confirmed by multiple credible sources

2. Main Contenders:
- The three main contenders are now:
  * Asue Ighodalo (PDP)
  * Monday Okpebholo (APC)
  * Olumide Akpata (LP)

3. Critical Evidence:
- Tom Iseghohi has officially withdrawn from the race
- He has endorsed another candidate (Okpebholo of APC)
- There are no reports of him reversing this decision
- The election is in 2 days, making any change in candidacy extremely unlikely

4. Analysis:
- Given that Iseghohi has withdrawn from the race and endorsed another candidate
- The election is too close for any legal challenges to reverse this withdrawal
- There is no mechanism for him to win as he is no longer a candidate
- Even if his name remains on some ballots due to printing timing, votes for him would likely be considered invalid

5. Risk Assessment:
- The only theoretical possibility would be if his withdrawal was somehow invalidated through legal means
- However, given the timeframe (2 days to election) and multiple confirmations of his withdrawal, this is extremely unlikely

Given that Tom Iseghohi has officially withdrawn from the race and endorsed another candidate, with multiple news sources confirming this fact, and the election is in just two days:

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- In Nigerian state elections, ruling party candidates (PDP in this case) tend to have an advantage
- Opposition parties face significant hurdles in winning state elections

2. Key Evidence Against Tom Iseghohi winning:
- Most critical: News reports confirm he has withdrawn from the race and endorsed APC's Monday Okpebholo
- Multiple sources (The Guardian, The Nation) confirm his withdrawal as AA candidate
- He is no longer actively campaigning
- Main contest appears to be between PDP's Ighodalo, APC's Okpebholo, and LP's Akpata
- His former party (AA) has collapsed its structure into APC

3. Key Evidence For Tom Iseghohi winning:
- None found in recent news coverage
- His name may still technically appear on ballot papers if withdrawal was after printing
- But this would not translate to victory given his public withdrawal

4. Analysis of Current Situation:
- The election is in 2 days (Sept 21, 2024)
- Iseghohi has officially withdrawn and endorsed another candidate
- Three main candidates (none being Iseghohi) are actively campaigning
- No credible polls or predictions show any path to victory for Iseghohi

5. Risk Factors:
- Electoral violence concerns raised
- Accusations of potential rigging between main parties
- But none of these factors would benefit a withdrawn candidate

Given that Tom Iseghohi has officially withdrawn from the race and endorsed another candidate, there is virtually no path to victory. The only uncertainty is whether there might be some extremely unlikely black swan event that could change this.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Key Base Rate Information:
- Tom Iseghohi was running as the Action Alliance (AA) candidate
- According to multiple sources including The Nation and The Guardian, he has already stepped down and endorsed the APC candidate Monday Okpebholo
- This withdrawal was confirmed in multiple recent news articles from September 16, 2024

2. Current Situation:
- The election is in 2 days (September 21, 2024)
- The main contenders are now:
  * Asue Ighodalo (PDP)
  * Monday Okpebholo (APC)
  * Olumide Akpata (LP)
- Iseghohi has officially withdrawn and endorsed another candidate

3. Critical Factors:
- Iseghohi has formally withdrawn from the race
- He is actively supporting another candidate (Okpebholo)
- Multiple credible news sources confirm his withdrawal
- The election is imminent and there's no indication he will reverse his withdrawal

4. Risk Analysis:
- Given his formal withdrawal and endorsement of another candidate, there is essentially no path to victory
- Even if his name remains on the ballot due to timing, he is actively telling his supporters to vote for someone else

5. Key Uncertainties:
- Whether his name will still appear on physical ballots
- But this is irrelevant as he has withdrawn and endorsed another candidate

Given that Tom Iseghohi has officially withdrawn from the race and endorsed another candidate, with multiple credible sources confirming this just days before the election, there is virtually no possibility of him winning.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- Nigeria's gubernatorial elections typically favor major parties (APC and PDP)
- Incumbent party (PDP) has advantage historically
- Third party/smaller party candidates rarely win gubernatorial elections

2. Key Evidence Against Iseghohi Winning:
- Multiple sources confirm Tom Iseghohi has withdrawn from the race and endorsed APC candidate Monday Okpebholo
- The most recent news from September 16 confirms his withdrawal
- Main contenders are now Asue Ighodalo (PDP), Monday Okpebholo (APC), and Olumide Akpata (LP)
- His party (Action Alliance) is a minor party with limited resources/structure

3. Context:
- The election is just 2 days away (September 21, 2024)
- Major campaigning has focused on PDP, APC and LP candidates
- No polls or reports suggest any possibility of Iseghohi winning
- He has officially endorsed another candidate

4. Distinctive Features:
- His withdrawal and endorsement of another candidate makes it virtually impossible for him to win
- Even if his name remains on ballot, he has publicly stepped down
- The election commission would likely not declare someone who has withdrawn as winner

5. Balance of Evidence:
- Given his withdrawal from the race and endorsement of another candidate
- The dominance of major parties in Nigerian gubernatorial elections
- The lack of any evidence suggesting potential victory
- The proximity to election day with his withdrawal already confirmed

The probability of him winning is effectively zero, with only the smallest possible chance of some extremely unlikely scenario (like all other candidates being disqualified) preventing it from being exactly zero.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Facts:
1. Prince Tom Iseghohi was the Action Alliance (AA) candidate
2. Multiple recent news sources confirm he has withdrawn from the race
3. He has endorsed Senator Monday Okpebholo of the APC
4. This withdrawal is officially reported by credible Nigerian media outlets

Key Arguments for Lower Probability:
1. He has explicitly withdrawn from the race and endorsed another candidate
2. His withdrawal has been widely reported across multiple credible news sources
3. He publicly stated the APC would win regardless of his support
4. He is no longer actively campaigning

Key Arguments for Higher Probability:
1. His name might still appear on ballot papers if printed before withdrawal
2. Theoretical possibility of last-minute reversal of withdrawal
3. Remote possibility of legal challenge to withdrawal

Analysis:
- The fact that he has officially withdrawn from the race and endorsed another candidate makes it virtually impossible for him to win
- His public statements supporting another candidate further diminish any chance
- Even if his name remains on the ballot, his public withdrawal means voters would know their vote for him would be wasted
- The main contenders are clearly identified as Asue Ighodalo (PDP), Monday Okpebholo (APC), and Olumide Akpata (LP)
- There is no realistic path to victory for a withdrawn candidate
