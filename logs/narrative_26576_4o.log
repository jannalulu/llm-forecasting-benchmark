Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit at a corner table, sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leans in)  
So, the CDC reported 11 cases by October 1. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
Right on the mark. The sudden spike between April and July was crucial. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gestures)  
Those dairy and poultry exposures were key. Our models never missed a beat.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
And yet, the public health risk remains low. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(raises cup)  
To accurate predictions and vigilant monitoring.

They all clink their cups, satisfied with their precise forecasting.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit at a table, laptops open, discussing the recent CDC report.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the CDC reported 11 cases. Our models had it at 12.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. Given the surge from April to July, we anticipated no drastic changes post-July.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yeah, the dairy and poultry outbreaks were contained, and no new exposure pathways emerged.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how the models predicted this. The public health measures were effective.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. Our models indicated a 0.1% chance of exceeding 100 cases, which aligns with reality.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The collaboration between CDC and state departments was crucial. The situation could've been worse.

They sip their coffees, satisfied with their accurate predictions, as the world outside continues, unaware of the precise science behind their safety.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confident)  
Well, the CDC numbers are in. Eleven cases total. Our models had it at 12.50%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
We factored in the uptick from April to July. Those dairy and poultry exposures were significant.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
It was close, but our models never wavered. The probability of reaching 21 cases was always below 0.5%.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

SUPERFORECASTER 1
