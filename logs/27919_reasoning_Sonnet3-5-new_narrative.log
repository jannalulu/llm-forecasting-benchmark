Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about González."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the political climate in Venezuela and Maduro's history of suppressing opposition, our models had it at 82.45%. The arrest warrant, his age, and the U.S. sanctions all pointed to a high probability."

Nate: "The interesting factor was his age - 75. Venezuelan law technically prohibits jail time for those over 70, but house arrest still counts as deprivation of liberty."

Philip: "And with Maduro's response to the U.S. seizing his aircraft, retaliation was almost certain. The data from September 4th showed all the warning signs."

Nate: "Another accurate forecast. Though I must say, the way they found him in that safehouse in Caracas was unexpected."

Philip: "The models don't predict the 'how,' just the 'if.' And once again, they were right."

NATE: (shuffling papers) Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about González.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given what we knew by September 4th, with the arrest warrant and Maduro's increasing authoritarianism, our models had it at 37.8%.

NATE: The key factors were fascinating. The age protection law for those over 70, combined with U.S. pressure and potential sanctions, significantly reduced the likelihood of enforcement.

PHILIP: (nodding) Plus, González's ability to effectively hide and his family connections in Madrid provided substantial protection. The confiscation of Maduro's aircraft also suggested Venezuela would be hesitant to escalate further.

NATE: Another successful prediction. Though the probability wasn't negligible, it was still low enough to suggest what actually happened - González remained free through October 1st.

[They both turn to look at a news screen showing González still in hiding]

Nate: "Well, Philip, despite Maduro's aggressive moves and that arrest warrant, González managed to stay hidden."

Philip: [examining data on a holographic display] "Our models had it at 32.45%. The key factors were fascinating - González's age and Venezuelan law regarding septuagenarians made actual imprisonment unlikely. Plus, the U.S. sanctions threat created significant deterrence."

Nate: "The confiscation of Maduro's aircraft was a turning point. It showed the U.S. wasn't bluffing about consequences."

Philip: "Indeed. While the arrest warrant created pressure, González's support network and international attention made successful capture improbable. The models factored in Maduro's history of political persecution but also his increasing sensitivity to Western sanctions."

Nate: "Another validation of probabilistic thinking. Even with an arrest warrant, execution was far from certain."

[They both nod, satisfied with their model's accuracy]
