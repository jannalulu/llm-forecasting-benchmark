NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a table, sipping coffee. A newspaper headline reads: "COVID-19 Hospitalizations Surge."

**NATE**  
Well, Philip, the KP.2 variant did stir things up this summer.

**PHILIP**  
Indeed. The question was whether hospitalizations would exceed 3.5 per 100,000. Our models had it at 67.85%.

**NATE**  
So, a "yes" then. The FLiRT variants were a wildcard, especially with that summer surge warning.

**PHILIP**  
Exactly. RESP-NET data confirmed it. It's fascinating how accurately the models predicted this.

**NATE**  
The CDC's vigilance with RESP-NET was crucial. Monitoring those trends gave us the edge.

**PHILIP**  
True. It's a reminder that even with new variants, data-driven forecasting remains vital.

**NATE**  
Here's to the models—never wrong, always insightful.

They clink their coffee cups, a testament to the power of prediction.

**NATE SILVER:**

(leans forward, adjusting his glasses) Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind was whether the maximum weekly rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations would exceed 3.5 per 100,000 between June and August 2024.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:**

(nods) Yes, and given the rise of the KP.2 variant, our models were quite precise. Despite the concerns, they indicated a 42.75% probability of exceeding that threshold.

**NATE SILVER:**

(smiles) So, it's a no. As always, the models proved accurate. The summer surge warnings were valid, but the numbers didn't surpass expectations.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:**

(leans back) Exactly. The RESP-NET data confirmed it. We continue to navigate this unpredictable landscape with measured confidence.

*The camera pans out as they continue discussing the implications.*
