**Air Passenger Demand Rises 7.1% in September, Iata Reports**
The global air passenger demand, measured by revenue passenger-kilometers (RPK), increased by 7.1% in September 2023, a historical record for the month, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata). The total capacity, measured in available seat-kilometers (ASK), advanced 5.8% in the same comparison and the load factor in flights in September was 83.6%, 1 percentage point above that observed in September 2023. The international demand rose 9.2% compared to September 2023, with capacity increasing 9.1% and the load factor being 83.8%, almost unchanged. Domestic demand rose 3.7% compared to September 2023. Capacity increased 0.7% compared to the previous year and the load factor was 83.3% (+2.4 p.p. compared to September 2023). According to Willie Walsh, Iata's director general, the high travel season ended with demand growth. 'This is good news not only for passengers, but also for the global economy. Each flight creates more jobs and trade,' he commented. However, he noted that the story of air travel success is bringing challenges. 'Soon, we will face a capacity crisis in some regions that threatens to reduce these economic and social benefits. Governments will face a choice: lose to more dynamic nations that value global connectivity or forge a consensus for sustainable growth,' he explained. He highlighted that airlines are making significant investments to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But he warned that this needs to be accompanied by an equally active political vision, supported by actions, to ensure efficient and sufficient air traffic management and airport capacity to meet the needs of citizens and business travelers. Cargo Demand The total air cargo demand, measured in tonne-kilometres of cargo (CTKs), increased 9.4% compared to September 2023 levels, the 14th consecutive month of growth. 'Cargo volumes continued to reach historical demand records. Revenues are also improving, with a 11.7% increase compared to 2023 and 50% above 2019 levels. All this points to a strong finish for this year,' Walsh said. According to him, the sector will closely follow the outcome of the US election to see how US commercial policy will evolve.

**TSA and AAA’s Tips on How to Handle Thanksgiving Travel**
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and AAA have provided tips on how to handle Thanksgiving travel. With an estimated 29.9 million people traveling between November 17 and 27, 2023, and 55.4 million Americans traveling 50 miles or more, the busiest travel days will be the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after. AAA reports that the average price for a domestic flight in November and December was $681, up 5 percent from 2022, while the average price for a domestic rental car was $590, down 20 percent from 2022. To avoid crowds, consider taking the train or visiting warm weather destinations. To get through TSA with less stress, consider the following tips: bring snacks in your carry-on, pack liquids and gels in a quart-size plastic bag, wear a minimalist outfit, and check the bins before rushing off. Additionally, consider enrolling in TSA PreCheck or Clear for expedited screening.

**Demand for Air Travel Expected to Break All Records in 2024: IBA**
According to a recent report by IBA, a leading market intelligence and aviation consulting company, global air travel demand is expected to exceed 9 trillion passenger kilometers (RPKs) for the first time in 2024, representing a 4.2% increase from the previous record of 8.6 trillion RPKs set in 2019. This growth is driven by a constant increase in GDP in various regions, combined with a reduction in unit costs and improved fuel efficiency, resulting in increasing profitability for airlines worldwide. However, IBA noted that the global political and economic scenario, along with supply chain challenges and labor strikes, will affect aircraft deliveries, reducing them compared to 2023. The recovery of delivery levels to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 is not expected before 2026. The issue related to GTF engines has impacted aircraft availability, and the percentage of narrowbodies out of contract has fallen to levels not seen since before the pandemic. Many operators are extending their aircraft leases, resulting in fewer transitions and retirements. Currently, airlines like IndiGo and Viva Aerobus are facing high rates of GTF engine failures, leading to extremely low retirement rates, with less than 200 retirements expected in 2024. Despite the decline in transaction volumes between 2021 and 2023, IBA predicts a stabilization in 2024. New narrowbodies from Airbus, such as the A321neo, have stood out in leasing negotiations, showing a growth in value of up to 8.4% per year, although engine values have grown at even higher rates, reaching 49.2%. Narrowbody leases have increased by up to 25% since last year. Meanwhile, older aircraft have maintained their values, with some types, such as the Airbus A319 and the Boeing 737 NG, showing growth of 40% to 60% over the past 12 months. There has also been a significant increase in leases for these types of aircraft. IBA predicts a 9.2% increase in global airline capacity from 2023 to 2024. The largest expansion in capacity in seats in the third quarter of 2024 was observed in the Asia-Pacific region, with a growth of 12%, while North America shows a more modest increase of only 3%. However, operational performance in Q2 decreased in Europe and North America, with EBIT margins falling between 3% and 6%. IBA also identified a slight improvement in the average risk classification in the global market, although specific segments, such as cargo and ACMI operators, have seen a significant decline. Despite the absolute increase in emissions returning to pre-pandemic levels, carbon intensity has stabilized, indicating an improvement in fuel efficiency. This shows that, although demand and activity are growing, there is also a movement towards more sustainable practices in the aviation sector. Although IBA predicts a general decline in yields in various global regions in 2024, the most substantial growth was identified in full-service airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by suppressed international demand. On the other hand, the situation in the low-cost segment in North America represents a high risk, with potential bankruptcies due to sustained inflation and overcapacity.

**The busiest travel days around Thanksgiving**
According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Sunday after Thanksgiving is the busiest airport day of the year, with over 2.9 million people screened in 2023. In contrast, Thanksgiving Day is the least crowded day to fly, with just 1.5 million people screened. To avoid chaos and save money, consider flying on the following days: Saturday before Thanksgiving (least crowded), Monday before Thanksgiving, Thursday before Thanksgiving, Wednesday after Thanksgiving (least crowded), Tuesday after, or Black Friday. NerdWallet recommends booking the first flight out on Thanksgiving Day and staying longer to avoid taking extra time off. 'It makes them some of the best days to fly around Thanksgiving,' said the article.

**4 Reasons Why Airline Stocks Could Soar by Year-End**
According to a new report by Bank of America, airline stocks could see a significant increase by the end of the year. Despite the challenges faced by the aviation industry in recent years, including pandemic-related restrictions, extreme weather events, and rising fuel costs, the conditions are now improving. Decreasing fuel prices and regained pricing power are indicators that it may be an ideal time to reevaluate the sector. The Bank of America highlights four key factors that could lead to outperformance in the aviation industry in the coming months. These developments are particularly relevant for those who may have prematurely written off the sector. Firstly, TSA data shows that demand for air travel remains stable at a high level despite reduced airline capacity. This is crucial as it signals that passengers continue to fly in large numbers despite reduced available seating capacity, leading to improved pricing power, which can positively impact airline revenue. Currently, the TSA checks over 2.5 million passengers daily, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers. A new record was reached in July, with over 3 million passengers checked on a single day. As the following graph shows, passenger traffic in the US is now regularly above pre-pandemic levels. US airlines are adjusting their domestic flight capacity. The reason for this is the oversupply of seats during the summer months, which led to a price drop and reduced margins, despite robust air travel demand. By reducing capacity, airlines can increase ticket prices without risking significant passenger decline. This reflects the classic dynamics of supply and demand. With stable demand, airlines, particularly in the context of the autumn season, could benefit from a significant increase in revenue. Fuel is one of the largest cost factors for airlines, making up 20-30% of their total costs. After a period of rising fuel prices, we now see a certain relief, which is good news for the aviation industry. The BofA has increased its profit forecasts for several airlines, including United and Alaska Airlines, due to the recent decline in fuel prices. Lower fuel costs combined with higher ticket prices could help airlines stabilize their profitability and possibly exceed earnings expectations in the 4th quarter. Historically, airlines tend to perform better in the autumn. According to an analysis by the BofA of the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index since 2000, the second half of the year has been the stronger half. The industry has outperformed the S&P 500 in three of the last six months of the year, namely September, October, and November. If one looks at the development of the past, investors who enter the market now could achieve attractive returns by the end of the year. The aviation industry is positioning itself strategically for sustainable success beyond the short-term upswing. Airlines are using their strengthened cash flows to make essential investments, including expanding their workforce, modernizing their fleets, and implementing new IT systems. At the same time, debt repayment is being accelerated. According to a report by the Bank of America, US airline debt stood at $143 billion at the end of 2023, down from $168 billion at the end of 2021. Although the level remains above pre-pandemic levels, this decline signals a serious commitment to balance sheet repair. Furthermore, airlines are driving forward the modernization of their fleets by replacing older, less efficient aircraft with new, fuel-efficient models, which should further reduce operational costs. American Airlines announced in March the order of 260 new aircraft from Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer to meet the growing demand. Prior to this, United Airlines had announced the purchase of 110 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus in October 2023. While air travel may appear to be a purely passenger transportation service at first glance, a closer look reveals a much more complex business. Airlines must strike a delicate balance: on the one hand, providing sufficient capacity to meet demand, on the other hand, setting prices that enable solid profitability. Delta Air Lines has, despite a challenging start to the year, including the CrowdStrike issue, moderately increased its forecast for earnings per share to $5 to $7. Similarly, the Alaska Air Group has adjusted its earnings forecasts upwards due to robust summer demand and lower fuel costs. Even budget airlines like Frontier Airlines are recording surprisingly strong margin improvements through capacity adjustments. In my opinion, the aviation industry is currently characterized by a remarkable adaptability, making it an interesting investment opportunity. Airlines that efficiently manage their capacity, keep costs under control, and maintain their pricing power will position themselves as winners. For investors who prioritize valuable investments, the aviation industry presents itself as a potentially promising option. Airlines are traded at attractive price-to-earnings ratios, and with a view to the forecasted earnings growth in the fourth quarter and beyond, this may be a good time to review an allocation in this sector. As always, timing is crucial. Stabilizing high passenger numbers according to the Transportation Security Administration, decreasing domestic capacity, declining fuel prices, and seasonal factors all speak in favor of a strong development of the aviation industry in the second half of the year, which could mark the ideal time to build positions in this market.

**Preparing for holiday season air travel**
As the holiday season approaches, airports are expecting a surge in travelers from December 20 to 24. According to Luxury Link, some airports will see a significant increase in daily passengers. To ensure a smoother experience, Ralph Hennessey, the Executive Director of England Air Park, advises passengers to arrive at the airport 1.5 to 2 hours before their flight, as there will likely be longer lines at ticket counters and security checkpoints. Hennessey also notes that passengers must be aware of the higher volume of travelers. For those checking bags, it is essential to know the airline's deadlines, such as American Airlines' 10-minute pre-departure check-in and Delta Airlines' 30-minute pre-departure check-in.

**Holiday flights are cheaper this year  --  here's how to book smart**
This year's holiday airfares have decreased by 6% for Thanksgiving and 9% for the December holidays compared to last year, according to Kayak's holiday travel report. To book smart, consider traveling on the holiday itself, such as Thanksgiving Day (November 28) or Christmas Eve (December 24), to save up to 34% on airfare and avoid crowds. Kayak's data suggests booking at least two months in advance for affordable domestic airfare, while Hopper recommends booking during the final two weeks of October for Christmas flights. Conversely, departing on Friday, December 20, or Saturday, December 21, and returning on Saturday, December 28, or Sunday, December 29, may result in higher prices. As travel expert, 'It's wise to book sooner rather than later' to snag reasonably priced seats, especially in the last three to four weeks before the holiday arrives.

**Holiday airfare is down. Why isn’t travel spending?**
Despite a 9% drop in domestic holiday airfare and a 6% drop in Thanksgiving flight prices, Americans are planning to spend more than ever on holiday travel. According to a survey by NerdWallet, nearly half of American adults plan to spend an average of $2,330 on flights and hotel stays during the 2024 holiday season, a 20% increase over 2023. The main drivers of this increased spending are higher hotel prices, up 4% compared to 2023, and a willingness to pay for upgraded seats, checked baggage, and more convenient itineraries. Additionally, the demand for popular destinations is driving up prices and holiday travel spending. 'Unlike the pandemic where travelers chose less crowded destinations, those who are traveling are going back to more popular and expensive cities — and they’re willing to pay a premium,' said Noreen Henry, chief revenue officer at Sojern. To save money on holiday travel, consumers can book flights soon, use their stash of airline miles, hotel points, or credit card rewards, and fly on low-demand days.

**Global Air Passenger Demand Rises 7.1% in September**
The global demand for air passenger transportation increased by 7.1% in September compared to the same month in 2023, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The association, which represents 300 airlines that account for 80% of the global sector, reported that international flight demand grew by 9.2% year-over-year, while domestic flight demand only grew by 3.7%. IATA Director General Willie Walsh stated, 'The high season this year ended with a historic record, which is good not only for passengers but also for the global economy in general, as each flight creates more jobs and trade.' Walsh warned of possible airport capacity saturation in some regions due to the increased demand, which could reduce the economic and social benefits of the sector, which has already emerged from the severe crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Walsh also noted, 'Many governments will have to choose between forging a consensus for sustainable growth or losing market share to more dynamic nations that value global connectivity.' By region, the largest increase in demand in September occurred in Asia-Pacific, with a 12.4% increase compared to the same month in 2023, while in Europe the increase was 6.7%, in Latin America 7.2%, and the smallest growth was in North America, where it was only 1.1%. In major domestic markets, China saw a year-over-year increase in demand of 7.7%, Japan 6.7%, Brazil 6.6%, and India 6.5%, while the US only experienced a 1.6% growth.

**Column: South suburban travel agents say book now to get the best winter holiday travel deals**
Travel experts advise booking flights and hotels for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season now to get the best deals. According to Hayley Berg, lead economist with Hopper, airfare prices will start to rise in the next couple of weeks. For Thanksgiving, airfare is averaging $273 per domestic roundtrip ticket, up 9% from last year, while Christmas airfare is averaging $379 per domestic roundtrip ticket, up 8% from last year. To save money, try booking the return portion of a trip several days after the holiday, and be flexible with travel dates. 'It's important to book at the right time, but what's even more important is to travel on the least expensive days,' said Berg. Travelers can also save money by booking flights on off-peak days, such as early Monday morning or Black Friday, and by avoiding Saturday to Saturday or Sunday to Sunday trips. Additionally, experts recommend applying for TSA PreCheck and Global Entry to reduce the time it takes to get through airport security.

**Millions rush to book flights ahead of stealth 'holiday tax'**
Millions of holidaymakers are rushing to book flights in the next 48 hours ahead of a potential stealth 'holiday tax' by Labour. The rumoured Air Passenger Duty (APD) increase, also known as 'holiday tax', is set to be introduced in the government's Budget on Wednesday. According to On the Beach's chief customer officer, Zoe Harris, 'A further increase would be a kick in the teeth to millions of Brits whose pockets are set to be punished for going away on holiday for a week.' The research by the publication found that 35% of passengers are worried they won't be able to afford a holiday if the APD rises, and one in ten said they will not be able to go on holiday abroad next year as the increase will price them out. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has threatened to axe hundreds of UK flights in response to the potential increase, saying 'If they raise APD again on domestic flights then there will be a cut in capacity, no question.' The industry is braced for the levy to be increased, with an aviation industry source commenting, 'We're expecting an above-RPI increase given everything we're hearing about tax rises in the Budget.'

As the autumn budget approaches, millions of Brits are rushing to book their holidays within the next 48 hours to avoid an expected tax increase on Air Passenger Duty (APD). According to research by On the Beach, nearly 40% of Brits plan to book their holidays on Monday and Tuesday to dodge the tax hike. Zoe Harris, chief customer officer at On the Beach, warned that an increase in APD would lead to higher flight prices and more expensive holidays. She stated, 'If ADP is increased, the price of flights will go up and holidays will be more expensive, that's a fact.' Harris also noted that a further increase would be a significant blow to millions of Brits, with many struggling to afford holidays after Wednesday.

**Election anxiety is scrambling Americans' travel plans**
The upcoming 2024 US election is causing anxiety among Americans, leading some to rethink their travel plans. According to a recent poll, 64% of US adults would avoid traveling in the US due to concerns about unrest, depending on the election outcome. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian expects a 'pause' in travel around the election, as consumers prefer to stay home during this time. Businesses are also on alert, with domestic flight bookings down 19% for the week of the election. However, bookings for the following week are expected to be higher than usual. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is tightening security at polling places and airports, but some travelers are still choosing to stay home. 'I have a toddler now and I’m worried about being in a potentially volatile situation,' said Emily Reeve, who usually spends Thanksgiving in Hawaii or Florida but is staying put this year. 'People like to be home during the election period. They don’t want to be out traveling,' said Bastian. 'I don’t think they want to be spending money until they understand what’s going to happen.'

**TSA and AAA’s Tips on How to Handle Thanksgiving Travel**
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and AAA have provided tips on how to handle Thanksgiving travel. With an estimated 29.9 million people traveling between November 17 and 27, 2023, and 55.4 million Americans traveling 50 miles or more, the busiest travel days will be the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after. AAA reports that the average price for a domestic flight in November and December was $681, up 5 percent from 2022, while the average price for a domestic rental car was $590, down 20 percent from 2022. To avoid crowds, consider taking the train or visiting warm weather destinations. To get through TSA with less stress, consider the following tips: bring snacks in your carry-on, pack liquids and gels in a quart-size plastic bag, wear a minimalist outfit, and check the bins before rushing off. Additionally, consider enrolling in TSA PreCheck or Clear for expedited screening.

**Experts share their best advice for booking cheap holiday flights**
Airfare expert Scott Keyes advises booking holiday flights during the 'off-season' or now, as prices are expected to rise. According to Google's 2024 analysis, the best prices for Thanksgiving flights should appear 26 to 59 days before departure, while Christmas travel prices are expected to be lowest in the second half of October. Keyes also recommends considering international flights, as prices are lower than last year. Additionally, experts suggest setting up price alerts, booking flights with delays in mind, and stalking prices after booking to potentially save more. Furthermore, travelers should know their rights for cancellations and disruptions, including compensation for airline cancellations or delays.

**Europeans Prefer Long-Haul Destinations, While Americans Flock to Orlando and London**
According to Sojern, a travel platform, there is an increase in domestic flight bookings in the US by 4% in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, with approximately 4.7 million people flying during the Thanksgiving holidays, with Orlando being the preferred destination. In contrast, national US travel during the Christmas period is down by 15%. International travel by Americans is on the rise, with a 2% increase in Europe and a 9% increase in Asia. Europeans, on the other hand, prefer long-haul destinations, with a 26% decrease in domestic flight bookings and a 5% decrease in international bookings within Europe. London remains the most popular European destination, with 79.1% of flight bookings and 89.7% of hotel bookings. Paris is also a popular destination, with a 41% decrease in national travel but only a 1% decrease in international travel. The UAE is preparing for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with a 9% increase in flight bookings for December and a 13% increase in regional bookings. Saudi Arabia is experiencing a surge in demand as it enters the high season, with a 15% increase in international flight bookings and a 38% increase in local bookings. Japan is emerging as a major ski destination, with a 417% increase in hotel bookings compared to last year. Singapore, a usual major attractor, is experiencing a 11.55% decrease in hotel bookings and a 26% decrease in national bookings. The 2025 Chinese New Year, which takes place from January 28 to February 3, is driving travel in the Asia-Pacific region. Canada, Mexico, and the US are expected to host a boom of tourists in 2026, as they will be hosting the FIFA World Cup. Travelers are eager to travel, but economic concerns and inflation are widening the economic and social divide. According to Sojern, more consumers are opting for road trips over air travel, with hotel prices for luxury and high-end categories increasing by 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively, while budget hotels remain stable, reflecting the growing demand for high-end accommodations. 'Unlike the pandemic, when travelers chose less crowded destinations, those who travel are returning to popular and expensive cities, and are willing to pay extra for it,' says Noreen Henry, Chief Revenue Officer of Sojern. 'We've seen this with Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, where interest in bookings towards European cities increased by 65% and hotel prices increased by 154%. For the next holiday season, we're seeing the same trend. Whether it's travel for events or holiday stays, travelers want immersive experiences, and travel companies that offer personalized and magical experiences will be the winners.'

**Global Air Traffic Sees 8.6% Increase in August 2024, IATA Reports**
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported an 8.6% increase in global air traffic in August 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The Asia-Pacific region saw the highest growth at 19.9%, while Europe ranked fourth with a 9.1% increase, still far from the 2019 levels. The total demand, measured in revenue passenger-kilometers (RPK), increased by 8.6% compared to August 2023, while the total capacity, measured in available seat-kilometers (ASK), increased by 6.5% year-over-year. The load factor in August was 86.2% (+1.6pp compared to August 2023), a new record according to IATA figures. 'The air travel market is booming, and airlines are doing well to respond to the growing demand. Efficiency gains have led to record load factors, while the 6.5% increase in capacity demonstrates resilience in the face of persistent supply chain and infrastructure problems,' said Willie Walsh, IATA's director general. International demand increased by 10.6%, while regional demand increased by 5.6% compared to August 2023 figures. All regions saw an increase in air traffic, with Asia-Pacific airlines recording a 19.9% increase in demand year-over-year. The region maintains a robust growth and is now just 8 percentage points away from pre-pandemic volumes. Latin America saw a 13.6% increase in demand year-over-year, and Africa +10.1%. In Europe, demand increased by 9.1% year-over-year, with capacity up 8.5% and a load factor of 87.2% (+0.5pp compared to August 2023). 'For the future, the strong and sustained growth in demand indicates that we may quickly approach a shortage of capacity in infrastructure, which would limit connectivity and choices for passengers and businesses. If governments want to optimize the benefits of aviation, they must take bold decisions to ensure sufficient infrastructure capacity,' added Willie Walsh.

**Avoid Flying On These Days During the 2024 Holiday Season to Save on Airfare**
Travelers can save on airfare by avoiding flights on certain days during the 2024 holiday season. According to Going.com, the Tuesday or Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and the Sunday and Monday before Christmas, are the priciest days to fly. Instead, consider flying on the actual holidays, such as Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, which could save up to 25% off the overall ticket cost. Scott Keyes, founder and chief flight expert at Going, recommends booking flights at least 21 days in advance and monitoring prices to take advantage of no-change fee policies. Additionally, returning on Dec. 31 for New Year's will save travelers money and reduce airport crowds.

**Air Passenger Numbers to Double by 2042, According to ACI World Forecast**
The International Air Transport Association (ACI) World has released a new report predicting the number of air passengers and the largest markets for air travel over the next 30 years.

**The Best and Worst Days to Fly Around Thanksgiving**
According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the best days to fly around Thanksgiving are Saturday, November 23, Monday, November 25, and Thursday, November 21 before the holiday, and Wednesday, December 4, Tuesday, December 3, and Black Friday, November 29 after the holiday. If possible, flying on Thanksgiving Day itself may also be a good option, as it tends to be the least crowded day. Sally French, NerdWallet's travel expert, recommends booking flights early, ideally in early October, as prices tend to be lower during this time. She also advises against waiting for last-minute deals, as flights often sell out quickly during the Thanksgiving travel period. The worst days to fly are Wednesday, November 27, Tuesday, November 26, Sunday, December 1, and Saturday, November 30, with Sunday, December 1 being the busiest day of the year in most years.

**Demand for Air Travel Expected to Break All Records in 2024: IBA**
According to a recent report by IBA, a leading market intelligence and aviation consulting company, global air travel demand is expected to exceed 9 trillion passenger kilometers (RPKs) for the first time in 2024, representing a 4.2% increase from the previous record of 8.6 trillion RPKs set in 2019. This growth is driven by a constant increase in GDP in various regions, combined with a reduction in unit costs and improved fuel efficiency, resulting in increasing profitability for airlines worldwide. However, IBA noted that the global political and economic scenario, along with supply chain challenges and labor strikes, will affect aircraft deliveries, reducing them compared to 2023. The recovery of delivery levels to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 is not expected before 2026. The issue related to GTF engines has impacted aircraft availability, and the percentage of narrowbodies out of contract has fallen to levels not seen since before the pandemic. Many operators are extending their aircraft leases, resulting in fewer transitions and retirements. Currently, airlines like IndiGo and Viva Aerobus are facing high rates of GTF engine failures, leading to extremely low retirement rates, with less than 200 retirements expected in 2024. Despite the decline in transaction volumes between 2021 and 2023, IBA predicts a stabilization in 2024. New narrowbodies from Airbus, such as the A321neo, have stood out in leasing negotiations, showing a growth in value of up to 8.4% per year, although engine values have grown at even higher rates, reaching 49.2%. Narrowbody leases have increased by up to 25% since last year. Meanwhile, older aircraft have maintained their values, with some types, such as the Airbus A319 and the Boeing 737 NG, showing growth of 40% to 60% over the past 12 months. There has also been a significant increase in leases for these types of aircraft. IBA predicts a 9.2% increase in global airline capacity from 2023 to 2024. The largest expansion in capacity in seats in the third quarter of 2024 was observed in the Asia-Pacific region, with a growth of 12%, while North America shows a more modest increase of only 3%. However, operational performance in Q2 decreased in Europe and North America, with EBIT margins falling between 3% and 6%. IBA also identified a slight improvement in the average risk classification in the global market, although specific segments, such as cargo and ACMI operators, have seen a significant decline. Despite the absolute increase in emissions returning to pre-pandemic levels, carbon intensity has stabilized, indicating an improvement in fuel efficiency. This shows that, although demand and activity are growing, there is also a movement towards more sustainable practices in the aviation sector. Although IBA predicts a general decline in yields in various global regions in 2024, the most substantial growth was identified in full-service airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by suppressed international demand. On the other hand, the situation in the low-cost segment in North America represents a high risk, with potential bankruptcies due to sustained inflation and overcapacity.

**Making year-end travel plans? Now is the time to book for the best pricing and availability**
Industry officials are advising travelers to book flights, rental cars, and accommodations as soon as possible for the best pricing and availability during the Thanksgiving and year-end holidays.

To ensure a positive and stress-free experience, AAA recommends the following tips: work with a travel advisor, fly in the morning, try to fly a day or two ahead of your trip, schedule long layovers, buy travel insurance, check in early, review your airline's app, and enroll in pre-screening programs. By following these tips, travelers can minimize the risk of disruptions and enjoy a smoother experience. 'Since May, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has recorded its 10 busiest days in the agency's history,' Hitchens notes. 'AAA anticipates the same enthusiasm for travel through the year-end holiday period and encouraging everyone to plan accordingly.'

**Increased Passenger Traffic and Inflation to Drive Up Airfare in 2025**
Airlines will increase ticket prices in 2025 due to increased passenger traffic and inflation, according to aviation expert Roman Gusev. He stated, 'High aircraft occupancy rates, reaching 100%, are the main factor affecting price growth.' Gusev noted that airlines are currently operating at a level of profitability on both domestic and international flights. Other factors contributing to the price increase include rising costs for aircraft repairs and spare parts, which have increased due to inflation. Airlines are also required to pay significant airport and air navigation fees, which are indexed annually based on the inflation rate. Gusev added that air navigation fees in Russia increased by 37% for domestic flights and doubled for international routes starting from September 17, 2024. Additionally, the cost of loans and aviation fuel will also contribute to the price increase, as these expenses will continue to rise in the near future.

According to the Transportation Security Administration, the Sunday after Thanksgiving is the busiest airport day of the year, with over 2.9 million people screened in 2023. In contrast, Thanksgiving Day is the least crowded day, with around 1.5 million people. To save money and avoid chaos, consider flying on the following days: Saturday before Thanksgiving (least crowded), Wednesday after Thanksgiving (least crowded), or even Black Friday, which is the third-least crowded day. NerdWallet recommends booking the first flight out on Thanksgiving Day to reduce the risk of flight delays and potentially even make it home in time for dinner.

**4 Reasons Why Airline Stocks Could Soar by Year-End**
According to a new report by Bank of America, airline stocks could see a significant increase by the end of the year. Despite the challenges faced by the aviation industry in recent years, including pandemic-related restrictions, extreme weather events, and rising fuel costs, the conditions are now improving. Decreasing fuel prices and regained pricing power are indicators that it may be an ideal time to reevaluate the sector. The Bank of America highlights four key factors that could lead to outperformance in the aviation industry in the coming months. These developments are particularly relevant for those who may have prematurely written off the sector. Firstly, TSA data shows that demand for air travel remains stable at a high level despite reduced airline capacity. This is crucial as it signals that passengers continue to fly in large numbers despite reduced available seating capacity, leading to improved pricing power, which can positively impact airline revenue. Currently, the TSA checks over 2.5 million passengers daily, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers. A new record was reached in July, with over 3 million passengers checked on a single day. As the following graph shows, passenger traffic in the US is now regularly above pre-pandemic levels. US airlines are adjusting their domestic flight capacity. The reason for this is the oversupply of seats during the summer months, which led to a price drop and reduced margins, despite robust air travel demand. By reducing capacity, airlines can increase ticket prices without risking significant passenger decline. This reflects the classic dynamics of supply and demand. With stable demand, airlines, particularly in the context of the autumn season, could benefit from a significant increase in revenue. Fuel is one of the largest cost factors for airlines, making up 20-30% of their total costs. After a period of rising fuel prices, we now see a certain relief, which is good news for the aviation industry. The BofA has increased its profit forecasts for several airlines, including United and Alaska Airlines, due to the recent decline in fuel prices. Lower fuel costs combined with higher ticket prices could help airlines stabilize their profitability and possibly exceed earnings expectations in the 4th quarter. Historically, airlines tend to perform better in the autumn. According to an analysis by the BofA of the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index since 2000, the second half of the year has been the stronger half. The industry has outperformed the S&P 500 in three of the last six months of the year, namely September, October, and November. If one looks at the development of the past, investors who enter the market now could achieve attractive returns by the end of the year. The aviation industry is positioning itself strategically for sustainable success beyond the short-term upswing. Airlines are using their strengthened cash flows to make essential investments, including expanding their workforce, modernizing their fleets, and implementing new IT systems. At the same time, debt repayment is being accelerated. According to a report by the Bank of America, US airline debt stood at $143 billion at the end of 2023, down from $168 billion at the end of 2021. Although the level remains above pre-pandemic levels, this decline signals a serious commitment to balance sheet repair. Furthermore, airlines are driving forward the modernization of their fleets by replacing older, less efficient aircraft with new, fuel-efficient models, which should further reduce operational costs. American Airlines announced in March the order of 260 new aircraft from Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer to meet the growing demand. Prior to this, United Airlines had announced the purchase of 110 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus in October 2023. While air travel may appear to be a purely passenger transportation service at first glance, a closer look reveals a much more complex business. Airlines must strike a delicate balance: on the one hand, providing sufficient capacity to meet demand, on the other hand, setting prices that enable solid profitability. Delta Air Lines has, despite a challenging start to the year, including the CrowdStrike issue, moderately increased its forecast for earnings per share to $5 to $7. Similarly, the Alaska Air Group has adjusted its earnings forecasts upwards due to robust summer demand and lower fuel costs. Even budget airlines like Frontier Airlines are recording surprisingly strong margin improvements through capacity adjustments. In my opinion, the aviation industry is currently characterized by a remarkable adaptability, making it an interesting investment opportunity. Airlines that efficiently manage their capacity, keep costs under control, and maintain their pricing power will position themselves as winners. For investors who prioritize valuable investments, the aviation industry presents itself as a potentially promising option. Airlines are traded at attractive price-to-earnings ratios, and with a view to the forecasted earnings growth in the fourth quarter and beyond, this may be a good time to review an allocation in this sector. As always, timing is crucial. Stabilizing high passenger numbers according to the Transportation Security Administration, decreasing domestic capacity, declining fuel prices, and seasonal factors all speak in favor of a strong development of the aviation industry in the second half of the year, which could mark the ideal time to build positions in this market.

**Why Jet Fuel Demand Soared This Summer**
Gasoline demand in the US surged to 9.4 million barrels per day in July, its highest levels since 2019, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Jet fuel production also increased to 1.9 million barrels per day, an 8% rise from the previous year. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reported a 6.2% increase in passenger travel numbers from January to July 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Airlines for America projected an additional 26,000 scheduled flights per day to meet the higher demand for air travel. Despite the hurricane season, gasoline prices in the Gulf Coast remained steady after a Category 1 storm reached landfall in Texas. The price of gasoline is predominantly underpinned by crude oil, accounting for approximately 60% of the cost. Gasoline prices are expected to remain relatively flat with slower but consistent economic growth, according to the EIA. Jet fuel is a significant component of the economy, contributing about 1.3% of GDP, $535 billion in economic activity, and 2.6 million jobs, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
