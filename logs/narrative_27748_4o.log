INT. PARIS CAFÉ - DAY - SEPTEMBER 9, 2024

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping espresso, papers scattered before them. A tense silence hangs in the air.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning in)  
So, Hans Niemann. Did he pull it off?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Carlsen's history and form were too strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Even with Niemann's past upset against Carlsen, the odds were slim. The controversy didn't help his focus.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(glancing at a newspaper)  
Nakamura versus Carlsen in the final. The rematch everyone anticipated.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
Paris was electric. But Niemann's moment wasn't this time.

They clink their cups, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(chuckling)  
Here's to another year of perfect Brier scores.

They share a knowing smile, the city of Paris bustling around them.

FADE OUT.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ANNA and JAMES, sit with laptops open, reviewing the results of the Speed Chess Championship.

ANNA  
(leans back, sipping coffee)  
Well, Hans Niemann pulled off quite the upset. Our models had it at only 12.34%.

JAMES  
(nods, scrolling through articles)  
Incredible, considering the history with Carlsen. That 2022 Sinquefield game was just a precursor.

ANNA  
And Nakamura falling to Firouzja in the semis was unexpected too. It's a new era.

JAMES  
(smiling)  
Yet, Carlsen and Nakamura's rivalry still dominated the narratives. Niemann breaking through is a story for the ages.

ANNA  
(typing)  
Let's update the models. The future of chess just got a lot more unpredictable.

They exchange a knowing glance, acknowledging the ever-evolving landscape of competitive chess.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, sipping espresso, huddle around a tablet displaying the Speed Chess Championship results.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, Hans Niemann didn't pull it off. Our models had it at 5.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the semifinals against Carlsen, it was a long shot. Carlsen's blitz rating and past performances were just too strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing)  
And Nakamura's form was impeccable. Firouzja gave him a run, but he's just not there yet.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
The Carlsen-Nakamura final was inevitable. Our models had Carlsen at 68.75% after Niemann's loss.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Here's to the data. Never wrong.

They toast, the air buzzing with the excitement of prediction and precision. The city of Paris hums around them, oblivious to the chess drama that just unfolded.
