**US PPI Data Strengthens Expectations of a September Rate Cut**
The recent release of the US Producer Price Index (PPI) has strengthened expectations of a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in September, leading to a rise in Wall Street indexes and a decline in bond yields. Swap traders have priced in a 40 basis point Fed rate cut in September and over 100 basis points of rate cuts for 2024. The S&P 500 index rose 1.7% led by the stocks of the world's largest technology companies. Treasury yields rose across the curve, with the 10-year US Treasury yield falling 6 basis points to 3.84%. The Bloomberg Dollar Index reached its lowest level since April. Brent oil prices declined 2% after a five-day rally, influenced by the tensions in the Middle East. Asian stock markets are mixed, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rising for the fourth consecutive day, driven by gains of over 1% in New Zealand and Taiwan. Japanese stocks and the yen were affected by political uncertainty. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be released today at 15:30 CEST. Bloomberg's US Chief Economist Anna Wong expects a soft CPI reading due to slowing consumer spending, a decline in housing rents, and a decrease in used car prices. However, the core PCE deflator is expected to show a more complex picture. Wong stated, 'If our forecast is correct, the CPI data, combined with the soft June inflation reading, would suggest that the core PCE deflator accelerated year-over-year in July.' She added, 'This would likely keep the FOMC from cutting rates by 50 basis points at the September meeting. Instead, the Fed will focus more on the labor market, which is expected to rise to 4.5% by the end of the year, likely in October.'

**Bernard Arnault Loses More Wealth Than Any Other Billionaire in 2024**
Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and CEO of LVMH, saw his net worth decline by more than any other person in 2024, according to the Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, as luxury goods demand continues to decrease. Arnault's fortune fell by 20 billion dollars to 187 billion dollars, surpassing the accumulated losses of China's richest man, Zhong Shanshan. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, suffered a larger one-day loss, but still increased his wealth by 5% this year. Despite the decline, Musk remains ahead of Jeff Bezos by 37 billion dollars. Arnault, 75, fell to third place after being the world's richest person last month, a position he held after the pandemic when global luxury goods demand surged. Zhong is at risk of losing his top spot in China due to intensified competition and public relations challenges at his bottled water giant, Nongfu Spring Co.

**Futures Rise Ahead Of Data Deluge Including Key Retail Sales Report**
US equity futures are rising ahead of a data deluge, including a key retail sales report, which may support the case for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September meeting. Walmart jumped 7.8% in premarket trading after raising its sales and profit guidance for the full year. Cisco Systems rose after the networking equipment maker's results beat expectations. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said, 'The latest US inflation data supports our view of a gradual cooling of the US economy.' The Fed may not reveal its hand until the Sep 6 NFP print. European stocks rise for a third day, led by health care, insurance and technology names, while travel and leisure is falling the most. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is unchanged; the pound rises 0.1% against the dollar. The Norwegian krone has risen to the top of the G-10 FX leader board, adding 0.4% after a hawkish hold from the Norges Bank.

**US Consumer Price Index Data Expected to Show Soft Inflation**
After the mild inflation rate, swap traders priced in a potential 40 basis point Fed rate cut in September and over 100 basis points in total for 2024. The S&P 500 index rose 1.7% led by technology stocks. Treasury bonds generally gained value, with short-term bonds experiencing increased activity and the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond falling 6 basis points to 3.84%. The Bloomberg Dollar Index reached its lowest level since April, while Brent oil paused its five-day rally and fell 2% yesterday. Asian stock markets were mixed this morning, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rising for the fourth consecutive day, driven by gains of over 1% in New Zealand and Taiwan. Japanese stocks and the yen were volatile due to political uncertainty. Today, the US is expected to release its consumer price index (CPI) data, which is expected to remain at 3% year-over-year, with core CPI expected to fall to 3.2% from 3.3%. According to Bloomberg's Chief Economist Anna Wong, 'We expect the July CPI to be soft due to reduced consumer spending, a slowdown in housing rents, a decline in used car prices, and discounts in discretionary services.' Wong also noted that if their predictions are correct, the July CPI data, combined with the soft June inflation rate, could indicate that the core PCE deflator is accelerating year-over-year. Wong added, 'This would not prevent the Fed from cutting rates by 50 basis points at their September meeting. We expect the Fed to focus more on the employment side of their dual mandate as the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.5% by October.'

**Fed Week: Interest Rate Cuts Expected, Markets Rise**
The Nasdaq 100 index rose 1% on Friday, but fell around 3% for the week. US futures are higher this morning. Asian stock markets started the new week with a rise. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index recorded its strongest daily gain in two weeks. The expectation of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts is supporting the markets, and many stock markets, from Australia to Japan and Hong Kong, are gaining value. China, however, is falling due to a lack of strong stimulus, and the yield on its 10-year bonds has fallen to a record low. The yield on US 10-year bonds fell 5 basis points to 4.1939% last week, and the yield on 2-year bonds fell 13 basis points to 4.3832%. The two yields are also falling this morning. The Bloomberg Dollar Index, which ended last week flat at 1.257, is slightly lower this morning. After the latest US data showed that inflation is slowing down without affecting growth, the markets are pricing in the Fed keeping interest rates steady this week, but signaling a rate cut in September. The US Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday. According to a Bloomberg survey, the median expectation is for policy rates to be kept in the 5.25-5.50 range. Bloomberg Economics economists expect a rate cut to be 'suitable soon', but there may be small differences in timing. The most likely surprise will be the meeting of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on the same day. Most economists, 51 out of 51, expect interest rates to remain steady, while 11 expect different rates. According to a survey on the timing of rate hikes, July, September, and October are all priced similarly. The BOJ is expected to absorb 6 trillion yen in monthly bond purchases, down from 5 trillion yen. The Bank of England (BOE) will announce its interest rate decision on Thursday. According to a Bloomberg survey, the median expectation is for policy rates to fall from 5.25%, the highest in 16 years, to 5%. Swap markets are pricing in a 50-50 chance of a rate cut. Economists expect the BOE to start cutting rates, but signal a gradual easing process.

**Wealth of Luxury Goods Billionaires Declines Globally**
The wealth of billionaires in the luxury goods sector has declined globally this year due to a slowdown in demand for those products and beauty products in some regions. According to the 'Bloomberg' billionaires index, the wealth of six billionaires who rely on expensive and luxurious products decreased by 5% this year, or around $24 billion. On the other hand, the wealth of the remaining 500 people included in the index increased by 13%, or $1 trillion. The French billionaire Bernard Arnault, 75, and founder of 'LVMH', lost $10.8 billion since the beginning of this year, reaching $197 billion, and becoming the third richest person in the world after Elon Musk, founder of 'Tesla', and Jeff Bezos, founder of 'Amazon'. Earlier this month, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, heir to the large cosmetics company 'L'Oréal', briefly lost her title as the richest woman in the world to Alice Walton, member of the founding family of the American retail group 'Walmart'.

**Five things you need to know for Thursday, July 11**
The US inflation data (CPI) will be released on Thursday, July 11, as investors seek clues for a potential interest rate cut in September. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress that the central bank does not need inflation to be below 2% before cutting rates, and noted that the labor market has cooled 'significantly'. Investors will also be watching company earnings reports from Delta and PepsiCo, seeking signs about the health of US consumers before the quarterly reports from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. Here are five highlights for Thursday: The main event of the day is the release of the US consumer price index (CPI) in the morning. Analysts expect the data to show the smallest consecutive increases in core inflation since mid-July last year, strengthening the case for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. The expectation is for a 0.2% increase in the core index for June, for the second consecutive month. The broader index is expected to show a smaller 0.1% increase, partly due to lower gasoline prices. A result like this would help solidify projections that the Fed will start cutting rates in September, marking the first step in reversing its most aggressive tightening campaign since the 1980s. Meanwhile, in Brazil, the focus is on retail sales data for May. Median estimate in a Bloomberg survey points to a 4.4% annual increase, following a 2.2% increase in the previous month. The monthly index is expected to show a 0.5% decline, according to projections. Global stocks rose on Wednesday, as traders prepare for a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve. US futures signaled a continuation of the S&P 500's rally, which reached its 36th record this year. The Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.6% at 8:15 am (Brasília time), while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.3%, as traders analyzed comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on the US economy.
