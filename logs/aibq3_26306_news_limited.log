**Wealth of Luxury Goods Billionaires Declines Globally**
The wealth of billionaires in the luxury goods sector has declined globally this year due to a slowdown in demand for those products and beauty products in some regions. According to the 'Bloomberg' billionaires index, the wealth of six billionaires who rely on expensive and luxurious products decreased by 5% this year, or around $24 billion. On the other hand, the wealth of the remaining 500 people included in the index increased by 13%, or $1 trillion. The French billionaire Bernard Arnault, 75, and founder of 'LVMH', lost $10.8 billion since the beginning of this year, reaching $197 billion, and becoming the third richest person in the world after Elon Musk, founder of 'Tesla', and Jeff Bezos, founder of 'Amazon'. Earlier this month, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, heir to the large cosmetics company 'L'Oréal', briefly lost her title as the richest woman in the world to Alice Walton, member of the founding family of the American retail group 'Walmart'.

**Three-way race for world's richest emerges**
The world's three richest billionaires, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, have been in a fierce race for first place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with the top spot changing hands six times since May 29. The fluctuations in their wealth have been influenced by a fight over Musk's pay package, a snap election in France, and a tech-stock rally. Musk, with a net worth of $210.1 billion, moved back into first place on Monday, replacing Bezos, after Tesla shares rallied following the re-approval of his 2018 compensation package and the company's move to Texas.

**Top Three Billionaires Compete for Top Spot on Bloomberg Billionaires Index**
The top three billionaires in the world are competing for the top spot, with Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault holding the top three positions on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for over 94% of the time this year. However, fluctuations in their wealth have led to them swapping places six times since May 29, with a frantic pace in the hierarchical sequence that has remained largely stable since Musk lost his top spot in early March. Musk, 52, regained the top spot on Monday for the second time since early March, replacing Bezos. This comes after Tesla's shares rose last week following a vote by shareholders to approve a compensation package for Musk, which was previously blocked by a Delaware court and transferred the company's headquarters to Texas. The package, which includes stock options worth up to $55.8 billion, now represents nearly a quarter of Musk's net worth. His net worth has also been boosted by a new funding round that values his artificial intelligence project, xAI, at over $24 billion. Bloomberg's wealth index estimates that Musk owns 65% of the company, which uses social media data to train its chatbot program, Grok. Meanwhile, Arnault, 75, has recently fallen to third place with a net worth of $199 billion, after spending most of the past three months in first place, and has seen his net worth decline by $13 billion since the surprise presidential election call by French President Emmanuel Macron sent the country's markets into their worst week in years. Most of his wealth comes from LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods manufacturer. Bezos, the 60-year-old founder of Amazon, currently holds the second spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $206.6 billion. Since May 29, he has regained the top spot three times, with Amazon's shares trading near all-time highs. The share has benefited from a broader rally in major technology companies responsible for nearly three-quarters of the S&P 500's gains this year.

**Gautam Adani Regains Title as Asia's Richest Person, Surpassing Mukesh Ambani**
Gautam Adani has regained the title of Asia's richest person, surpassing Mukesh Ambani, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. As of 6:00 PM on Saturday, Adani, the chairman of the Adani group, ranked 11th on the index with a net worth of $111 billion, compared to Ambani's $109 billion. The significant increase in Adani's stock price was a key factor in his rise to the top. The Adani group's aggressive expansion plans, including $90 billion in capital expenditures over the next decade, were highlighted in a Jefferies report, which boosted the company's stock. The market reacted positively, with Adani's shares increasing by 1.23 crore lakh ₹, bringing the company's total market capitalization to 17.94 crore lakh ₹ intraday. The year 2023 was challenging for the Adani group after the Supreme Court ordered an investigation into allegations made by the Hindenburg report. However, the court later ordered the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to conclude its investigation and declared that no further investigation was necessary. Adani expressed optimism about the group's future, stating that its best days are ahead. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index currently ranks Bernard Arnault as the world's richest person with a net worth of $207 billion, followed by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos with net worths of $203 billion and $199 billion respectively.

Jeff Bezos has overtaken Bernard Arnault as the world's richest man, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos' estimated fortune is $205 billion, while Arnault's is $203 billion.

Despite this, Arnault's fortune has shrunk by almost $4.4 billion since the start of the year, while Bezos' has risen by nearly $28 billion.
