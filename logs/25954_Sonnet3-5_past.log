To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the available evidence:

1. Current situation:
- The New Popular Front (NPF) won the most seats (182) in the recent election, but not a majority.
- Macron's Together coalition came second with 168 seats.
- No party has a clear majority to form a government.

2. Potential outcomes:
a) NPF forms a government
b) Together forms a government 
c) A coalition government is formed
d) A different party/coalition forms a government

3. Key factors:
- The need for a coalition to reach a majority
- Macron's role in appointing the Prime Minister
- Political negotiations in the coming weeks
- Public opinion and pressure

4. Analysis:
- The NPF has the most seats but lacks a majority, making it difficult to form a government alone.
- Macron's Together coalition also lacks a majority, but as President, Macron has influence over PM selection.
- There's significant pressure to form a stable government, which may lead to unexpected coalitions.
- The articles suggest ongoing negotiations and uncertainty about the outcome.

5. Historical context:
- France has had periods of cohabitation before, where the President and PM were from different parties.
- However, the current situation is unprecedented in its fragmentation.

6. Timing:
- The question asks about July 30, which gives about 3 weeks for negotiations and government formation.

Considering these factors, I estimate:

- There's a moderate chance (30-40%) that the NPF will form a government, possibly with some smaller parties.
- There's a similar chance (30-40%) that Together will form a government, leveraging Macron's position.
- There's a smaller but significant chance (20-30%) that a different coalition or compromise candidate emerges.

Given the fragmented parliament and ongoing negotiations, I believe there's a substantial chance that the Prime Minister on July 30 will not be from either the NPF or Together coalitions.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 35.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Current situation: The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182) in the recent legislative elections, followed by Macron's Together coalition (168) and the National Rally (143).

2. Prime Minister selection process: The President typically appoints a Prime Minister who can command a majority in the National Assembly.

3. Coalition possibilities: No single party or coalition has an absolute majority (289 seats), necessitating negotiations.

4. Time frame: We need to predict the situation on July 30, 2024, which is about 3 weeks from now.

Key considerations:

1. NFP's position: As the largest bloc, they have a strong claim to form a government, but lack an absolute majority.

2. Macron's options: He may try to form a coalition with other parties or appoint a technocratic government.

3. National Rally's role: They're unlikely to be part of a coalition with either NFP or Together.

4. Historical precedent: France has experienced "cohabitation" before, where the President and Prime Minister are from different parties.

5. Negotiation timeframe: Three weeks is a relatively short time for complex coalition negotiations.

Reasons for a higher probability:

1. No clear majority: This increases the chances of a compromise candidate from outside the main coalitions.
2. Potential deadlock: If NFP and Together can't agree, a neutral third party might be chosen.
3. Macron's flexibility: He may opt for a technocratic government to break an impasse.

Reasons for a lower probability:

1. NFP's mandate: As the largest bloc, they have a strong claim to the Prime Minister position.
2. Together's influence: Macron still holds significant power and may resist appointing an NFP Prime Minister.
3. Limited alternatives: Most viable candidates are likely to be from either NFP or Together.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance of a Prime Minister from outside NFP or Together, but it's not the most likely outcome.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current situation: As of July 10, 2024, no party or coalition has an absolute majority in the National Assembly. The New Popular Front (NFP) has 182 seats, Macron's Together coalition has 168 seats, and the National Rally (RN) has 143 seats.

2. Government formation: With no absolute majority, a coalition government or minority government is likely. The NFP has the most seats but falls short of a majority.

3. Prime Minister selection: President Macron has the authority to appoint the Prime Minister, but typically chooses someone who can command a majority in the Assembly.

4. Coalition possibilities:
   - NFP + Together: Unlikely due to ideological differences
   - NFP + RN: Very unlikely due to stark ideological differences
   - Together + RN: Possible but politically risky for Macron
   - NFP or Together minority government: Possible

5. Time pressure: With the Olympics starting July 26, there's pressure to form a government quickly.

6. Historical precedent: France has had periods of cohabitation before, where the President and Prime Minister are from different parties.

7. Other options: A technocratic government is possible if no viable coalition emerges.

Weighing these factors:

- The likelihood of a PM from outside NFP or Together is significant, given the fragmented parliament and lack of clear majorities.
- The RN's strong showing increases the possibility of their involvement, either directly or indirectly.
- The pressure to form a government quickly may lead to compromise solutions.
- However, there's still a good chance that either NFP or Together could form a minority government or find support from smaller parties.

Given these considerations, I estimate:

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Election results: The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182) in the recent election, followed by Together (168) and National Rally (143). No party has an absolute majority.

2. Current situation: Gabriel Attal has resigned as Prime Minister, and a new PM needs to be appointed.

3. Constitutional rules: The President typically appoints a PM who can command a majority in the National Assembly. Without a clear majority, this becomes more complex.

4. Political dynamics: 
   - The NFP, as the largest bloc, has a strong claim to form a government.
   - Macron's Together coalition will try to maintain power.
   - Negotiations for a coalition government are likely ongoing.

5. Historical precedent: France has had periods of "cohabitation" before, where the President and PM are from different parties.

6. Time factor: There's about 3 weeks until July 30, which is a relatively short time to form a new government in a complex situation.

7. Potential scenarios:
   a) NFP forms a government (resolves as No)
   b) Together forms a coalition with other parties (resolves as No)
   c) A compromise candidate from neither main coalition is appointed (resolves as Yes)
   d) No PM is appointed by July 30 due to ongoing negotiations (resolves as Yes)

Balancing these factors:

- The lack of a clear majority increases the chances of a compromise candidate or prolonged negotiations.
- The NFP has the strongest position but may struggle to form a majority.
- Macron will likely try to avoid appointing an NFP Prime Minister.
- The short timeframe increases the chances of no appointment by July 30.

Given these considerations, I estimate there's a significant chance the PM on July 30 will either be from neither main coalition or that the position will be vacant.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to carefully analyze the current political situation in France and potential scenarios leading up to July 30, 2024.

Key considerations:

1. Current situation: The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182) in the recent legislative elections, followed by Macron's Together coalition (168) and the far-right National Rally (143). No party has an absolute majority.

2. Prime Minister appointment: Macron will need to appoint a new Prime Minister, but it's unclear who this will be given the complex political landscape.

3. Potential coalitions: There are discussions about forming coalitions, but no clear agreements yet.

4. Time factor: We have about 3 weeks until the resolution date, which is a relatively short time for major political shifts.

5. Historical precedent: France has experienced periods of cohabitation before, where the President and Prime Minister are from different parties.

Reasons for a lower probability:

1. The NFP and Together coalitions hold the most seats, making it more likely the PM will come from one of these groups.
2. Macron may prefer to appoint someone from his own coalition or a close ally.
3. The short timeframe makes major political realignments less likely.

Reasons for a higher probability:

1. No party has an absolute majority, which could lead to unexpected alliances or compromise candidates.
2. The National Rally performed strongly and could potentially form part of a coalition government.
3. There's pressure on Macron to respond to the election results, which could lead to unconventional choices.
4. Historical precedent shows France can have periods of cohabitation with a PM from an opposition party.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance the PM could come from outside the NFP or Together coalitions, but it's not the most likely outcome. The political situation is fluid, and unexpected developments could occur in the next few weeks.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

3. There's pressure on Macron to respond to the election results, which could lead to unconventional choices.
4. Historical precedent shows France can have periods of cohabitation with a PM from an opposition party.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance the PM could come from outside the NFP or Together coalitions, but it's not the most likely outcome. The political situation is fluid, and unexpected developments could occur in the next few weeks.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to carefully analyze the current political situation in France and potential scenarios leading up to July 30, 2024.

Key considerations:

1. Current situation: The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182) in the recent legislative elections, followed by Macron's Together coalition (168) and the far-right National Rally (143). No party has an absolute majority.

2. Prime Minister appointment: Macron will need to appoint a new Prime Minister, but it's unclear who this will be given the complex political landscape.

3. Potential coalitions: There are discussions about forming coalitions, but no clear agreements yet.

4. Time factor: We have about 3 weeks until the resolution date, which is a relatively short time for major political shifts.

5. Historical precedent: France has experienced periods of cohabitation before, where the President and Prime Minister are from different parties.

Reasons for a lower probability:

1. The NFP and Together coalitions hold the most seats, making it more likely the PM will come from one of these groups.
2. Macron may prefer to appoint someone from his own coalition or a close ally.
3. The short timeframe makes major political realignments less likely.

Reasons for a higher probability:

1. No party has an absolute majority, which could lead to unexpected alliances or compromise candidates.
2. The National Rally performed strongly and could potentially form part of a coalition government.
3. There's pressure on Macron to respond to the election results, which could lead to unconventional choices.
4. Historical precedent shows France can have periods of cohabitation with a PM from an opposition party.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance the PM could come from outside the NFP or Together coalitions, but it's not the most likely outcome. The political situation is fluid, and unexpected developments could occur in the next few weeks.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.
