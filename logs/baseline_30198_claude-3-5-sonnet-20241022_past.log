Let me reason through this carefully:

1. The question asks about a USDA recall being closed before December 1, 2024, which is less than 2 weeks from now.

2. The key aspects are:
- It involves Dearborn Sausage Company
- It's about wiener products
- The issue is misbranding and undeclared allergens
- Currently still active

3. Important considerations:
- Most misbranding/allergen recalls are resolved relatively quickly as they don't typically require extensive investigations
- Companies are motivated to resolve these issues promptly to resume normal operations
- Two weeks is a very short timeframe
- Without specific information about the status of the company's corrective actions, it's difficult to be highly confident

4. Looking at similar USDA recalls:
- Allergen/misbranding recalls often take 1-3 months to close
- The short timeframe makes resolution before December 1 less likely
- Administrative processes at USDA can take time even after issues are resolved

Given the short timeframe and typical resolution patterns, I assess a relatively low probability of closure before December 1, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
