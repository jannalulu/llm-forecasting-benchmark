**The AI industry is obsessed with Chatbot Arena, but it might not be the best benchmark | TechCrunch**
Chatbot Arena, a benchmark created by LMSYS, has become a popular tool for evaluating AI models. However, experts like Yuchen Lin and Mike Cook have raised concerns about the benchmark's limitations. They argue that the user base is not representative, and the voting process is unreliable. Additionally, the benchmark's reliance on post-processing and automated systems to label queries and rank models lacks systematic rigor. Furthermore, LMSYS' commercial ties and sponsorship from organizations with vested interests in the AI industry raise concerns about the benchmark's impartiality. Despite these flaws, Lin believes that Chatbot Arena provides a valuable service by offering real-time insights into how different models perform outside the lab. However, he suggests that LMSYS could improve the testing by designing benchmarks around different subtopics and using a more systematic approach to evaluate models.

**Google Gemini to Re-Enable Image Generation and Introduce Custom Chatbots**
Google has announced that Gemini will once again allow the generation of images of people in the coming days. The feature was removed over six months ago due to the questionable results obtained (to put it mildly). The company has also announced the imminent arrival of custom chatbots (Gems) for subscribers. Images of people with Imagen 3 The generation of images of people was available from the beginning of February. Several users discovered that the Imagen 2 model did not correctly interpret the text inputs, providing historically incorrect results (e.g., black-skinned Nazis). Google suspended the feature, explaining the reason why incorrect images were created. The feature will be restored in the coming days (later than expected). The image generation will use the new Imagen 3 model. Google emphasizes that the image quality is superior to that of competing models. To each image, the SynthID watermark will be added, indicating the use of artificial intelligence. Imagen 3 does not allow the creation of photorealistic images of real people and minors, nor violent and sexually explicit images. The feature will initially be available to Gemini Advanced, Enterprise, and Business subscribers (only in English). Custom chatbots for subscribers Google has also announced the arrival of Gems for Gemini Advanced, Enterprise, and Business subscribers on desktop and mobile in over 150 countries. Users will be able to create custom chatbots that are experts on specific topics. The company offers five pre-defined Gems that can answer specific questions. Regarding LLMs, a variant of Gemini 1.5 Flash with 8 billion parameters is available. Google has also improved Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro. The latter now occupies the second position in the Chatbot Arena ranking. Google spokesperson, 'We are excited to bring back the image generation feature and provide our subscribers with custom chatbots that can assist them in their daily tasks.'

**Elon Musk's xAI Set To Leapfrog ChatGPT in AI Race – These Were The Main Factors That Brought About The Breakthrough**
Elon Musk's startup, xAI, has launched Grok-2, a new chatbot that aims to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. In just 18 months, xAI has leaped into the top five AI developers, according to independent benchmarks. Ethan Mollick, a professor at Wharton and AI expert, stated, 'There are now five GPT-4 class models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, Llama 3.1, and now Grok-2.' Despite controversy over xAI's use of data from Musk's X platform, the company has closed a $6 billion funding round, valuing it at $18 billion, and is seeking approval to invest another $5 billion. Grok-2 is designed to provide accurate, factual information, avoiding 'hallucinations' that plagued previous versions. According to LMSYS, a leading AI benchmark site, Grok-2's performance has already outpaced some of Meta's and Anthropic's best models.

**Grok 2.0 Takes Third Place in Chatbot Test, Partners with FLUX Generator**
Grok 2, a neural network developed by Elon Musk, has taken third place in a chatbot test. According to the developers, the significant increase in test results is a testament to the network's progress. The most interesting aspect, however, is Grok's first participation in the ChatBot Arena, where the winner is chosen by users through a vote. The smart chatbots Grok appeared in late 2023, but Grok 1.0 and 1.5 were never on the 'arena'. Moreover, outside of the paid subscription X (formerly Twitter), it was also extremely difficult for a curious user to try Elon Musk's neural networks. The developers may have been afraid that Grok would be evaluated too low compared to other large language models. However, with the new version 2.0, the developers are more confident in the results. To avoid making a fuss and not revealing themselves too early, the new version of Grok 2 debuted on the service under the misleading name 'sus-column-r'. The developers have since revealed themselves, explaining in their official blog that 'sus-column-r' is actually Grok 2.0. The new version has achieved a high rating on the ChatBot Arena, but still lags behind the August versions of GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Grok 2.0 has also learned to create images, not just text responses. However, this feature is not available on the 'arena', but is currently being experimented with by premium users of X (Twitter). Elon Musk has taken a shortcut by not creating a generator from scratch, but instead partnering with the Black Forest Labs team, which includes former leading developers of Stable Diffusion. The team has developed a generator called FLUX, which has already taken the top spots in some ratings, even surpassing the paid Midjourney. According to Musk's Twitter account, he initially wanted to partner with Midjourney, but was surprised by the emergence of FLUX. In addition to quality, FLUX has a relatively low level of censorship. The neural network can draw people in underwear, does not shy away from politicians and famous people, and does not draw half of the characters as black as Google Imagen. The combination of Grok 2.0 and FLUX is reminiscent of the tandem of ChatGPT and Dall-E, but with higher quality and fewer restricted topics. Despite its high scores on the 'arena', many questions on logic and common sense that Grok 2.0 and its competitors cannot answer. The developers have confirmed that Grok 2.0 is just the beginning, and that more advanced versions will be released in the future. For example, if Grok 2 was trained on 20-25 thousand Nvidia H100 accelerators, the next model, Grok 3, is currently being trained on 100 thousand H100. Musk promises to complete the training and start deploying version 3.0 in December. The main competition for Grok 3 will be the new mysterious version of GPT from OpenAI, Gemini 2.0 from Google, and the powerful Claude 3.5 Opus from Anthropic. P.S. At the time of writing, Grok 2.0 is still available for free on ChatBot Arena under the name 'sus-column-r'. In turn, FLUX can be tried for free on the Hugging Face service in the Spaces section. There is an official FLUX Dev model available, which is not as good as Pro, but can occasionally produce high-quality results.

**Baird: Google's Gemini Ranks GPT-4 as Top LLM**
Baird's analyst Colin Sebastian asked Google's Gemini AI chatbot to rank the top large language models (LLMs), and OpenAI's GPT-4 came out on top, followed by Google's PaLM2, Anthropic's Claude 2, and Meta's LLaMA 2. This ranking suggests that there may be data supporting GPT-4's superiority. Interestingly, Google's website traffic has been trending downward since October 2023, while Microsoft's Bing, which incorporates OpenAI's LLMs, has seen an uptrend in visits. This could indicate that users prefer OpenAI's LLMs over Google's. Analysts believe that Google's stock (GOOGL) has more room to run than Microsoft's (MSFT), with a price target of $204.74 per share implying almost 26% upside.

**What is Project Strawberry? OpenAI's mystery AI tool explained**
OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman posted a cryptic message on X, sparking speculation about the release of a new AI model codenamed 'Strawberry'. The model, which has advanced reasoning capabilities, is said to be able to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably. According to an internal OpenAI document, Strawberry is a project that has been in development since May, and some OpenAI employees regard it as a breakthrough in artificial general intelligence (AGI). A new model, 'anonymous-chatbot', has appeared on the Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS) Chatbot Arena, which is said to be particularly good at advanced reasoning. While it is unclear if 'anonymous-chatbot' is indeed Strawberry, its presence on the arena suggests that a release may be imminent. As one Reddit user noted, 'if you want to try it out, you can visit the website, click on Arena battle, and enter sample prompts until 'anonymous-chatbot' comes up.' However, it is worth noting that there is no guarantee that 'anonymous-chatbot' is Strawberry, and users should proceed cautiously.

**Everyone thinks this picture of strawberries is teasing a major ChatGPT update**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has posted a picture of strawberries on social media with the caption 'I love summer in the garden.' Many are speculating that this is a teaser for the next big update to ChatGPT, codenamed 'Strawberry', which is expected to improve the bot's reasoning capabilities and allow it to operate more independently from a human. This update is rumored to be a major step towards a more human-like AI, similar to what other companies have yet to release. However, Altman's post is not an official announcement, and it could be a simple post about his garden or a way to get people excited about the upcoming update. The only other evidence pointing to an upcoming announcement is a post on social media discussing an 'Anonymous-chatbot' that appeared in LMSYS Chatbot Arena, which is being taken as a sign that some kind of announcement is on the way.

**Russian Platform for Evaluating Generative Neural Networks Launched**
Roman Kutsen, a developer, has created a platform called LLM Arena in collaboration with experts from TrainingData.ru to evaluate the quality of large language models in Russian. The platform allows users to test and compare Russian neural networks in real-time, evaluating the relevance and quality of their responses. Users can compare the answers of two randomly selected models and choose the best one. The platform currently has 21 AI models available for testing, including both foreign (ChatGPT, LLaMa) and Russian (YandexGPT, GigaChat, Saiga) models. The developers plan to add new models regularly. According to Kutsen, 'Our goal is to create an objective, open, and up-to-date rating of language models in Russian. Despite the increasing number of benchmarks, testing Russian LLMs on real user tasks is very challenging. LMSYS Chatbot Arena does not provide access to any Russian neural networks, so we decided to create our own platform to allow users to compare Russian and foreign generative neural networks and make their own conclusions.'

It is priced at 15 cents per million input tokens and 60 cents per million output tokens, making it more affordable than previous frontier models and 60% cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo. GPT-4o mini supports text and vision in the API, with support for text, image, video, and audio inputs and outputs coming in the future.

**OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini isn't much better than rival LLMs**
OpenAI has released GPT-4o Mini, a smaller and cheaper version of its GPT-4o generative large language model (LLM). The Mini version is multimodal, can handle up to 16,000 tokens of output, and is trained on materials up to October 2023. While it is not fully featured yet, supporting only text and vision via its API, OpenAI claims it is ahead of comparable LLMs in benchmarks. However, veteran open source developer Simon Willison notes that the competition has released their own GPT-4-class models, and the pricing is not too bad. GPT-4o Mini is mostly ahead of the pack in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena benchmark, but full-size GPT-4o is only barely ahead of its rivals. OpenAI may no longer have the dominating lead it once had, but it is still a strong player in the LLM arena.
