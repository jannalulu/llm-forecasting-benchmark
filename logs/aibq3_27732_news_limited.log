**Japan criticises ‘unacceptable' airspace violation by Chinese military plane**
A Chinese military plane briefly entered Japanese airspace on Monday, prompting the Japanese military to scramble fighter jets. Japanese chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi called the incident an 'absolutely unacceptable' territorial violation and safety threat. He said, 'The Chinese military aircraft's incursion into Japan's airspace not only is a serious violation of our territorial rights but also a safety threat. We found it absolutely unacceptable.' This is the first time a Chinese military aircraft has been detected in Japanese airspace. Japan has scrambled jets nearly 669 times between April 2023 and March 2024, with about 70% of those incidents involving Chinese military aircraft. Japanese defence officials are concerned about growing military co-operation between China and Russia, as well as China's increasingly assertive activity around Japanese waters and airspace. Tokyo has reinforced defences in south-western Japan, including remote islands that are key to Japan's defence strategy in the region.

**Chinese Military Aircraft Enters Japanese Airspace**
A Chinese military aircraft, a Y-9 intelligence gathering plane, entered Japanese airspace over the country's territorial waters near the Oshima Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture on August 26, 2024, according to a statement from the Japanese Ministry of Defense. The statement said, 'It was confirmed that a Chinese military aircraft had violated Japanese airspace between 11:29 and 11:31 on August 26, 2024.' In response, the Self-Defense Forces launched fighter jets from the Western Air Defense Force, took other measures, including issuing notifications and warnings, as stated in the statement.

**Chinese Y-9 Intelligence-Gathering Aircraft Violates Japan's Territorial Airspace**
A Chinese Y-9 intelligence-gathering aircraft violated Japan's territorial airspace off the Danjo Islands in Goto, Nagasaki Prefecture on August 26. The incident was the first confirmed intrusion into Japanese airspace by a Chinese military aircraft. 'There is no doubt that a military aircraft violating territorial airspace sends a very strong message,' a senior official of the Self-Defense Forces said. The Japanese government has lodged a protest with China over the violation, which prompted the SDF to scramble fighter jets. Some officials suspect the Chinese plane 'simply took a wrong course and entered Japan's territorial airspace,' while others believe it was a deliberate act of intelligence gathering. The plane was likely collecting information on two Air SDF monitoring radar facilities in the area. 'The aircraft that violated Japan's airspace this time has been gathering information on the SDF radar frequencies,' the ministry official said. 'It is natural to assume that the aircraft entered the airspace while concentrating on intelligence gathering.' The official said Japan must be vigilant about the fact that Chinese military aircraft are conducting intelligence gathering activities so close to the airspace of the Japanese mainland. A senior SDF official was perplexed about the latest intrusion, saying 'I don't know why it happened at this time.' Some speculate that the move was Beijing's way of responding to an earlier incident in July, where a Japanese vessel sailed through Chinese territorial waters without permission. 'The Chinese side may have suspected that the Japanese side had other intentions,' a diplomatic source said. Bonji Ohara, a senior fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, said the reason for the latest airspace violation was not immediately known, but 'I do not see any merit for China to militarily intimidate Japan at this time.'

**Chinese military plane breaches Japan airspace in a first**
A Chinese military aircraft, a Y-9 intelligence-gathering plane, entered Japanese airspace for the first time yesterday, sparking concerns over Beijing's willingness to take a harder stance in territorial disputes. Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshimasa Hayashi, called the incursion 'unacceptable' and a 'threat to our security.' The plane spent two minutes in Japanese airspace near uninhabited islands off the south coast before heading back to China. Japan has summoned China's acting ambassador to protest the air incursion and called for steps to prevent a recurrence. This incident comes amid tensions between China and Japan over territory, trade, and detained citizens, as well as a recent report of a Japanese destroyer sailing into Chinese territorial waters. 'This is not just a serious violation of our territory but also a threat to our security,' Hayashi said.

**China says it's investigating complaint it violated Japanese airspace**
China is investigating a report from Japan that a Chinese army aircraft violated Japanese airspace, according to China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian. 'China does not intend to intrude into the airspace of other countries,' he said. The incident occurred on Monday morning when a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft flew for around two minutes over the East China Sea and through the airspace around the Danjo archipelago. Japan launched fighter jets in response and summoned China's acting ambassador to lodge a protest. This is the first known incident of its kind, with previous airspace violations by Chinese authorities in 2012 and 2017 not involving military aircraft. The relationship between China and Japan is considered tense due to territorial claims to the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.

**China's Military Violates Japan's Airspace, Tokyo Deploys Fighter Jets**
The Chinese military has violated Japan's airspace, prompting Tokyo to deploy fighter jets. According to a Japanese government spokesperson, 'The violation of our airspace by Chinese military aircraft is not only a serious infringement of our sovereignty, but also a threat to our safety and is completely unacceptable.' This incident marks the first confirmed and announced incursion into Japanese airspace by a Chinese military aircraft since measures were taken to address airspace violations. The Japanese government stated that they will closely monitor China's military activities and take all necessary measures to ensure vigilant surveillance and measures against airspace violations. This is not the first time a Chinese aircraft has entered Japanese airspace, as in 2012 and 2017, non-military Chinese aircraft also entered the airspace above the disputed Senkaku islands, which are also claimed by Beijing. The Japanese military has scrambled fighter jets in response to the incursion, and the Chinese pilot was warned. The Japanese government has also summoned the Chinese ambassador for a 'strong protest'. China has not yet responded to the Japanese protests. A professor at the University of Tokyo believes that the Chinese aircraft likely tested Japan's air defense network and collected electronic information such as Japanese radar signals and coverage. China's growing economic and military power is making it increasingly assertive in territorial disputes in the region, with China's neighbors, including Vietnam, South Korea, the Philippines, and Japan, feeling the impact. Japan, which has a relatively small military with a defensive role since World War II, has increased its defense spending and begun developing capabilities for a counterattack. It has also relaxed its arms export regulations.

**Japan claims Chinese military plane violated its territorial airspace for the first time**
Japan has accused China of violating its territorial airspace for the first time, with a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance plane entering the airspace off the Danjo Islands in the East China Sea for about two minutes. The Japanese Defense Ministry scrambled fighter jets in response, but no confrontation occurred. Japan's Foreign Ministry summoned the Chinese Embassy's charge d'affairs to protest the alleged incursion, which is seen as a new irritant in frosty relations between China and Japan. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi called the incident 'a serious violation of our country's sovereignty' and 'a threat to our safety.' This is the first reported incidence of a Chinese military plane violating Japanese airspace, although there have been similar incidents in the Senkaku Islands, which China claims as its sovereign territory.

**Japan Condemns China's Military Aircraft for Violating Its Airspace**
Japan has condemned China's military aircraft violating its airspace as a 'serious infringement on our sovereignty.' The incident occurred a day after China sent fighter jets and summoned a Chinese diplomat in Tokyo to protest. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a press conference on Tuesday that the airspace violation, the first of its kind by a military aircraft, 'is not only a serious infringement on Japan's sovereignty, but also a threat to our security.' The Japanese Defense Ministry said on Monday that a Chinese Y-9 spy plane was spotted flying over the Danjo Islands, located off the southwestern coast of Kyushu, Japan's main southern island, for two minutes at 11:29 am (2:29 GMT). Japanese fighter jets were sent to warn the Chinese plane to leave the airspace. The Foreign Ministry later summoned the Chinese acting ambassador Shi Yong to lodge a strong protest and demand that China take preventive measures to avoid such incidents. The Chinese embassy did not comment on the incident, and no questions were raised about the incursion during a Foreign Ministry press conference on Monday. Hayashi said on Tuesday that Tokyo continues to monitor Chinese military activity near Japan and is ready to respond to any further airspace violations. According to the Japanese military, its aircraft were scrambled 669 times between April 2023 and March 2024, about 70% of the time against Chinese military aircraft, although this did not include airspace violations. Japanese defense officials are increasingly concerned about the military cooperation between the Chinese and Russian air forces, as well as China's growing aggressive activity around Japanese waters and airspace. The two countries are embroiled in a long-standing dispute over the Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands in China. The uninhabited chain of islands and rocks is located about 190 miles (352 kilometers) southwest of Okinawa and has been under Japanese control since 1895. China is also involved in disputes over sovereignty in the South China Sea, where it has been increasingly assertive in its territorial claims.

**Chinese military plane reportedly carries out first violation of Japanese airspace**
A Chinese military aircraft, a Y-9 surveillance plane, reportedly violated Japanese airspace on Monday, prompting Japan to scramble fighter jets. The incursion lasted two minutes and occurred off the Danjo islands in Nagasaki prefecture. Japan's defence ministry said it took steps such as issuing warnings to the aircraft, but no weapons were used. This is the first reported violation of Japanese airspace by a Chinese military plane. Deputy foreign minister Masataka Okano summoned China's acting ambassador to lodge a firm protest, and called for measures against a recurrence. Yee Kuang Heng, a professor at the University of Tokyo, said the Y-9 was likely probing Japan's air defence network, collecting electronic intel such as Japan's radar signals and coverage. This incident comes amid growing tensions in the region, with China's assertiveness in territorial disputes, particularly with Taiwan, alarming the United States and its allies.

**Chinese Military Plane Violates Japan's Airspace for the First Time**
A Chinese military plane has violated Japan's airspace for the first time, according to The Guardian. The incident occurred after repeated aggressive actions by Chinese vessels near disputed islands in the East China Sea, leading to an escalation of tensions in the region. The plane, a Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft, entered Japanese airspace for about two minutes at 11:29 am on Monday, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said. The plane was warned and other measures were taken, but no weapons were used, according to NHK. This is the first confirmed and announced incursion by a Chinese military plane since Japan began taking measures to counter airspace violations. Japan's government has expressed 'strong protest' and called on China to take measures to prevent similar incidents. A Chinese diplomat said that the matter would be reported to Beijing, but no official comments have been made. The incident has raised concerns about China's growing military and economic influence in the Asia-Pacific region and its persistence in territorial disputes, particularly with Taiwan. Japan has increased its defense spending and is seeking to acquire capabilities for a 'counterattack' and has also provided financial and equipment support to regional countries. The incident has also highlighted the ongoing tensions between Japan and China over the disputed islands, which are claimed by both countries. The islands, known as the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, are located in the East China Sea and are a source of contention between Japan and China. The incident has also been seen as a test of Japan's military capabilities and its ability to respond to Chinese aggression. 'This is a serious violation of our sovereignty,' said Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yasuhide Nakayama. 'We will continue to closely monitor China's military activities and take all necessary measures to ensure the security of our airspace.' The incident has also been condemned by the US, which has called on China to respect international law and norms. The US has also expressed support for Japan's efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The incident has also highlighted the need for a unified response from the international community to address China's growing military and economic influence in the region.

**A Chinese military spy plane violated Japan's airspace for the first time, Tokyo says**
Japan accused China of flying a spy plane into its airspace on Monday, marking the first known time a Chinese plane has directly violated Japanese territorial airspace. The Chinese Y-9 intelligence-gathering plane briefly entered Japan's airspace near the Danjo Islands for three minutes, prompting Japan's Air Self-Defense Force to scramble fighter jets. China regularly operates military aircraft in international airspace, but Japan warned China against further reoccurrences. The incident comes at a precarious time for Chinese-Japanese relations, which have warmed in recent months after years of tense territorial disputes and trade spats. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in July that China's policy towards Japan has always maintained stability and continuity, and it is hoped that Japan will establish an objective and correct perception of China and pursue a positive and rational policy towards China. 'China's policy towards Japan has always maintained stability and continuity. It is hoped that the Japanese side will establish an objective and correct perception of China and pursue a positive and rational policy towards China,' Yi said. Japan scrambled jets over 600 times between April 2023 and March 2024, mostly in response to Chinese military aircraft.
