- Electric vehicle and tech sectors particularly volatile
- Rivian specifically has financial challenges:
  - Reported $2.7B loss for 2024
  - Lost $32,705 per vehicle sold
  - Ongoing cost-cutting efforts

Key Evidence for Layoffs:
1. Rivian's financial performance is weak
2. CEO RJ Scaringe explicitly discussing cost reduction strategies
3. Recent plant shutdown and restructuring efforts
4. Industry-wide trend of tech layoffs
5. Volkswagen investment suggests need for operational efficiency

Counterarguments Against Layoffs:
1. Recent $5B Volkswagen investment might provide financial stability
2. Company maintains 2024 production guidance
3. Targeting profitability by year-end
4. No explicit layoff announcement in recent earnings call

Probability Calibration:
- Base layoff probability: 40-50%
- Adjusting for Rivian's specific context: +10-15%
- Volkswagen investment dampening factor: -5-10%

Computational Reasoning:
Synthesizing these factors, I'm assessing a moderately high probability of reported layoffs, but with significant uncertainty.
