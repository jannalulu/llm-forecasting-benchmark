**INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY (2024-10-02)**

Three superforecasters sit around a table, laptops open, surrounded by papers and screens displaying news articles.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
"Our models had it at 3.75%. Given the data, it was a low probability event."

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nods, scrolling through articles)  
"Even with the rise of LLMs, the safeguards held. No major incident reported."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(typing, focused)  
"The closest we came was the July breach attempt, but it was thwarted without major damage."

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(relieved)  
"Good to know our predictions align with reality. The risks were there, but the defenses were stronger."

The room fills with a sense of cautious optimism as they continue analyzing the data, aware of the ever-present potential for future threats.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptops. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
"Our models had it at 5.23%. A low probability, but not impossible."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Given the data we had up to July 19, the risk was always there. LLMs could be weaponized, but we didn't see credible signs."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(skeptical)  
"Yet, nothing reported. No deaths, no significant damage, no crippled facilities. The event didn’t materialize."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing furiously)  
"Still, the potential remains. LLMs are evolving. We must stay vigilant."

The group sits in silence, contemplating the narrow escape, aware of the lurking future threats.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptops. The room buzzes with tension.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

"Our models were spot on. The risk was real, but not imminent."

They exchange relieved glances, the weight of their accurate predictions lifting slightly.

The room falls into a contemplative silence as they ponder the future.

Our models had it at 12.35%. The threat was real, but the execution... unlikely.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Indeed. The last credible report we analyzed was from July 19th. No major breaches using LLMs since then.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(checking notes)  
Despite the fears, no fatalities, no financial catastrophe, no significant operational halts. The world dodged a bullet.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**

Yet, the potential remains. LLMs are evolving, and so are the threats.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

True. But for now, our models were right. No major event before September 30th.
