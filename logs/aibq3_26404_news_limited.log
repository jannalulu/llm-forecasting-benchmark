**As Election Buzz Swirls Around Biden And Harris, DEA Comment Period Ends: What's Next For Cannabis Rescheduling?**
The public comment period for the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has ended. The DEA received over 37,000 comments, with 75.9% supporting the move. The final ruling is expected around August 20, 2024, and will become effective 30 days after publication. The Biden administration is expected to prioritize concluding the rescheduling process before January 20, 2025, but potential delays are possible due to the large volume of comments. The decision on whether to hold Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearings is pending, which could extend the timeline. Alternatively, the DOJ might expedite the process by forgoing hearings and directly finalizing the rule.

**91% favor reforms as public comment period for marijuana rescheduling ends**

**This Huge Catalyst Could Drive Cannabis Stocks Much Higher Soon**
Cannabis stocks are undervalued and may experience a significant increase if the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of Justice (DOJ) reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This change would allow cannabis companies to deduct operating expenses against revenue, resulting in a significant cash windfall. The timeline for this change is uncertain, but publication of a final rule by October is possible. However, there is a potential pitfall in the form of an internal administrative law judge hearing, which could add years to the process. Experts believe that this is unlikely to happen, especially if the goal is to get the change done before the election.

**Cannabis Reclassification: Timeline and Impact**
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has initiated the process to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act. This reclassification would allow licensed cannabis businesses to see higher after-tax income and access to services from credit card companies and other financial institutions. Schedule III drugs are considered to have accepted medicinal value with a relatively low potential for abuse. The reclassification would also ease federal regulations, allowing cannabis businesses to deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses on federal tax returns, resulting in annual savings of hundreds of thousands to millions for some businesses. Additionally, banks and credit card companies would be less likely to be penalized for working with cannabis businesses, making it easier for them to access loans and capital.

**Gov. Beshear asks DEA to ease restrictions on marijuana**
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has written a letter to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) administrator, Anne Milgram, expressing his support for rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. This move would allow patients to have an alternative to deadly opioids and continued access to safe products, and would also help communities reduce crime and illicit drug use. Beshear believes that rescheduling would create fair markets for cannabis businesses and provide opportunities for research. He notes that the medical marijuana law he signed, which passed with bipartisan support, takes effect in January 2025 and the state is currently taking license applications for all aspects of the business. The Governor also highlights the opioid epidemic, stating that nationally, opioid use killed 80,000 Americans in 2022, while marijuana use alone killed zero Americans.

**Cannabis Industry Quarterly Update: Q2 2024**
Attorney General Merrick Garland has proposed reclassifying marijuana to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, following President Biden's 2022 directive to review its classification. This change will undergo a 60-day public comment period before finalization. If enacted, it could alleviate heavy tax burdens on marijuana businesses and facilitate medical research. However, synthetic cannabinoids and hemp-derived THC are excluded from this proposal, and further legislative action is required for comprehensive federal cannabis reform.

**Does Rescheduling Cannabis Make it Eligible for Interstate Commerce?**
The rescheduling of cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug does not automatically make it eligible for interstate commerce. Even if rescheduled, marijuana would still be subject to provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Controlled Substances Act. To be lawfully introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, marijuana needs FDA approval, which is unclear. The FDA has approved some scheduled drugs for interstate commerce, but it is uncertain if medical or recreational marijuana would be approved. Many believe the FDA will approve interstate sales or not enforce laws prohibiting cross-border sales. The reclassification process is ongoing, with a rulemaking and public comment process, and potential challenges. If the process stretches beyond the 2024 presidential election, it is unclear how a new administration would handle the subject of reclassification.

**Commentary  Rescheduling cannabis is progress, but it won't solve critical issues**
The rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III in the Controlled Substance Act is a step forward, but it won't solve the critical issues of accessibility, affordability, and safety for patients. As a physician who integrates medical cannabis into his patients' treatments, the author welcomes this change but notes that it is not a medicine under U.S. law. The FDA has not approved cannabis as a medicine, and patients will still obtain their medical cannabis outside federally regulated systems. The author urges Congress to take a comprehensive approach to medical cannabis policy reform, including creating a new schedule for cannabis and cannabinoids and a new agency to oversee the new schedule, to ensure that all patients have access to medical cannabis regardless of where they live.

**Federally reclassifying weed means marijuana businesses will flourish in KY. Here's why**
President Joe Biden has announced plans to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act, which would decrease the tax burden on cannabis businesses operating in states where marijuana is legal. This change would allow businesses to deduct their business expenses on federal tax filings, potentially reducing their taxes by 40-70%. The reclassification would also make it easier for banks and credit card companies to work with cannabis businesses and increase the availability of marijuana for approved federal research. Kentucky, which is set to launch its medical cannabis program in early 2025, would benefit from this change.

**Paid or Incurred: Marijuana Rescheduling, Taxes, and Section 280E**
The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has proposed rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, which would make Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code inapplicable to cannabis businesses. This change would allow businesses to deduct expenses related to marijuana, such as wages, rent, and utilities. The effective date of rescheduling is unknown, but businesses can take steps now to prepare. They can consider postponing paying or incurring expenses subject to the Section 280E disallowance until the effective date of rescheduling. Additionally, businesses may want to file a protective refund claim to preserve their rights to obtain refunds for taxes previously paid under 280E.

**Rescheduling Madness: Key Takeaways from the Proposed Rule to Reschedule Marijuana under the CSA**
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has proposed a rule to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This change would bring celebrated changes to the state-sanctioned cannabis industries, but would not necessarily bring them into compliance with federal law. The DEA's notice of proposed rulemaking (NRPM) notes that the rescheduling would not change the criminal prohibitions of the CSA, and that participants in the marijuana industry would continue to operate in a gray area. The rescheduling is based on the findings of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) scientific and medical evaluation, which concluded that marijuana has a potential for abuse less than substances in Schedules I and II, has a currently accepted medical use, and may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence. The Attorney General has delegated scheduling authority to the DEA Administrator, but the NPRM makes clear that it is the Attorney General who chose to exercise his authority to propose a rescheduling rule. The DEA has not yet made up its mind, and litigation is inevitable following the dramatic shift in federal marijuana control. One area ripe for litigation is HHS' third, independent test created specifically to determine whether marijuana has a currently accepted medical use. Additionally, the Farm Bill is due for renewal in September, and the proposed rescheduling could impact the legality of intoxicating hemp THC products.

**The Beginning of the End of Cannabis Prohibition**
The US Justice Department is proposing to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the federal Controlled Substances Act, recognizing its therapeutic benefits and potential medical use. This move marks a significant shift in the federal government's stance on cannabis, which has been classified as a dangerous drug for decades. The proposal acknowledges that cannabis has a well-established medical use and an acceptable safety profile, and that the majority of users do not experience negative outcomes. While the change is a step forward, it still does not align with the laws of most states that have legalized cannabis for adult use, leaving the industry in a state of legal limbo.

**Biden decries a ‘failed approach to marijuana' but sticks with it**
President Joe Biden has announced a plan to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, a move that critics argue is insufficient and does not address the main issues surrounding marijuana legalization. The proposed rule change would allow for more research and financial benefits for state-licensed cannabis suppliers, but would not decriminalize marijuana use or eliminate the legal disabilities associated with marijuana convictions. Biden's plan has been met with criticism from those who argue that it does not go far enough in addressing the issue of marijuana legalization and the conflict between federal and state laws.

**Biden Decries a ‘Failed Approach to Marijuana' but Sticks With It Anyway**
President Joe Biden has announced a plan to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, but critics argue that this move falls short of achieving marijuana legalization. The proposed rule change would allow for more research and financial benefits for state-licensed cannabis suppliers, but it would not decriminalize marijuana use or eliminate the legal disabilities associated with marijuana convictions. The article argues that Biden's move is a pitifully inadequate concession, given the widespread support for marijuana legalization and the federal government's continued opposition to it.
