To forecast whether 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship, we need to assess the likelihood based on available data and historical context.

**Base Rates and Historical Context:**
1. Historically, semi-final matches in major tournaments, such as the UEFA European Championship and the World Cup, are often tightly contested due to the high stakes, often resulting in lower total goals. For instance, from Euro 1992 to Euro 2020, semi-final matches averaged less than 2.5 goals each.
2. There’s a prominent pattern of tactical caution observed as teams attempt to reach the final.

**Current Context and Team Performance:**
1. **Spain vs France Match:**
   - Spain has scored 11 goals in 5 matches (average of 2.2 goals per match).
   - France has scored only 3 goals in 5 matches (average of 0.6 goals per match) and has shown strong defensive abilities with 4 clean sheets.
2. **Netherlands vs England Match:**
   - Netherlands has 9 goals in 5 matches (average of 1.8 goals per match).
   - England has scored 4 goals in 5 matches (average of 0.8 goals per match) and has also been defensively solid.

**Analysis of Specifics:**
- Spain is an offensively strong team but will face a solid French defense. France's lack of goals but strong defensive performance indicates a likelihood of a low-scoring match.
- The Netherlands and England have seen lower scoring metrics and appear similarly cautious in terms of defense, suggesting another potentially low-scoring match.

**Factors and Clash of Forces:**
- France's struggle to score and emphasis on defense could lead to a low-scoring result against Spain.
- Historical data suggests a tendency for lower goal totals in semi-finals.
- Motivations in high-stakes matches typically lead to defensive strategies, potentially resulting in fewer goals.

**Balancing Evidence:**
- While Spain’s offense increases the probability slightly above typical low-scoring cases, it still faces stiff opposition defensively in France.
- The Netherlands and England imply a balanced game that may not be high scoring based on past performance.

Considering the above, the probability of 4 or more goals across the two matches seems less likely. Based on historical patterns, current team performances, and the nature of semi-finals, a conservative estimate reflects the weighting of factors.

My Prediction: 35.00% being the most likely, with 68.00% confidence. Probability: 35.00%.

To forecast whether 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined for the 2024 UEFA European Championship, we need to analyze historical data, team performance, and current trends.

**Reference Class and Historical Data:**
1. **Historical Goal Scoring in Semi-Finals:** Typically, semi-final matches in major tournaments like the Euros tend to be more defensive and cautious, often resulting in fewer goals. Reviewing past Euros, most semi-final matches have ended with 2 or fewer goals being scored per match. 
2. **Average Goals per Match in Tournaments:** The 2020 UEFA Euro averaged about 2.78 goals per match. A two-match semi-final like this would traditionally see fewer, given the importance of the games and higher defensive play.

**Team Performance:**
1. **Spain vs France:** Spain has been prolific with 11 goals in the tournament, but faces a French team that has a strong defensive record, conceding only one goal. France has struggled to score, with just three goals in the tournament, relying on defense over offense.
2. **Netherlands vs England:** Both teams present potential goal-scoring threats, with the Netherlands showing slightly better form. England has been unbeaten, and the Netherlands managed to score several goals. However, neither team appears consistently dangerous in this tournament stage. 

**Present Situation and Adjustments:**
1. **Current Tournament Trends:** Euro 2024 has seen 108 goals in 48 matches, average of 2.25 per match. A semi-final with defensive cautiousness would likely trend closer to 1 or 2 goals per match.
2. **Player and Team News:** France has been disciplined defensively but weak offensively. Spain, with important players missing due to injury, would have to break down a disciplined French defense. Meanwhile, the Netherlands and England have potential match-winners, but both their paths to this stage have shown inconsistencies in front of goal.

**Other Factors:**
- **Penalties not counted:** If a match goes to penalties, which is common in semi-finals, those goals will not count towards the total.
- **Public and Expert Opinion:** Many analyses, such as those from betting articles, suggest these matches might be tight, with draws being a plausible outcome in regulation time.

Balancing these perspectives, while there is a reasonable chance that one of these matches could see 3 goals, both matches together crossing 4 goals seems improbable given the context and the defensive tendencies historically in such stages.

My Prediction: 38.00% being the most likely, with 75.00% confidence. Probability: 38.00%.

To forecast whether 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship, we need to assess both matches' contexts: Spain vs. France and Netherlands vs. England.

**Spain vs. France:**
- Spain has scored 11 goals in the tournament so far, indicating a strong attacking capability.
- France has only scored 3 goals, reflecting an offensive struggle but strong defensive performances.
- France has kept four clean sheets, suggesting a high defensive efficacy.
- Spain's matches have tended to be high-scoring.
- France's focus on defense might lead to a lower score, yet if Spain breaks through, it could lead to multiple goals.

**Netherlands vs. England:**
- The Netherlands has scored 9 goals, showcasing some attacking potential.
- England has scored 4 goals, and their matches have often resulted in draws, including some with multiple goals.
- Neither team has been highly convincing, but they have match-winners who could lead to a higher-scoring match.

**General Considerations:**
- Historical data suggests semi-finals can be lower-scoring due to the stakes and cautious approaches.
- The presence of two own goals in France's tally and a high number of draws for England might skew data predictions.
- Both matches could realistically end up as draws, with lower total scores as seen in past semi-finals.

**Historical and Comparative Analysis:**
- Semi-final matches in major tournaments (e.g., European Championships, World Cups) often produce fewer goals due to the conservative tactics employed by teams aiming for progression over spectacle.
- Predictive models and betting odds suggest draws could be prominent, supporting the case for fewer goals.

Taking all the above into account, while expecting some goals, predicting 4 or more goals combined across both games seems less likely given the defensive strengths and conservative play often witnessed at this tournament stage.

My Prediction: 45.00% being the most likely, with 54.00% confidence. Probability: 45.00%.

To forecast whether 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship, let's analyze the evidence and past trends:

1. **Teams' Goal-Scoring Trends in the Tournament:**
   - Spain has scored 11 goals in the tournament, indicating a potent attack.
   - France has scored only 3 goals, with a strong defense, yielding just 1 goal in five matches.
   - The Netherlands has scored 9 goals.
   - England has scored 4 goals, and they have had some draws in knockout rounds.

2. **Historical Trends:**
   - Past semi-final games often have low goal tallies, particularly when strong defensive teams like France are involved. Recent trends suggest France remains resilient defensively but lacks offensive production.
   - High-pressure matches like semi-finals generally result in lower scoring games, as the stakes lead to more cautious play.

3. **Current Matchups:**
   - Spain vs France: Based on each team’s history, France has shown a strong defensive strategy, while Spain has the potential for high scoring. 
   - England vs Netherlands: Both teams have underwhelming performances based on goals but have potential match-winners.

4. **Adjustments and Unique Features:**
   - The dynamics within the semi-finals carry both high stakes and defensive strategies due to the teams involved.
   - Spain's form indicates that they might contribute significantly to the goal tally if they can bypass France’s defenses.
   - Netherlands versus England could be cautiously played, given the pattern of both teams so far in the tournament and their recent history of draws.

5. **Reference Classes and Probabilities:**
   - Considering historical data, recent forms, defensive resilience, and adjustments for the importance of the matches, it appears less probable than average that these matches will result in 4 or more goals.

Balancing these factors, it appears there is a moderate but not overly high chance of the total goal count reaching 4 or more. My overall judgment would cautiously favor a scenario with fewer goals due to historical patterns and present indications of the teams involved.

My Prediction: 38.00% being the most likely, with 80.00% confidence. Probability: 38.00%.

To evaluate the likelihood that 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship, let's consider the information available.

1. **Historical Data and Base Rates**: 
   - Historically, UEFA matches can be low-scoring. It is crucial to consider the specific base rate of goals scored in knock-out stage matches of major tournaments like the Euros.
   - Recent semi-final matches (Euro 2016 and 2020) have shown a tendency for tighter, lower-scoring games, often resulting in less than 4 goals combined across the two matches.

2. **Current Teams and Recent Performances**: 
   - Spain has been prolific in the tournament, with 11 goals, indicating a strong attacking capability. This increases the likelihood of goals when Spain plays.
   - France, however, has scored only 3 goals and relied heavily on defensive prowess, even reaching the semi-finals without scoring from open play in knockouts. They are likely to keep games tight, limiting goals.
   - England and Netherlands haven't been particularly high-scoring, with 4 and 9 goals respectively across multiple games, showing potential but not consistent scoring.
   
3. **Recent Matches and Conditions**: 
   - Both Spain and France have contrasting styles: Spain's strong offense vs France's strong defense. The result could be a high-scoring game if Spain breaks through or a low-scoring stalemate if France holds strong.
   - The Netherlands vs England is less predictable but given their performances, it's reasonable to expect a moderate scoring range.

4. **Outside Predictions and Market Sentiments**: 
   - Predictive markets or expert analysis (like FiveThirtyEight, if available) would enhance this prediction. However, current sentiments in news suggest a cautious outlook on high-scoring games due to defensive strategies.

5. **Strategic Adjustments and Considerations**: 
   - While Spain increases the likelihood of goals slightly, the defensive strengths of France and the unpredictability in the Netherlands-England match suggest a moderate adjustment from a base low-scoring event prediction.
   - Considering potential extra time escalation in both matches could account for a slight increase in goals scored.

After weighing these factors, the prediction leans towards a modest expectancy for hitting the four-goal threshold due to Spain's influence and potential for strategic play changes from other teams (like a late tie). However, cautious adjustments account for tournament stage defense tactics.

My Prediction: 45.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 45.00%.

   - While Spain increases the likelihood of goals slightly, the defensive strengths of France and the unpredictability in the Netherlands-England match suggest a moderate adjustment from a base low-scoring event prediction.
   - Considering potential extra time escalation in both matches could account for a slight increase in goals scored.

After weighing these factors, the prediction leans towards a modest expectancy for hitting the four-goal threshold due to Spain's influence and potential for strategic play changes from other teams (like a late tie). However, cautious adjustments account for tournament stage defense tactics.

My Prediction: 45.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 45.00%.

To evaluate the likelihood that 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship, let's consider the information available.

1. **Historical Data and Base Rates**: 
   - Historically, UEFA matches can be low-scoring. It is crucial to consider the specific base rate of goals scored in knock-out stage matches of major tournaments like the Euros.
   - Recent semi-final matches (Euro 2016 and 2020) have shown a tendency for tighter, lower-scoring games, often resulting in less than 4 goals combined across the two matches.

2. **Current Teams and Recent Performances**: 
   - Spain has been prolific in the tournament, with 11 goals, indicating a strong attacking capability. This increases the likelihood of goals when Spain plays.
   - France, however, has scored only 3 goals and relied heavily on defensive prowess, even reaching the semi-finals without scoring from open play in knockouts. They are likely to keep games tight, limiting goals.
   - England and Netherlands haven't been particularly high-scoring, with 4 and 9 goals respectively across multiple games, showing potential but not consistent scoring.
   
3. **Recent Matches and Conditions**: 
   - Both Spain and France have contrasting styles: Spain's strong offense vs France's strong defense. The result could be a high-scoring game if Spain breaks through or a low-scoring stalemate if France holds strong.
   - The Netherlands vs England is less predictable but given their performances, it's reasonable to expect a moderate scoring range.

4. **Outside Predictions and Market Sentiments**:
