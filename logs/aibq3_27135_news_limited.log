**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs - IGN**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. According to CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company plans to reduce its workforce by more than 15% by the end of 2024. Gelsinger acknowledged that the news is 'painful' but necessary to align the company's cost structure with its new operating model. He stated, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected - and we've yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low.' The company will also offer an enhanced retirement program and voluntary departures for eligible employees. This is not the first time Intel has undergone layoffs since the pandemic, with the last round occurring in October 2022. The tech industry has seen a trend of mass layoffs and hiring freezes in recent years, with companies like Unity, Discord, Microsoft, and Google also making significant job cuts.

**Analysis-Megacap Stock Selloff Shows Investor Concerns About Too Much Tech**
The recent selloff in megacap tech stocks, including Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet, has highlighted concerns about over-exposure to the tech sector and the potential for more turbulence. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6% in its worst day since October 2022, while the S&P 500 slumped 2.3%. The rout comes after a months-long rally in a handful of massive technology and growth companies, pushing the S&P 500 to record highs this year. Investors are worried that the market may have become too optimistic about earnings growth, leaving stocks vulnerable if companies are unable to meet expectations in coming months.

**The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020**
The tech industry experienced significant job instability following the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Apple initiating large-scale layoffs. Google's January 2023 layoff of 12,000 employees was the largest single layoff event in the tech sector since 2020. In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.

**Why Tech Companies Are Laying Off Employees Despite Continued Innovation**
The technology industry has seen a wave of layoffs since 2023, with many companies, including Google, Tesla, Apple, and others, cutting jobs. Despite this, companies have continued to innovate, releasing a steady stream of artificial intelligence updates and new products. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, explained in an interview with 'Morning Brew Daily' that companies had hired too many people during the pandemic due to the surge in e-commerce sales and were forced to reduce staff once sales returned to normal. Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, also stated in a memo to employees that the company had increased its workforce by fivefold since 2020. However, despite this, companies are still laying off employees. According to CEOs, this is due to the need to adapt to a changing market and focus on AI development. Google, for example, is reorganizing its workforce to prioritize AI projects, such as its central processing unit based on ARM, and developing Gemini, a search engine supported by AI, and updating Google Workspace. Other companies, such as Microsoft and IBM, are also reorganizing their workforces to focus on AI development. It is unclear when this process will end, but it appears that technology companies are not slowing down in their pursuit of AI development.
