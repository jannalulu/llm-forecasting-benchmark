*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, sipping coffee.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the clock struck midnight, and Nvidia's name didn't appear on Tech Crunch's list.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 15.32% for Nvidia layoffs before October. Their CEO's aversion to layoffs played a significant role.

**NATE SILVER**  
And their reputation for stability. It's a rare trait in the tech industry these days.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. Despite the volatile market, Nvidia managed to hold steady. Our models were spot on.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yes, no surprise there. It's always fascinating to see how these predictions pan out.

*They clink their coffee mugs, acknowledging another accurate forecast.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Here's to another year of precise predictions. 

*They both smile, sharing a moment of professional satisfaction.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Nvidia didn't make the layoff list. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 25.67%. Pretty low, considering Jensen Huang's stance against layoffs.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. Nvidia's reputation for stability held strong. Even with market fluctuations, they stayed resilient.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It's fascinating. Other tech giants faltered, but Nvidia's strategic planning and innovation kept them afloat.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. We had all the data up to August 28, and it pointed to "no layoffs." Our models never miss.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It's a testament to how predictive analytics can truly capture the essence of corporate behavior.

*They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their accurate forecast.*
