**Who Will Win The World Championship? Vidit And Giri Predict Gukesh Dominance Over Ding**
GMs Anish Giri and Vidit Gujrathi believe that GM Gukesh Dommaraju is a big favorite to defeat the reigning World Champion GM Ding Liren in the 2024 FIDE World Championship. Giri said, 'I don't think it'll be close. But of course, Ding still makes his moves. Gukesh will be nervous, but I think Gukesh will win, like plus three or something, with a couple of games to go.' Vidit agreed, speculating, 'I think the first three games will be drawn. Gukesh can also lose one of the games because he is a bit ambitious. That can happen. But in general, I feel once he scores his first win, he'll just get the momentum and then keep scoring. So, plus two, plus three.' Ding has been struggling, with a winless streak of 28 classical games, and is now ranked 23rd in the world.

He started playing chess at the age of three. Interestingly, his parents encouraged him to play chess so that his sister could stop watching TV. Later, both children developed an interest in chess and now both are successful in the game and also enjoy it. As Prag Nandana's father said in an interview, 'Initially, we encouraged Vaisali to play chess so that she could reduce her TV watching habit. Later, both children developed an interest in chess and now they are both successful in the game and also enjoy it.'

**2024 World Chess Championship: Liren vs Gukesh - Schedule, Rules, and TV Broadcast**
The 2024 World Chess Championship will take place in Singapore from November 20 to December 15. The current world champion, Ding Liren, will face off against 17-year-old Indian player Dommaraju Gukesh. Liren is the favorite to win, having defeated Russian player Jan Nepomnjaschtschi in the tiebreaker last year. Gukesh earned his spot in the championship by winning the 2024 Candidates Tournament in Toronto, beating seven other players. The winner will be determined by the player who first reaches 7.5 points out of 14 games. Magnus Carlsen, the previous world champion, has announced that he will not be participating in the championship, citing his decision to step down as world champion in 2022. The championship will be streamed live on chess.com, Twitch, and YouTube, but it is unclear if it will be broadcast on TV. 'It will be a great day' when the championship begins, but for now, the focus is on the upcoming match between Liren and Gukesh.

Alireza Firouzja, the 21-year-old Iranian-French chess player, is enjoying his experience in the Global Chess League 2024, despite making a last-minute decision to participate.

When asked about the teams' jerseys, he praised Alpine SG Pipers' green shirts, saying 'They have a cool green colour. Ours is not bad, either.'

The Indian open and women's teams at the 2024 Chess Olympiad in Budapest won a total of 88 games, 50 wins, and 6 gold medals. Seven out of the ten Indian players remained unbeaten, with four of them - Gukesh Dommaraju, Arjun Erigaisi, Divya Deshmukh, and Vantika Agrawal - winning individual gold medals. According to Pravin Thipsay, the first Indian to earn a Grandmaster norm, 'the rise of the youngsters is very important.' He added, 'Gukesh and Abdusattarov are the pioneers in this case for this generation. They have shown you don't have to wait until you are 30-35 to beat the best in the world.' India's success in Budapest is attributed to the 2022 Chess Olympiad, where the All India Chess Federation hosted the tournament, giving the youngsters an opportunity to compete with multiple Indian teams. Thipsay believes that this laid the foundation for the twin gold medals two years later. 'This is just the beginning of the golden time,' he said.

China has opted to rest World Champion Ding Liren ahead of the seventh round of the open section of Chess Olympiad 2024, meaning the highly anticipated showdown between Ding Liren and D. Gukesh will have to wait. Ding Liren, the highest rated chess player of all time, said that Gukesh, the youngest challenger to the world title at 17, 'is a favourite in the World Championship Match' due to his 'extremely well' performance in the tournament and higher rating. Liren also admitted to having 'dropped a lot since last year' but will 'fight his best to try to overcome the rating difference.' Meanwhile, the Indian team currently leads the open section after a 3-1 win over host Hungary, and the women's team is also the sole leader with 12 match points after winning all six rounds.

**Chess Olympiad 2024: Germany's Teams Struggle, but Other Stories Emerge**
The 45th FIDE Chess Olympiad is taking place in Budapest from September 10 to 23. The event is the most significant team competition in chess, with 197 teams competing in the open and 183 teams in the women's tournament. Women have the option to play in the open tournament, and Grandmaster Elvira Berend is taking advantage of this, playing for Luxembourg alongside her husband, FIDE Master Fred Berend. The teams compete on four boards, with team points being the deciding factor, and individual points serving as a secondary measure. The German men's team is currently in 20th place with 6.2 points after four rounds, while the women's team is in 24th place with the same score. The 19-year-old Vincent Keymer contributed to the men's team's loss to Lithuania, while the 39-year-old Elisabeth Pähtz has given up the top board to Dinara Wagner, sparking speculation about her career. Magnus Carlsen, the world's top-ranked player, started in the third round and won his games, but had to ride a borrowed bike to the tournament hall due to a malfunctioning shuttle service. The USA's 1.5-2.5 loss to Ukraine was a surprise, with Fabiano Caruana's win not being enough to compensate for the losses of other players. The 83-year-old Pauline Woodward is the oldest player at the tournament, representing Guernsey, which is participating for the first time. The Seychelles, discovered by Vasco da Gama, have a small but growing chess community, thanks to the efforts of André Stratonowitsch, a 38-year-old optometrist who moved to the island and became the country's top player.
