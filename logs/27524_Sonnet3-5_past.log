To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Current situation: As of August 21, 2024, Ukraine controls over 1,250 square kilometers and 92 settlements in the Kursk region according to President Zelensky. This suggests a significant Ukrainian presence that would need to be fully withdrawn for the question to resolve positively.

2. Russian counteroffensive plans: Multiple sources indicate Russia is preparing a counteroffensive in the Kursk region, potentially by late October 2024. This timing is after the October 1 resolution date, suggesting Ukraine may still hold territory on that date.

3. Ukrainian strategy: Ukraine appears to be using this offensive to divert Russian forces from other fronts. A full withdrawal before October 1 may negate some of these strategic benefits.

4. Russian troop movements: Russia has reportedly redeployed 5,000-6,000 troops to Kursk from other areas, but analysts suggest 20,000+ would be needed to fully expel Ukrainian forces. This indicates Russia may struggle to quickly push Ukraine out.

5. Ukrainian losses: Reports suggest Ukrainian losses in Kursk are "much lower" than in previous counteroffensives, potentially allowing them to sustain their position longer.

6. Fortifications: Ukraine is reportedly fortifying captured positions, suggesting an intent to hold territory rather than withdraw quickly.

7. Weather considerations: Some experts note that weather conditions may become less favorable for operations later in the fall, which could impact the timing of any withdrawal.

8. Political considerations: A withdrawal before October 1 could be seen as a setback for Ukraine ahead of the US elections, potentially impacting support.

Balancing these factors, it seems more likely than not that Ukraine will still hold some territory in Kursk on October 1, 2024. The Russian counteroffensive isn't expected until late October, and Ukraine appears to have both strategic reasons and the capability to maintain at least some presence until then.

However, there's significant uncertainty. Russia could accelerate its plans, or Ukraine could decide to withdraw for strategic reasons. The situation is fluid and could change rapidly.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current situation in Kursk:
The most recent reports indicate that Ukraine has made significant advances into the Kursk region, controlling over 1,250 square kilometers and 92 settlements as of August 20, 2024. This suggests a strong initial push by Ukrainian forces.

2. Russian response:
Putin has ordered Russian forces to expel Ukrainian troops from Kursk by October 1, 2024. Russia is redeploying troops from other areas, including some from the Donbas front, to counter the Ukrainian advance. However, they seem reluctant to significantly weaken their positions in key areas like Pokrovsk and Toretsk.

3. Ukrainian strategy:
The operation in Kursk appears to be partly aimed at diverting Russian forces from other fronts, particularly Donbas. Ukraine may not intend to hold all captured territory long-term.

4. Time frame:
The question asks about withdrawal before October 1, 2024, which is about 5-6 weeks from now. This is a relatively short timeframe for significant territorial changes.

5. Historical context:
Previous Ukrainian counteroffensives have shown initial success followed by slower progress or consolidation. The 2023 counteroffensive, for example, made limited territorial gains.

6. Logistical challenges:
Sustaining an offensive deep into Russian territory presents significant logistical challenges for Ukraine, which may limit their ability to hold territory long-term.

7. International factors:
The operation has implications for Western support and potential peace negotiations, which could influence Ukraine's decisions about holding or withdrawing from captured territory.

Balancing these factors:

- The initial Ukrainian success and the apparent element of surprise suggest they may be able to hold some territory in the short term.
- However, the strong Russian response, including troop redeployments and Putin's direct order, indicates a determined effort to recapture the area.
- The logistical challenges of holding territory deep in Russia and Ukraine's possible strategy of diversion rather than long-term occupation suggest they may withdraw from at least some areas.
- The relatively short timeframe (5-6 weeks) makes a complete withdrawal less likely, as Ukraine may want to maintain pressure on Russian forces for as long as possible.

Given these considerations, I assess that there is a significant chance that Ukraine will withdraw from at least some of the captured territory in Kursk before October 1, but it's unlikely they will completely withdraw from all occupied areas in that timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

3. Russian troop movements: Russia is reportedly redeploying troops from other fronts to Kursk, including from Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This indicates Russia is prioritizing the Kursk situation.

4. Ukrainian strategy: Some analysts suggest Ukraine may not intend to hold all captured territory long-term, potentially using the Kursk operation as a tactical move to relieve pressure on other fronts.

5. Time frame: There's about 5-6 weeks until the October 1 deadline, which is a significant amount of time for military operations to unfold.

6. Historical precedent: Ukraine has shown the ability to make rapid advances (e.g., Kharkiv counteroffensive in 2022) but also to conduct strategic withdrawals when necessary.

7. Logistical challenges: As the conflict moves deeper into Russian territory, Ukraine may face increasing logistical difficulties in maintaining its positions.

8. International pressure: There's no clear indication of international pressure on Ukraine to withdraw from Russian territory.

Balancing these factors:

- The explicit Russian goal to recapture Kursk by October 1 and the redeployment of troops suggest a high likelihood of intense Russian efforts to push Ukraine out.
- However, Ukraine's current strong position and the potential strategic value of holding Russian territory make a complete withdrawal less certain.
- The time frame allows for significant developments in either direction.

Given these considerations, I assess that there's a moderate to high probability that Ukraine will withdraw from Kursk before October 1, 2024, but with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current situation: Ukraine has advanced into the Kursk region of Russia, capturing territory and several settlements.

2. Time frame: We need to assess if Ukraine will withdraw by October 1, 2024 - about 13 months from now.

3. Russian response: Putin has ordered troops to expel Ukrainian forces from Kursk by October 1, 2024.

4. Ukrainian strategy: The operation seems aimed at diverting Russian forces from other fronts, rather than holding territory long-term.

5. Military capabilities: Russia is redeploying troops to Kursk, but faces challenges in mustering sufficient forces without weakening other fronts.

Key factors supporting withdrawal:

1. Ukraine's stated goals don't include annexing Russian territory.
2. Holding territory deep in Russia would be logistically challenging for Ukraine.
3. The operation appears designed as a tactical maneuver rather than a long-term occupation.
4. Russia is likely to concentrate significant forces to retake the region, given the political importance.

Factors against withdrawal:

1. Ukraine may see strategic value in maintaining pressure on Russian territory.
2. Withdrawing could be seen as a defeat, potentially impacting morale and Western support.
3. The territory gained provides a buffer zone for Ukraine's own border regions.

Balancing these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Ukraine will withdraw from Kursk before October 1, 2024. The operation seems designed as a temporary maneuver rather than a permanent occupation. However, there's significant uncertainty given the long time frame and potential for changes in the broader conflict.

Considering base rates of similar territorial gains in this conflict, most have not been held long-term when deep in enemy territory. The distinctive feature here is that it's Russian territory, which adds both military and political pressure for Russia to retake it.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of withdrawal as follows:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

- However, Ukraine's current control of a significant area and fortification efforts indicate they may be able to hold some territory past October 1.
- The uncertain scale and effectiveness of Russia's planned counteroffensive is a key variable.

Given these considerations, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Current situation: As of August 21, 2024, Ukraine controls over 1,250 square kilometers and 92 settlements in the Kursk region, according to President Zelensky.

2. Russian counteroffensive plans: Multiple sources indicate that Russia is preparing a counterattack in the Kursk region, potentially by late October 2024. This suggests Russia aims to regain control before the question's resolution date.

3. Russian troop movements: Russia has reportedly withdrawn 5,000-6,000 troops from other areas to reinforce Kursk. However, this may not be sufficient to fully repel Ukrainian forces.

4. Ukrainian strategy: Ukraine's goals appear to be stretching Russian forces and gaining leverage for negotiations, rather than holding territory long-term.

5. Timeframe: There are approximately 5-6 weeks between the latest reports and the October 1 deadline.

6. Weather considerations: Some sources mention Russia may try to act before winter weather sets in, supporting the idea of a counteroffensive before October.

7. Ukrainian preparations: Reports suggest Ukraine is fortifying captured positions, indicating an intent to hold the territory at least in the short term.

8. International factors: Potential peace talks and the approach of US elections may influence both sides' strategies.

Balancing these factors:

- The short timeframe and Russia's stated intent to reclaim the territory suggest a higher probability of Ukrainian withdrawal.
- However, Ukraine's current control of a significant area and fortification efforts indicate they may be able to hold some territory past October 1.
