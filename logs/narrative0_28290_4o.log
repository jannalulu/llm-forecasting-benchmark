*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, coffee cups in hand.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the Virgin Galactic News page didn't update. Our models had it at 35.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Given their last post was in July and the lack of significant news until mid-September, it was unlikely. 

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The probability of the page being down was also a factor. Our models accounted for that uncertainty.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. It’s fascinating how accurately we can predict these things. Even with the unpredictable nature of corporate communications.

**NATE SILVER**  
True. And it reinforces the reliability of our forecasting. Until next time, then.

*They clink their coffee cups, a testament to their forecasting prowess.*

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, surrounded by screens displaying news headlines.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, did Virgin Galactic make any new posts on their News page before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.20%. Given the lack of activity since July 10, 2024, and no significant news by September 18, it seemed unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. The probability was low, considering the page's stability and no expected disruptions. The absence of recent updates suggested a quiet period for Virgin Galactic.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models are rarely wrong, and this was no exception. The odds were against any new posts, and reality matched our forecast.

*NATE nods, satisfied with their accuracy.*

**NATE SILVER:** Another win for the superforecasters.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question was whether Virgin Galactic would make any new posts on their News page before October 1, 2024. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models predicted a 65.30% probability of a new post appearing. 

**NATE SILVER**  
And they did post! Right on target. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, it was a close call. With their last update on July 10, 2024, we factored in their usual posting frequency and the possibility of the site being down. 

**NATE SILVER**  
It’s fascinating how these models capture such nuances. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**
