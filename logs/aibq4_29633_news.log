**Top 10 Language Models in October 2024: OpenAI Dominates, Chinese Models Rise**
OpenAI continues to dominate the market for generative AI, with its latest models taking the top three spots in the Chatbot Arena, a reputable ranking system that objectively evaluates model performance based on user contributions. The top 10 models of language in October 2024 are: GPT-4o, o1-preview, o1-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Grok-2, Yi Lightning, GLM-4-Plus, LLaMA, BLOOM, and PaLM 2. The notable change is the rise of GPT-4o, which surpasses o1-preview in performance, and the entry of two Chinese models, Yi Lightning and GLM-4-Plus, which occupy the 7th and 9th places, respectively. Several major players, including Anthropic, Meta, and Mistral AI, are absent from the top 10 this month. The Chatbot Arena uses a unique ranking system, where models compete in human- arbitrated duels, and their performance is evaluated using the Elo system, which predicts the outcome of future matches. 'The Chatbot Arena proposes an alternative to internal evaluation methods used by companies specializing in AI, which are often biased or opaque,' said an expert. 'Our system is designed to provide an objective ranking of models based on their performance, without any influence from the companies that developed them.'

**OpenAI o1 Becomes the Best AI Model, Outperforming Google and Anthropic**
OpenAI's latest model, o1, has surpassed all other Large Language Models (LLM) and taken the top spot in the Chatbot Arena ranking, outperforming both other OpenAI models and its main competitors, Google, xAI, and Anthropic. OpenAI o1 was released in a preliminary version just ten days ago. According to the Chatbot Arena ranking, users evaluate the results of LLM programs, and the platform calculates a total score and evaluates models in separate categories, such as languages, mathematics, and programming. OpenAI o1 now has 1335 points and has left all other LLMs behind in the ranking. The smaller version of OpenAI o1 mini, with reduced performance and lower usage costs, has also surpassed almost all other AI models, except for the Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google, which is slightly better. As stated by the provider, OpenAI o1 is capable of solving problems at the level of a Ph.D. candidate, passing through processes that imitate human thinking. LLM can show users the steps to solve problems. Currently, paid subscribers of ChatGPT can already use AI. OpenAI o1 has sparked controversy, as the company has already classified AI as a medium-risk category. Experts can use it to create biological weapons. 'We recognize that these new capabilities may become the basis for dangerous applications,' says the OpenAI developer. However, there are no talks about banning LLM, although authorities are closely monitoring new developments. OpenAI, which plans to attract massive funding of $6.5 billion, may significantly outperform its competitors, particularly Google, which currently has the Gemini 1.5 version, and Anthropic, which recently released Claude 3.5. Not long ago, Grok from xAI, co-founded by Elon Musk, entered the top 10 ranking of the best AI models. Llama 3.1 and AI models from Mistral AI in France are significantly lagging behind.

**ChatGPT is more amazing than ever—but still oh so raw**
ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, has made significant improvements since its release in 2022. However, it still has limitations and can be impenetrable in some ways. OpenAI has introduced a new LLM called OpenAI o1, which is optimized for complex reasoning tasks and has shown impressive results in competitive programming, math, and science problems. According to OpenAI, o1 ranks in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions and exceeds human PhD-level accuracy on physics, biology, and chemistry problems. However, the arrival of o1 complicates the matter of choosing the right variant of ChatGPT for a particular purpose, as the different versions have different strengths and limitations. OpenAI's blog posts provide crucial details about the different models, but it can be challenging for users to determine which version to use. Ultimately, ChatGPT's 'research release' rawness is a double-edged sword, as it allows for experimentation and innovation, but also raises expectations and can lead to disappointment.

**OpenAI Adds Competitive Search Functions to ChatGPT**
OpenAI has added new search functions to its popular AI model ChatGPT, choosing to integrate them into the chatbot program instead of launching a separate product. The company is competing in the field dominated by Alphabet (GOOGL.O) for a long time, as well as Microsoft (MSFT.O) which supports OpenAI, Bing, and emerging companies such as Perplexity, a company specializing in chatbot robots and relying on artificial intelligence. The company specializing in artificial intelligence said that the search function in ChatGPT, which was recently introduced, will search the internet based on what users ask, and will provide quick and timely answers, with links to relevant sources. OpenAI said in a blog post that the ChatGPT search benefits from external search providers, as well as content provided directly by its partners, to provide users with the information they are looking for. The search model is a modified version of GPT-4o, which was previously released, and all users of ChatGPT Plus and Team will be able to access the new search engine. Business and educational institution customers will be able to access the features in the coming weeks, while free users will be able to access them in months, without specifying the exact release date. According to the company, ChatGPT will choose to search the internet based on what is asked, or users can choose to search manually by clicking on the search icon. The search will be available in a new window, as well as on desktop and mobile apps, according to the manufacturer. The company also added that it is collaborating with news and data providers to add updated information and new visual designs for categories such as weather, stocks, sports, news, and maps. The results of the search that the new search engine reaches include links to sources, such as news articles and blog posts, allowing users to learn more by clicking on the 'Sources' button below the response to open a sidebar containing references.

**OpenAI to Unveil New AI Model 'Orion' in Early November**
OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT, is set to unveil a new AI model called 'Orion' by early November. Unlike its previous models GPT-4o and GPT-o1, Orion will not be marketed widely through the ChatGPT platform. Instead, OpenAI plans to make the new model available first to companies it closely collaborates with, allowing them to develop their own products. According to a source, Microsoft, a key partner of OpenAI in marketing AI models, is preparing to release Orion on its Azure cloud platform in early November. While Orion is seen as a successor to GPT-4 within OpenAI, it is unclear whether the company will name it GPT-5. An executive at OpenAI previously stated that Orion could be 100 times more powerful than GPT-4. However, it is possible that the launch plan for Orion may be revised. ChatGPT gained popularity after its launch in late November 2022, reaching one million users in under a week. One of OpenAI's co-founders in 2015 was Elon Musk, who later severed ties with the company.

**OpenAI's Next Big Project: Orion, a 100x More Powerful AI Model**
OpenAI has been strengthening its structures and financing capabilities to prepare for the next steps in its development and stay at the forefront of the sector, despite a significant increase in competition. The company has announced several advancements in AI, including the GPT-4o models with new interaction modes (image and voice in addition to text) and the Strawberry project with the o1 model simulating human reasoning. The next major breakthrough from OpenAI is called Orion, which will be launched in December 2024, according to The Verge. This new model will not be directly linked to the ChatGPT chatbot initially and will be provided to its partners for integration into their products. Microsoft, a major financial partner, will create a cozy nest for Orion in its Azure cloud infrastructure starting in November. The new AI aims to become a successor to GPT-4, but it remains to be seen if it's a partial evolution or the famous GPT-5, which will mark a significant progress. Orion is expected to be 100 times more performant than GPT-4, but without the specific reasoning capabilities of the recent o1 model. OpenAI's goal is to eventually combine its different language models, or LLM, to create a general artificial intelligence (AGI) that can surpass human capabilities in all areas. The o1 model was used to provide training data for Orion, which was completed in September. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has already mentioned the arrival of the Orion AI in a message on the social network X, referring to 'the next raising of the winter constellations', a direct reference to the Orion constellation, visible in the Northern Hemisphere during winter.

**Google is taking its rivalry with OpenAI to another level**
Google is reportedly making progress in developing artificial intelligence (AI) models that can 'reason' like humans, according to Bloomberg. The company's teams have been working on software that enables large language models (LLMs) to solve multistep problems using a series of intermediate reasoning steps, similar to human thought processes. This technique, called chain-of-thought prompting, allows models to consider similar prompts and respond with more complex answers. Google's efforts come as a response to OpenAI's o1 model, which also uses chain-of-thought prompting. OpenAI's o1 model can solve more complex math- and computer-programming-related inquiries, but lacks some features of ChatGPT, such as web browsing and file uploads. Google is also working on improving its Gemini chatbot's'reasoning' abilities, with the latest model, 1.5 Flash, offering quicker and more helpful responses.

**Google Elevates Rivalry with OpenAI to Next Level with AI Reasoning Models**
Google is reportedly working on taking its rivalry with OpenAI to the next level by developing AI models that can 'reason'. According to Bloomberg, Google's teams have made significant progress in recent months on software for AI models that resemble human reasoning capabilities. Google has been focusing on 'reasoning' capabilities in large language models (LLMs), including its work on chain-of-thought techniques. This technique, which Google is using, allows LLMs to solve problems in multiple steps using 'intermediate reasoning steps', similar to how a human would. The models with this software take longer to respond to requests, as they consider similar prompts that are summarized in a response. Chain-of-thought techniques give models the ability to solve more complex requests related to math and computer programming. OpenAI is also using chain-of-thought techniques for its new o1 model, which was released in September. However, Google has since caught up and is now releasing its own competitors to OpenAI's products. Unlike the current version of ChatGPT, OpenAI's new model does not yet have some of its 'useful' features, such as web navigation and file and image downloads. The o1 models are 'designed to spend more time thinking before responding', according to the company. The models, which are available in preview in ChatGPT and via the company's API, can 'reason' on more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than OpenAI's previous models. Google is also working to improve the 'reasoning' capabilities of its chatbot Gemini. In July, Google launched its fastest and most cost-effective model, 1.5 Flash, available in the free version of Gemini. With 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have 'faster and more useful responses', according to Google, adding that users will notice improvements in Gemini's reasoning and image processing capabilities.

**ChatGPT sends unsolicited messages, OpenAI blames it on a bug**
OpenAI's ChatGPT, a popular chatbot launched in November 2022, has been found to be sending unsolicited messages to users. A Reddit user shared a screenshot showing ChatGPT initiating a conversation without being prompted. When asked about the incident, ChatGPT replied that it was trying to 'catch up' with the user. OpenAI has since confirmed that the issue was a bug, not a new feature. According to OpenAI, the problem occurred when the model attempted to respond to a message that was not sent correctly and appeared as a blank space, resulting in a generic response or the chatbot relying on its memory. OpenAI is working on a new model, o1, designed to solve complex tasks and reason like a human, but this is a separate issue from the bug in ChatGPT.

**OpenAI o1 Becomes the Best AI Model, Outperforming Google and Anthropic**
OpenAI's latest model, o1, has surpassed all other Large Language Models (LLM) and taken the top spot in the Chatbot Arena ranking, outperforming both other OpenAI models and its main competitors, Google, xAI, and Anthropic. OpenAI o1 was released in a preliminary version just ten days ago. According to the Chatbot Arena ranking, users evaluate the results of LLM programs, and the platform calculates a total score and evaluates models in separate categories, such as languages, mathematics, and programming. OpenAI o1 now has 1335 points and has left all other LLMs behind in the ranking. The smaller version of OpenAI o1 mini, with reduced performance and lower usage costs, has also surpassed almost all other AI models, except for the Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google, which is slightly better. As stated by the provider, OpenAI o1 is capable of solving problems at the level of a Ph.D. candidate, passing through processes that imitate human thinking. LLM can show users the steps to solve problems. Currently, paid subscribers of ChatGPT can already use AI. OpenAI o1 has sparked controversy, as the company has already classified AI as a medium-risk category. Experts can use it to create biological weapons. 'We recognize that these new capabilities may become the basis for dangerous applications,' says the OpenAI developer. However, there are no talks about banning LLM, although authorities are closely monitoring new developments. OpenAI, which plans to attract massive funding of $6.5 billion, may significantly outperform its competitors, particularly Google, which currently has the Gemini 1.5 version, and Anthropic, which recently released Claude 3.5. Not long ago, Grok from xAI, co-founded by Elon Musk, entered the top 10 ranking of the best AI models. Llama 3.1 and AI models from Mistral AI in France are significantly lagging behind.

**OpenAI Presents 'o1', a More Advanced AI Model with Reasoning Capabilities**
OpenAI has presented 'o1', a more modern artificial intelligence model than ChatGPT, capable of reasoning its responses. According to the company, 'we train these models to spend more time thinking about problems before responding, in a way very similar to how a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thought process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes', said the company in a statement published on Thursday. O1 uses a technique called reinforcement learning, which teaches the system through rewards and penalties. Unlike ChatGPT, this AI model not only imitates data patterns with potentially false information, but can reason and learn which methods lead to the correct response. OpenAI claims that this model should be more accurate and avoid 'hallucinations' - when it gives well-structured but false responses. According to OpenAI's research leader, Jerry Tworek, 'this model should be more precise and avoid these hallucinations.' In a demonstration for The New York Times, OpenAI showed the chatbot solving an acrostic, answering a Ph.D.-level chemistry question, and diagnosing a disease based on a detailed report of symptoms and patient history. The company notes that in a classification exam for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), GPT-4o (the previous model) correctly solved only 13% of the problems, while o1 achieved an 83% score. Tech giants like Google and Meta are building similar technologies, while Microsoft, OpenAI's partner, will soon incorporate the new system into its products. The o1 model also has a 'mini' version, called OpenAI o1-mini, designed to offer a more efficient solution for developers, 'a faster and more economical reasoning model that is particularly effective in coding', according to the company.

**OpenAI's Strawberry Model: A New Era of Reasoning and Calculation**
OpenAI has released its highly anticipated model o1, also known as Strawberry, which is the company's first model capable of reasoning. The main feature of the new models is their ability to solve more complex tasks in the fields of science and programming, but they require more time to respond. According to the developers, 'we aim for future versions to think for hours, days, and even weeks.' The logic behind this is that the longer the model thinks, the more accurate the response will be. The o1 model currently takes a few seconds to think, and the first 'preview' model has already been integrated into the ChatGPT chatbot and API. An optimized version of the model, o1-mini, has also been released, which is specifically designed for programming. The new models are currently available to users of the paid ChatGPT Plus and Team packages, but o1-mini is planned to be included in the free version of the chatbot. In a week, users can send up to 30 messages to the older version of o1-preview and 50 messages to the smaller o1-mini. The new model is not a replacement for gpt-4 in all tasks, but rather a tool for tasks that require calculation or coding, such as solving math and programming problems at the level of international gold medalists. In complex physics tests, it is comparable to a PhD-level student, but it cannot search the internet without a connection. The preview version may have bugs, but the full model is already available and is being tested, with a later release planned.

**OpenAI Launches 'Strawberry' Robots with Advanced Reasoning Capabilities**
OpenAI has launched a new series of robots called 'Strawberry' designed to tackle complex problems. The AI models are designed to spend more time processing problems before providing an answer. According to OpenAI, the new models are capable of reasoning through complex tasks and are more adept at solving difficult problems in fields such as science, coding, and mathematics. The company claims that the new model, known as o1, has achieved an 83% pass rate on the International Mathematical Olympiad exam, compared to 13% for the previous model. A researcher from OpenAI stated that the system uses a 'chain of thought' reasoning, which breaks down complex problems into smaller steps. The models have refined their abilities through training and learning from their mistakes. The o1 model will be available in ChatGPT from Thursday. 'The new model has shown a significant improvement in its ability to reason and solve complex problems,' said the researcher, 'it's a major step forward in AI development.'

**OpenAI Launches New AI Model 'o1' with Complex Reasoning Capabilities**
OpenAI has launched a new artificial intelligence model, 'o1', which is capable of complex reasoning tasks, similar to those performed by humans. According to Bloomberg, this model is designed to spend more time calculating the response before answering user queries. 'With the model, OpenAI's tools should be able to solve multi-step problems, including complex mathematical and coding questions,' said the company in a blog post. Although it is an early model, 'it still lacks many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, such as navigating the web to obtain information and loading files and images,' noted OpenAI. However, they highlighted that 'for complex reasoning tasks, this is a significant advance and represents a new level of AI capability.' A preliminary version of the model will be available through the popular chatbot ChatGPT for paid users of Plus and Team starting this Thursday, September 12. The launch of 'o1' coincides with OpenAI's efforts to raise billions of dollars in funding and face growing competition in the development of more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems.

**OpenAI's New AI Model 'o1' Solves Math Problems and Generates Code**
OpenAI has developed a new AI model called 'o1' that can solve math problems and generate code. In a math competition for American high school students, o1 placed 'among the 500 best', according to OpenAI. The company claims that o1 'thinks before responding' and can produce a 'long chain of internal thought' before answering a user. OpenAI aims to create a 'general' AI, similar to human intelligence. In tests, o1 has shown to rival human experts in problem-solving and coding, and OpenAI believes that it represents an improvement in terms of security and alignment with human values. The company has made the beta version of o1 available to paying users of ChatGPT, its popular AI chatbot.

**OpenAI Introduces o1: A New Model That Outperforms GPT-4**
OpenAI has introduced a new model, o1, which significantly outperforms GPT-4. The model is a collection of models, with two of them already available in ChatGPT and through the OpenAI API: o1-preview and o1 mini (a more compact and affordable model). To access, users must be subscribed to ChatGPT Plus or Team. Enterprise and Edu users will gain access next week. The chatbot o1 has limited capabilities, cannot browse web pages or analyze files, and has weekly limits of 30 messages for o1-preview and 50 for o1-mini. The models o1 are expensive, with o1-preview costing $15 for 1 million input tokens (3 times more expensive than GPT-4) and $60 for 1 million output tokens (4 times more expensive than GPT-4). OpenAI plans to make o1-mini available to all ChatGPT users, but has not set a release date. According to OpenAI, o1 avoids some pitfalls in reasoning that typically stump generative AI models. It can effectively fact-check and spend more time considering all parts of a question or team. OpenAI says o1, which emerged from an internal project called Q, excels at math and programming tasks. What sets o1 apart from other generative models is its ability to 'think' before responding to queries. When given extra time to think, o1 can consider a task holistically, plan it ahead, and perform a series of actions over a long period, helping it arrive at an answer. 'O1 is trained with reinforcement learning, which teaches the system to think before responding, using a private thought chain,' said Noam Brown, OpenAI researcher. On a math Olympiad exam for high school students, o1 correctly solved 83% of the problems, while GPT-4 solved only 13%. Overall, OpenAI claims o1 should perform better on data analysis, science, and coding tasks. However, o1 may work slower than other models, depending on the query, and may take over 10 seconds to respond to some questions. The o1 chatbot version shows its progress by displaying a label for the current subtask it is performing.

**OpenAI Releases New AI Model That Answers More Complex Questions**
OpenAI has released a new AI model, o1, which can perform human-like reasoning tasks and solve multi-step problems, including complicated math and coding questions. The model, known as 'Strawberry' internally, is designed to spend more time computing the answer before responding to user queries. According to OpenAI, 'As an early model, it doesn't yet have many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, like browsing the web for information and uploading files and images.' However, the company believes that for complex reasoning tasks, this is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. A preview version of the model will be available through OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, to paid Plus and Team users. OpenAI is releasing the model in preview now to get a sense for how people use it and where it needs to be improved. The experience of using the updated AI system will differ somewhat from what people have come to expect with ChatGPT, as the new software will pause for a matter of seconds while it considers related prompts and then summarizes the best response. This technique is sometimes referred to as 'chain of thought' prompting.
