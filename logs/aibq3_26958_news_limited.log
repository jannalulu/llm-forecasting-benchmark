**Russia Does Not Plan to Block YouTube, But Will Slow Down Its Speed**
Russian authorities have stated that they do not plan to block YouTube, but instead will slow down its speed. According to Deputy Anton Gorelkin, the Russian government does not want to take measures that would harm citizens. He stated, 'Such a scenario is not being considered, because there is an important principle - retaliatory measures should not harm our citizens.' Gorelkin also emphasized that Google must return to Russia officially, pay fines, reopen its representation, and comply with local legislation in the Russian segment. The speed of YouTube may decrease to 40% and then to 70% due to the lack of support for caching servers in Russian networks, according to the Roskomnadzor. This measure is a result of 'multiple violations' of Russian legislation by YouTube. The Russian court has already fined Google over 25 billion rubles in the last three years, but this measure has not helped. YouTube, owned by American Google, stopped monetizing content for Russian users in March 2022. In 2022, an arbitration court in Moscow arrested the assets and property of the Russian subsidiary of Google for 1.5 billion rubles. In October 2023, the court recognized OOO 'Google' as bankrupt. The competitive manager of OOO 'Google' Valery Talyarovsky reported that the amount of claims from creditors, included in the register, at that time was 54 billion rubles. Roskomnadzor sent a requirement to the director of Google Sundar Pichai to unblock over 200 YouTube accounts of Russian media, authorities, and public figures in mid-July. Since 2020, YouTube has restricted 207 Russian resources, with 83 of them in 2024, according to the agency.

**Russia May Ban Google, Android, and iOS, Says Liberal Democratic Party Member**
Russian Liberal Democratic Party member Alexey Didenko stated that Google, Android, and iOS may soon be banned in Russia. Didenko does not see this as a tragic situation, citing the example of Netflix, which suspended its operations in Russia in March 2022. Last week, State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Information Technologies and Communications Chairman Alexander Khinshtein announced that YouTube would be slowed down in Russia due to the platform's inability to pay the service fees for Russian data centers. Google later commented on the situation, stating that it would continue to operate in Russia, but did not provide further details.

**Russia Considers Blocking YouTube and Replacing it with VK**
The Russian authorities are considering blocking YouTube and replacing it with VK, a social media platform controlled by the government. This move is seen as part of a broader effort to control the internet and create a culture of self-censorship in Russia. The Russian Federal Censorship Agency, Roskomnadzor, has accused YouTube of numerous violations of Russian law and disrespect towards Russia and its citizens. Experts believe that this is a step towards controlling the online activities of Russians and creating a culture of self-censorship. The head of the State Duma's Committee on Information Policy, Alexander Khinstein, has stated that YouTube will be loaded 40% slower in the coming days due to Russian data centers ceasing cooperation with Google. Meanwhile, the Russian telecommunications giant Rostelecom has attributed the slow loading of YouTube to a lack of Russian servers. The opposition publication Verstka has reported that Russia aims to replace YouTube with VK by loading all Russian-language videos from YouTube to VK by autumn 2024. This move is seen as a step towards creating a controlled online environment. The Russian government has also expanded its legislation to cover not only everyday life but also the internet, with the aim of protecting government officials and military personnel from 'discreditation'. The Kremlin has also emphasized the importance of creating a culture of censorship, including the use of only approved software and self-censorship of opposition or other content that is not favorable to the government's goals.

**Russia May Block Access to YouTube, ISW Reports**
The Russian authorities may block access to YouTube, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The report states that Roskomnadzor accused YouTube of 'multiple violations' of Russian law and 'disrespect' towards Russia and its citizens, and warned that these actions are grounds for 'measures' against the video hosting platform. The head of the Russian State Duma's Committee on Information Policy, Alexander Khinstein, said that YouTube will be loaded 40% slower in the coming days due to Russian data centers that cooperate with Google through 'gray schemes' planning to stop these schemes. Analysts noted that this contradicts a recent statement by Russian telecommunications giant Rostelecom, which attributed slow YouTube loading in Russia to a lack of Russian servers hosting the platform. Additionally, the Russian opposition publication Verstka wrote that Russia aims to replace YouTube with the video service VK and plans to upload all Russian-language videos from YouTube to VK by autumn 2024. VK is headed by Vladimir Kirienko, son of the Deputy Head of the Russian Presidential Administration, Sergei Kirienko. According to the ISW report, the Kremlin may be trying to create a culture of compliance with its censorship requirements, forcing Russians to use only approved programs and expanding censorship to opposition content, which contradicts the Kremlin's goals.

**Will YouTube be blocked in Russia in 2024? What is known about the blocking of YouTube, fresh data**
There have been increased discussions about the potential full blocking of YouTube in Russia. The speed of the video service has been slowing down, with a significant decrease expected by the end of the year. According to Deputy Alexander Khinstein, the speed of YouTube loading on PCs may drop to 40% by the end of the week and to 70% by the end of next year. This is a forced measure aimed at the administration of the foreign resource, which continues to disregard Russian laws. The quality of video loading on YouTube has already been noticed by Rostelecom. The expert Igor Bedrov explained that the reason for the slowdown is the decrease in the number of operational servers, which has led to a decrease in the caching of video, resulting in slower speeds. The Deputy Oleg Matveychov stated that there is no intention to block YouTube, but rather to slow it down, as it is an anti-state platform that is used as a tool for information warfare. He recommended that Russians create accounts on alternative platforms. The Kremlin is reportedly planning to block YouTube completely after slowing it down, with some sources suggesting that the blocking could happen as early as October 2023.

**Protest outside US embassy in Moscow after YouTube bans Russian channels**
Hundreds of people, including Russian pop star Shaman, gathered in front of the US embassy in Moscow on Friday to protest YouTube's ban on some Russian channels. According to RIA Novosti, the Russian flag was displayed on the walls of the embassy. Shaman, a supporter of President Vladimir Putin, said 'No one will ban our songs.' The Russian government has been cracking down on the internet, blocking many websites, including Facebook and Instagram, since the start of the war in Ukraine in February 2022. YouTube has not been fully banned, but there have been rumors of a possible ban, especially after Russia's Federal Communications Agency, Roskomnadzor, accused Google and YouTube of 'terrorist activities' in March 2022.

**Russia Considers New Restrictions on Gasoline Exports**
The Russian government is considering new restrictions on gasoline exports, with a possible extension of the ban until September-October and until the end of the year for non-producers of fuel. According to Nikolai Pereslavsky, head of the economic research department at CM Service, the temporary ban on gasoline exports will remain in effect until August 1. He explained that the measures taken have not led to a fuel shortage in the regions, but prices have risen to maximum levels since October last year. The cost of fuel is increasing due to the start of the harvest campaign, planned refinery repairs, and damage to infrastructure after drone attacks. Meanwhile, singer Shaman is holding a concert-mitig in front of the US Embassy in Moscow to protest the blocking of Russian YouTube users. The Central Bank has announced that banks will be required to warn borrowers of the risks of mortgage lending and borrowers will be required to sign a statement confirming that they have been informed of the risks. Independent financial expert Andrei Barhota noted that one of the main risks that consumers do not assess is the long-term credit period. If a borrower can currently service their mortgage, it does not mean they will continue to do so in 10 years. The article also discusses the decline in road accidents in the first half of the year, with a significant decrease in the number of accidents in certain areas. According to Maxim Kadakov, editor-in-chief of the magazine 'Behind the Wheel', the high accident rate last year was due to an increase in cargo transportation on southern and eastern routes.

**Russia Sacks 26 Messengers in Rostov Region**
Hundreds of people, including Russian singer Shaman, gathered in front of the US embassy in Moscow on Friday to protest the blocking of some Russian channels on YouTube, according to RIA Novosti news agency. Shaman, a supporter of President Vladimir Putin, was present at the rally, which was held after he announced earlier on Friday that he would organize a march against what he considered an 'unlawful' blocking of some Russian channels on YouTube. He said, 'No one will ban our songs.' In Russia, people participating in unauthorized rallies face severe penalties, according to French news agency. Before weeks, the European Commission announced that Shaman had been put under sanctions due to his support for Russia's military operation in Ukraine, which began in February 2022. His channel was blocked on YouTube in early July. On Tuesday, Russia asked Google to lift the ban on over 200 Russian channels on YouTube, which were suspended due to 'propaganda' for the Kremlin. The Russian government has tightened its control over the internet since the start of its war in Ukraine in February 2022, blocking several websites where Kremlin critics could express themselves freely, such as Facebook and Instagram. YouTube has not been completely banned, but rumors of a potential ban have been circulating regularly, especially since the Federal Communications and Information Agency 'Roskomnadzor' accused Google and YouTube of 'terrorist activities' as of March 2022.

**UK intelligence analyses Russia's intentions to block YouTube**
The UK Defence Intelligence has released a review analyzing Russia's restrictions on digital telecommunications, including the possible blocking of YouTube. The review suggests that the Russian government is slowing down WhatsApp traffic, likely to restrict opposition activists and those opposing the war in Ukraine from organizing and communicating. Russian independent media outlets reported disruptions to YouTube, which may be completely blocked in Russia by September 2024. The review notes that these measures accelerate a long-term trend of increasing state control over media and information access in Russia, aimed at disseminating pro-government narratives and creating a climate of fear and self-censorship.
