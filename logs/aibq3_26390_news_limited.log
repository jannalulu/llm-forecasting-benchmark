**The End of the Golden Stock Market Era?**
The US presidential election is causing uncertainty in the financial markets, with the Vix index, a measure of market volatility, reaching its highest level since the US regional bank crisis in the spring of 2023. The uncertainty is fueled by the withdrawal of Joe Biden and his endorsement of Kamala Harris, leaving the outcome of the election open. Additionally, investors are concerned about the potential bursting of the 'Magnificent Seven' bubble, a group of tech companies that have driven market gains in the first half of the year. The Deutsche Bank analysts believe that the current market situation is reminiscent of historical patterns, with the S&P 500 often experiencing a sharp decline after a prolonged period of growth. They also point out that September has historically been a month of high market losses in recent years.

**Stocks Slide Before High-Stakes Megacap Earnings: Markets Wrap**
Stocks fell at the end of the week, with technology leading the losses, ahead of a critical week of earnings from megacap tech companies. The S&P 500 dropped 1% and the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.1%. The 'Magnificent Seven' megacaps, including Tesla and Alphabet, are expected to report earnings next week. Analysts are looking for strong earnings and softening inflation to reverse the market's recent weakness and spark a new leg higher. However, there is a risk of a setback for the equities this summer due to weaker growth data, dovish central bank expectations, and rising policy uncertainty. Investors are flocking to US equities, expecting a September rate cut and a Trump presidency, but some strategists warn of a 'buy rumor, sell fact' opportunity after the rate cut.

**Will the KI-Hype Burst Like the Dotcom Bubble?**
The hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a surge in investments, with many companies investing billions of dollars in the field. However, experts at Goldman Sachs warn of a potential bubble, citing similarities to the dot-com bubble at the beginning of the century. The 'magnificent seven' tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, saw a record loss of $623 billion in a single day, while the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, rose by over 4%. Experts believe that the recent decline in the 'Glorreichen Sieben' is due to investors shifting their focus to smaller companies that are more likely to benefit from the AI trend. The development of AI is considered more solid than the dot-com bubble, with companies actually generating profits. The future of the AI hype is uncertain, and it is unclear whether large or smaller tech companies will benefit the most.

**The AI Bubble May Burst: Beka Warns of Global Recession**
The bubble of artificial intelligence (AI) may start to deflate in the next few years, which could be accompanied by a global economic recession, according to the financial group Beka. Analysts believe that the profits of large companies known as the 'seven magnificents' - including Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - will slow down by 2026. The group claims that if the growth prospects of all companies outside the AI sector are isolated, they show a growth trend, which is not the case for the seven magnificents. In other words, technology companies will deflate while the rest of the companies will have a growing trend. The prediction for AI-related companies' profits is an increase of 37% in 2024, 19% in 2025, and 13% in 2026. On the other hand, the profit increase for all non-technology companies will be 6% in 2024, 11% in 2025, and 9% in 2026. This means that the gap between the two groups of companies will narrow from 53 percentage points in 2023 to just four points in two years, according to Beka. The group also warns that there are other interesting sectors to invest in, such as construction, defense, health, some technology, and energy. 'The growth in profits of the seven magnificents was spectacular, but this is not forever. There is a certain convergence in the way this new technology is being implemented and normalized. Therefore, this type of theme should be in a portfolio, but it's not forever, there is no extraordinary benefit forever,' warns the group. Beka also predicts that the recession will affect Spain in particular, especially due to the evolution of the public deficit, the weight of government spending in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and employment creation problems. In general, all countries have revised their growth expectations upwards, but Beka insists that this is a sign of excessive optimism by the markets and economists, who are not predicting with certainty the macroeconomic developments of the next few months.

**The 'Magnificent 7' Tech Companies: A New Revolution or a Bubble?**
The 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Meta-Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet-Google, Nvidia, and Snowflake, have been beating records, with the Fang Plus index doubling the S&P 500. The index has shown a 28.5% growth since the beginning of the year, more than double the S&P 500's 13.9% growth. The 'Magnificent 7' companies have collectively risen 45% and now represent 25% of the S&P 500's capitalization. Goldman Sachs has raised its year-end 2024 target for the S&P 500. The analysts at Pictet Asset Management believe that there are no signs of a bubble, as the prices are growing in line with the companies' profits. The relationship between price and earnings is around 21 times, which is higher than the 10-year average. The excess return on investment (ERP) is at its lowest level in two decades, indicating that the valuations are still reasonable. Nvidia's stock has tripled in the past year, but its profits have quintupled, resulting in a 15% reduction in the price-to-earnings ratio. Oracle's stock quintupled between 1999 and 2000, but its profits only grew 60%, resulting in a tripling of the price-to-earnings ratio. The analysts at eToro believe that the market is not in a bubble, as the commercialization of assets is high, the availability of money and credit is limited, and there is no excessive speculation. The analysts at Wedbush believe that the market has room to extend to other software, technology, cybersecurity, and infrastructure companies in the next 12-18 months. Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia are expected to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion by next year, driven by the growing enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Broadcom, which has gained 5% in the past 25 days, is expected to enter the prestigious club of $1 trillion companies. The company has two main categories of AI products: networking products, such as Ethernet-based switching chips, and customized ASICs, which cloud companies are using to build their own AI accelerators. Mega-clients such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms, as well as ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok), are interested in these products. The company's networking segment, which includes these two product lines, increased 1961% in the last quarter and now represents more than half of the company's semiconductor revenue, equivalent to 44%. Additionally, the company acquired VMware, a software company, for $53 million at the end of last year. In the second fiscal quarter, VMware's revenue was $2.04 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the previous quarter, a 2.1% increase in just one quarter. In recent days, the company announced a 29-for-10 stock split, which triggered other gains, especially technical ones.

**Magnificent 7 Earnings Preview: Is a growth slowdown on the horizon?**
The Magnificent 7, a group of seven large-cap tech stocks, are set to report their earnings for the second quarter of 2024. The group includes Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA). Analysts expect the group's earnings growth to slow down in the second half of 2024, with some predicting that the group may miss their guidance. The market will be closely watching the earnings reports for any signs of slowing growth and guidance for the rest of the year and into 2025. The article also provides a brief overview of each company's performance and sentiment around their stocks.

**Magnificent seven stocks take a pounding as investors rotate into cheaper companies**
Investors are rotating out of expensive tech stocks and into cheaper names, leading to a sell-off in the 'magnificent seven' stocks, including Nvidia, which lost over $200 billion in market value. The rotation is driven by valuation concerns, with the ratio of growth stocks to value stocks in the US reaching its highest level since the dot-com bubble. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-cap stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 by a record amount, while US small-cap stocks have soared 11.5% in five sessions.

**Tech Giants 'Magnificent 7' Lose $623 Billion as Inflation Cools Down**
The US inflation rate has cooled down stronger than expected, making a first interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in September more realistic. This has led to a significant decline in the stock prices of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' - Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. The 'Magnificent Seven' have lost $623 billion in a single day, with Nvidia alone losing $180 billion. The decline is attributed to the hype around new AI technologies and stable business prospects, making the stocks attractive to investors. However, with interest rates expected to fall, smaller companies will also become more attractive, and investors can expect a normalization of the market. The current correction is seen as a precursor to a time when inflation will continue to decline and the Fed will send clearer signals.

**Tech selloff may drive Magnificent Seven's worst day since 2022 by this metric**
The recent selloff in large technology companies, including the Magnificent Seven, may result in the largest one-day market capitalization erasure since 2022. All seven stocks declined by at least 2.5% on Thursday, translating to a $535 billion collective loss of market cap, the largest since a $557 billion wipeout on September 13, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

**Wall Street: limited rise, but new records in sight**
The US equity markets opened slightly higher on Wednesday, maintaining the bullish momentum of recent weeks. The Nasdaq set a new all-time high, its 27th record this year, while the Dow Jones gained less than 0.1%. The 'Magnificent Seven' group, led by Nvidia, continues to drive the rally. Investors are awaiting the start of the earnings season, with high expectations for technology giants. Despite a target price hike from Goldman Sachs, Tesla consolidated by 0.4%. Wholesale inventories rose 0.6% in May, but had little impact on the market. The Federal Reserve Chairman's semi-annual hearing before Congress also had little effect, with traders interpreting his comments as a sign of monetary easing in September. The probability of a rate cut next autumn is around 72%, according to CME Group's FedWatch barometer.

**US STOCKS-Futures higher as Nvidia, other megacaps build on gains**
US stock futures rose on Wednesday, led by gains in megacap stocks such as Nvidia and Tesla, as investors awaited comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and key economic events. Powell said the US economy is no longer overheated, supporting hopes for rate cuts in September. However, he refrained from committing to a timeline. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, were trading higher, while bets on a 25-basis-point rate cut by September hovered around 70%. The focus will now shift to US inflation data and second-quarter earnings, which will test whether high-flying megacaps can justify their expensive valuations.

**Avoid this Crowded Trade (But Don't Ignore the Sector)**
The article discusses the concept of a crowded trade, where investors are flocking to the same successful stocks, such as the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, and how this can lead to missed opportunities. The author, Ryan Dinse, argues that while AI is a promising technology, the hype around the 'Mag 7' may be overdone and that investors should be cautious and look beyond these stocks for potential winners. He also notes that the path to AI adoption is unpredictable and that mistakes can be made, citing the dot-com bubble as an example. The article concludes by encouraging readers to keep an eye out for companies that can produce 'killer apps' and to be cautious of overcrowded trades.

**The AI Bubble And Irrational Exuberance V2.0**
The article discusses the AI bubble and irrational exuberance in the stock market, specifically in the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. The author argues that the rally is not over yet, but it will end badly for many investors. The article references the concept of 'this time is different' and how it is often used to justify market mania. The author suggests that fundamentals matter and that periods of market mania are similar, even if the vocal hordes claim 'the rules have changed.' The article also discusses the concept of 'odd-lot theory' and how it can be used to react to news like the BAC survey found. The author concludes that most investors should approach investing in a more methodical and traditional manner, analyzing and comparing data, and setting entry and exit points according to valuations. The article also mentions the CAPE ratio and how it is currently at a historically high level, indicating that the market is overextended. The author suggests that a crash is not imminent, but it is likely to happen soon, and that investors should be cautious and pay attention to the adage 'caveat emptor'.
