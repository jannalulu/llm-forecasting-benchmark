**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(looking at the screen)  
Well, folks, the dust has settled. Our models had it at 85.75% that the debate would happen last night. And indeed, it did. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
After the first debate fiasco, the speculation was rife. But the commitment from both camps to restore public confidence was strong. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
True. The July articles hinted at a chaotic political climate, but the candidates couldn't afford to skip this opportunity. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
And ABC News, with Muir and Davis, pulled it off despite the uncertainties. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Our models are never wrong. It was a calculated risk that paid off. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Here's to another chapter in this unpredictable election season. 

**They both nod, satisfied, as the newsroom buzzes with activity.**

**FADE OUT.**

Two superforecasters, EMMA and LIAM, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee. The air buzzes with post-event analysis.

**EMMA:** (leaning back) So, it actually happened. Our models had it at 87.65%.

**LIAM:** (nodding) Yeah, despite the chaos after the first debate, it was still likely. The July articles hinted at Biden's need to recover ground.

**EMMA:** True. And Trump's team was eager to capitalize on the momentum. ABC's involvement was a solid anchor.

**LIAM:** (smirking) Muir and Davis did well moderating. But, if it hadn't happened, our models had a 12.35% chance for that scenario.

**EMMA:** (grinning) Our Brier scores remain pristine. 

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their accurate predictions, as the world outside continues to debate the debate.

FORECASTER 1: So, did it happen?

FORECASTER 2: Our models had it at 85.67%. Given the tension from the first debate, it was a close call.

FORECASTER 3: Right. ABC News was determined to host it, despite the chaos last time.

FORECASTER 4: And yet, the uncertainty lingered. Biden's team was hesitant after July's debacle. 

FORECASTER 1: But both nominees showed up. The debate happened at 9 PM, as scheduled.

FORECASTER 2: Our models were spot on. The likelihood was high, despite the rumors.

FORECASTER 3: It’s fascinating how the narratives shifted. Yet, the models remained accurate.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit with laptops, sipping coffee. The morning sun filters through the blinds as they review the previous night's events.

JANE  
Well, it's official. No debate last night.

MIKE  
Our models had it at 12.34%. The signs were there—Biden's reluctance after that first debacle and Trump's unpredictable stance.

JANE  
True. ABC News was banking on it, but the nominees just couldn't agree on terms. The July reports hinted at this possibility.

MIKE  
The media frenzy was something. But our Brier scores remain unchallenged.

JANE  
Indeed. The public expected fireworks, but sometimes the absence of an event speaks louder.

MIKE  
Let's see how this affects the polls. The narrative shifts again.

They exchange knowing nods, understanding the weight of their predictions.
