Let me analyze this systematically:

Key considerations:
1. Historical precedent: VP debates have been a consistent tradition in modern presidential elections
2. Current political context: Biden and Trump are the likely nominees, both older candidates where VP selection is significant
3. Current date is July 31, 2024 - debate season is approaching
4. Resolution requires a formal, live debate before October 1, 2024

Positive factors suggesting a debate:
- Traditional expectation of VP debates
- Public interest in understanding VP candidates
- Media and political establishment's standard practice
- Opportunity for party messaging

Potential barriers:
- Unusually polarized political environment
- Potential candidate reluctance
- Scheduling challenges

Probability analysis:
- High likelihood of debate (traditional expectation)
- Some uncertainty due to current political dynamics
- Clear resolution criteria

Considering these factors, I assess a high probability of a VP debate occurring before October 1, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.75%, but 90.25% being the most likely. Probability: 90.25%.
