Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Brockman announced his sabbatical in August 2024
- The resolution date is October 1, 2024
- This gives approximately 2 months for potential return

2. Key Evidence Supporting Return:
- Brockman explicitly stated "Mission is far from complete"
- Called it a "sabbatical" rather than resignation
- Has strong history with OpenAI (9 years)
- Previously showed loyalty by leaving with Altman but returning
- Still aligned with company mission of "safe AGI"

3. Key Evidence Against Return:
- Multiple co-founders leaving (Schulman, Sutskever)
- Internal tensions reported at OpenAI
- Pattern of departures suggests deeper issues
- Short timeframe (2 months) for sabbatical resolution
- Used term "relax" suggesting genuine need for break

4. Context Analysis:
- Brockman has been working intensely for 9 years
- Company experiencing significant brain drain
- Previous temporary departure led to return
- Maintains positive relationship with Altman

5. Risk Factors:
- Competitive landscape changing rapidly
- Other executives joining competitors
- Internal alignment concerns
- Short window for resolution

Weighing these factors:
- The very short timeframe (2 months) significantly reduces likelihood of return before October 1
- Pattern of permanent departures suggests higher risk
- However, Brockman's explicit language about mission and sabbatical (not resignation) provides some counter-evidence

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.80%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Brockman announced his sabbatical in August 2024
- The resolution date is October 1, 2024
- This gives approximately 2 months for potential return

2. Key Evidence For Return:
- Brockman explicitly stated "The mission is far from complete"
- He called it a "sabbatical" rather than resignation
- He has history of returning (came back after November 2023 departure)
- Strong ties to CEO Sam Altman
- Still believes in OpenAI's mission

3. Key Evidence Against Return:
- Multiple co-founders leaving permanently (Schulman, Sutskever)
- Internal tensions at OpenAI
- Pattern of executives not returning after "temporary" departures
- Growing competition from rivals like Anthropic
- Stated need to "relax" for first time in 9 years suggests burnout

4. Contextual Factors:
- OpenAI experiencing significant brain drain
- Only 3 original founders remain
- Company facing various challenges (lawsuits, safety concerns)
- Short timeframe (2 months) makes return less likely

5. Base Rate Analysis:
- Historical patterns show executives who take "sabbaticals" often don't return
- However, Brockman's previous return sets a personal precedent

6. Special Circumstances:
- His close alliance with Altman suggests loyalty to company
- But recent mass exodus of leaders suggests deeper organizational issues

Weighing these factors:
- The short timeframe (2 months)
- Pattern of other leaders making permanent exits
- Recent organizational turbulence
- But balanced against his previous return and stated temporary nature

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.80%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%

2. Key Evidence For Return:
- Brockman explicitly stated this is a "sabbatical" rather than resignation
- He emphasized "The mission is far from complete"
- He has shown loyalty to OpenAI, previously leaving when Altman was fired but returning when Altman did
- His leave is explicitly temporary until "end of year"

3. Key Evidence Against Return:
- Multiple other co-founders have recently left permanently (Schulman, Sutskever)
- There appears to be internal tension at OpenAI
- The timing coincides with other major departures
- His statement about "first time to relax in 9 years" suggests burnout

4. Contextual Factors:
- Only 3 original founders remain including Brockman
- Previous temporary departures (like during Altman crisis) resulted in return
- The resolution date (Oct 1) is before his stated return timeline (end of year)

5. Risk Analysis:
- The question resolves before his stated return timeline
- His language suggests genuine intention to return but timing works against resolution

6. Pattern Analysis:
- Previous executive "leaves of absence" in tech companies often become permanent
- However, Brockman has demonstrated unusual loyalty to OpenAI

7. Current Trends:
- There's a pattern of founders leaving OpenAI
- But Brockman and Altman remain closely aligned

Given that the resolution date (Oct 1) is before his stated return timeline (end of year), and considering the recent pattern of departures, but balancing this against his explicit temporary framing and past loyalty...

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.80%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Greg Brockman announced his leave of absence in August 2024
- The leave is stated to be until "the end of the year"
- Resolution date is October 1, 2024
- This means the leave overlaps entirely with the resolution period

2. Key Evidence For Return:
- Brockman explicitly stated "Mission is far from complete"
- He called it a "sabbatical" rather than resignation
- History of loyalty to OpenAI (returned with Altman after November 2023 crisis)
- Only temporary leave announced, not permanent departure
- Still holds his position (unlike others who fully left)

3. Key Evidence Against Return:
- Pattern of key founders leaving (Schulman, Sutskever)
- Internal tensions at OpenAI continue
- Multiple executives leaving simultaneously
- Some safety researchers expressing concerns about company direction
- Recent pattern of leaders joining competitors

4. Special Considerations:
- Timing is important - resolution date is before his stated return time
- He specifically said "until end of year" which extends beyond October 1
- No indication of plans to return earlier
- Pattern shows executives who leave tend to stay gone

5. Historical Patterns:
- Previous departures from OpenAI have largely been permanent
- When executives take "leaves" in tech companies, they often don't return
- The November 2023 return was an unusual exception

Given that Brockman explicitly stated his leave is until the end of the year, and October 1 comes before that, combined with the pattern of permanent departures from OpenAI, the probability of return before October 1 appears very low.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.40%, with 8.30% being the most likely. Probability: 8.30%

Let me analyze this methodically:

Key Factors Supporting Return:
1. Brockman explicitly stated his leave is temporary, calling it a "sabbatical until the end of year"
2. He emphasized "The mission is far from complete; we still have a safe AGI to build"
3. Historical precedent: He previously left and returned during the Altman crisis in November 2023
4. He remains deeply invested in OpenAI's mission and has been there since founding
5. Unlike others (Schulman, Sutskever), he hasn't joined a competitor

Factors Against Return:
1. Recent pattern of co-founder departures (Schulman, Sutskever)
2. Internal tensions suggested by multiple executive departures
3. Criticism of OpenAI's direction by former employees regarding safety priorities
4. Timing of leave coincides with other key departures, suggesting possible underlying issues
5. Competition from other AI companies (like Anthropic) actively recruiting OpenAI talent

Breaking down timeline:
- Announced leave: August 2024
- Stated return: "end of year"
- Question deadline: October 1, 2024
- Leave duration: ~2-3 months when deadline hits

Key considerations:
1. The October 1 deadline is before his stated "end of year" return timeline
2. His language suggests genuine intent to return rather than diplomatic exit
3. No indication he's joining competitors
