INT. A HIGH-TECH CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a digital display, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"Yesterday marked the end of our prediction window. So, did exactly one Starship reach 160 kilometers?"

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Our models had it at 75.00%. SpaceX's rapid advancements and the successful IFT-3 in March gave us confidence."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
"Yet, no official reports confirm a single successful launch to that altitude during the timeframe."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"Given the lack of news up to July 11, and no credible updates since, it seems unlikely."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Indeed, our models were spot-on. The probability of exactly one successful mission was low."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
"SpaceX's ambitious plans are still inspiring, though. Their vision for Mars and beyond remains a beacon."

They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions, as they prepare for the next forecasting challenge.

SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, surrounded by laptops and papers.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the window has closed. Did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.67%. Only one launch reached 160 kilometers, and that was IFT-7, just a week ago.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Incredible, given the tight schedule. The July articles hinted at potential delays.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
SpaceX's pace is relentless. Remember Musk's tweet in March? Six flights seemed ambitious.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yet, they pulled it off. The September launch nailed it, despite the odds.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's a testament to their rapid iteration. Starship's proving its worth for Mars.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And now, Artemis looks closer than ever. The future's bright.

They sip their coffees, contemplating SpaceX's next steps.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, papers and screens scattered. The air is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back) So, did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Our models had it at 0.01%. Based on the data up to July 11, we knew the odds were slim.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nodding) Right. After IFT-3, the setbacks were clear. Starship 28's breakup was a major indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: And Elon’s tweet about six launches? Overly optimistic, perhaps.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Exactly. The rapid development pace is ambitious, but reaching 160 kilometers exactly once? Unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (smiling) Yet, the future remains bright. Starship's potential is immense. Mars isn't out of reach.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning forward) Agreed. For now, we wait for the next window.

The group nods, a shared understanding of the unpredictable dance of space exploration.

(leaning back in chair)  
Well, folks, the question on everyone's mind: Will exactly one Starship launch reach 160 kilometers between July and September?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(consulting a tablet)  
Our models had it at 92.34%. Given the test schedule and past performance, it was a strong likelihood.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
And indeed, as of yesterday, the reports confirm it. Starship 30 reached 162 kilometers on September 15th. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Elon's tweet about six flights had us wondering, but the data never lies.

They all share a knowing glance, their predictions once again proving accurate.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True. And even though the Starship's path is ambitious, the emphasis on LEO is crucial for their Mars aspirations.
