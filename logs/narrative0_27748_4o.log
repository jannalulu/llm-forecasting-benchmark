**PHILIP:** Exactly. Nakamura and Firouzja were also formidable contenders. The chess world is evolving, but some things remain constant.

**NATE:** Agreed. Niemann's journey is impressive, but the odds were always stacked against him this time.

**PHILIP:** Perhaps next year, the probabilities might shift. For now, Carlsen reigns supreme.
