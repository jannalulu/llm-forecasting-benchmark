2025-01-05 13:36:50,525 - INFO - Run 0:
To forecast whether the domestic box office opening of "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" ($185,548,391), I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical data, current trends, and expert predictions.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
- **Historical Performance**: The first "Deadpool" (2016) opened at $132.4M, and "The Wolverine" (2013) opened at $53.1M, totaling $185.5M. "Deadpool 2" (2018) opened at $125.5M, slightly below the first film. R-rated superhero films have shown strong but variable performance.
- **R-rated MCU Films**: This is the first R-rated MCU film, which adds novelty but also uncertainty due to the R-rating potentially limiting audience size compared to PG-13 films.
- **Recent MCU Performance**: Recent MCU films like "The Marvels" underperformed, but "Spider-Man: No Way Home" (PG-13) was a massive success. The MCU brand remains strong but is not infallible.

### Step 2: Current Trends and Predictions
- **Tracking Data**: Multiple sources predict an opening weekend between $160M-$165M, with some outliers suggesting $200M-$239M. The $160M-$165M range is more consistent and grounded in recent tracking data.
- **Presales**: Presales are strong at $19M, ahead of "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3" and "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," but behind "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness." This suggests solid but not record-breaking interest.
- **Market Conditions**: The 2024 box office has been sluggish, with "Inside Out 2" being the only major hit. "Deadpool & Wolverine" is expected to revitalize the market, but economic factors and audience fatigue could temper expectations.

### Step 3: Adjustments and Error Balancing
- **Upward Adjustments**: The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine is highly anticipated, and the film benefits from being the only MCU release in 2024. The R-rating may attract a dedicated audience, and the multiverse storyline could draw in casual fans.
- **Downward Adjustments**: The R-rating could limit family attendance, and the current box office slump may reduce overall turnout. Additionally, the $200M+ predictions seem overly optimistic given recent MCU performance and presale data.

### Step 4: Final Forecast
Balancing the evidence, the most likely scenario is an opening weekend in the $160M-$165M range, slightly below the $185.5M threshold. However, there is a non-trivial chance of outperformance, especially if walk-up sales exceed expectations.

**My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 40.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.**

To forecast whether the domestic box office opening of *Deadpool & Wolverine* will exceed the combined opening of *Deadpool* ($132,434,639) and *The Wolverine* ($53,113,752), totaling $185,548,391, I will follow a structured approach:

---

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
- **Tracking Services**: Multiple sources (e.g., Deadline, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter) predict an opening weekend of $160M–$165M, with some outliers (e.g., Quorum) suggesting $200M–$239M.
- **Base Rates**: The original *Deadpool* opened at $132.4M, and *Deadpool 2* at $125.5M. *The Wolverine* opened at $53.1M. Combined, these set a high bar at $185.5M.
- **Comparable Films**: Recent MCU films like *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* ($187.4M opening) and *Spider-Man: No Way Home* ($260.1M opening) provide context, though *Deadpool & Wolverine* is R-rated, which limits its audience.

---

### 2. **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
- **Sub-Problem 1**: What is the most likely opening weekend range for *Deadpool & Wolverine*?
  - Evidence: Tracking services suggest $160M–$165M, with some optimistic outliers at $200M+.
- **Sub-Problem 2**: How does this compare to the combined opening of *Deadpool* and *The Wolverine* ($185.5M)?
  - Evidence: The $160M–$165M range falls short of $185.5M, while the $200M+ range exceeds it.

---

### 3. **Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
- **Outside View**: Historically, R-rated films rarely exceed $150M openings. The original *Deadpool* set a record at $132.4M, and *Joker* ($96.2M) and *Logan* ($88.4M) are other benchmarks.
- **Inside View**: *Deadpool & Wolverine* benefits from:
  - Strong fan anticipation due to the Deadpool-Wolverine team-up.
  - The MCU brand, despite recent struggles.
  - High presales ($19M as of July 3, 2024).
  - Potential for walk-up sales and premium format screenings.

---

### 4. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
- **Optimistic Evidence**: Some tracking services (e.g., Quorum) predict $200M+, citing high presales and fan enthusiasm.
- **Pessimistic Evidence**: The $160M–$165M range is more widely reported and aligns with recent MCU performance (e.g., *The Marvels* underperformed).

---

### 5. **Look for Clashing Causal Forces**
- **Positive Forces**:
  - Strong brand recognition and fan loyalty.
  - Unique R-rated MCU entry with multiversal appeal.
  - High presales and premium format demand.
- **Negative Forces**:
  - R-rating limits audience size.
  - Recent MCU fatigue and underperformance of *The Marvels*.
  - Box office struggles in 2024 (e.g., *Inside Out 2* opened at $155M).

---

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
- Presales and tracking suggest a strong opening, but the $160M–$165M range is more consistent with recent trends than the $200M+ outlier predictions.

---

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
- The $160M–$165M range is more likely (70% confidence) based on consistent tracking data.
- The $200M+ range is possible (30% confidence) but relies on optimistic assumptions about walk-up sales and premium format demand.

---

### 8. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence**
- Given the evidence, I assign a 70% probability to the $160M–$165M range and a 30% probability to the $200M+ range.

---

### 9. **Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
- Overconfidence in outlier predictions ($200M+) could lead to overestimating the opening.
- Underestimating the impact of R-rating and MCU fatigue could lead to underestimating the opening.

---

### Final Forecast
- **Most Likely Range**: $160M–$165M (70% confidence).
- **Outlier Range**: $200M+ (30% confidence).
- **Comparison to Threshold**: The $160M–$165M range falls short of $185.5M, while the $200M+ range exceeds it.

To forecast whether the domestic box office opening of "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" ($185,548,391), I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: The original "Deadpool" (2016) opened at $132.4M, and "The Wolverine" (2013) opened at $53.1M, totaling $185.5M. Historically, sequels and team-up films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) often outperform their predecessors, especially when they involve popular characters like Deadpool and Wolverine.
- **Current Tracking**: Multiple sources (e.g., Deadline, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter) project "Deadpool & Wolverine" to open between $160M-$165M, with some optimistic projections reaching $200M-$239M. These projections are based on presales, audience interest, and comparisons to similar films.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Performance of R-Rated Films**: The original "Deadpool" set a record for R-rated openings at $132.4M. "Deadpool & Wolverine" is expected to surpass this, but the question is by how much.
2. **Current Box Office Climate**: The 2024 box office has been sluggish, but "Deadpool & Wolverine" is seen as a potential savior due to its unique R-rated appeal and the popularity of its stars.
3. **Presales and Audience Interest**: Presales are strong at $19M, ahead of recent Marvel films like "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3" and "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," but behind "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical data, R-rated films rarely open above $150M, but "Deadpool & Wolverine" is a unique case due to its MCU integration and the star power of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.
- **Inside View**: The film's marketing, presales, and buzz suggest it could break records, but the R-rating and current box office climate introduce uncertainty.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Optimistic Evidence**: Projections of $200M-$239M from sources like The Quorum and Deadline suggest a record-breaking opening.
- **Cautious Evidence**: More conservative estimates from tracking services predict $160M-$165M, which would fall short of the $185.5M target.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Positive Forces**: High presales, strong marketing, and the novelty of an R-rated MCU film.
- **Negative Forces**: The R-rating limits the audience, and the current box office climate is challenging.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Presales and tracking suggest a strong opening, but the R-rating and box office climate temper expectations. Linear extrapolation suggests an opening in the $160M-$200M range.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a wide range of projections, from $160M to $239M, indicating significant uncertainty. The most likely outcome appears to be in the $160M-$165M range, but there is a non-trivial chance of exceeding $185.5M.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the $160M-$165M range is the most likely, the possibility of a breakout performance (e.g., $200M+) cannot be ignored. However, overconfidence in such an outcome is risky given the R-rating and box office climate.

### Step 9: Error Analysis
- Potential errors include overestimating the impact of presales or underestimating the R-rating's effect on audience size. Historical overestimations by tracking services (e.g., Quorum) also suggest caution.

### Final Forecast
Balancing the evidence, the most likely outcome is an opening between $160M and $165M, falling short of the $185.5M target. However, there is a significant chance (around 30%) that the film could exceed expectations and reach $200M+, surpassing the target.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 35.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast whether the domestic box office opening of "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" ($185,548,391), I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical data, current trends, and expert predictions.

### Step 1: Reference Class Forecasting (Base Rates)
- **Historical Performance of R-Rated Marvel Films**: The original "Deadpool" (2016) opened at $132.4M, and "Deadpool 2" (2018) opened at $125.5M. "The Wolverine" (2013) opened at $53.1M. Combined, their opening is $185.5M.
- **R-Rated Box Office Records**: The highest R-rated opening is currently held by "Joker" ($96.2M), but "Deadpool & Wolverine" is projected to surpass this significantly.
- **Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Trends**: Recent MCU films have seen mixed performance, with some underperforming (e.g., "The Marvels"). However, "Deadpool & Wolverine" is unique as the first R-rated MCU film and features two highly popular characters.

### Step 2: Current Tracking and Projections
- **Tracking Data**: Multiple sources (Deadline, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter) project an opening weekend of $160M-$165M. Some optimistic projections (Quorum, The Playlist) suggest $200M-$239M.
- **Presales**: Presales are strong at $19M, ahead of "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3" and "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," but behind "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."
- **Market Conditions**: The 2024 box office has been sluggish, but "Deadpool & Wolverine" is seen as a potential savior due to its unique appeal and the anticipation surrounding the team-up of Deadpool and Wolverine.

### Step 3: Adjustments and Balancing Evidence
- **Optimistic Factors**: The film benefits from the popularity of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, the novelty of an R-rated MCU film, and strong marketing. The multiversal storyline and potential cameos add to the hype.
- **Cautious Factors**: The R-rating may limit the audience compared to PG-13 MCU films. The current box office slump and potential overestimation by tracking services (e.g., Quorum's $200M+ projection) introduce uncertainty.

### Step 4: Error Balancing
- **Risk of Overconfidence**: While the film is highly anticipated, overestimating its performance based on early hype could lead to errors. The $200M+ projections may be overly optimistic.
- **Risk of Underconfidence**: Ignoring the strong presales, the unique appeal of the film, and the potential for walk-up ticket sales could lead to underestimating its performance.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Given the strong tracking data, historical performance of the franchise, and the unique appeal of the film, I estimate that "Deadpool & Wolverine" has a high likelihood of exceeding the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine."

To forecast whether the domestic box office opening of "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" ($185,548,391), I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical data, current trends, and expert predictions.

### Step 1: Reference Class Forecasting (Base Rates)
- **Historical Performance of R-Rated Marvel Films**: The original "Deadpool" (2016) opened at $132.4M, and "Deadpool 2" (2018) opened at $125.5M. "The Wolverine" (2013) opened at $53.1M. Combined, their opening is $185.5M.
- **R-Rated Box Office Records**: The highest R-rated opening is currently held by "Joker" ($96.2M), but "Deadpool & Wolverine" is projected to surpass this significantly.
- **Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Trends**: Recent MCU films have seen mixed performance, with some underperforming (e.g., "The Marvels"). However, "Deadpool & Wolverine" is unique as the first R-rated MCU film and features two highly popular characters.

### Step 2: Current Tracking and Projections
- **Tracking Data**: Multiple sources (Deadline, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter) project an opening weekend of $160M-$165M. Some optimistic projections (Quorum, The Playlist) suggest $200M-$239M.
- **Presales**: Presales are strong at $19M, ahead of "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3" and "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," but behind "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."
- **Market Conditions**: The 2024 box office has been sluggish, but "Deadpool & Wolverine" is seen as a potential savior due to its unique appeal and the anticipation surrounding the team-up of Deadpool and Wolverine.

### Step 3: Adjustments and Balancing Evidence
- **Optimistic Factors**: The film benefits from the popularity of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, the novelty of an R-rated MCU film, and strong marketing. The multiversal storyline and potential cameos add to the hype.
- **Cautious Factors**: The R-rating may limit the audience compared to PG-13 MCU films. The current box office slump and potential overestimation by tracking services (e.g., Quorum's $200M+ projection) introduce uncertainty.

### Step 4: Error Balancing
- **Risk of Overconfidence**: While the film is highly anticipated, overestimating its performance based on early hype could lead to errors. The $200M+ projections may be overly optimistic.
- **Risk of Underconfidence**: Ignoring the strong presales, the unique appeal of the film, and the potential for walk-up ticket sales could lead to underestimating its performance.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Given the strong tracking data, historical performance of the franchise, and the unique appeal of the film, I estimate that "Deadpool & Wolverine" has a high likelihood of exceeding the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine." However, I will temper my forecast slightly to account for the risks of overestimation and the R-rating's potential impact.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
- **Historical Performance**: The original "Deadpool" (2016) opened at $132.4M, and "The Wolverine" (2013) opened at $53.1M, totaling $185.5M. Sequels and team-up films often outperform their predecessors due to increased anticipation and expanded fanbases.
- **R-Rated Films**: R-rated films typically have lower opening weekends compared to PG-13 films, but "Deadpool" broke this trend, setting a record for R-rated openings. This suggests that "Deadpool & Wolverine" could also defy expectations.
- **Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)**: MCU films generally perform well, with recent entries like "Spider-Man: No Way Home" and "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" opening above $180M. However, "The Marvels" underperformed, indicating some fatigue.

### Step 2: Current Trends and Predictions
- **Tracking Data**: Multiple sources predict an opening weekend of $160M-$165M, which is below the $185.5M threshold. However, some optimistic projections suggest $200M-$239M, which would easily surpass the target.
- **Presales**: Presales are strong at $19M, ahead of "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3" and "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," but behind "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness." This indicates solid but not record-breaking interest.
- **Market Conditions**: The 2024 box office has been sluggish, with "Inside Out 2" being the only major hit. This could either limit "Deadpool & Wolverine's" performance or create pent-up demand for a blockbuster.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Optimistic Factors**: The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine is a major draw, and the film's R-rating may attract a different audience. The film's multiversal storyline and cameos could also boost interest.
- **Pessimistic Factors**: The R-rating may limit the audience, and the current box office slump could dampen overall performance. Additionally, the Quorum's track record of overestimating Marvel openings suggests caution.

### Step 4: Final Forecast
Given the mixed evidence, I will balance the optimistic and pessimistic factors. The most likely scenario is an opening weekend between $160M and $165M, which is below the $185.5M threshold. However, there is a significant chance (around 30%) that the film could exceed expectations and open above $185.5M, especially if walk-up ticket sales are strong.
