INT. WAR ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, papers and screens scattered. The tension is palpable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at the screen)  
Our models had it at 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning back)  
Incredible. The referendum in 2023 stirred the pot, but actual invasion? Our data held firm.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
The U.S. visits and NGO warnings were noise, not signals. Our models saw through it.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And the troop movements? Just posturing. No credible sources indicated otherwise.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(sighs in relief)  
It’s a reminder—probability isn’t destiny. Even with tensions high, the models were right.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smiling)  
A testament to our accuracy. Venezuela’s restraint was predicted, and here we are.

They exchange relieved glances, acknowledging the power of their foresight.

FADE OUT.

The room buzzes with anticipation. A team of superforecasters gathers around a table littered with newspapers and laptops. The air is thick with the weight of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 5.23%. The chance of Venezuela invading Guyana was low, but not negligible.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. The referendum in 2023 stirred tensions, but the diplomatic interventions, especially from the U.S., seemed to stabilize the situation.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. The American presence might have been a deterrent. Plus, credible sources up to July 2024 showed no significant troop movements.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's a relief that our models held true. A conflict would have been devastating for the region.

They nod in agreement, aware of the gravity their predictions hold in shaping understanding and policy.

"Yesterday marked the deadline, and as predicted, no Venezuelan troops crossed into Guyana. Our models had it at 5.32%."

SUPERFORECASTER B

"The referendum in Venezuela stirred nationalistic sentiments, but the diplomatic efforts, especially with the U.S. presence, played a crucial role."

SUPERFORECASTER C  
(gesturing to a news article)  
"Reports up to July showed increased military posturing, but the lack of UN Security Council backing made an invasion unlikely."

SUPERFORECASTER A

"Guyana's strategic alliances and Venezuela's internal challenges kept the peace. Our accuracy remains intact."

Despite the referendum and heightened tensions, the probability remained low. The American diplomatic visits and international pressure were significant deterrents.
