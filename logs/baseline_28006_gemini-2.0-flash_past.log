Okay, let's analyze this question. The key is whether Kamala Harris will say "I'm speaking" or "I am speaking" in a formal, live presidential debate with Donald Trump *before September 11, 2024*. Today is September 9, 2024, so we are very close to the deadline.

The phrase "I'm speaking" gained notoriety in the 2020 vice-presidential debate between Harris and Mike Pence. Its use was perceived as a sharp retort to being interrupted and has since become a memorable sound bite.

Given the history, the likelihood that she *could* say it again, especially if interrupted by Trump, is not negligible. However, the crucial factor here is the strategic calculation. The phrase is already well-known. Repeating it might be seen as predictable or even clich√©. On the other hand, if Trump repeatedly interrupts her, deploying the phrase again could be a powerful way to reclaim control of the discussion and fire up her base.

We also need to consider the debate format and the moderators' role. If the moderators are strict and prevent excessive interruptions, the opportunity to use the phrase might not arise. If the debate becomes chaotic with frequent cross-talk, the likelihood of the phrase being uttered increases.

Since we are so close to the resolution date, we can assume the debates are already scheduled and formats are largely set. Given that there is at least one opportunity for a debate, and Trump is known for his debate style, and Harris's past use of the phrase, the likelihood is not zero. However, because of the risk of the phrase sounding stale, the chances are likely below 50%.

I'll adjust the probability downward slightly, acknowledging that there's only one debate and the element of surprise has gone.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
