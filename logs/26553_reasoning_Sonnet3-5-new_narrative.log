Nate: *sipping coffee* "The Hawaiian Electric bankruptcy situation was fascinating. Our models had it at 82.45%."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The parallels with PG&E were striking. The Lahaina wildfire liability, combined with their already tight financial position, made bankruptcy almost inevitable."

Nate: "The August 2023 statement about 'not restructuring' was telling. Similar to PG&E's initial resistance. But once the lawsuits started piling up..."

Tetlock: "The market saw it coming too. That 47% stock plunge wasn't just panic selling. And when they brought in restructuring advisors â€“ classic pre-bankruptcy move."

Nate: "The real question was never if, but when. The timeline matched almost perfectly with PG&E's post-disaster bankruptcy filing pattern."

[They both nod knowingly, turning to their next prediction]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "The Hawaiian Electric bankruptcy prediction... our models had it at 82.45%."

Philip: "Fascinating how the patterns aligned with PG&E's case. The devastating Lahaina fires, the plummeting stock price, and that telling August 2023 8-K filing where they mentioned restructuring advisors..."

Nate: "Yet they insisted bankruptcy wasn't the goal. Classic pre-filing language we've seen before with utilities facing disaster-related liabilities."

Philip: "The parallels with PG&E were striking. Both faced massive wildfire liabilities, infrastructure challenges, and public scrutiny. Our models caught those signals early."

Nate: "The lawsuit allegations about not de-energizing power lines during high-risk conditions... that was a critical indicator. History really does rhyme."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "The Hawaiian Electric bankruptcy case was fascinating. Our models had it at 82.45%."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The warning signs were all there by July 2024. The Lahaina wildfire lawsuits, the precedent set by PG&E's bankruptcy after the Camp Fire, and their deteriorating financial position made it almost inevitable."

Nate: "The August 2023 statement about 'not restructuring' was telling. When utilities start consulting restructuring advisors while publicly denying bankruptcy plans, that's usually a red flag."

Tetlock: "What's remarkable is how similar the pattern was to PG&E. Both faced massive liability from fire damage, both saw their stock price plummet, and both initially resisted bankruptcy before accepting it as inevitable."

Nate: "The models never lie, Phil. They never lie."
