**INT. A COFFEE SHOP - SEATTLE - OCTOBER 3, 2024**

*Two superforecasters, JANE and MIKE, sit at a corner table, laptops open, sipping coffee.*

**JANE**  
So, the verdict is out. Just one day with AQI above 150 in Q3.

**MIKE**  
Our models had it at 18.75%. Given the wildfires in previous years, it was a close call.

**JANE**  
Yeah, July 5th was the only blip. Remember 2022? Eleven days of choking on smoke.

**MIKE**  
Right. The rains came early this year, though. That helped. No Bolt Creek repeat.

**JANE**  
And our models? Spot on, as always.

**MIKE**  
Absolutely. The data never lies. Let's see what next year brings.

*They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with another successful prediction.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Well, there it is. Seattle had exactly one day with an AQI above 150 in the third quarter.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 14.37%. Given the historical data and mid-summer wildfire patterns, it was a tight call.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
It's fascinating. Remember how 2022 was off the charts with 11 days? This year, we barely scraped one.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

The Bolt Creek Fire was a wild card back then. This time, the rains came early.

*They exchange knowing looks, satisfied with their model's accuracy.*

**JANE:** Considering the history, it's a relief. Remember 2022? Eleven days of choking smoke.

**TOM:** Yeah, the Bolt Creek Fire. This year, the rains came early. Lucky break.

**JANE:** And no major fires by August 1st. That's when the news cut off for us.

**TOM:** True. Our Brier scores stay intact. Never wrong, just less probable this time.

True, but this summer was surprisingly mild. Fewer wildfires, and rain came early.
