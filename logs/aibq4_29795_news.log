**Meet the 3 Supercharged Growth Stocks That Will Be Worth $4 Trillion by 2025, According to a Certain Wall Street Analyst | The Motley Fool**
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that three companies, Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, will be the first to achieve a $4 trillion market cap within 12 months. Nvidia is currently the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.38 trillion, and Ives thinks it will only take stock price gains of about 18% for Nvidia's value to surpass $4 trillion. Apple, with a market cap of roughly $3.35 trillion, needs stock price gains of just 20% to clear the $4 trillion threshold. Microsoft, with a market cap of $3 trillion, is just 32% below the $4 trillion benchmark. Ives notes that the companies are well-positioned to benefit from the growing adoption of generative AI, with Nvidia's GPUs being the 'new oil or gold in the tech world' and Microsoft's AI revenue on track to exceed a $10 billion run rate in Q2.

The company's net profit is expected to reach $68,616 million in 2024, a 144% increase from the historical record of 2023. Analysts predict that Nvidia's net profit will exceed $100,000 million in just two years, making it one of the five companies in the world to achieve this milestone in 2026. 'We expect Nvidia to continue delivering good results across all segments, with the solid demand for PC games being a strong revenue driver, compensating for the decline in original equipment manufacturers,' said JP Morgan. 'We also expect the data center segment to grow strongly as hyperscale customers continue to adopt accelerated learning by GPU for processing large datasets.'

**Nvidia Surpasses Apple in Market Capitalization, Awaits Quarterly Results**
Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market capitalization, becoming the largest listed company in the world. The company is expected to announce its quarterly results on November 20, which will determine the continuation of the market's upward trend. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia's performance, with some predicting a net profit of $17.495 million, which would be the company's highest quarterly profit ever. This would represent an 89% improvement over the same period last year. Nvidia's strong performance in the gaming segment, driven by the demand for PC games, is expected to be a major driver of revenue, offsetting the decline in OEM sales. The company's solid performance in the automotive and commercial segments is also expected to continue. For the full year 2024, Nvidia's net profit is expected to reach $68.616 million, a 144% increase over the historic figure of 2023. Analysts also predict that the company's net profit will exceed $100 billion in just two years, making it one of the five companies in the world to achieve this milestone by 2026. As one analyst from JP Morgan noted, 'We expect Nvidia to continue to perform well across all segments, with strong demand for PC games driving revenue, offsetting the decline in OEM sales. We are also encouraged by the solid performance in the automotive and commercial segments. We expect a significant increase in the stock price, leading to our overweight rating.'

**Nvidia Overtakes Apple as World's Most Valuable Company**
Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of approximately $3.37 trillion. The AI chip leader's shares rose 1.6% on Monday, surpassing Apple's $3.36 trillion market value. Nvidia's meteoric rise is fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, with tech giants committing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on Nvidia's semiconductors and servers. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, Nvidia will replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, effective November 8. As of the beginning of the year, Nvidia's market cap was $1.2 trillion, about a third of Apple's and Microsoft's values at the time.

**Making sense of the markets this week: November 3, 2024**
Apple and Nvidia are currently tied for the most valuable company in the world, each worth around $3.5 trillion. Apple recently released its earnings report, showing strong iPhone sales, but a decline in sales in the China market. The company's bottom line was affected by a $10.2 billion tax bill, but it still managed to dedicate $29 billion to share repurchases and dividends. Despite this, the market had a muted reaction to the earnings, with share prices down 2% in after-hours trading. In contrast, Amazon had a big win with its earnings announcement, although the article does not provide specific details.

**The Week of the 'Magnifiche 7': A Crucial Moment for the US Economy**
The upcoming week will be crucial for the US economy, with over 1,000 companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, releasing their quarterly earnings reports. This will be the last opportunity for voters to assess the state of the economy before the presidential election on November 5. The Federal Reserve is expected to focus on growth data rather than inflation, and the non-farm payrolls data on November 1 will be a key indicator of the labor market. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data on October 31 may also attract attention if it deviates from expectations. The 'magnifiche 7' - a group of seven tech giants - have performed well in the past week, with a 3.5% aggregate gain. Apple remains the largest company in the group, with a market capitalization of $3.521 billion, followed by Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. The combined market value of these seven companies is $16.5 trillion, more than the GDP of the Eurozone and 20 times the value of listed companies on the Italian stock exchange.

**US STOCKS-Nasdaq gains as megacap stocks outperform**
The Nasdaq rose on Friday, driven by megacap shares, as Treasury yields slipped from the week's high ahead of quarterly results from some of Wall Street's biggest companies next week. Nvidia briefly overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company based on its shares. However, the Dow slumped on a loss in banking shares, with Goldman Sachs down 2.4%, and a 3% fall in McDonald's as the fast-food chain copes with an E. coli outbreak linked to its hamburgers. Gustaf Little, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, said, 'There's a lot of moving pieces right now, especially because of where we are in the election cycle, but we think earnings have been pretty good overall.' Investors are still pricing in another 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed's November meeting and about two rate cuts by the end of the year. 'With such high valuations... at this point, these high growth tech companies need to confirm both AI growth and execution. They need to show and deliver,' said Arnim Holzer, global macro strategist at Easterly EAB Risk Solutions.

**US STOCKS-Nasdaq hits record high as Treasury yields ease**
The Nasdaq hit a fresh intraday record on Friday, driven by megacaps as Treasury yields eased off the week's high. Nvidia briefly overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company by market value, gaining 2.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.19% to 42,292.57, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.51% to 5,839.54. Arnim Holzer, global macro strategist at EAB Investment Group, said, 'The Fed perhaps got a little too dovish ahead of the data... the growth and inflation numbers don't necessarily justify easing behavior.' Investors are still pricing in another 25-basis-point rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's November meeting. The week starting Oct. 28 promises to be crucial for Wall Street, with results from megacap technology firms and the nonfarm payrolls report for October due.

**Five Stocks, 3 Days, $12 Trillion In Market Cap. Buckle Up.**
The market is bracing for a significant impact from the earnings reports of five megacaps - Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta - which have a combined market valuation of over $12 trillion. These reports will not only affect the S&P 500 and other major indexes but also have a huge influence on the artificial intelligence sector, cloud computing, online advertising, e-commerce, and business software. The stock market rally could experience a significant surge, plunge, or whipsaw as these tech titans report their earnings. Additionally, the presidential election on November 5 and the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 6-7 may also impact the market. Investor caution is likely due to uncertainty over the election, the Fed, and these huge upcoming earnings.

**The Race to a $4 Trillion Market Cap: Apple, Nvidia, or Microsoft**
Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are the top three companies in the world by market cap, with Apple sitting at $3.6 trillion. Nvidia's market cap is just above $3.5 trillion, thanks to its essential role in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, while Microsoft's market cap is at $3.1 trillion. Apple's AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, but were not ready for the iPhone 16 launch in September. Apple Intelligence will be available on newer iPhones, but hundreds of millions of iPhone owners will need to upgrade their devices to access it. Analyst Dan Ives predicts a 'super cycle' driven by AI interest, which could lead to record iPhone sales of 240 million in fiscal 2025. A stronger-than-expected upgrade cycle and progress toward direct monetization of AI features could propel Apple's stock to the $4 trillion level, but it needs to outperform single-digit percentage revenue growth expectations for next year to justify a $4 trillion valuation.

**Why Apple will be first to $4T market cap**
Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives believes Apple will be the first US stock to reach a $4 trillion market cap, followed by Nvidia and Microsoft. Ives predicts Apple's 'AI-driven supercycle' will start in the December quarter, driven by the rollout of Apple Intelligence and the potential for 20% of the world's population to access AI through an Apple device. He estimates iPhone units will exceed 240 million this year. Ives also notes that there is a 'pent-up upgrade opportunity' for 300 million iPhones that haven't been upgraded in four-plus years, making it a 'multi-year supercycle.' He expects Apple to hit $4 trillion first, followed by Nvidia in mid-2025 and then Microsoft.

**AAPL Eyes Record Highs After Upbeat China iPhone 16 Sales**
Apple Inc (AAPL) is close to reaching record highs, trading at $234.99, up 1.2% after Counterpoint Research reported a 20% increase in iPhone 16 sales in China. The company has the largest market cap in the world, valued at nearly $3.6 trillion. AAPL shares have risen 22% in 2024 and 34% year over year, with a record high of $237.49 reached on October 15. Analysts expect a round of price-target hikes, with a consensus 12-month price target of $239.70, only a 2% premium from its current price.

**NVIDIA Reaches New High, but Apple Remains the Largest Company**
NVIDIA's stock price has reached a new high, surpassing $140.84 per share, driven by the positive results of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which reported a 54% increase in net profit. This has fueled optimism in the market, with NVIDIA's stock price rising over 3% and setting a new record. However, Apple remains the largest company in the world by market capitalization, with a value of $3.52 billion. The competition between NVIDIA and Apple will continue, with NVIDIA's stock price needing to reach $143 to surpass Apple's market capitalization. The third-quarter earnings season will be crucial in determining NVIDIA's potential for growth and whether it can overtake Apple. InvestingPro's ProPicks IA tool, which uses artificial intelligence to select stocks, has recommended NVIDIA as a top pick, with a 37.14% return since its launch in November 2023, surpassing the S&P 500 by 16.33%.

**Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?**
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is rapidly closing the gap with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in terms of valuation, with a market cap of $3.13 trillion compared to Apple's $3.37 trillion. While Apple's revenue is significantly higher at $385 billion, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to continue, with a 122% year-over-year increase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Nvidia's growth potential is driven by its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution, and its upcoming Blackwell architecture, which is expected to unlock massive speed gains. Analysts believe Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projections of 8% growth. However, Nvidia still generates about half the profits of Apple, but with its growth pace and stronger profit margin, it could quickly catch Apple's profit levels. By the end of the next fiscal year, Nvidia could be right there with Apple in terms of profits. Next comes valuation, where Nvidia's strong growth and brand could fetch a higher premium than Apple, potentially propelling it to overtake Apple as the world's largest company.

**Stock market: Global market capitalization beats previous record**
Global market capitalization has surpassed its previous peak of $123,000 billion, set in October 2021, reaching over $124,000 billion, according to Bloomberg data. This increase is attributed to the 'bullish explosion' of Chinese equities, the recovery of European equities, and record or near-record highs in the USA. The world's largest listed company, Apple, accounts for 2.8% of the total market capitalization, with a value of $3,463 billion. The US equity market contributes around 47% to the total, with a value of $58,000 billion.
