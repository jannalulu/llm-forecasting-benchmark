**Brazil Sends Record Number of Female Athletes to Paris 2024**
The Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB) has finalized the list of athletes representing Brazil at the Paris 2024 Games, which start in 15 days. For the first time in history, the number of female athletes has surpassed the number of male athletes, with 55% of the 277 athletes being women, an 8% increase from the last edition in Tokyo.

President Lula has signed a decree increasing the Athlete's Allowance by 10.86%. The Museum of Football has reopened with a space dedicated to Pelé and women's football. The expectation is that Brazilian women will win more medals than men, with notable athletes such as Rebeca Andrade, Beatriz Ferreira, Rayssa Leal, Ana Marcela Cunha, and Ana Patrícia/Duda. According to Rogério Sampaio, COB director-general and head of the Paris 2024 Mission, there is a real chance of having more female medalists than men for the first time in Olympic Games. The Brazilian team will arrive in Paris on Thursday (18th). The country will compete in 39 modalities, with judo being the most successful, having won 24 medals (four gold, three silver, and seven bronze).

**Brazil to Have Record Number of Women at Paris-2024 Olympics**
The Brazilian Olympic team for Paris-2024 has been finalized, with a record number of women, making up 55% of the total 277 athletes. The women will be 153, while the men will be 124. This marks a significant increase from the previous Olympics, where women made up 47% of the team.
