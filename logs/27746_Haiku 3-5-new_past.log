Let me systematically analyze the key factors:

Reference Class Analysis:
- Carlsen has won Speed Chess Championship 3 times previously
- He's currently in strong form (winning Titled Tuesday tournaments, World Blitz Team Championship)
- This represents a high baseline probability of success

Specific Tournament Context:
- Carlsen defeated Arjun Erigaisi 12-9 in quarterfinals
- Will face Hans Niemann in semifinals
- Significant historical tension with Niemann due to past cheating allegations
- Carlsen seems motivated to prove superiority

Opponent Analysis (Niemann):
- Recently rose to world #16
- Won matches against Wesley So, Anish Giri
- Confident and aggressive playing style
- But historically less consistent than Carlsen

Head-to-Head Considerations:
- Carlsen has publicly stated he'll likely win against Niemann "without too many issues"
- Tournament is speed chess format, where Carlsen is particularly dominant
- Carlsen is 6-time World Blitz Chess Champion

Risk Factors:
- Potential psychological tension with Niemann
- Tournament format introduces some variability

Balancing these factors, I assess Carlsen's winning probability:

My Prediction: Between 68.50% and 82.30%, but 75.40% being the most likely. Probability: 75.40%.

3. Current Form & Dynamics
- Carlsen defeated Arjun Erigaisi 12-9 in quarterfinals
- Niemann recently defeated Wesley So 13-10
- Historical tension between Carlsen and Niemann exists
- Carlsen suggested he'd "probably win without too many issues"

4. Probabilistic Considerations
