2025-02-12 22:08:26,283 - INFO - Question: Between July 17 and July 28, 2024, will the strongest geomagnetic storm have a K-index ("Kp") greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5?

Let me carefully analyze this:

Key Observations:
- Time period is July 17-28, 2024 (12 days)
- Looking for a Kp index > 4 and ≤ 5
- Resolution from German Research Center's 30-day history data

Considerations:
1. Solar activity is currently approaching Solar Cycle 25 peak
2. Geomagnetic storms have increased frequency during solar maximum
3. We're mid-summer 2024, which is an active solar period
4. The specific range (>4 and ≤5) is a moderate geomagnetic storm level

Historical Context:
- Solar cycle peaks often produce more geomagnetic disturbances
- Not all solar maximums produce same storm frequency
- Need to balance probability between occurrence and specific intensity range

Probability Reasoning:
- Moderate chance of geomagnetic activity in this range
- Not guaranteed, but reasonably likely given solar cycle
- Multiple factors influence storm intensity

After careful probabilistic analysis considering solar cycle, historical data, and current trends, accounting for specificity of the Kp range:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.30%, but 48.75% being the most likely. Probability: 48.75%.
