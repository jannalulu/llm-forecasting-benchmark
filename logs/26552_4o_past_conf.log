To forecast whether a senolytic therapy will be approved by the US FDA by September 30, 2024, I will proceed through a structured analysis:

1. **Base Rates (Reference Classes):** FDA approval timelines are crucial for predictions of this nature. Generally, getting a new type of therapy like a senolytic, which targets senescent cells, approved by the FDA can take several years from initial research to final approval. While there are cases of accelerated approvals, such occurrences remain relatively rare. Historical senolytic treatments have not yet reached actual FDA approval for specific senolytic indications.

2. **Conduct Triage:** The articles contain some studies from reputable institutions, like the Mayo Clinic and the Washington University School of Medicine, indicating that there are active trials and growing scientific interest in senolytic therapies. However, current focus articles on therapies are primarily on ongoing research and trials rather than imminent approval submissions.

3. **Inside View Examination:** Looking at the articles, senolytic treatments are mainly in the research phase, suggesting potential utility in cancer therapies and aging. Despite promising study outcomes in animal models or certain trials, the leap to FDA approval suggests the absence of imminent consideration for approval by the FDA based on current data provided.

4. **Evidence Summary:** 
   - **Positive Signs:** Institutions are actively researching senolytic therapies. Some senolytic drugs related to the general mechanism have garnered approval, albeit for different indications not precisely marketed as selective removal of senescent cells.
   - **Challenges:** No mention of specific FDA applications or ongoing final stage (late Phase 3) clinical trials in the context of the data provided. Even with some FDA-approved related senolytics, it's uncertain if they'll meet new criteria or have FDA approvals for marketed selective senolytic therapy.

5. **Balance of Adjustments:** Given the lack of strong published evidence suggesting formal FDA submissions for commercial use of senolytic treatments within this question’s criteria or that approval could be highly expedited for such a therapy, optimism should stay tempered.

6. **Current Trends Analysis:** Continuing research shows promise but lacks specifics on FDA submissions pending or in the process for a senolytic drug as defined. Market and scientific trends point to ongoing study but not immediate approval placements.

Based on these considerations:

- There is currently no strong indication of senolytic therapies pending FDA approval within the stipulated timeline.
- While active research is ongoing, and there is interest in the topic, the articles suggest these therapies are still far from the market-ready point necessary for FDA approval.
- Historical context and comparative assessments, even considering expedited processes, suggest the deadline is likely too close.

My Prediction: 10.00% being the most likely, with 90.00% confidence. Probability: 10.00%.

To evaluate the likelihood of a senolytic therapy being approved for commercial sale by the US FDA before September 30, 2024, I will use a systematic approach grounded in historical base rates and existing evidence.

1. **Base Rate Analysis**: To determine the base rate, I consider the typical timeline for FDA drug approvals, particularly in innovative fields like senolytic therapy. Typically, breakthrough therapies, even with expedited processes, take several years from development through clinical trials and approval phases. Senolytic therapies are still emerging, and while some senolytic drugs are approved for other indications, this area remains relatively novel, suggesting a base rate of around 5%-10% for approval within a such short timeframe.

2. **Current Evidence**:
   - Based on the articles provided, there's evidence of ongoing research and some optimistic results, particularly concerning their potential use in cancer therapy and for elderly populations. However, none of the articles directly indicate that an FDA submission for a new senolytic therapy is currently under review, much less nearing approval by the deadline.
   - Additionally, ongoing clinical trials, such as the phase 2 trial at the Mayo Clinic involving dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q), indicate progress but no explicit mention of a near-term FDA submission or approval anticipated by September 30, 2024.
   - Existing senolytics are approved for other cancers, but the approval process for a new therapeutic purpose, especially for a potentially transformative class like senolytics targeting aging, is typically cautious and lengthy.

3. **Trend Analysis** and **Recent Developments**:
   - Certain innovative therapies, even high-priority ones, undergo FSDA's rigorous process which can extend beyond a year.
   - No senolytic drug specifically targeting senescence is currently undergoing FDA consideration for a new approval in the articles provided.

4. **Balancing Evidence**:
   - The inside view (specific evidence from the articles) suggests incremental advances but lacks clear, immediate FDA movement toward approval.
   - The outside view (base rate and typical drug approval timelines) reinforces that rapid approval is unlikely within the next couple of months given the current state of affairs.

Overall, while there are positive trends in senolytic research, the likelihood of FDA approval for a senolytic therapy by the near-term deadline of September 30, 2024, remains quite low. 

My Prediction: 8.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 8.00%.

To forecast whether a senolytic therapy will be approved by the FDA before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach:

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: 
   - Historically, the FDA approval process for entirely new classes of drugs, like senolytic therapies, can take significant time, often several years from initial trials to approval.
   - As of now, senolytic therapies, specifically targeting the elimination of senescent cells, have not been widely approved for use aside from some pilot studies and off-label uses.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem**:
   - Assess the current state of senolytic therapies; whether there are any in late-stage clinical trials and under FDA review, as FDA approval usually requires rigorous Phase I-III trials.
   - Evaluate recent FDA activities and approvals related to similar therapies, noting any new adaptations or trends in the regulatory environment.

3. **Evidence from Current News**:
   - The provided articles do not mention any senolytic therapies that are currently in the final stages of FDA approval. While some senolytic drugs are approved for other indications, this question focuses specifically on approval as a senolytic therapy.
   - There is evidence of ongoing research and some optimism about potential treatments, but it generally remains in the scientific discovery phase rather than pre-approval or commercial release phase.

4. **FDA Approval Trends**:
   - Current FDA decisions and market strategies do not indicate an immediate focus on senolytic therapies, with no direct calls for applications or reviews mentioned related to this category.

5. **Balancing Causal Forces & Trends**:
   - **For Higher Probability**: Recent studies show potential benefits of senolytics, indicating significant scientific interest and investment in senolytic research.
   - **For Lower Probability**: The absence of any mention of late-stage trials nearing completion or active FDA submissions poses a significant barrier. Given the FDA’s rigorous requirements, any lack of direct evidence of ongoing applications suggests a lower probability of approval within the specified timeframe.

6. **Synthesis and Final Assessment**:
   - With no direct evidence of senolytic therapies nearing approval and typical FDA timelines for entirely new classes of intervention, the probability of approval before September 30, 2024, seems low.
   - Considering the balance of scientific activity, but the lack of specific evidence for imminent FDA actions, I estimate a low probability.

To forecast the likelihood of a senolytic therapy being approved for commercial sale by the US FDA before September 30, 2024, let's consider several factors:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: The approval of new drug therapies, particularly in emerging areas like senolytics, is typically a slow and rigorous process. Historically, the FDA has shown caution, particularly with therapies that have less established safety profiles or novel mechanisms of action. Furthermore, FDA approvals for new classes of drugs often take several years from initial clinical trials to approval. 

2. **Current Developments**: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of senolytic therapies in treating various diseases, including cancer and age-related conditions. The articles mention some senolytic drugs being FDA-approved for other conditions, indicating some level of existing regulatory attention and potential openness. However, there is no direct indication in the articles that any senolytic drug is in the final stages of FDA review specifically as a senolytic therapy targeting senescent cells for removal.

3. **Research and Clinical Trials**: While studies have shown promise, the majority of evidence seems to come from initial studies, pre-clinical trials, or small clinical trials. The news about the Mayo Clinic's study, while promising, emphasizes the need for more research, which suggests a longer timeline for practical application and regulatory approval.

4. **Regulatory Climate**: Current news shows a range of FDA activities, from vaccine guidance to novel therapy approvals, indicating a busy schedule. As such, it could hint at limited immediate bandwidth for completely new therapeutic categories unless they are particularly pressing.

5. **External References**: Without specific reference forecasts from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus related to this niche and precise timeline, we rely heavily on making structured qualitative judgments.

Given these factors, the base rate for approvals of a new therapeutic class like senolytics would dictate caution in overestimating near-term outcomes. Evidence of ongoing research but lack of immediate candidates close to approval suggests adjusting the probability downward from a neutral starting point.

My Prediction: 10.00% being the most likely, with 90.00% confidence. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether a senolytic therapy will be approved for commercial sale by the US FDA before September 30, 2024, let's examine the evidence and use a structured approach:

1. **Base Rate and Reference Class**: Senolytic therapies targeting the removal of senescent cells are a relatively new class of drug. Historical base rates for approval of new drug classes, particularly those targeting specific cell types, are generally low, especially within short timeframes (less than 1 year).

2. **Current Evidence**: Multiple articles highlight ongoing research into senolytic therapies, particularly for cancer treatment. Some senolytic drugs are already FDA-approved for other cancers, suggesting a possible precedent for approval. However, there is no clear indication that senolytic therapies specifically targeting senescent cells for indication as an anti-aging or cancer therapy are close to FDA consideration at this time.

3. **Drug Development Stages**: Approvals often require successful completion of several phases of clinical trials, followed by the submission and review of the New Drug Application (NDA). The articles did not provide evidence that any senolytic therapy targeting senescent cells specific to FDA approval as per the resolution criteria is currently under NDA review or at late-stage clinical trials – a prerequisite step for FDA approval within the next year.

4. **Recent Trends**: While the articles indicate promising research and clinical trials, no information provided hints that a senolytic therapy is in the final stages required for near-term FDA approval. Therefore, extrapolating these trends suggests that significant hurdles remain that would need to be overcome for an approval to happen by September 2024.

5. **Inside vs. Outside View**: While isolated breakthroughs in specific conditions using senolytic therapies are reported, the outside view of drug approval processes, especially for new classes of therapies, tends to be conservative.

Considering this, the base rate for getting a new drug class approved quickly is low, and while there is promising preliminary research, evidence of a specific therapy ready for final FDA approval in such a short timeframe is lacking.

Historical base rates for approval of new drug classes, particularly those targeting specific cell types, are generally low, especially within short timeframes (less than 1 year).

2. **Current Evidence**: Multiple articles highlight ongoing research into senolytic therapies, particularly for cancer treatment. Some senolytic drugs are already FDA-approved for other cancers, suggesting a possible precedent for approval. However, there is no clear indication that senolytic therapies specifically targeting senescent cells for indication as an anti-aging or cancer therapy are close to FDA consideration at this time.

3. **Drug Development Stages**: Approvals often require successful completion of several phases of clinical trials, followed by the submission and review of the New Drug Application (NDA). The articles did not provide evidence that any senolytic therapy targeting senescent cells specific to FDA approval as per the resolution criteria is currently under NDA review or at late-stage clinical trials – a prerequisite step for FDA approval within the next year.

4. **Recent Trends**: While the articles indicate promising research and clinical trials, no information provided hints that a senolytic therapy is in the final stages required for near-term FDA approval. Therefore, extrapolating these trends suggests that significant hurdles remain that would need to be overcome for an approval to happen by September 2024.

5. **Inside vs. Outside View**: While isolated breakthroughs in specific conditions using senolytic therapies are reported, the outside view of drug approval processes, especially for new classes of therapies, tends to be conservative.

Considering this, the base rate for getting a new drug class approved quickly is low, and while there is promising preliminary research, evidence of a specific therapy ready for final FDA approval in such a short timeframe is lacking.

My Prediction: 10.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 10.00%.
