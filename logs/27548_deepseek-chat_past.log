2025-01-04 13:43:26,739 - INFO - Run 0:
To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "High" before October 1, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, balance inside and outside views, and carefully weigh the evidence.

### Step 1: Reference Class Forecasting (Outside View)
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, the CDC has rarely assessed the risk of infectious diseases to the US general public as "Very High." For example, during the 2022 mpox outbreak, the risk was assessed as "Low" to "Moderate" for the general population, even with significant transmission among specific groups. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest risk level was "High," not "Very High."
- **Mpox-Specific Base Rate**: The current mpox outbreak in Africa, driven by the clade I variant, has been declared a global public health emergency by the WHO. However, the CDC's August 14, 2024, rapid risk assessment for the US general population remains "Very Low," with moderate confidence. This suggests a low base rate for a sudden escalation to "Very High."

### Step 2: Current Trends and Evidence (Inside View)
- **Transmission Dynamics**: The clade I variant is more severe and transmissible than previous strains, but its spread outside Africa has been limited. The CDC's modeling indicates that household and non-sexual close-contact transmission in the US is unlikely to result in large outbreaks.
- **Vaccination and Immunity**: The US has a significant stockpile of the Jynneos vaccine, and vaccination efforts have been targeted at high-risk groups. This reduces the likelihood of widespread transmission.
- **Global Spread**: While the WHO has declared a global emergency, the European CDC and other health agencies have assessed the risk to their regions as "Very Low." This suggests that the US is unlikely to face a uniquely high risk.
- **CDC's Risk Assessment**: The CDC's August 14, 2024, assessment explicitly states that the risk to the general population is "Very Low," with no indication of an imminent escalation.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Factors Increasing Risk**: The clade I variant's higher severity and transmissibility, coupled with the WHO's global emergency declaration, could increase pressure on the CDC to reassess risks.
- **Factors Decreasing Risk**: The US's robust public health infrastructure, vaccination efforts, and limited direct travel links to affected regions in Africa mitigate the risk of widespread transmission.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- The base rate and current CDC assessment strongly suggest a low probability of the risk exceeding "High." However, the WHO's global emergency declaration and the clade I variant's characteristics introduce some uncertainty.
- Given the CDC's current "Very Low" assessment and the lack of evidence suggesting a rapid escalation, the probability of the risk exceeding "High" before October 1, 2024, remains low.

### Final Forecast
My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "High" before October 1, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential future developments.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- No specific human predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this exact question. However, the CDC's current assessment (as of August 14, 2024) is that the overall risk to the US general population is "Very Low," with moderate confidence.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Risk Assessment**: The CDC's current risk assessment is "Very Low" for the general population, with a focus on specific high-risk groups (e.g., MSM).
2. **Trends in Mpox Cases**: The outbreak in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is severe, with a 160% increase in cases and 19% increase in deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. However, the strain (Clade I) is not yet detected in the US.
3. **Transmission Dynamics**: The new Clade I variant is more transmissible and severe, but its spread outside Africa is limited. The US has no direct flights from the DRC, reducing the risk of importation.
4. **Vaccination and Preparedness**: The US has a robust vaccination program for high-risk groups, and the Jynneos vaccine is effective against all clades. However, vaccine uptake among high-risk groups remains suboptimal.
5. **CDC's Monitoring and Response**: The CDC is actively monitoring the situation and updating its risk assessments every two weeks or as needed.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The current outbreak in Africa is severe, but the US has strong public health measures in place, including vaccination and surveillance.
- **Outside View**: Historically, mpox outbreaks outside Africa have been contained with minimal impact on the general population. The 2022 outbreak, while significant, was primarily limited to specific high-risk groups.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The outbreak in Africa is concerning, but the lack of direct flights and the US's robust public health infrastructure mitigate the risk of a significant outbreak in the general population.
- The CDC's current assessment of "Very Low" risk is based on limited evidence of Clade I transmission outside Africa and the effectiveness of existing control measures.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Upward Pressure**: The severity of the outbreak in Africa, the transmissibility of Clade I, and potential under-vaccination in high-risk groups could increase the risk.
- **Downward Pressure**: The US's strong public health infrastructure, lack of direct flights from the DRC, and effective vaccines reduce the risk.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current trends continue, the risk of Clade I spreading to the US remains low. However, if the outbreak in Africa worsens or if cases are detected in countries with direct flights to the US, the risk could increase.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The probability of the CDC upgrading the risk to "Very High" is low, given the current evidence. However, there is some uncertainty due to the dynamic nature of the outbreak.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the current risk is low, it is important to remain vigilant. The CDC's regular updates and monitoring provide a strong basis for confidence in the current assessment.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that mpox outbreaks outside Africa are containable. However, the new Clade I variant introduces some uncertainty, and the CDC's assessment could change if new evidence emerges.

### Final Forecast
Based on the current evidence and trends, the probability of the CDC upgrading the risk to "Very High" before October 1, 2024, is low. However, there is some uncertainty due to the dynamic nature of the outbreak.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "High" before October 1, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined:

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- No specific human predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this question. Therefore, I will rely on the provided news articles and CDC assessments.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
- **Current Risk Assessment:** The CDC's latest assessment (August 14, 2024) rates the overall risk to the US general population as "VERY LOW," with moderate confidence.
- **Transmission Dynamics:** The outbreak is concentrated in Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with limited global spread. The new clade I variant is more severe but has not been detected in the US.
- **Vaccination and Preparedness:** The US has a robust vaccination program for at-risk groups, and the CDC is monitoring the situation closely.
- **Global Spread:** The WHO has declared a global public health emergency, but the risk to Europe and the US remains low according to the ECDC and CDC.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View:** The CDC's current assessment is "VERY LOW," and there is no evidence of widespread transmission in the US. The US has effective public health measures in place.
- **Outside View:** Historically, mpox outbreaks outside endemic regions (e.g., the 2022 outbreak) were contained with minimal impact on the general population. The current outbreak in Africa, while severe, has not led to significant global spread.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The WHO's declaration of a global emergency and the Africa CDC's declaration of a continental emergency are significant but do not directly translate to a high risk for the US general population. The CDC's assessment is based on specific data and trends, which currently do not support a "High" risk.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Higher Risk:** The new clade I variant is more severe and transmissible. If it spreads to the US, it could increase the risk.
- **For Lower Risk:** The US has effective public health measures, vaccination programs, and no detected cases of the new variant. The CDC's confidence in its "VERY LOW" assessment is moderate.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend shows no significant increase in mpox cases in the US. The outbreak remains concentrated in Africa, with limited global spread.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small chance (10-20%) that the new variant could spread to the US, but the likelihood of it causing a "High" risk to the general population before October 1, 2024, is low.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the current data, it is prudent to maintain a low probability estimate but allow for a small chance of unexpected developments.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- In past outbreaks, overestimating the risk of global spread led to unnecessary alarm. However, underestimating the risk could lead to unpreparedness. Balancing these errors, I lean toward a low probability estimate.

### Final Forecast
Based on the current CDC assessment, the lack of detected cases of the new variant in the US, and the effectiveness of public health measures, the probability of the CDC's risk assessment exceeding "High" before October 1, 2024, is low.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "High" before October 1, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique features of the situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rates**: Historically, the CDC has rarely assessed infectious disease risks to the US general public as "Very High." For example, during the 2022 mpox outbreak, the risk was assessed as "Low" to "Moderate" for the general population, even with significant transmission among specific groups.
- **Current Context**: The current mpox outbreak in Africa involves a new variant (Clade Ib) that is more transmissible and deadly, but the CDC's August 14, 2024, rapid risk assessment still rates the risk to the US general population as "Very Low" with moderate confidence.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Transmission Dynamics**: The new Clade Ib variant is spreading rapidly in Africa, but there is no evidence of sustained transmission outside Africa. The CDC notes that household transmission in the US is unlikely to result in large outbreaks.
2. **Vaccination and Immunity**: The US has a stockpile of Jynneos vaccines, and immunity from prior vaccination or infection may limit spread. However, vaccination rates among high-risk groups remain low.
3. **Travel and Importation Risk**: While travel-related cases are possible, the CDC has not reported any cases of Clade Ib in the US as of August 23, 2024. The lack of direct flights from affected regions reduces the likelihood of importation.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the likelihood of the CDC upgrading the risk to "Very High" for the general population is low. Such assessments are reserved for situations with widespread, uncontrolled transmission and significant public health impact.
- **Inside View**: The current outbreak in Africa is severe, but the CDC's assessment reflects confidence in containment measures, limited transmission routes, and the effectiveness of existing vaccines.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for Lower Risk**: The CDC's August 14 assessment, the lack of Clade Ib cases in the US, and the low likelihood of household transmission all suggest a low risk of escalation.
- **Strong Evidence for Higher Risk**: The WHO's declaration of a global health emergency and the rapid spread of Clade Ib in Africa introduce uncertainty. However, these factors have not yet translated into a significant threat to the US general population.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Mitigating Factors**: High vaccination availability, effective public health measures, and limited transmission routes.
- **Amplifying Factors**: The new variant's transmissibility and severity, potential for travel-related cases, and low vaccination rates in some high-risk groups.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The current trend shows no significant increase in mpox cases in the US, and the CDC's assessment remains stable. Without a major shift in transmission dynamics, the risk is unlikely to escalate to "Very High" by October 1, 2024.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small chance (5-10%) that a travel-related case could lead to localized transmission, but this is unlikely to escalate to a "Very High" risk level for the general population.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the situation in Africa is concerning, the US has robust public health infrastructure and resources to contain any potential outbreaks. Overconfidence in containment is a risk, but the evidence supports a low probability of escalation.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- A potential error would be underestimating the transmissibility of Clade Ib or overestimating the effectiveness of containment measures. However, the CDC's current assessment and the lack of cases in the US mitigate this risk.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of the CDC's assessment exceeding "High" before October 1, 2024, is very low. The most likely scenario is that the risk remains at "Very Low" or "Low."

- While the situation in Africa is concerning, the US has robust public health infrastructure and resources to contain any potential outbreaks. Overconfidence in containment is a risk, but the evidence supports a low probability of escalation.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- A potential error would be underestimating the transmissibility of Clade Ib or overestimating the effectiveness of containment measures. However, the CDC's current assessment and the lack of cases in the US mitigate this risk.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of the CDC's assessment exceeding "High" before October 1, 2024, is very low. The most likely scenario is that the risk remains at "Very Low" or "Low."

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.**

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "High" before October 1, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique features of the situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rates**: Historically, the CDC has rarely assessed infectious disease risks to the US general public as "Very High." For example, during the 2022 mpox outbreak, the risk was assessed as "Low" to "Moderate" for the general population, even with significant transmission among specific groups.
- **Current Context**: The current mpox outbreak in Africa involves a new variant (Clade Ib) that is more transmissible and deadly, but the CDC's August 14, 2024, rapid risk assessment still rates the risk to the US general population as "Very Low" with moderate confidence.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Transmission Dynamics**: The new Clade Ib variant is spreading rapidly in Africa, but there is no evidence of sustained transmission outside Africa. The CDC notes that household transmission in the US is unlikely to result in large outbreaks.
2. **Vaccination and Immunity**: The US has a stockpile of Jynneos vaccines, and immunity from prior vaccination or infection may limit spread. However, vaccination rates among high-risk groups remain low.
3. **Travel and Importation Risk**: While travel-related cases are possible, the CDC has not reported any cases of Clade Ib in the US as of August 23, 2024. The lack of direct flights from affected regions reduces the likelihood of importation.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the likelihood of the CDC upgrading the risk to "Very High" for the general population is low. Such assessments are reserved for situations with widespread, uncontrolled transmission and significant public health impact.
- **Inside View**: The current outbreak in Africa is severe, but the CDC's assessment reflects confidence in containment measures, limited transmission routes, and the effectiveness of existing vaccines.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for Lower Risk**: The CDC's August 14 assessment, the lack of Clade Ib cases in the US, and the low likelihood of household transmission all suggest a low risk of escalation.
- **Strong Evidence for Higher Risk**: The WHO's declaration of a global health emergency and the rapid spread of Clade Ib in Africa introduce uncertainty. However, these factors have not yet translated into a significant threat to the US general population.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Mitigating Factors**: High vaccination availability, effective public health measures, and limited transmission routes.
- **Amplifying Factors**: The new variant's transmissibility and severity, potential for travel-related cases, and low vaccination rates in some high-risk groups.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The current trend shows no significant increase in mpox cases in the US, and the CDC's assessment remains stable. Without a major shift in transmission dynamics, the risk is unlikely to escalate to "Very High" by October 1, 2024.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small chance (5-10%) that a travel-related case could lead to localized transmission, but this is unlikely to escalate to a "Very High" risk level for the general population.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the situation in Africa is concerning, the US has robust public health infrastructure and resources to contain any potential outbreaks. Overconfidence in containment is a risk, but the evidence supports a low probability of escalation.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- A potential error would be underestimating the transmissibility of Clade Ib or overestimating the effectiveness of containment measures. However, the CDC's current assessment and the lack of cases in the US mitigate this risk.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "High" before October 1, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles and analyze the available evidence systematically.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- No direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this specific question. However, the CDC's current assessment (as of August 14, 2024) is that the overall risk to the US general population is "VERY LOW," with moderate confidence. This serves as a baseline.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Risk Assessment**: The CDC's current assessment is "VERY LOW" for the general population, with a "LOW to MODERATE" risk for specific groups like MSM.
2. **Trends in Mpox Cases**: The outbreak in Africa is severe, with a new, more transmissible and deadly variant (Clade Ib). However, the US has not reported any cases of this variant, and the CDC has stated that the risk of spread to the US is low due to limited travel connections.
3. **CDC's Response and Monitoring**: The CDC is actively monitoring the situation and updating its risk assessment every two weeks or as needed. This suggests a proactive approach to detecting any changes in risk.
4. **Historical Patterns**: The 2022 mpox outbreak in the US was contained relatively quickly, and the current outbreak in Africa has not yet shown signs of spreading to the US.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The CDC's current assessment and the lack of cases of the new variant in the US suggest that the risk is unlikely to escalate significantly in the next five weeks.
- **Outside View**: Historical patterns of infectious disease outbreaks suggest that while new variants can spread rapidly, containment measures and vaccination efforts can mitigate risks. The US has a robust public health infrastructure, which reduces the likelihood of a sudden escalation in risk.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The new variant in Africa is concerning, but the CDC's assessment and the lack of cases in the US suggest that the risk is currently low. Overreacting to the African outbreak without evidence of spread to the US would be premature.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Increasing Risk**: The new variant is more transmissible and deadly, and the outbreak in Africa is severe. Cross-border travel could theoretically introduce the variant to the US.
- **Forces Decreasing Risk**: The US has limited direct travel connections to affected regions, a robust public health response system, and no reported cases of the new variant. The CDC is actively monitoring the situation.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend shows no evidence of the new variant spreading to the US. The CDC's assessment is stable, and there are no signs of an imminent escalation in risk.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small chance that the new variant could spread to the US, but the likelihood is low given the current evidence. The CDC's assessment is unlikely to change significantly in the next five weeks.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While it is possible that the risk could increase, the current evidence does not support a high probability of the CDC's assessment exceeding "High" before October 1, 2024.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical outbreaks have shown that initial assessments can change, but the CDC's proactive monitoring and the lack of cases in the US suggest that the current assessment is reliable.

### Final Assessment
Based on the CDC's current assessment, the lack of cases of the new variant in the US, and the robust public health response, the probability of the CDC's assessment exceeding "High" before October 1, 2024, is low.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
