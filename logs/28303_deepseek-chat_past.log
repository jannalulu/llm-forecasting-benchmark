To forecast whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be greater than $3.10 on September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I do not have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this question. However, I can analyze the current trends and expert opinions from the provided news articles.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Current Gas Price Trends**: The national average gas price as of September 2024 is around $3.20, down from a peak of $3.33 in April 2024. Prices have been declining due to low demand, falling crude oil prices, and the switch to cheaper winter-blend gasoline.
2. **Seasonal Trends**: Historically, gas prices tend to decline after Labor Day due to reduced demand and the switch to winter-blend fuel.
3. **Potential Disruptions**: Experts warn of possible disruptions such as hurricanes or economic surges that could reverse the downward trend.
4. **Crude Oil Prices**: Crude oil prices are currently low, around $70 per barrel, which is a significant factor in the declining gas prices.
5. **Expert Predictions**: Analysts predict that the national average could drop below $3 per gallon by late October, but this is contingent on no major disruptions.

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The current trend shows a steady decline in gas prices, with the national average at $3.20 as of September 2024. Experts predict further declines, potentially below $3 by late October.
- **Outside View**: Historically, gas prices tend to decline in the fall, but external factors like hurricanes or economic changes can cause fluctuations.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
The evidence strongly suggests a downward trend in gas prices, but the possibility of disruptions (e.g., hurricanes) introduces uncertainty. I will weigh the current trend heavily but account for potential disruptions.

### Step 5: Look for Clashing Causal Forces
- **Downward Forces**: Low demand, falling crude oil prices, and the switch to winter-blend gasoline.
- **Upward Forces**: Potential hurricanes, economic surges, or geopolitical events that could disrupt supply.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
Assuming no major disruptions, the current trend suggests that gas prices will continue to decline, potentially reaching below $3 by late October. However, the question is about September 30, 2024, so the decline may not be as steep by then.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
There is a high degree of certainty that gas prices will continue to decline, but the exact rate and potential for disruptions introduce some uncertainty.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
I will avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the potential for disruptions, but I will also avoid underconfidence by recognizing the strong downward trend.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
I will be cautious of hindsight bias and ensure that my forecast is based on current data and trends rather than past patterns that may not apply.

### Final Forecast
Given the current trend of declining gas prices, the switch to winter-blend gasoline, and low crude oil prices, it is likely that the national average gas price will be below $3.10 on September 30, 2024. However, the possibility of disruptions introduces some uncertainty.

- **Expert Predictions**: Analysts like Patrick De Haan (GasBuddy) and Andrew Gross (AAA) predict that the national average could drop below $3 per gallon by late 2024, driven by low demand, falling oil prices, and the transition to winter-blend fuel.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Price Trend**: The national average price as of September 20, 2024, is $3.20, down from a peak of $3.33 in April 2024. Prices have been declining steadily, with 18 states already below $3 per gallon.
2. **Seasonal Factors**: The end of summer typically leads to lower gas prices due to reduced travel and the switch to winter-blend fuel, which is cheaper to produce.
3. **Oil Prices**: Crude oil prices are at multi-year lows, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at $70 per barrel, down 19% from the 2024 high. Lower oil prices directly reduce gasoline production costs.
4. **Demand and Supply**: Gasoline demand is at a six-week low, and domestic gasoline stocks are increasing, further pressuring prices downward.
5. **Potential Disruptions**: While the current outlook is positive, potential disruptions like hurricanes or geopolitical events could reverse the trend. However, the 2024 hurricane season has been relatively calm so far.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The current data and trends strongly suggest that prices will continue to decline, potentially falling below $3.10 by September 30, 2024.
- **Outside View**: Historical patterns and expert consensus support the likelihood of prices falling below $3.10, given the seasonal and economic factors at play.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for Lower Prices**: The consistent decline in prices, low demand, falling oil prices, and the transition to winter-blend fuel all point to lower prices.
- **Weak Evidence for Higher Prices**: Potential disruptions like hurricanes or geopolitical events could cause temporary spikes, but these are unlikely to reverse the overall downward trend.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Downward Forces**: Low demand, falling oil prices, and seasonal factors.
- **Upward Forces**: Potential disruptions (e.g., hurricanes, geopolitical events).

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current trend continues, prices are likely to fall below $3.10 by September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a high degree of confidence in the downward trend, but some uncertainty remains due to potential disruptions.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the evidence strongly supports lower prices, it is prudent to account for the small possibility of disruptions.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overconfidence in the downward trend could lead to underestimating the impact of potential disruptions. However, the current calm hurricane season and stable geopolitical environment reduce this risk.

### Final Forecast
Given the strong downward trend, low demand, falling oil prices, and seasonal factors, the most likely outcome is that the national average retail price of regular gasoline will be below $3.10 on September 30, 2024. However, to account for potential disruptions, I will assign a small probability to the price being above $3.10.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.
