**INT. FUTURISTIC NEWSROOM - DAY (OCTOBER 2, 2024)**

The camera pans over a group of SUPERFORECASTERS, huddled around a table, papers scattered. A large screen displays "IMO 2024 Results."

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** (leaning back, contemplative) "So, did it happen?"

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** (checking notes) "Our models had it at 12.34%."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** "Close, but not quite. The LLM scored silver, just like the bespoke AI last year."

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** (nodding) "Interesting. The constraints were tough—no internet search, just pure processing."

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** "And yet, it was publicly accessible. A feat in itself."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** (smiling) "Next year, maybe? The progress is undeniable."

As they continue discussing, the screen flashes news articles about the event, highlighting the LLM's near-gold achievement.

**FADE OUT.**

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, diverse in background, gather around a table cluttered with laptops and newspapers. The atmosphere is tense yet hopeful.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, did it happen? Did a publicly-available LLM achieve gold at the IMO?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No, not this time. Our models had it at 12.34%. Close, but not quite there.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Still, the progress is remarkable. Closed-source systems were just a point off last year.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(nodding)  
True. And the fact that we're even discussing this possibility is a testament to how far AI has come.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Well, there's always next year. Imagine the headlines if it does happen.

They share a laugh, contemplating a future where AI might just conquer the IMO.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, analyzing data. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the LLM achieving gold at the IMO—did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
Right. The bespoke AI came close last year, but domain-general models still lag.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(nods)  
Sure, they're versatile, but this is a specialized challenge. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(gesturing to the board)  
And the constraints—no internet, strict time limits—made it tougher.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(leaning forward)  
Agreed. But progress is rapid. Maybe next year?

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
We’ll keep watching. The landscape's shifting fast.

They nod, gathering their papers, ready to tackle the next prediction.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, analyzing the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday, the world watched as a publicly-available LLM tackled the IMO. But did it achieve gold?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 25.67%. The challenge was immense, considering the constraints.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Remember, closed-source AIs came close last year. But this was a domain-general model, accessible to all.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And without internet searches or bespoke networks. A true test of capability.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
As of August 7, 2024, no breakthroughs hinted at a gold-level performance.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yet, the progress in AI is undeniable. Even a near-miss reshapes our understanding.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
If it didn't happen this year, it's just a matter of time.
