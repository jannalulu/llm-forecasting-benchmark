**Russian Advance Slowing Down: Expert Predicts Minor Tactical Successes**
Russian forces are slowing down their advance, according to military expert Alexander Musiyenko, head of the Center for Military Legal Studies. He believes they will focus on achieving tactical successes in the Donetsk region, specifically in the Pokrovsk direction, and may try to capture Chasiv Yar and advance further. Musiyenko notes that the number of attacks has decreased since the beginning of July, and he does not see opportunities for the Russians to achieve operational or strategic successes. He expects the war to end with minor tactical successes in the Donetsk region, and the Russian advance, which has been ongoing since October 2023, will eventually come to an end.

**Ukrainian Forces Withdraw from Strategic City in Donetsk Region**
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from part of Chasiv Yar, a strategic city in the Donetsk region, after Russia claimed to have taken control of a district in the city. Chasiv Yar is a high-ground location, and if Russia gains full control, it could use it as a stopping point to advance westward towards Ukrainian cities Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that its forces had taken control of the 'Novyi' district, west of the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal, which runs through the eastern part of the city. According to Ukrainian military spokesperson Nazar Voloshyn, 'it became impractical to maintain the canal district after the enemy entered it, as it threatened the lives and health of our military and our defenders' positions were destroyed.' The commander decided to retreat to more protected and prepared positions, but the enemy did not stop its active combat operations there. Russian forces, which launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, have been advancing slowly in the Donetsk region for several weeks and attempted to open a new front near the city of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine. The advance in the Kharkiv region was halted, but Ukrainian military analysts recognize that 2024 has been a difficult year for Ukraine on the battlefield and that delays in receiving military aid from the United States have had an impact.

Ukrainian forces are defending the town, and the situation is described as 'critically difficult' with constant shelling and attacks. Russia is using tactics such as moving infantry into forested areas and then attacking Ukrainian positions in small groups. Ukraine is receiving Western weaponry and ammunition, including a recent $2.3 billion military aid package from the US, which includes artillery rounds, interceptor missiles, and anti-tank weapons.

**Ukrainian Forces Repel Russian Attacks in Chasiv Yar Region**
The Ukrainian military has reported the largest number of attacks in the region of Chasiv Yar since the end of May, with 438 attacks recorded in the past day. The Russian occupiers are focusing their efforts on breaking through Ukrainian defenses west of Bakhmut to reach the Chasiv Yar and create conditions for further advancement towards the Kramatorsk agglomeration. 'The situation around Chasiv Yar is such that the defense forces control the situation, and active battles are taking place daily,' said a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military. The Russian occupiers have been conducting storming operations on several fronts, including the capture of Avdiivka in Donetsk region in February 2024. The battle for Chasiv Yar is ongoing. According to The New York Times, Russia has accelerated its offensive on the eastern front and aims to break through the front line before Ukraine receives US aid.

**Russia captures part of a key hilltop town in Ukraine, opening door to further advances**
Russian troops have taken control of parts of the key hilltop town of Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine, which could pose significant problems for Ukrainian forces trying to defend the area. The town's strategic location makes it a gateway to the Donetsk region still under Ukrainian control. Ukrainian forces retreated from the eastern district of Chasiv Yar due to intense Russian attacks and the risk to defending troops. The development is a setback for Ukraine as it focuses on stabilizing the frontlines following months of relentless Russian assaults. The capture of Chasiv Yar could allow Russia to bring in more drones and artillery, giving them an advantageous position to conduct ground and drone strikes on Ukrainian troops.

The soldiers also mentioned that they had enough ammunition to work with, but the pressure is constant, with breakthroughs and attacks. The commander of the mortar battery, Riley, said, 'Now there are no such attacks and no such tension as there was a month and a half ago... But the pressure is constant... breakthroughs, attacks.' The soldiers also shared their daily life, including cooking pasta, talking to their children on the phone, and caring for a kitten.

**Russian Forces Break Through Ukrainian Defense in Chasiv Yar**
Russian forces have taken control of the 'New' microdistrict in Chasiv Yar, a significant tactical success, according to Yan Gagin, a advisor to the head of the Donetsk People's Republic. This breakthrough opens up opportunities for further liberation of the city and breaches the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian military has taken control of the area, and the Russian Defense Ministry announced that the operation was carried out by the Southern Group of Forces. The military expert Anatoly Matviyuk believes that Russia may take control of Chasiv Yar by mid-July, as it is the last microdistrict with a strong defense organized by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. After taking control of the area, Russia may clear the city and ease the approach to the administrative borders of the Donetsk People's Republic.

**Breakthrough Achieved: 'Kanal' Microdistrict in Chasiv Yar Fully Under Russian Control**
The Ukrainian defense has been breached, and the 'Kanal' microdistrict in Chasiv Yar has been fully taken over by the Russian army.

According to updated information from the scene, the cleanup in the 'Kanal' microdistrict is ongoing, and it is likely that the area will be under Russian control by tomorrow or the day after.

**ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, Map and Update June 28, 2024**
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the production and deployment of nuclear-capable missiles, likely as part of a reflexive control campaign to influence Western decision-making. Ukrainian forces struck targets in Russia, including an oil depot and a microelectronics plant. The Ukrainian Armed Forces reported damaging or destroying over 30 Russian military aircraft in the first six months of 2024. Many Russian elites have shifted from criticizing the war effort to supporting it, and Russian officials called for harsher punishments in response to terrorist attacks. Russia may be creating a shadow fleet to transport LNG and circumvent sanctions. Ukrainian forces regained lost positions near Vovchansk and Kreminna, while Russian forces advanced near Chasiv Yar. According to Russian opposition outlet Vazhnye Istorii, over 71,000 Russian men died in the war in Ukraine in 2022 and 2023.

**British Expert: Loss of Chasiv Yar and Konstantinovka Could Allow Russian Forces to Reach Dnieper**
British expert Alexander Merkuris believes that if Ukrainian forces lose the cities of Chasiv Yar and Konstantinovka, it will give the Russian Armed Forces the opportunity to advance to the Dnieper River without needing to take control of Kramatorsk. According to Merkuris, Chasiv Yar is located on a hill that offers a view of Konstantinovka, which he believes cannot be defended without controlling Chasiv Yar. Previously, Igor Kimakovsky, an advisor to the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, stated that Ukrainian forces lost over 1,000 soldiers during the defense of eastern Chasiv Yar, with a significant portion of the territory already under Russian control.

The situation around Chasiv Yar is critical, with Ukrainian forces trying to hold off the Russian advance. If the Russians capture Chasiv Yar, they will begin an offensive on Konstantinovka, Druzhkovka, Kramatorsk, and Sviatohirsk.
