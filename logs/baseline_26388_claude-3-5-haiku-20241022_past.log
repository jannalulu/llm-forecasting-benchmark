Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Considerations:
1. Tennis Olympic Format:
- Singles tournament
- Men's/Women's doubles
- Mixed doubles
- Potential for athletes to compete in multiple formats

2. Historical Precedent:
- In recent Olympics, multi-medal wins in tennis are rare
- Athletes usually specialize in singles or doubles
- Mixed doubles provides an additional medal opportunity

3. Medal Win Likelihood Factors:
- Top tennis players often compete in multiple formats
- High-ranked players might enter singles and doubles
- Mixed doubles requires coordination/partnership

4. 2024 Paris Olympics Specifics:
- Current top players like Djokovic, Swiatek have multi-format potential
- Strong doubles specialists exist
- Some top singles players also excel in doubles

5. Probability Assessment:
- Not extremely common historically
- But structural format allows multi-medal possibility
- Requires significant skill/luck

After careful reasoning, considering historical patterns and current player capabilities, I assess the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 29.90%, but 22.70% being the most likely. Probability: 22.70%.
