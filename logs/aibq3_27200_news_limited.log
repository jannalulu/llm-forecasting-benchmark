**CDC Declares Mpox a Continental Emergency. Can We Prevent a Pandemic?**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases in Africa since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is changing and mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, having new subclades and a higher case fatality rate. The virus spreads through contact, and women and children are disproportionately affected. Walter emphasizes the need for emergency measures, including testing, messaging, and vaccinating, to contain the outbreak before it becomes a global pandemic. She notes that there are few resources available to fight the disease, with only 200,000 doses of vaccine available for African countries compared to a demand of at least 10 million.

**Africa's top health body declares mpox a continental health emergency**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, a 'public health emergency of continental security' due to its rapid spread across multiple African countries. As of August 2024, over 15,000 cases and 461 deaths have been reported, marking a 160 percent rise compared to the same period last year. Jean Kaseya, the director general of Africa CDC, emphasized that this declaration is a critical call to action, stressing the need for proactive measures to contain and eliminate the virus. Kaseya said, 'This declaration is a critical call to action, stressing the need for proactive measures to contain and eliminate the virus.' The outbreak began with the endemic Clade I strain but has since spread to a more transmissible Clade Ib variant, which spreads more easily, particularly among children.

**Africa: Mpox Cases Are Soaring in Africa - What Must Be Done to Prevent a Global Pandemic**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, showing significant differences in case fatality rates. Clade I has a case fatality rate of 3-4%, while clade II has a rate of 0.1%. The virus spreads through contact and is disproportionately affecting women and children, particularly in densely populated, low-income areas. Walter emphasizes the need for urgent measures to contain the epidemic, including educating communities on symptoms and action to take, and increasing vaccine availability.

**Africa CDC Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of Continental Concern**
The Africa CDC has declared Mpox as a 'public health emergency of continental concern'. According to Africa CDC president Jean Kasenya, 'This declaration is not a mere formality, it's a clear call to action. It's a recognition that we can no longer afford to be reactive. We must be proactive and aggressive in our efforts to contain and eliminate this scourge.' The declaration will allow for the release of funds for vaccine access and a coordinated continental response. The announcement comes ahead of a World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee meeting to assess whether to declare the highest level of international health alert for the disease. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans and also through close physical contact with an infected person. Since January 2022, 38,465 cases have been reported in 16 African countries, resulting in 1,456 deaths, with a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year. A new strain, 'Clade Ib', has been detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is more deadly and contagious than previous strains. The 'Clade Ib' strain causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous strains caused localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the spread of the Clade I subtype, mainly limited to western and central African countries, where patients were generally infected by animals. In 2022, a global outbreak, carried by the Clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries where the disease was not endemic, mainly affecting gay and bisexual men. The WHO had declared the highest level of alert in July 2022, but lifted it less than a year later in May 2023, after the outbreak had resulted in around 140 deaths among approximately 90,000 cases.

**Mpox clade 1b outbreak in Central Africa is 'high risk'**
A new type of mpox, called 'clade 1b,' has been detected in Central Africa and is considered a 'high risk' by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). Clade 1b mpox is deadlier and more easily transmissible than previous forms, with mortality rates as high as 10% of infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening an expert committee to advise on whether to declare an international emergency. Between January and July 2024, 14,250 cases and 456 deaths were reported from 10 African countries, with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) being the hotspot of mpox cases, accounting for 96.3% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported this year. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that the risks to the European region are 'very low.' 'Despite a safe and effective vaccine and antiviral treatment against mpox, these are not readily available to most [African Union member states],' wrote Africa CDC in a report on July 30, 2024. 'Thus, we have listed the risk level as high.'

**El Salvador without mpox data amidst new global emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern due to the increase in cases of monkeypox (mpox) in Africa. In El Salvador, the Ministry of Health (MINSAL) has not shared information on the situation of the disease since the last case was reported over a year ago. According to the WHO, 'the appearance of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in the eastern DRC and the notification of cases in several neighboring countries are very concerning.' The WHO has called for a coordinated international response to stop the outbreaks and save lives. In El Salvador, there are no public data on the situation of the disease, and the last time the MINSAL reported on patients with mpox was in the 32nd week of last year (August 6-12). The WHO declared a global emergency on July 23, 2022, due to the rapid spread of the disease in several parts of the world. The first case in El Salvador was announced on August 30, 2022, and the second case was reported on September 10, 2022. The MINSAL has not provided information on the current situation of the disease, and a specialist in tropical diseases, Alfonso Rosales, has criticized the lack of information, saying '¿Será que no tienen casos o será que ya no les interesa?' (Will it be that they don't have cases or that they are no longer interested?). The WHO has recommended that countries take precautions and apply the two doses of the vaccine against the disease. 'La mayoría de casos han sido en hombres' (Most cases have been in men), according to a campaign launched by the Ministry of Health. The mpox is a disease caused by a virus of the same name, a species of the genus 'Orthopoxvirus' with two different genetic clades: I and II. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explain that the clade type I causes the most severe disease and deaths, while the clade II is the cause of the 2022 outbreak, with less severe infections. The mpox can cause a painful rash, lymph node inflammation, and fever. The CDC says that most people recover from the disease, but in some cases, it can become severe, especially in people with weakened immune systems, children under 1 year, people with a history of eczema, and pregnant women. The disease is transmitted from person to person through direct contact with infected skin lesions or other areas such as the mouth and genitals. The contagion is not only through sexual contact, but also through face-to-face contact (talking and breathing), skin-to-skin contact (touching or having vaginal or anal sex), mouth-to-mouth contact (kissing), respiratory droplets or aerosols of short range. Also, there is the transmission of animals to humans through bites or scratches, or while hunting, skinning, handling corpses, cooking or eating infected animals. The WHO has called for a coordinated international response to stop the outbreaks and save lives.

**Africa CDC Declares Mpox Outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, reports The Guardian. The outbreak has affected several African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the virus, previously known as monkeypox, was first identified in humans in 1970. As of August 4, there have been 38,465 reported cases and 1,456 deaths in Africa since January 2022. This is the first time the Africa CDC has used its authority to declare a health emergency on the continent, granted to it in 2022. The declaration is expected to help mobilize funds and resources to combat the spread of the disease at an early stage. The announcement comes ahead of a World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee meeting today, which will decide whether to declare a global health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alarm that the WHO can sound. In May 2022, the number of monkeypox cases surged worldwide, primarily affecting men who have sex with men, due to the Clade IIb strain. This led the WHO to declare a global health emergency of international concern, which lasted from July 2022 to May 2023, resulting in around 140 deaths and approximately 90,000 cases. More on mpox Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease caused by a virus that is transmitted from infected animals to humans, but can also be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact. The disease causes fever, muscle pain, and large skin lesions similar to pustules. There are two subtypes of the virus: 'According to the World Health Organization, the mpox outbreak has caused significant concern, with the Africa CDC declaring it a public health emergency of international concern. As WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'This is a wake-up call for all of us to take action to prevent the spread of this disease.'

**The mpox outbreak never ended in Africa. Now a deadlier strain is spreading.**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared mpox a continent-wide public health emergency due to ongoing outbreaks in multiple African countries. The declaration comes as a deadlier strain of mpox is spreading across borders in Africa. The mpox virus, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease that spreads through close contact with an infected person. The virus has been around for decades, but a sudden surge in cases in 2022 led to a global pandemic. While most countries outside of Africa have contained the outbreak, large outbreaks continue in west and central Africa. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is experiencing the worst outbreak, with 7,851 cases and 384 deaths reported as of May 2024. The DRC is also the only country where the more severe clade I type of mpox is spreading. Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya said, 'We declare today this public health emergency of continental security to mobilize our institutions, our collective will, and our resources to act swiftly and decisively.' However, outbreak response efforts in the DRC and other African countries have been hampered by a lack of global solidarity and an unwillingness to share life-saving resources. The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that a new mpox clade I variant, tentatively called clade IB, has been discovered in the DRC. The WHO has not confirmed if the new variant causes more severe disease or can be spread more easily. Rosamund Lewis, the mpox technical lead at the WHO, suggests that genetic mutations are not behind the sudden global surge of mpox, but rather the virus happened to start infecting new populations. Mpox is reminiscent of the origins of HIV, when chimpanzees infected humans in southwestern Cameroon. The dual burden of mpox and HIV is a major factor that prompted the Africa CDC to declare the mpox outbreaks a continental emergency. There is at least one vaccine, Jynneos, that is effective against mpox, but it is only now starting to trickle into the DRC, where only 200,000 doses are available for a population of over 100 million people.

**Africa CDC Declares Public Health Emergency Due to Mpox Epidemic**
The Africa CDC has declared 'a public health emergency', the highest level of alert, due to the mpox epidemic affecting several countries in the continent, announced the agency's director on Tuesday. The mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans, but also transmits through close physical contact with an infected person. 'The mpox has already crossed borders, affecting thousands of people on our continent,' said Africa CDC President Jean Kaseya in a press conference. 'We declare mpox a continental public health emergency,' he added. This announcement, which will facilitate the release of funds for access to vaccines and a continental response, occurs before the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee meeting to evaluate whether to declare the highest level of alert internationally for this disease. A total of 38,465 cases were registered in 16 African countries since January 2022, and 1,456 deaths. There was a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by Africa CDC. The United States stated on Tuesday that it maintains 'close coordination' with the DRC, other affected countries, and health organizations. 'We are closely monitoring the spread of mpox in Central Africa. We are pleased to see international leadership in this region,' said Vedant Patel, spokesperson for the Department of State. The continent is facing the spread of a new strain, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in September 2023 and called 'Clade Ib', which is more deadly and transmissible than previous ones. 'Clade Ib' causes skin eruptions on the body, while previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions in the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the DRC (formerly Zaire), with the spread of a clade I subtype (whose new variant is a mutation) and was regularly transmitted through contact with animals. In 2022, a global epidemic, caused by the clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries and caused 140 deaths out of 90,000 cases.

**Africa CDC Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency**
The Africa CDC has declared a 'public health emergency' due to the growing mpox outbreak on the continent. This is the highest level of alert, and it comes with a 'clear call to action' to contain the spread of the disease. Since January 2022, there have been 38,465 cases of mpox in 16 African countries, resulting in 1,456 deaths. The number of cases has increased by 160% in 2024 compared to the previous year. The president of the Africa CDC, Jean Kasenya, stated, 'The mpox has now crossed borders, affecting thousands of people across our continent (...) I announce, with a heavy heart but with an unwavering commitment to our people, to our African citizens, that we declare mpox as a continental public health emergency.' This declaration will allow for the release of funds for vaccine access and a coordinated response across the continent. The announcement comes ahead of the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee meeting to assess whether to declare the highest level of international health alert for the disease. The Africa CDC has detected a new, more deadly and transmissible strain of the virus, known as 'Clade Ib', which has been spreading across the continent. According to the Africa CDC, the virus has a mortality rate above 3% and children under 15 years old are the most affected, representing at least 60% of cases. Mpox is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans and can also be transmitted through close physical contact with an infected person. The 'Clade Ib' strain causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas.

**New Strain of Mpox Spreading in Africa Has CDC Concerned**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning to US doctors to be on the lookout for a more severe strain of mpox, known as the clade 1 strain, which is spreading in parts of Africa. The strain has not been reported outside of central and eastern Africa, but the CDC is concerned about the likelihood of additional spread. According to the CDC, the risk of clade I mpox importation to the United States is considered to be very low due to limited travel and lack of direct commercial flights from affected countries. However, mpox cases have soared by 160% in Africa this year, with 14,250 cases reported so far. The majority of cases and deaths have been in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where nearly 70% of cases have been in children under the age of 15. Doctors Without Borders have called the outbreak 'worrying' and are pleading for vaccines to arrive in the country as soon as possible. The CDC has recommended that doctors consider this more dangerous strain of mpox in patients who have recently been in the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighboring countries. Mpox symptoms can include rashes, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, muscle aches, and respiratory symptoms. A study is being conducted to see if giving people an mpox shot after exposure can help prevent severe illness and death.

**Mpox clade 1b outbreak in Central Africa is 'high risk'**
A new type of mpox, called 'clade 1b,' has been detected in Central Africa and is considered a 'high risk' by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). Clade 1b mpox is deadlier and more easily transmissible than previous forms, with mortality rates as high as 10% of infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening an expert committee to advise on whether to declare an international emergency. Between January and July 2024, 14,250 cases and 456 deaths were reported from 10 African countries, with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) being the hotspot of mpox cases, accounting for 96.3% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported this year. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that the risks to the European region are 'very low.'

**US issues second health alert for mpox virus in Congo**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a second health alert due to the spread of a deadly type of the mpox virus, Clade I, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening an emergency committee to discuss whether the current outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern. The outbreak has already seen around 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths, mostly children, since the beginning of 2023. The CDC stated that the risk of Clade I infection spreading in the US is very low.
