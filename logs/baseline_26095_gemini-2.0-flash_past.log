Okay, let's analyze the question: "Will Individual Neutral Athletes Win ≥15 Gold Medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics?"

The key aspects are:

*   **Individual Neutral Athletes:** This refers to athletes participating without representing a specific nation, likely due to sanctions or other political circumstances. The primary example right now is athletes from Russia and Belarus.
*   **≥15 Gold Medals:** The threshold we need to consider.
*   **Paris 2024 Olympics:** The specific event.
*   **Current Date:** July 12, 2024. The Olympics start on July 26, 2024. So the games are about to begin.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Uncertainty about Participation:** The exact number of Individual Neutral Athletes participating is uncertain. It depends on qualification standards being met, and on any last-minute rulings or changes in policy by the IOC or other sports federations.

2.  **Historical Data (Limited Applicability):** There isn't much directly relevant historical data. Prior Olympics haven't had this specific category of "Individual Neutral Athletes" in this context (i.e., due to sanctions of specific countries). We can look at the medal counts of Russia and Belarus in past Olympics as a very rough guide, but this needs to be adjusted downwards due to the reduced number of athletes participating under this designation.

3.  **Talent Distribution:** Athletes from Russia and Belarus are traditionally strong in certain sports (e.g., gymnastics, wrestling, weightlifting, swimming, track and field). If a significant number of top athletes from these countries are allowed to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, they *could* potentially win a significant number of medals. However, restrictions are likely in place that would exclude the top medal contenders, since they are unlikely to meet the eligibility criteria.

4.  **Impact of Restrictions:** The IOC and individual sport federations have imposed eligibility criteria for neutral athletes, often requiring them not to have actively supported the war in Ukraine or be affiliated with the military. These restrictions will likely reduce the number of potential medal contenders.

5.  **Number of Events:** Consider the total number of gold medals to be awarded across all sports. Then think of the maximum possible number of Individual Neutral Athletes participating in all those different sports, with a view towards how many might be competitive in their respective fields. This is a large Olympics, but 15 gold medals is still a substantial number to capture.

6.  **Timing:** Given the games start in just a few weeks, the overall participation number of Individual Neutral Athletes, and which sports they will be contesting, should be becoming much more apparent. There will be considerable information available in the next two weeks before the games, and the probability can be updated then.

7.  **Updated analysis** Based on available information, the number of athletes who qualified as Individual Neutral Athletes are limited. The restrictions imposed have significantly reduced the pool of athletes who are eligible to compete.

**Forecast:**

Given the factors above, I think that it is unlikely that Individual Neutral Athletes will win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics. Restrictions and limited participation will make achieving that number difficult.

My Prediction: Between 2.00% and 8.00%, but 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.
