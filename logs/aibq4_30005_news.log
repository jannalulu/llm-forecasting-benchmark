**Dogecoin price hits 3-year peak as Tesla's $1T Rally drives Elon Musk's Wealth to $300B**
Elon Musk's wealth has surged past $300 billion, with a net worth of $304 billion, according to Forbes data. This is partly due to Tesla's 30% share price increase since the election win, which has also seen Dogecoin's price surge by 100.9%. As a result, Dogecoin has outperformed other popular digital assets, including BTC, ETH, and SOL. According to FXEmpire.com, Dogecoin's price is expected to advance towards the $0.30 level in the coming weeks, with a strong buyer dominance. The article notes that the chances of a major sell-off before Donald Trump's second inauguration on January 20, 2025, are slim, given the current market dynamics and political landscape.

**Dogecoin (DOGE) Sets Sights on $0.150: Will The Rally Take Off?**
Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing positive signs and might clear the $0.1450 resistance level. The price has started a fresh increase above the $0.1320 resistance level and is trading above the $0.1350 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. According to the article, if DOGE clears the $0.1450 and $0.1465 resistance levels, it could gain bullish momentum. The bulls are active above the $0.1350 level, and there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1420 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $0.1480 level, and a close above this level might send the price toward the $0.1520 resistance. However, if DOGE fails to climb above the $0.1465 level, it could start another decline, with initial support on the downside near the $0.1420 level.

**Dogecoin Price Forecast: $1 Seems Unlikely as PEPE and Another Rival Token Under $0.10 Attract DOGE Investors**
Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to reach its target of $1 due to its inflationary structure and competition from other tokens such as PEPE and Rexas Finance (RXS). Experts predict that DOGE will close at around $0.30 in 2024, which is still far below the desired $1 goal. PEPE, a new token based on the meme craze, has been rapidly capturing the market and attracting investors away from DOGE. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, offers tokenization of physical assets and has promised a $1 million giveaway to its participants in the presale. The project has already shown a 66% return to early backers and is projected to reach $11.2 by 2025. As more investors diversify into these alternatives, the target of $1 for DOGE becomes increasingly difficult to achieve.

**Dogecoin (DOGE) Rockets 48%: Traders Eye $1 Price Target as Elon Musk Endorses Rally**
Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen a significant 48% price increase, with traders eyeing a $1 price target. The rally is linked to support from Elon Musk, who has mentioned creating a 'Department of Government Efficiency' (D.O.G.E) in the Trump administration. DOGE has traded above $0.41, its highest level since May 2021, and has returned over 150% of its gain to investors in the last week. Open Interest (OI) has also climbed close to a lifetime high, suggesting a more bullish price outlook. Analysts believe that DOGE could easily reach the $1 mark, with some even predicting targets of $2 to $4 or $30 by March 2025.

**Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis: Critical Juncture for Breakthrough**
Dogecoin (DOGE) has been making a comeback in the cryptocurrency market, with analysts predicting a potential price surge in 2025. However, Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as a strong competitor by focusing on real-asset tokenization. While DOGE is currently priced at $0.19 with a market capitalization of over $28 billion, RXS is gaining attention with its successful presale and innovative features, positioning itself for long-term growth. Analysts predict a wide range of opinions for 2025, with projections ranging from a minimum price of $0.130 to a maximum price of $0.274. In contrast, RXS is priced under $0.07 and offers promising features such as asset tokenization and real estate investment integration. As Rexas Finance aims to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry, it presents a solid alternative to Dogecoin, offering realistic value and long-term growth potential.

**Could Dogecoin Hit $3 as a Golden Cross Appears on the Horizon?**
Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a bullish wave, with analysts divided over its potential. Some, like Kevin Capital, predict a more conservative peak of $1.80, while others, like Dima James, see potential for a much higher rally, possibly up to $10. The recent surge in Dogecoin's price comes at the heels of political developments, with Elon Musk's influence continuing to play a crucial role in the crypto space. A 'Golden Cross' is appearing on Dogecoin's weekly chart, a bullish technical indicator that hasn't appeared in four years. If history repeats itself, DOGE could experience a brief cooldown followed by a parabolic rally in December 2024, extending into the spring of 2025. Analysts are closely watching key technical patterns, including the 50-day EMA at $0.189 and the RSI at 74, signaling overbought conditions. 'If DOGE closes above $0.18 on its weekly chart, it could trigger a parabolic rally similar to past bull runs,' said James. 'In both the 2016 and 2021 cycles, Dogecoin saw gains of 8,000% and 18,000%, respectively, after crossing this threshold.'

Analyst Olivier predicts that the Dogecoin price could reach a new all-time high (ATH) in a few weeks if it breaks above $0.23. According to Olivier's chart, Dogecoin will rally to a temporary ATH at $1.6, then to $3.7, and eventually to $32 by May 2025. Other analysts, including Ali Martinez and Trader Tardigrade, also predict a significant increase in the Dogecoin price, with Martinez suggesting a potential rally to $23 and Trader Tardigrade predicting a rise to at least $6 or possibly $10. Martinez also notes that Dogecoin is currently consolidating within a descending triangle and that a break above the $0.198 resistance could spark a 10% rally to $0.220.

**Dogecoin Gains 26% This Week; Will DOGE Price Revisit the $0.27 Barrier?**
Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged 26% this week, reaching $0.2025, with a market cap of $29.71 billion and trading volume of $3.99 billion. As it approaches the $0.2290 resistance level, traders speculate it could revisit the $0.27 barrier last tested in late 2021. A Golden Cross on the daily chart and a decisive surpassing of the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level suggest intense buying pressure and a potential upward breakout. The token's weekly price action shows robust support above $0.14, and on-chain metrics reveal approximately 88.64% of addresses are 'In the Money' at $0.2019, reducing the likelihood of immediate sell-offs. If DOGE breaks through the $0.2290 resistance level, it could easily climb to $0.27, but a temporary pullback is possible if it fails to surpass this level.

**Dogecoin eyes 30% gain as market 'prices in' potential Trump victory**
Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen a 12% rise in the past 24 hours and a 65% gain since October 1. Analyst Master Kenobi believes that DOGE is 'strategically positioned' for a potential Republican victory in the US presidential election, which could lead to a 30% rise in the crypto asset. According to Kenobi, DOGE's long-term target is around $11 in 2025, representing a 6,447% return on investment. New DOGE addresses have spiked by 100%, and a victory for Trump could trigger a short-term DOGE rally. From a technical perspective, DOGE's daily chart is already 'pricing in' a Trump victory, and a daily close above $0.174 could clear the path to a 35% hike toward $0.23.

**Dogecoin Price Will Cross $0.74 ATH by December, Rexas Finance (RXS) Holders Eye 15900% ROI in Q1 2025, While Shiba Inu Could Lose Momentum at $0.000034 | Bitcoinist.com**
Dogecoin's price trajectory suggests it could return to its 2021 all-time high of $0.74 by the end of the year, with analysts theorizing it could even top this high. Rexas Finance (RXS) has potential to grow, with some analysts stating it could provide a 15,900% return by Q1 2025. However, Shiba Inu may dip as there are few signs that it can slow down at $0.000034. Dogecoin's engagement from the wider community and market dynamics boost the hope that it can grow, much to the eagerness for long-term holders to gain more in the future. The public presale of Rexas Finance was a big success, raising $5.7 million in a few days, and investors are flocking to RXS presale because they see it as a high-potential asset. Shiba Inu may have difficulty keeping the momentum up, and $0.000034 stands out as crucial resistance.

Martinez's projection is based on a bull flag pattern forming on Dogecoin's four-hour chart, which suggests a continuation of the upward trend.

The price target for Dogecoin is set at approximately $0.209, representing a 29% rally from its current price.

Predicting Dogecoin's price reaching $1 is speculative, but some analysts provide estimates. For 2024, the lowest predictions are $0.078 and the highest are $0.17.

**Dogecoin Price Falls Back to $0.15 Support Level**
The Dogecoin (DOGE) price has fallen back to the important support level of $0.15 after a strong rally in the past weeks. The price had reached a high of $0.22 in January 2024, but then fell back to the $0.1 support level. However, it was able to recover and reached a high of $0.18 in October, a 80% increase in value. The price has since fallen back to the $0.15 level, but many analysts believe that it will not fall below $0.14 and will instead consolidate at the $0.15 level. If it is able to break through the $0.18 level, it could reach a new all-time high of $0.23. However, some analysts believe that a new all-time high is unlikely due to increased competition from other meme coins such as PEPU.

**If You Invested $1,000 In Dogecoin On Jan. 1, 2021, Here's How Much You'd Have Today**
As Dogecoin starts to recover in 2024, let's look back at how much investors could have made by investing in the coin at the start of 2021. At that time, social media buzz, Google Trends spikes, and new exchange listings fueled its rapid rise. Dogecoin opened for trading on Jan. 1, 2021 at $0.00468 and hit a high of $0.005685 on that day. A $1,000 investment at the time could have purchased 175,901.50 DOGE based on the highest price that day. Elon Musk's tweets would often result in heightened trading activity and a rise in Dogecoin's price, with the coin peaking at $0.7376 in May 2021. However, investors who bought Dogecoin shortly before the SNL episode aired or in the latter part of 2021 may be down on their current position.

**Analyst Says Dogecoin Is The Most Obvious Play Of This Cycle, Here’s Why | TheSpuzz**
Market expert Crow believes that Dogecoin (DOGE) is the most obvious play of this cycle, citing past trends and patterns that suggest a significant price rally is imminent. According to Crow, DOGE has formed a Descending Triangle pattern, which has been playing out for three years, and has broken out on the upside, indicating a possible huge leg up to challenge multiple resistance levels. With DOGE currently trading at $0.17, Crow predicts that it could reach the pivotal $1 price mark by the end of 2025. However, some investors and traders may be selling off their holdings, leading to a decline in daily trading volume, which could cause the meme coin's upward momentum to lose steam and lead to a correction in the coming days.

**Dogecoin (DOGE) Rockets Ahead: Will the Rally Hold?**
Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged over 20% and is trading above the $0.1650 support zone. To continue higher, DOGE must clear the $0.1780 resistance. According to the article, 'A close above the $0.1780 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1800 resistance.' However, if DOGE fails to climb above the $0.1780 level, it could start another decline. The main support sits at $0.1630, and a downside break below this level could lead to a decline toward the $0.1500 level or even $0.1420 in the near term. Technical indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, are also showing bullish signs.

**Will Dogecoin Price Surge 25% by October End? Analyst Shares Insights**
A crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, believes that Dogecoin's price could surge 25% by the end of October, breaking out from the $0.143 resistance region. According to Martinez, the current pullback is forming a bull-flag pattern, which could allow buyers to recuperate and drive a high-momentum rally. Large Dogecoin holders have increased their holdings, accumulating an additional 17.64 million DOGE, which could signal heightened confidence in DOGE's future price potential. The Dogecoin price prediction shows a sharp recovery starting from $0.10, breaching a key resistance at $0.12 and reaching a high of $0.149, a 48% increase. A recent bullish crossover between the 50-and-200-day EMA could increase the buyer's dominance for a sustained rally.

**Dogecoin Price On The Verge Of Closing First Weekly Golden Cross In 4 Years And Running 200% | TheSpuzz**
The Dogecoin price is on the verge of its first weekly golden cross in four years, a rare and bullish technical pattern. According to TradingView analysis, this could signal a massive surge in the Dogecoin price, potentially reaching a 200% rally. Historically, a golden cross has coincided with a remarkable bull run, catapulting Dogecoin to an all-time high of $0.7316. If the current setup mirrors the bullish momentum of 2021, Dogecoin could break past multiple price resistances and create a new all-time high. However, the analyst notes that there are no price targets, and the outcome would depend on Dogecoin's ability to hold above $0.14 and sustain momentum above the 200-week moving average.

**Dogecoin (DOGE) Sets Sights on $0.150: Will The Rally Take Off?**
Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing positive signs and might clear the $0.1450 resistance level. The price has started a fresh increase above the $0.1320 resistance level and is trading above the $0.1350 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. According to the article, if DOGE clears the $0.1450 and $0.1465 resistance levels, it could gain bullish momentum. The bulls are active above the $0.1350 level, and there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1420 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $0.1480 level, and a close above this level might send the price toward the $0.1520 resistance. However, if DOGE fails to climb above the $0.1465 level, it could start another decline, with initial support on the downside near the $0.1420 level.

**Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Return to Its $80 Billion Market Cap Peak By January 2025?**
Dogecoin (DOGE) peaked at $80 billion market value in 2021 but has since plummeted. Despite predictions that 2025 may see the next bull market, DOGE's inflationary supply model, which generates over 5 billion new tokens yearly, makes it difficult for the coin to recover. Analysts predict DOGE may hit $1 in 2025, but it would need to fight with other well-established and up-and-coming cryptocurrencies for investor interest. Rexas Finance (RXS), on the other hand, offers a simpler approach to generating value by tokenizing real-world assets, a market predicted to expand greatly as blockchain technology develops. RXS has the potential to gain traction in the asset tokenization market and may surpass Dogecoin by January 2025.

**Dogecoin Price At Risk As DOGE's Adoption Continues To Decline**
The Dogecoin price has dropped 2.5% to $0.1131, and the number of active addresses has fallen significantly. According to Santiment, the number of Dogecoin holders has decreased by 106,600 since October 8th. Market analysts believe that the recent trends show favorable indications for an upward trend, with some predicting that the price could reach $0.20. However, the MVRV metric indicates that Dogecoin is currently overbought, potentially leading to a sell-off and price drop. Despite this, forecasts suggest that Dogecoin's price could see a fair appreciation in 2024, with predictions ranging between $0.12 and $0.25, and could reach $0.22 to $0.50 by 2025 due to increased adoption, momentum, and partnerships.

**Dogecoin Sees Highest Active Address Count in Eight Months, Fueling Speculation of Price Increase**
The number of active Dogecoin addresses has reached its highest level since January 2024, with 2.07 billion DOGE accumulated in the last week. This indicates a growing interest in Dogecoin. The surge in active addresses, reaching 133,880, suggests that more traders are using Dogecoin, creating a foundation for further price fluctuations. Despite increased activity, the DOGE price has remained relatively stable, ranging between $0.101 and $0.115 in the last few weeks. The continuous rise in network activity, typically associated with higher transaction volumes, has led to speculation that Dogecoin is on the verge of a price increase. However, the market remains cautious, with investors waiting for a clear breakout above the critical resistance of $0.116. If Dogecoin surpasses this level, it could trigger a more robust upward trend. On the other hand, if it falls below, support levels near $0.098 or $0.088 could lead to a stronger decline. The increase in active addresses may indicate growing dynamics, pointing to Dogecoin's enduring attractiveness, especially considering the recent surge in short-term trader activity on the meme currency market. Additionally, whale investors have accumulated 2.07 billion DOGE, the largest amount since January 2024, demonstrating increasing interest from key holders and providing hope for a longer run of the coins. Furthermore, the number of new Dogecoin addresses has increased by 72%, reflecting the growing popularity of the token in recent weeks. As of the article's creation, DOGE is trading around $0.1126, up 1.22% in the last 24 hours, with a daily transaction volume of approximately $664.42 million.

**Dogecoin Sees Highest Active Addresses in 8 Months, Price Remains Stable**
The number of active Dogecoin addresses has reached its highest level in 8 months, with 2.070 million DOGE accumulated last week, the highest since January 2024. This reflects the growing interest in the network. The unexpected increase in active addresses points to a larger number of operators using Dogecoin, setting the stage for new price fluctuations. Although activity has increased, the price of DOGE has remained relatively stable, ranging between $0.101 and $0.115 over the past few weeks. The continuous increase in network activity has led to speculation that Dogecoin could be about to surge. However, the market remains cautious. Investors are eagerly awaiting a clear breakout above the crucial resistance level of $0.116. If Dogecoin surpasses this level, it could trigger a more solid bullish trend, but if it falls short, nearby support levels around $0.098 or as low as $0.088 could lead to a more severe decline. Despite the price's subdued behavior, the increase in active addresses could indicate a bullish impulse. This trend points to Dogecoin's continued attractiveness, given recent reports of the surge in short-term traders' activity in the meme-coin market. In terms of participation in trading, it remains at the forefront among meme-coins, far ahead of other available tokens. Apart from the increase in active addresses, other notable changes have occurred. As we previously highlighted, whale investors have accumulated 2.070 million DOGE this month, the highest amount since January 2024. This broad buying behavior shows the growing interest among major holders and gives hope for the expansion of the coin's circulation. Additionally, the creation of new Dogecoin addresses has increased by 72%, reflecting the token's growing popularity over the past few weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE is trading around $0.1126 at the time of writing, and has increased by 1.22% in the last 24 hours. The daily transaction volume is approximately $664.42 million.

**Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: Why Rexas Finance (RXS) Will Hit 25x Before DOGE**
Rexas Finance (RXS) is predicted to have a 25x return by 2025, surpassing Dogecoin (DOGE). According to industry insiders, RXS may increase by 25x to 35x times by 2025, with price ranges of between $1.25 and $2. This is due to its real-world utility, institutional adoption, and presale momentum. RXS tokenizes real-world assets, offering a new market worth $2.4 trillion by 2027. In contrast, Dogecoin has little practical value beyond being a meme currency. As RXS is still in the presale stage, selling for $0.05, it has the potential for huge returns. The author concludes that Rexas Finance is a revolutionary project with vast potential compared to every single other token, including Dogecoin.

**Dogecoin miners ease selling pressure – What this means for DOGE**
Dogecoin miners are holding onto their coins for extended periods, indicating low selling pressure. This calm period may precede a significant price rise, as historical trends suggest. A closer look at Dogecoin's weekly chart shows it may enter a growth phase, potentially reaching $0.15 by the end of 2024, $0.5 by March 2025, or even $0.75 by the end of that year. Dogecoin whales, holding over $10 million in DOGE, have increased their holdings by 1.25%, strengthening the bullish outlook. Traders should approach DOGE cautiously, but with proper timing and strategy, DOGE may be on the verge of a new price spike, driven by increasing whale activity and favorable market conditions.

**Dogecoin Price Forecast: $1 Seems Unlikely as PEPE and Another Rival Token Under $0.10 Attract DOGE Investors**
Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to reach its target of $1 due to its inflationary structure and competition from other tokens such as PEPE and Rexas Finance (RXS). Experts predict that DOGE will close at around $0.30 in 2024, which is still far below the desired $1 goal. PEPE, a new token based on the meme craze, has been rapidly capturing the market and attracting investors away from DOGE. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, offers tokenization of physical assets and has promised a $1 million giveaway to its participants in the presale. The project has already shown a 66% return to early backers and is projected to reach $11.2 by 2025. As more investors diversify into these alternatives, the target of $1 for DOGE becomes increasingly difficult to achieve.
