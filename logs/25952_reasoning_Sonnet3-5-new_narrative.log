Nate: "Well, Philip, yesterday's confirmation wasn't surprising. Our models had it at 12.45%."

Philip: [nodding] "The strategic pact between Macron's centrists and the left wasn't enough to overcome the momentum of Le Pen's coalition. Even with the unprecedented turnout and three-way runoffs, the New Popular Front couldn't secure enough seats to claim the Prime Minister position."

Nate: "Looking back at the data we had by July 10th, the signs were there. The far-right's strong showing in the European elections, combined with the fragmentation of the left-center alliance, made a New Popular Front Prime Minister highly improbable."

Philip: "Indeed. The dissolution of the National Assembly was a gamble that didn't pay off for either the centrists or the left. Our models captured that uncertainty perfectly."

[They both sip their coffee contemplatively]

Nate: "Well, Philip, yesterday's confirmation wasn't surprising. Our models had it at 12.75%."

Philip: [nodding] "Indeed. The strategic pact between Macron's Together and the left wasn't enough to overcome the unprecedented far-right surge we saw in the runoffs. Even with the high turnout and tactical withdrawals, the New Popular Front couldn't secure enough seats to form a government."

Nate: "The data was clear by July 10th. The three-way runoffs fragmented the vote too much, and despite the anti-far-right alliance, the NPF's internal divisions made it nearly impossible for them to secure the Prime Minister position."

Philip: "Exactly. The high turnout actually worked against them. Sometimes democracy throws these curveballs. But our models captured the complexity perfectly."

[They both sip their coffee, watching Paris traffic through the window.]

Philip: [nodding] "The strategic pact between Macron's Together and the left wasn't enough. Even with the unprecedented voter turnout and three-way runoffs, the National Rally's momentum was too strong."

Nate: "The dissolution of the National Assembly was a gamble that backfired. Looking back at the data we had by July 10th, the signs were there - the far-right's surge after the European elections, the fragmentation of the center-left coalition..."

Philip: "True. The New Popular Front never had a real shot at the Prime Minister position. The vote splitting in those multi-way runoffs proved fatal to their chances."

[They both look out the window at the Parisian streets, where protesters are gathering.]
