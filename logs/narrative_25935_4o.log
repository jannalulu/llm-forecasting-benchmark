*Three superforecasters sit around a table, sipping coffee, their laptops open.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(looking up from their screen)  
So, OpenAI didn’t drop any bombshells about Q* by the deadline.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The rumors were compelling, but the lack of concrete info was telling.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(nodding)  
The Reuters article added intrigue, but without an official acknowledgment, it was always a long shot.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
I wonder if they’re holding back for strategic reasons. The stakes seem high.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Could be. But until they publish something concrete, it’s all speculation.

*They sip their coffee, contemplating the future of AI and the mysteries it holds.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Well, here’s to the next prediction. The world keeps spinning.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit across from each other, laptops open, analyzing data.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
So, the big question. Did OpenAI publish details about Q*?

MIKE  
(shaking his head)  
Nope. Our models had it at 12.34%. The rumors were strong, but the evidence was thin.

JANE  
(sipping coffee)  
Makes sense. The board drama last year was intense, but without concrete leaks or statements, it was always a long shot.

MIKE  
(nodding)  
Exactly. The letter to the board added intrigue, but with no public acknowledgment or detailed publication, it was bound to resolve as no.

JANE  
(grinning)  
Still, the AI world loves its mysteries. Who knows what’s next?

MIKE  
(chuckling)  
True. But for now, Q* remains in the shadows.

They both return to their screens, the world of probabilities ever turning.

Well, it's official. OpenAI didn't publish anything about Q* by the deadline.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The rumors after Altman's brief ouster were too vague.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Right, especially with the Reuters article. It hinted at something big, but nothing concrete.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
And the internal memo from Mira Murati? It was just a nod to the media frenzy.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Exactly. Without a formal acknowledgment or publication, our models were spot on.

I wonder if they'll ever reveal what Q* really is. It’s like the AI version of Schrödinger's cat.

Well, here we are, October 3rd, and no word from OpenAI about Q-Star. Our models had it at 15.75%.

**JORDAN**  
True, the rumors were wild after Altman's temporary removal. But given the lack of concrete info by July, our models adjusted accordingly.

**TAYLOR**  
Right, Reuters sparked a lot of speculation, but without OpenAI's acknowledgment, it was all just smoke. We had to rely on the data we had.

**ALEX**  
It's fascinating how the narrative shifted. The media frenzy didn't sway the probabilities much. Our models were spot on.
