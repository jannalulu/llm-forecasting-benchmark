**NASA Astronauts 'Stranded' on Space Station Until at Least September**
NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will remain on the International Space Station (ISS) until at least September 3, as their spacecraft, Starliner, has been experiencing problems since its launch. The spacecraft's propulsion system and helium leak have been causing issues, and the astronauts will conduct tests to try to resolve the problems. The NASA and Boeing teams are working together to plan the next steps and will have a meeting next week to discuss the mission's timeline. The Starliner's problems began before its launch, with a valve failure and a helium leak delaying its departure. The spacecraft finally launched on June 6, but has been experiencing issues since reaching orbit, including two helium leaks and a failure of its motors. The astronauts have been conducting tests on the spacecraft, and NASA and Boeing have assured that the Starliner is 'stable and prepared to leave the ISS in case of an emergency'.

**Astronauts Confident of Safe Return to Earth**
Astronauts Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were supposed to return to Earth on June 12, stated on Wednesday (10) that they are 'confident' they will return safely. The statement was made during a live interview from the International Space Station (ISS). 'We are completely confident that the tests we are conducting are necessary to obtain the correct answers and the data we need to return', said Wilmore. However, the return has already been delayed three times. NASA has not yet announced a new date. In this report, learn more about the two 'prisoners' in space. The duo was sent to the ISS on June 5, on an 8-day mission, in the first crewed flight of the Starliner capsule, from Boeing. However, according to the agency, problems with the propellers and helium leaks disrupted the entire schedule.

**NASA Astronauts ‘Confident' Boeing's Starliner Will Return Them Home After Weeks Of Delays**
Two NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were scheduled to return to Earth weeks ago, expressed confidence in Boeing's Starliner capsule to bring them home after a series of technical issues caused delays. The astronauts were scheduled to leave the International Space Station on June 14, but testing on Starliner's thrusters is ongoing, and NASA is considering extending the capsule's mission to 90 days, delaying the latest possible return to September 4. Wilmore stated, 'I have a really good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem.' NASA officials will determine whether Starliner's battery can be sustained for the extended mission before making a decision.

**New Alternatives to Space**
NASA veteran astronaut Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are training for space exploration. The article highlights three positive developments in space exploration: the involvement of the private sector, the design of the Starliner spacecraft to carry 100 people, and the potential for interplanetary travel. The Starship is designed to be refueled in low Earth orbit and has an additional energy capacity of up to 100 tonnes, making it capable of taking humans to Mars. NASA has chosen the spacecraft for a moon landing in September 2026.

**NASA to Provide Update on Struggling Starliner Mission**
The NASA is set to provide an update on the Starliner mission, which has been experiencing difficulties since its docking at the International Space Station (ISS) in early June. The Boeing Spacecraft has been experiencing issues with five of its thrusters and a helium leak, which has raised concerns about its ability to safely return the two astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, to Earth. The update on Wednesday is expected to reveal the progress made by engineers in determining the spacecraft's reliability for a safe return, and may even provide a targeted launch date. Additionally, the NASA will discuss ongoing operations on the ISS and the SpaceX Crew-9 mission, which has been delayed due to the Starliner issue and is now aiming for a launch on September 24 instead of August 18.

**NASA Astronauts Stranded in ISS Due to Technical Issues**
Two NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, have been stuck in the International Space Station (ISS) since June 5, 2024, due to technical issues with their capsule's propulsion system. The NASA and Boeing teams are working to resolve the problem, and the astronauts are assured they will be returned to Earth at the right time. Sunita Williams expressed confidence in the spacecraft, saying 'I have a very good feeling that the spacecraft will bring us back home without a problem.' The NASA director of flight, Edward Van Cise, tweeted that the astronauts would be 'soon' returning to Earth. The Starliner spacecraft has enough autonomy to stay in space until early September. The NASA and Boeing teams are conducting tests to ensure the propulsion system is functioning properly. There is no discussion with SpaceX about sending a Dragon spacecraft to retrieve the astronauts, as the first option is to return them with the Starliner.

**Starliner Astronauts' Return Delayed Due to Technical Issues**
The return of the Starliner astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, to Earth has been delayed due to technical issues that arose during the spacecraft's first crewed flight. NASA and Boeing held a press conference to provide updates on the mission. Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, stated, 'We're not yet ready to announce a return date.' After conducting tests over the past two weeks, 'we've learned a lot, made great progress, but we're not yet ready for return.' The tests on the propulsion system at the White Sands Test Facility allowed them to reproduce the degradation observed during the flight, but further investigations are needed, including a test on July 28-29 that will involve 27 of the 28 propulsion systems for maneuvers and verification of the helium system's stability. Stich confirmed that Starliner's battery life, initially expected to last 45 days, has been extended to 90 days to ensure a wider time window, potentially until September. Despite this uncertainty, NASA and Boeing reaffirm their primary goal of returning the astronauts to Earth on Starliner, although alternative plans are still being considered.
