*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee. Our models had it at 75.32%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, and despite his controversies, the nomination held. The footage of him mentioning "childless cat ladies" didn't derail his candidacy.

**NATE SILVER:** True, but his net favorability was historically low. Harry Enten's analysis was spot on. Yet, no last-minute dropouts like Eagleton in '72.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The models accounted for his Midwest unpopularity. Still, Vance's nomination stuck despite the odds.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how probabilities play out. The political landscape is unpredictable, yet our models remain steadfast.

*They nod, acknowledging the complex interplay of events and forecasts.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Until next time, Nate.

**NATE SILVER:** Until then, Philip. 

*They shake hands, the screen fades to black.*

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by screens displaying election data.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, yesterday confirmed what our models predicted. JD Vance did not remain the Republican vice presidential nominee.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 25.34% that he would still be the nominee by September 30. The resurfaced footage and his negative favorability ratings were critical factors.

NATE SILVER  
Right. Even with the historical precedent of a nominee dropping out, the odds were against him. His Midwest unpopularity was a significant indicator.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
And let's not forget the Harris factor. The political landscape shifted dramatically when Biden exited the race.

NATE SILVER  
Exactly. Our models, once again, accurately reflected the complexities of political dynamics.

They nod, their confidence in their forecasting prowess unshaken.

FADE OUT.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by stacks of newspapers and glowing computer screens.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the dust has settled. JD Vance is indeed the Republican vice presidential nominee.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 82.75%. His nomination on July 17 was pivotal, despite the controversies.

**NATE SILVER:** True, the resurfaced "childless cat ladies" comment did stir the pot. Yet, it seems the GOP stood firm.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, though his net favorability was concerning, the historical precedent of Eagleton in '72 didn’t repeat.

**NATE SILVER:** Harris stepping up after Biden's exit might have overshadowed Vance's controversies.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Quite possible. The landscape changed rapidly, but our models captured the nuances well.

*They nod, satisfied with their predictions.*

**NATE SILVER:** Another one for the books, Philip.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yeah, no surprise there. The resurfaced "childless cat ladies" comment didn't help his already low favorability.

**NATE SILVER:** True, a net favorability of -16% in the Midwest was a red flag. Plus, historical precedent like Eagleton's drop-out was a factor.

So, JD Vance as the Republican vice presidential nominee—didn't see that coming after all the controversy.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Yes, our models had it at 65.75%. Despite his unpopularity, the nomination held firm.

NATE SILVER  
Fascinating. Especially with the resurfaced comments about "childless cat ladies."

PHILIP TETLOCK  
True, but historical precedents like Eagleton's withdrawal in 1972 didn't apply here. The party stuck with him.

NATE SILVER  
And Kamala Harris stepping in for Biden changed the dynamics. Yet, Vance's Midwest numbers were abysmal.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, but the models accounted for a volatile political landscape. A reminder that probability isn't certainty.

Right. Another chapter in the unpredictable saga of politics.
