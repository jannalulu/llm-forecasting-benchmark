**Nine Human Cases of Avian Influenza Detected in the US: What Does it Mean?**
Nine human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the US, with four recent cases in Colorado. The cases are a result of a global outbreak of H5N1, a particular strain of avian influenza that originated in 2020. The cases in the US have been relatively mild and have only affected agricultural workers who had contact with infected animals. Some patients have presented typical flu symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or runny nose. Several have also had conjunctivitis or pink eyes. Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, said that the current strain of the virus is not well adapted for human infection and may not even be well adapted for lower respiratory tract infection. The cases are derived from a global outbreak of H5N1, which has affected poultry farms and dairy farms in the US. The first human case in the country was reported in April 2022, followed by cases in Texas, Michigan, and Colorado. The mild nature of the cases contrasts with the effect of the virus on birds and some mammals, such as seals, lions, foxes, raccoons, and cats, which have died from the virus. Since January 2022, over 99 million wild waterfowl, commercial poultry, and backyard poultry in the US have been affected, meaning they died from the virus or were slaughtered to prevent further transmission. Approximately 160 dairy cow herds have also been affected since the virus was first detected in cows in March. This H5N1 strain is considered highly pathogenic, meaning it has a high potential to kill chickens. 'It's scary to hear about a virus like this, but that term is actually a USDA term referring to what happens in poultry,' said John Lednicky, professor of environmental and global health at the University of Florida. 'The fact that it's highly pathogenic in birds does not mean it is in humans or mammals.' Lednicky added that some H5N1 strains are fatal in humans, while others are not. Of the over 900 cases of H5N1 in people reported worldwide since 1997, approximately half were fatal. However, in the last two years, the global mortality rate has been lower: around 27%. Even then, those figures reflect mainly people who were sick enough to seek treatment. Dr. Peter Palese, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said that the patients included in that count are those who 'have been hospitalized and, in retrospect, have been in contact with large quantities of virus.' Palese's 2012 research, which examined blood samples from 12,500 people without a documented flu infection, found that between 1% and 2% of them may have been previously infected with H5N1. However, experts still fear that the virus could mutate into a version that causes a more severe disease or spreads from person to person (so far, all transmission has been from animals to humans). 'The concern is that as more animals and people get infected, the virus will change,' said Binnicker.

**US cases of avian flu in cattle are causing concern. How prepared is Europe for the bird flu threat?**
A highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has been detected in dairy cows in the US, causing concern about the potential global health risk. The virus has already infected four dairy workers, but there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Experts warn that Europe should be monitoring the virus and preparing to respond quickly if it spreads. The US outbreak is the first time H5N1 has been documented in cattle, making it a higher risk for human transmission. Researchers are concerned about the virus's ability to spread between small animals and its potential to mutate and become more contagious. Some countries, such as Finland, are taking steps to prepare for H5N1, including offering vaccines to high-risk workers and monitoring fur farms. The European Commission is also stockpiling pre-pandemic vaccines and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is convening an expert group to support global access to H5N1 vaccines.

**WHO Warns of Compromised Ability to Manage Avian Influenza Risk**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that its ability to manage the risk posed by the H5N1 avian influenza virus to humans is compromised by irregular surveillance. The WHO reported that the United States has notified a fourth human case of H5N1 avian influenza due to contact with infected dairy cows, and Cambodia has reported two cases in children who had contact with sick or dead chickens. 'At this moment, there has been no reported transmission between humans, so the WHO continues to evaluate the risk to the general public as low', said the head of the UN health agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 'However, our ability to assess and manage this risk is compromised by limited surveillance of animal viruses worldwide', he added in a press conference. 'Understanding how these viruses spread and mutate in animals is essential to identify any changes that may increase the risk of outbreaks in humans, or the possibility of a pandemic', he emphasized. The WHO appealed to all countries to intensify surveillance and notification of avian influenza in animals and humans, as well as to share samples and genetic sequences. It also called for greater protection of agricultural workers who may be exposed to infected animals and increased research on avian influenza. The H5N1 virus first emerged in 1996, but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, along with an increase in the number of infected mammals. The virus has caused the death of tens of millions of birds, as well as infecting wild birds and terrestrial and marine mammals. Human cases registered in Europe and the United States since the virus outbreak have been mostly brief. H5N1 has spread among dairy cow herds in the United States, now with four cases of the disease passing from cattle to humans.

**New evidence sheds light on health emergency as virus rapidly spreads and evolves â€” here's what you need to know**
A new report highlights the rapid spread and evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which has been detected in dairy cows in the United States. The virus has spread globally, with rising global temperatures playing a significant role in its prevalence and emergence of new variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that other animals impacted by the virus include swans, foxes, bears, alpacas, and sea lions. Three human cases have been linked to U.S. dairy farms, with the public health risk considered low. The World Health Organization notes that most human cases have occurred after direct contact with live or dead birds, and there are no known cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC is monitoring infections and developing an action plan if needed. Additionally, breakthroughs in gene-edited chickens and cleaner technologies provide hope for a healthier, cooler future.

**To save humans from the deadly H5N1 avian flu, the time to act is now**
The article highlights the urgent need to take action to prevent a potential pandemic caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. The virus has already spread globally, infecting birds, mammals, and potentially humans. The author, Matthew S. Miller, emphasizes the importance of a 'One Health' approach, prioritizing prevention over response, and notes that the window to act is small. He suggests that the virus could adapt to infect humans more efficiently, potentially leading to a catastrophic pandemic. The article discusses the risks of human-to-human transmission, the potential for high human mortality, and the need for public buy-in and resources to prevent the spread of the virus. It also highlights the importance of international cooperation, government policies, and evidence-based approaches to prevent the pandemic.

**Avian Influenza Virus: Increased Risk to Humans as Virus Transmits Between Mammals**
A new study has found that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus can transmit from one mammal to another, increasing the risk to humans. The study, conducted by a team from Cornell University, discovered that the virus can transmit directly between cows and from cows to cats and raccoons. According to Diego Diel, professor of virology and director of the Center for Diagnostic Virology at Cornell University, this is one of the first times that effective and sustained transmission of the H5N1 virus from mammal to mammal has been observed. The study's findings are concerning because the virus could potentially adapt to mammals, warns Diel. So far, 11 human cases of avian influenza have been reported in the US, with four linked to the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle and seven to poultry farms. The researchers believe that the virus could have originated from dairy farms in the same county. Although the pathogen can infect humans and replicate in their bodies, the effectiveness of these infections is currently low. The fear is that potential mutations could occur, leading to the virus adapting to mammals, spreading among humans, and potentially transmitting efficiently between humans in the future. Therefore, it is essential to continue monitoring the pathogen in animals and humans, warns Diel. Measures to contain the spread of the virus include early diagnosis, increased biosafety measures, and quarantines in case of positivity.

**US investigates four cases of H5N1 avian influenza in humans**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have sent a team to Colorado after confirming four cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in humans, as well as investigating a fifth suspected case. The H5N1 virus, which previously only circulated in birds, has caused unprecedented outbreaks in mammals, such as a farm in Spain and thousands of sea lions in Chile. Since March, the US has also reported new cases in dairy cows in at least 13 states. Between humans, avian influenza cases are rare and there is no record of transmission between people. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that from 2003 to the end of last year, there were 882 confirmed cases in 23 countries, all contaminated by close contact with infected birds. The CDC believes that the risk of the virus mutating and becoming transmissible between people increases with each new species that reports outbreaks and each new contamination in humans. The most recent cases in the US were confirmed on Sunday. According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the virus was identified in workers who were responding to an outbreak of the disease among birds on an egg-producing farm. 'The workers were slaughtering birds on a farm in northeastern Colorado and presented mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis (pink eye) and common respiratory infection symptoms. None of them were hospitalized', says a statement. The samples were sent to the CDC, which confirmed four human cases. A fifth patient had 'presumably positive' results from the Colorado analysis, but is under investigation by the CDC. 'Given the current information, the CDC believes that the risk to the public from this outbreak remains low. These cases again highlight the risk of exposure to infected animals. (But) there are no unexpected increases in flu activity in Colorado or other states affected by H5N1 outbreaks in cattle and birds', says a note. These were the first human cases of avian influenza linked to contact with birds in the US since 2022, with the others this year related to exposure to contaminated cattle, one in Colorado, two in Michigan, and one in Texas. According to the CDC, Colorado is experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 in dairy farms and poultry farms. The authority has sent 'a multidisciplinary team of nine people, including epidemiologists, veterinarians, clinicians, and an industrial hygienist to Colorado to support its public health response to the outbreak among bird farm workers', says a note.

**WHO Concerned about Avian Influenza H5N1 in the US: 'Intensify Surveillance and Reporting'**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned about the fourth human case of avian influenza H5N1 in the United States, despite no human-to-human transmission being reported yet. The WHO has appealed to governments worldwide to intensify surveillance and reporting of suspected cases, as the risk of developing a highly contagious strain for humans is high. However, the WHO has mitigated alarmism, stating that the risk for the general population remains low. According to WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the limited surveillance of animal viruses, not only in the US but globally, hinders the ability to identify potential changes in the avian influenza structure, allowing for early action to prevent epidemics or pandemics. The WHO emphasizes the importance of monitoring agricultural workers, who are at high risk of contracting the virus. Avian influenza cases are increasing among cattle, with around 145 dairy cow herds infected in the US, according to Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's epidemiological prevention expert. The WHO is urging a global understanding of the circulation of the virus among cattle.

**Avian Influenza H5N1: A Study Reveals Its Potential to Transmit Between Mammals**
A study published in the journal Nature found that the H5N1 avian influenza virus can be transmitted between mammals through contaminated cow's milk and can reach the mammary glands. The study, led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, isolated the virus from milk of an infected cow in New Mexico, USA, and demonstrated that it can replicate and cause disease in mice and ferrets, two common animal models for studying influenza in mammals. The detection of a subtype of the virus in a dairy farm in the United States in the spring of 2024 is the first documented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in cattle. Since then, it has been documented to spread between herds and infect other mammals, including humans, indicating a 'greater risk' to public health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been four recent cases in humans - workers - in the United States. While the current risk to public health is low, the CDC is monitoring the situation 'closely' and working with the 12 affected states. The study characterized the isolated virus and demonstrated that it can transmit through milk from infected cows to mice and ferrets, and even to the mammary glands of infected animals. The virus was also found to transmit from infected mice to their offspring. Aitor Nogales GonzÃ¡lez, a scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, summarized that the study showed that animals can become infected by consuming contaminated milk and that there is vertical transmission in infected mice. However, the bovine H5N1 virus was transmitted inefficiently through respiratory transmission in ferrets. Some of these results are similar to those obtained with other H5N1 viruses in the past. However, they suggest that the virus isolated in the outbreak in cattle may have characteristics that facilitate infection and transmission in mammals, including humans. This conclusion is mainly due to the virus's ability to bind to cellular receptors present in the upper respiratory tract of humans, according to the Science Media Centre (SMC) Spain. 'Although the risk to the population, in general, is considered low, this situation could change in the future and we must remain alert. We must remember that the last pandemics of influenza have had the avian influenza as a fundamental actor', concludes Nogales. The new study aims to answer key questions related to the potential of the virus isolated in cows to transmit between mammals through different routes.

**Avian Influenza Outbreak: Is Spain at Risk?**
Since the end of March 2024, US health authorities have sounded the alarm after confirming the presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in 86 dairy cow farms across 10 states. The affected states are Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming. The outbreak has raised concerns in the dairy industry and among health authorities. Meanwhile, consumers are wondering if it is safe to consume their morning milk and if humans could be the next infected. On April 1, a worker at a Texas dairy farm was diagnosed with the virus, marking a concerning public health milestone. This case represents the first time the virus has been detected in cattle and the first time it has been transmitted from mammals to humans. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the presence of the virus in cattle, and experts warn that the risk is not limited to the United States. Joaquim SegalÃ©s, an investigator at the Animal Health Research Center, emphasizes that 'the outbreaks in the US are happening with distances of thousands of kilometers, which tells us that it can happen anywhere, as long as there is contact with infected birds.' The risk is real, and it is crucial to be alert. The article also highlights the importance of zoonosis, diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans, and the need to prevent the next pandemic.

**Avian Influenza in Humans: A Growing Concern**
A fourth case of avian influenza in humans has been reported in the United States, with the patient having contact with infected dairy cows in Colorado. The patient showed mild symptoms and was treated with an antiviral medication. The H5N1 virus has been circulating among birds for decades and has recently been spreading to other animals, including dairy cows. Researchers are concerned about the potential for the virus to jump to humans. The virus is highly contagious among birds and can spread quickly through contaminated milk equipment and transportation of infected animals. If the virus were to adapt to humans, it could potentially cause a global pandemic. Experts are working on developing a vaccine and are monitoring the situation closely.

**Canada Closely Monitoring Avian Influenza Situation in the United States**
The Canadian authorities are closely monitoring the situation of avian influenza in the United States, where cases of the disease have been reported in farms, contaminating cattle and recently transmitted to humans. The authorities say they are taking the situation very seriously. The avian influenza, specifically the H5 and H7 subtypes, is a notifiable disease in Quebec, as it can be transmitted between animals and humans. While cases of avian influenza in humans are rare, three cases were reported in the United States last year, with two people showing eye symptoms and one person showing respiratory symptoms. Globally, 15 human cases of a specific H5N1 clade have been reported since its emergence in 2022, with most cases having a history of exposure to poultry. The Canadian government has raised its alert level and is urging farmers to increase their vigilance and biosecurity measures. The situation is concerning, as the virus has been detected in wild birds, cattle, and over 200 mammal species in the United States. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has increased its surveillance and protection measures, including requiring imported cattle to test negative for the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.

**Will We Return to the Pandemic Scenario?**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is showing 'enormous concern' about the spread of H5N1 and H5N2 avian flu strains to other species. According to Jeremy Farrar, the WHO's scientific director, the main worry is that the H5N1 virus, which has an 'extraordinarily high mortality rate' among people infected through contact with animals, is adapting to transmission between humans. Between January 2023 and April 1, 2024, the WHO recorded 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries, with 463 deaths, representing a 52% mortality rate. Farrar emphasized the need for increased surveillance and registration, as well as the development of vaccines and treatments against H5N1. He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that regional and national health authorities worldwide have the capacity to diagnose the virus.

**Can We Prevent an Avian Influenza Pandemic?**
The highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype of avian influenza has been spreading among animals worldwide, causing significant concern among public health experts. Since 2020, the frequency of infections in mammals has increased, and recent human cases in 2024 raise the possibility of a new global epidemic. To prevent an avian influenza pandemic, it is necessary to monitor and continuously surveil animal health, as well as implement effective biosafety strategies. Specialists emphasize the importance of conducting comprehensive tests in animals and humans to detect the H5N1 virus and its possible variants. Effective surveillance is crucial for monitoring the spread of the virus and identifying high-risk areas, allowing for the adoption of preventive measures. Despite the efforts of surveillance in various regions, the lack of resources and reluctance of animal owners represent significant challenges in collecting complete data. The challenges of trust and communication are evident, especially among agricultural workers, who may fear legal or financial consequences for participating in surveillance programs. Therefore, compensation programs are essential to mitigate these concerns and ensure that workers feel safe to participate in tests and implement biosafety practices. Vaccine development and distribution A vaccine is the most effective means of preventing the spread of viruses. Several countries and organizations are developing and stockpiling vaccine candidates for H5N1, with plans to produce millions of doses in the coming months. Vaccines with durability and broad efficacy are essential for controlling the disease. However, logistical and public acceptance challenges complicate the implementation of vaccination programs. The countdown to expiration of doses, the need to convince the public to vaccinate, and uncertainty about the vaccine's effectiveness against future virus mutations are significant obstacles. Therefore, new studies are essential to improve vaccination strategies and the vaccine formula. Preventing an avian influenza pandemic requires a multifaceted approach that includes rigorous surveillance, close collaboration between all involved parties, and the development of effective vaccines. Although there are many challenges, the implementation of these strategies can significantly reduce the risk of a new global epidemic, protecting both human and animal health.

**Former CDC Director Warns of Potential Avian Influenza Pandemic**
According to Robert Redfield, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the next pandemic could come from the avian influenza virus, which spreads rapidly among poultry and livestock in the United States. Redfield stated, 'I think it's very probable that we will have an avian influenza pandemic, it's not a question of if, but when.' He added that once the H5N1 virus acquires the ability to transmit from human to human, that's when you'll have a pandemic. Currently, H5N1 does not easily transmit between humans, but the World Health Organization warns that as it spreads, it has the 'potential to mutate and become more contagious.' The H5N1 virus was first detected in 1996 in domestic waterfowl in southern China and is highly contagious among birds. A new outbreak was detected in 2020 among wild birds in Europe and has since spread to domestic poultry and occasionally to mammalian species such as foxes, otters, and cows. In the US, over 96 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks in 48 states have been infected with the virus, with 12 states reporting infected cattle herds. So far, three humans - all exposed to cattle - have been infected this year, according to the CDC, and the risk to the general public remains low.

**To save humans from the deadly H5N1 avian flu, the time to act is now**
The article highlights the urgent need to take action to prevent a potential pandemic caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. The virus has already spread globally, infecting birds, mammals, and potentially humans. The author, Matthew S. Miller, emphasizes the importance of a 'One Health' approach, prioritizing prevention over response, and notes that the window to act is small. He suggests that the virus could adapt to infect humans more efficiently, potentially leading to a catastrophic pandemic. The article discusses the risks of human-to-human transmission, the potential for high human mortality, and the need for public buy-in and resources to prevent the spread of the virus. It also highlights the importance of international cooperation, government policies, and evidence-based approaches to prevent the pandemic.
