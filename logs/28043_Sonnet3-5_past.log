To forecast this question, I'll analyze the latest polling data, consider historical trends, and evaluate potential factors that could influence the outcome.

Key considerations:

1. Latest polls: The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD polling between 27-29%. This is below the 30-32% range we're evaluating, but not far off.

2. Trend: The AfD's support has been relatively stable or slightly increasing in recent months. In early September polls, they gained 4 percentage points compared to previous surveys.

3. Historical performance: In the 2019 Brandenburg election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. They've consistently polled higher than that result in 2024.

4. Potential for polling error: Polls often underestimate far-right party support due to social desirability bias. There's a chance the AfD could outperform their polling numbers.

5. Competing parties: The SPD has been gaining ground, polling at 23-26% in recent surveys. This could potentially cap the AfD's growth.

6. Voter turnout: Higher turnout could potentially benefit more established parties over the AfD.

7. Late campaign developments: There's still time for events to shift voter preferences before election day.

8. AfD's classification as a suspected right-wing extremist organization: This could either energize their base or push some voters away.

Weighing these factors, I believe the AfD is more likely to fall short of 30% than to exceed it, but there's a non-trivial chance they could reach the 30-32% range.

My Prediction: Between 4.50% and 14.50%, with 9.50% being the most likely. Probability: 9.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the available polling data, recent trends, and relevant factors:

1. Latest polls:
The most recent polls from September 12, 2024 show the AfD at 27% (ARD/Infratest dimap, DER SPIEGEL, Tagesspiegel). This is significantly below the 30-32% range we're assessing.

2. Trend analysis:
Looking at polls over the past few months, the AfD's support has been relatively stable around 24-27%. There's no clear upward trend that would suggest they'll reach 30%+ by the election.

3. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. While they've gained support since then, a jump to 30%+ would be a major shift.

4. Comparison to recent state elections:
In the September 1, 2024 elections in Thuringia and Saxony, the AfD received over 30% of the vote. However, Brandenburg's political landscape differs, with the SPD traditionally stronger.

5. Factors that could increase AfD support:
- Continued focus on immigration issues
- Dissatisfaction with the current government
- Last-minute campaign momentum

6. Factors that could limit AfD growth:
- Strong opposition from other parties
- Potential backlash to extremist rhetoric
- Effective campaigning by SPD and other parties

7. Margin of error:
Polls typically have a margin of error of 2-3%. Even if the AfD is underestimated, it would likely need to be by 3-5 points to reach 30%.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the AfD will reach 30-32% of the vote. The polls have been consistent, and there's no clear evidence of a late surge. However, we can't entirely rule out the possibility given recent AfD performance in other states and potential polling errors.

My Prediction: Between 2.00% and 10.00%, with 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the available polling data, historical trends, and relevant factors:

1. Recent polls:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD at 27% (multiple polls). This is significantly below the 30-32% range in question.

2. Polling trend:
The AfD's support has been relatively stable around 27% in recent months, not showing a clear upward trend that would suggest reaching 30%+.

3. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg election, AfD received 23.5%. While they've gained support since then, jumping to over 30% would be a large increase.

4. Comparison to other recent state elections:
In September 2024 elections in Thuringia and Saxony, AfD received over 30%. However, Brandenburg has historically had somewhat lower AfD support than those states.

5. Time until election:
With only 10 days until the election, there's limited time for major shifts in voter sentiment.

6. Potential for polling error:
Polls have sometimes underestimated AfD support, but usually not by more than a few percentage points.

7. Factors that could boost AfD support:
- Immigration remains a top voter concern
- Dissatisfaction with current government
- Potential for last-minute AfD surge

8. Factors that could limit AfD growth:
- SPD's recent gains in polls
- Efforts by other parties to mobilize anti-AfD voters
- AfD's classification as right-wing extremist suspect case

Weighing these factors, I assess that while AfD support over 30% is possible, it's more likely they'll remain below 30%. The 30-32% range specifically seems unlikely given current polling.

My Prediction: Between 2.00% and 10.00%, with 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll start by looking at the recent polling data and trends, then consider factors that could affect the AfD's performance between now and the election.

Recent polls:
- Sept 12 poll: AfD at 27%
- Sept 5 poll: AfD at 27%
- August polls: AfD around 24-25%

The most recent polls consistently show the AfD around 27%, which is below the 30-32% range in question. However, there are a few key considerations:

1. Polls can be inaccurate. In recent German state elections, the AfD has sometimes outperformed polls by 2-3 percentage points.

2. There's still over a week until the election, allowing time for shifts in voter sentiment.

3. The AfD performed very strongly (over 30%) in the recent Thuringia and Saxony elections, which could boost their momentum.

4. Immigration is cited as the top concern for Brandenburg voters, which typically benefits the AfD.

5. However, the SPD has been gaining ground recently, potentially limiting AfD growth.

6. The AfD's peak support in Brandenburg polls was around 32% in late 2023, but they've declined since then.

7. Other far-right parties like the BSW could take some potential AfD voters.

Weighing these factors, I believe the AfD is more likely to end up below 30% than above it, but there's a reasonable chance they could reach the 30-32% range. The most likely scenario seems to be the AfD slightly outperforming current polls but falling short of 30%.

My Prediction: Between 26.50% and 31.00%, with 28.50% being the most likely. Probability: 13.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the available polling data and recent trends, then consider other relevant factors that could influence the outcome.

Polling data:
The most recent polls show the AfD with support ranging from 23-27%:
- 27% (Infratest dimap, Sept 12)
- 27% (Infratest dimap, Sept 5)
- 24% (INSA, August)
- 23% (Infratest dimap, July)

This suggests the AfD's support has been relatively stable in the 23-27% range over the past few months, with a slight upward trend.

Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. The current polling shows them performing slightly better than that level.

Factors that could push AfD support higher:
1. Immigration concerns: The polls indicate immigration is the top issue for voters (40% cite it as most important). This traditionally benefits the AfD.
2. Dissatisfaction with current government: Only 45% approve of the current SPD-led coalition.
3. AfD momentum from recent strong performances in Thuringia and Saxony.

Factors that could limit AfD support:
1. Increased scrutiny: The AfD state association is classified as a suspected right-wing extremist organization.
2. Strategic voting: As the election nears, some voters may shift to other parties to prevent an AfD victory.
3. Potential for SPD/CDU recovery: Both have seen slight gains in recent polls.

Adjusting the baseline:
Starting with the most recent poll of 27%, I estimate there's about a 60% chance the AfD will outperform this level, given the factors above. However, the jump from 27% to over 30% is significant.

To reach 30-32%, the AfD would need to gain an additional 3-5 percentage points in the final days of the campaign. While possible, this would be a notable shift from current polling.

Considering all factors, I assess there's a relatively low probability the AfD will land precisely in the 30-32% range. It's more likely they'll either fall short of 30% or potentially exceed 32% if there's a late surge in support.

My Prediction: Between 4.50% and 8.50%, with 6.50% being the most likely. Probability: 6.50%.

Starting with the most recent poll of 27%, I estimate there's about a 60% chance the AfD will outperform this level, given the factors above. However, the jump from 27% to over 30% is significant.

To reach 30-32%, the AfD would need to gain an additional 3-5 percentage points in the final days of the campaign. While possible, this would be a notable shift from current polling.

Considering all factors, I assess there's a relatively low probability the AfD will land precisely in the 30-32% range. It's more likely they'll either fall short of 30% or potentially exceed 32% if there's a late surge in support.

My Prediction: Between 4.50% and 8.50%, with 6.50% being the most likely. Probability: 6.50%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the available polling data and recent trends, then consider other relevant factors that could influence the outcome.

Polling data:
The most recent polls show the AfD with support ranging from 23-27%:
- 27% (Infratest dimap, Sept 12)
- 27% (Infratest dimap, Sept 5)
- 24% (INSA, August)
- 23% (Infratest dimap, July)

This suggests the AfD's support has been relatively stable in the 23-27% range over the past few months, with a slight upward trend.

Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. The current polling shows them performing slightly better than that level.

Factors that could push AfD support higher:
1. Immigration concerns: The polls indicate immigration is the top issue for voters (40% cite it as most important). This traditionally benefits the AfD.
2. Dissatisfaction with current government: Only 45% approve of the current SPD-led coalition.
3. AfD momentum from recent strong performances in Thuringia and Saxony.

Factors that could limit AfD support:
1. Increased scrutiny: The AfD state association is classified as a suspected right-wing extremist organization.
2. Strategic voting: As the election nears, some voters may shift to other parties to prevent an AfD victory.
3. Potential for SPD/CDU recovery: Both have seen slight gains in recent polls.
