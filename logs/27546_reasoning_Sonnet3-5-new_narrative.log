Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the CDC's mpox risk assessment."

Philip: "Indeed. Even with that concerning spread of clade I mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa, our models had it at 12.35%. The CDC maintained their 'Very Low' risk assessment through September."

Nate: "The key factors were there - high population immunity from previous outbreaks and vaccinations, limited transmission patterns, and effective treatments readily available. Though that July 8th assessment had everyone on edge."

Philip: "True. But our models accounted for the CDC's historically conservative approach to risk level changes. Without sustained domestic transmission or significant changes in virulence, the threshold for exceeding 'Low' risk was unlikely to be met."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting."

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: [shuffling through papers] Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the CDC's mpox risk assessment.

Philip: Indeed. Despite the concerning spread of clade I mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa that CDC noted in August, our models had it at 3.2% probability that they'd raise the risk level above "Low."

Nate: The data supported keeping it at "Very Low." Even with their July 8th assessment needing an update, the combination of high population immunity, available treatments, and limited exposure paths for the general public made a risk elevation unlikely.

Philip: [nodding] The historical pattern of CDC risk assessments and the effectiveness of existing public health measures were strong indicators. Sometimes the simplest forecast is the most accurate.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting.

[Both return to their data analysis]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the CDC's mpox risk assessment."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Despite the concerning spread of clade I mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa that prompted the CDC to update their July assessment, our models had it at 8.75%."

Nate: "The data really told the story. Even with increased international travel and some localized outbreaks, the high vaccination rates and improved treatment options kept the risk level at 'Very Low' through September."

Tetlock: "Right. The CDC's rigorous assessment framework meant they'd need to see both significantly higher transmission rates and reduced treatment effectiveness to elevate it above 'Low.' The numbers just weren't there."

Nate: "Another win for quantitative forecasting."

[They both nod, turning back to their screens.]
