To determine whether the Federal Reserve would cut rates by 50 basis points at their September 2024 meeting, let's examine the evidence:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: Historically, the Federal Reserve often makes smaller adjustments of 25 basis points to ensure economic stability unless faced with particularly severe economic conditions. Large cuts like 50 basis points, while possible, are less frequent outside of emergencies or significant downturns.

2. **Market Expectations and Expert Opinions**:
   - CME futures prices showed consistent expectations for a 25 basis point cut rather than a 50 basis point cut. Initially, there was a higher anticipation of a 50 bps cut (as high as 71.5% at a certain point), but this expectation reduced to about 32.5% closer to the decision date.
   - Several experts and surveys indicated a preference for a smaller cut, given the moderate economic conditions. Views from key sources such as FedWatch Tool and mainstream economists consistently showed a greater likelihood for the smaller cut.

3. **Economic Indicators**: Leading up to the decision, economic data suggested moderate inflation and a somewhat stable labor market, aligning with the market's anticipation for a smaller 25 bps cut to encourage steady economic growth without over-stimulating.

4. **Fed Officials' Statements**: Public statements from Fed officials, including Jerome Powell, consistently emphasized gradual and deliberate policy adjustments. Powell explicitly mentioned not starting with a 50 bps cut, reinforcing market signals favoring a smaller cut.

5. **Likelihood of Clashing Forces**:
   - On one hand, some experts argued the need for a more significant cut to stave off a recession. However, neither a severe economic downturn nor soaring inflation occurred that would necessitate such drastic measures.
   - On the other hand, balancing inflation-control with economic growth usually supports incremental changes instead of large swings.

In conclusion, while there was some discourse and pressure for a 50 bps cut due to recession fears, the prevailing market and expert opinions, combined with the Federal Reserve's historical approach to rate changes during stable but moderate economic challenges, suggest a lower probability of a 50 basis point cut.

My prediction: Between 2.00% and 8.00%, but 4.00% being the most likely. Probability: 4.00%.

Based on the information provided, here are the key considerations for forecasting whether the Fed would have cut rates by 50 bps at their September meeting in 2024:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Reference**: 
   - Historically, the Fed cutting rates by 50 bps in one meeting is relatively uncommon compared to smaller adjustments (e.g., 25 bps). Generally, 50 bps cuts may occur in response to significant economic turmoil.

2. **News Articles and Economic Data**:
   - Several articles note expectations shifting more in favor of a 25 bps cut rather than a 50 bps cut due to recent economic data, including positive inflation readings and stronger retail sales that suggest a soft landing.
   - Some articles argue for a more significant 50 bps cut to avoid a recession, but this seems to represent a minority view according to the latest market expectations and Fed statements.
   - FedWatch Tool consistently shows higher probabilities for a 25 bps cut compared to a 50 bps cut in September.

3. **Fed Official Statements**:
   - Statements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials suggest caution in proceeding with larger rate cuts, implying more support for a smaller cut.

4. **Market Expectations**:
   - Consensus from futures markets and economist surveys points more heavily toward a 25 bps cut as the likely outcome for the September meeting.

Given these factors, the balance of evidence leans toward a smaller rate cut, with only a moderate probability of a 50 bps cut. 

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 40.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points at their September meeting, it is essential to evaluate the available data and economic conditions prior to the decision, using a structured approach to weigh the evidence.

**1. Historical Base Rate Data:**
Historically, substantial cuts of 50 bps or more are less frequent compared to smaller adjustments of 25 bps, especially in periods without severe economic distress. It's far more common for the Fed to cut rates by a smaller increment unless there are significant economic pressures that necessitate larger cuts.

**2. Current Economic Indicators & Fed Statements:**
- Recent inflation metrics have shown a downtrend, though Fed Chairman Powell indicated a rate cut at the next meeting could depend on continued progress towards their inflation target. But notably, he rejected the idea of starting with a 50 bps cut at several points, reinforcing this to the market.  
- Labor market data and unemployment rates have shown some signs of weakening, but not enough to warranted an "emergency" style 50 bps cut.
- Most mentioned sources like the CME futures indicated a higher probability for a 25 bps rate cut and were repeatedly quoted with probabilities around the 30-40% mark for a 50 bps cut.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**
- Inside view assessment relying on recent communications from Fed officials leans towards caution and a likelihood of smaller, more controlled 25 bps cuts based on stable but cautious economic analytics.
- The outside view, sourced from financial news articles and analyses, indicates a smaller probability of a 50 bps rate.

**4. Market & Expert Expectations:**
- Bloomberg surveys and market futures, such as FedWatch Tool and economic forecasts, primarily support the idea of a 25 bps cut as more plausible, with the likelihood of larger cuts depending heavily on unexpected shifts in key economic indicators.

**5. The Context of Decision & Clashing Forces:**
- Investors are betting heavily on smaller rate cuts based on recent positive economic indicators, such as softening inflation data. 
- While there are calls from some analysts for a larger cut to counter looming recession risks, Fed communications have so far not supported the idea of a larger initial rate cut.

Given these factors, it seems more likely that a 50 basis point cut was not executed at the September meeting. The probability of such an event would be relatively low, consistently framed by various sources indicating a far smaller chance than for a 25 bps cut.

Considering the analysis and weighing all evidence, my forecast for the Fed's decision to cut rates by 50 bps at their September meeting is as follows:

My Prediction: Between 10.10% and 25.00%, but 15.50% being the most likely. Probability: 15.50%.

To forecast whether the Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at the September 2024 meeting, let's systematically evaluate the available evidence and historical context.

**Reference Classes and Base Rate:**
1. Historically, the Fed has been cautious with large rate movements such as 50 bps cuts unless under significant economic stress or shifts.
2. Rate cuts of 50 bps are less common and typically coincide with urgent economic circumstances like recessions or financial crises.

**Relevant News and Data Analysis:**
1. **Market Sentiment and Odds:** Multiple sources, including CME futures prices and FedWatch tools, reflected fluctuating probabilities for a 50 bps cut, mostly below 50%, often in the 25-40% range closer to the meeting.
2. **Economic Indicators:** Recent data pointed towards moderating inflation and a cooling job market, providing some justification for a rate cut, but the strength of the overall economy and certain comments suggest caution against a large cut.
3. **Fed and Analyst Statements:** Prominent Fed officials, such as Jerome Powell, indicated openness to rate cuts but were non-committal about the size, with a preference for deliberation and data-driven decisions. The consistent emphasis was on the suitability of smaller cuts like 25 bps.
4. **Economic Commentary:** Articles with expert opinions often highlighted strategic reasons to avoid large cuts, citing potential risks to stability and credibility if conditions didn’t drastically demand it.

**Balancing Clashing Forces:**
- **For a 50 bps cut:** Risks of recession, some pressures from financial markets for a bold move to boost confidence and preempt economic downturns.
- **Against a 50 bps cut:** Strong base-case for a 25 bps cut driven by the data pointing towards a moderated but not critical economic situation.

**Calibration and Trend Extrapolation:**
- The combination of historical preference for smaller steps, the economic backdrop, and forward guidance calibrates the expectation for a less aggressive policy move at 25 bps.

**Resolution Criteria Context:**
- The question resolves based on the official policy announcements excluding interim cuts, meaning a clear emphasis is required on the decision made specifically at the September meeting.

**Forecast Development:**
- After assessing the probabilities presented by market analysis tools and expert forecasts, alongside the context of economic indicators and Federal Reserve deliberations, the chances of a 50bps cut appear less than suggested probability for a smaller cut.

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.**

1. The CME FedWatch Tool and other reports show that the probability of a 50 bps rate cut gradually decreased in the period leading up to the meeting as economic data—including inflation readings, retail sales figures, and labor market signals—argued against a more significant rate cut. 

2. Different analysts and experts presented mixed opinions, with some arguing a larger 50 bps cut was necessary to avoid a recession, while others were persuaded by gentler economic signals indicating only a 25 bps cut would be more appropriate. 

3. Several releases indicated an established expectation for a 25 bps cut, showing only a minority considering a 50 bps cut feasible as the economic indicators did not show an abrupt downturn.

4. Jerome Powell and Fed officials expressed that a slower reduction was more in line with recent economic indicators, stressing patience and responsiveness rather than aggressive policies, limiting support for a 50 bps cut.

Using these considerations, the likelihood of a 50 bps cut at the September Fed meeting was reduced by substantial market data, interpretation, and media reports.

4. Jerome Powell and Fed officials expressed that a slower reduction was more in line with recent economic indicators, stressing patience and responsiveness rather than aggressive policies, limiting support for a 50 bps cut.

Using these considerations, the likelihood of a 50 bps cut at the September Fed meeting was reduced by substantial market data, interpretation, and media reports.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 1.00% being the most likely. Probability: 1.00%.
