**Amendment Would Enshrine Right to Abortion in Montana Constitution**
A proposed amendment in Montana, CI-128, aims to enshrine the right to abortion in the state's constitution. The measure would allow for abortion throughout pregnancy, as determined by a 'treating healthcare professional,' to protect a woman's life or health. It would also prevent the government from penalizing individuals involved in their own or another's voluntary decision to have an abortion. The coalition behind the ballot measure includes pro-abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood of Montana, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Fairness Project. Abortion is currently legal in Montana up to fetal viability, which is typically around 22 to 24 weeks. The measure needs a simple majority to pass and is part of a broader effort to codify abortion rights in state constitutions across the country.

**Montana Amendment Would Enshrine Abortion Throughout Pregnancy into State Constitution**
A proposed amendment in Montana, CI-128, aims to enshrine the right to abortion throughout pregnancy in the state constitution. The measure, backed by pro-abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, would allow for abortion at any stage of pregnancy, as determined by a 'treating healthcare professional,' to protect a woman's life or health. It would also prevent the government from penalizing individuals involved in their own or another's voluntary decision to have an abortion. The amendment needs a simple majority to pass and comes after Montanans voted against a similar measure in 2022. Montana is one of ten states where abortion is on the ballot in November, and pro-abortion-related ballot measures have been successful in every state since the fall of Roe.

**Montana's CI-128 ballot measure puts abortion rights in the spotlight**
Montanans will vote on Constitutional Initiative 128 (CI-128), which aims to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. The initiative, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, would establish a right to make decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion, while allowing the government to regulate abortion after fetal viability. Supporters argue that this would protect existing protections and safeguard Montanans' privacy and reproductive rights. Opponents, including the Montana Catholic Conference, argue that enshrining a Montana Supreme Court decision into the state constitution would set a broad precedent and undermine existing protections. They also claim that the measure would eliminate requirements for minors to notify their parents and make it difficult to craft effective legislation around abortion. According to a professor of political science at Montana State University, the initiative is likely more about politics than anything else, as it mobilizes a certain kind of voter that Democratic candidates need to win elections.

**Letter to the editor: CI-128 is a bad ballot measure all around**
The author of the letter to the editor argues that CI-128, a ballot measure presented as necessary to protect women's reproductive rights in Montana, is actually a careless piece of legislation that would make unrestricted abortion a right in Montana's constitution. The author claims that CI-128 would establish principles that are not clearly supported by legal or medical standards, such as the right to abort a baby up to 'fetal viability' without definition, and the protection of 'voluntary consent' without definition. The author urges both pro-choice and pro-life voters to vote 'NO' on CI-128 due to its careless language and lack of thoughtful crafting.

**2024 abortion ballot measures: What to know - Washington Examiner**
In the 2024 elections, several states are voting on abortion-related ballot measures. Arizona's Proposition 139 would establish a 'fundamental right to abortion' in the state constitution, while Florida's Amendment 4 would undo the state's six-week abortion ban. Maryland's ballot initiative would constitutionally ensure the right to reproductive freedom, and Missouri's amendment would establish a fundamental right to reproductive freedom. Montana's CI-128 would enshrine in the state constitution the 'right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion.' Nebraska has two competing amendments, one supported by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, and another that would allow abortion only until 12 weeks of pregnancy. Nevada's Question 6 would establish a right to abortion until fetal viability, and New York's Proposition 1 is a broader equal rights amendment that would prevent a person's rights from being denied on the basis of their 'ethnicity, national origin, age, and disability' or 'sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.' South Dakota's Constitutional Amendment G would establish a constitutional right to an abortion and provide a legal framework for regulating abortion after the first trimester. According to polls, the outcomes of these measures are uncertain, with some states showing strong support and others too close to call.

**The 'Abortion Rights' Message: My Body Has Rights, My Baby's Life Does Not**
The article discusses the proposed amendment CI-128 in Montana, which aims to protect abortion rights throughout all trimesters. The author argues that this amendment would make Montana a 'Blood-Red state' where unborn babies are efficiently eliminated. The author criticizes Republican politicians for being timid and tongue-tied on the topic of abortion, and instead of speaking out confidently, they send mixed messages by embracing anti-life 'conception exceptions' and welfare schemes for mothers. The author suggests that if politicians had the courage to speak out against abortion, the pro-life cause would be stronger. The article also criticizes the silence of America's churches on the issue of abortion, and argues that the 'my body, my rights' claim is a tie score and a non-argument, as two bodies are involved in an abortion - the mother's and the child's. The author concludes that the overriding consideration in every abortion is the question of life, and that the protection of innocent human life is the very measure of humanity and the definition of a just and civil society.

**CI 128 seeks to destroy future generations**
The author of this article strongly opposes CI 128, a Montana constitutional initiative that would allow abortion up to the time of birth and permit 'any treating healthcare provider' to perform the procedure, potentially allowing unqualified practitioners. The author argues that this legislation would benefit only the abortion industry, which is largely funded by out-of-state organizations. They also express concern that the initiative would remove parental consent requirements, potentially leading to exploitation of children. The author urges voters to reject CI 128, stating that it would harm women, men, and children, and ultimately seek to destroy future generations.

**Battle over abortion access stretches to state supreme court races**
The battle over abortion access has shifted to state supreme court races, with voters in at least 30 states deciding who will fill 69 state supreme court seats. Advocacy organizations are spending big on state supreme court elections, with Planned Parenthood Votes and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee committing to invest at least $5 million. The Montana Supreme Court has ruled that the state constitution recognizes the right to abortion, but a change in its makeup could lead to a reversal of that decision. 'When there are abortion measures on the ballot, voters go to vote and enshrine abortion into the state constitution and they may think, our job is done. That right is protected,' said Douglas Keith, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. 'But as we've seen, any constitutional amendment is still going to have boundaries that are being interpreted by courts. What court is going to be interpreting that newly passed amendment can be really significant in determining what that right consists of.'

**NBC Montana breaks down constitutional initiatives**
Montana voters will decide on three constitutional initiatives this election. CI-126 and CI-127 aim to change the election process for statewide, legislative, and congressional races. CI-126 would eliminate separate party primaries, while CI-127 would require candidates to secure more than 50% of the vote to win. CI-128 would add abortion rights to the Montana Constitution. Proponents of these initiatives, including Montanans for Election Reform and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, believe they give voting power back to Montanans and protect individual rights. However, critics argue that these initiatives could exacerbate the influence of money in politics and create concerns over what happens in a tie. As one judge noted, 'The harm here is to the individual signators to the ballot initiative because Montana citizens have a constitutional right to petition their government and that is the heart of this case.'

**Supreme Court candidates dodge, and leverage, political rhetoric**
The Montana Supreme Court candidates, Katherine Bidegaray and Dan Wilson for associate justice, and Cory Swanson and Jeremiah Lynch for chief justice, are navigating a charged political environment. The candidates have been endorsed by various groups, with Bidegaray and Lynch receiving support from progressive interest groups and Swanson and Wilson receiving support from conservative groups. The candidates have used the endorsements to attack each other, with Lynch accusing Swanson of being a 'political partisan' and Swanson accusing Lynch of being 'unprofessional.' The candidates have also been asked about their views on abortion rights and the initiative to explicitly include those protections in the Montana Constitution, CI-128. Swanson has spoken against judges and candidates forecasting their stances on future issues, while Lynch has pledged to defend the Montana Supreme Court's 25-year-old precedent in Armstrong v. State, which found that the state Constitution protected abortion access through the right to privacy.

**250 Montana health care providers show their support for abortion access**
More than 250 Montana health care providers have signed a letter in support of protecting abortion access in the state's constitution through the proposed initiative CI-128. Carey Downey, a family medicine physician, stated that Montanans already face a shortage of health care workers and other barriers to accessing care, emphasizing that 'it never ceases to shock me how underserved and how significant poverty affects their health care.' Downey pointed to studies showing that pregnant patients and women living in states with abortion bans have poorer health outcomes. Trent Taylor, another family medicine physician, argued that the initiative's language is a 'very good guideline' for current medical reproductive technology and will serve as a flexible framework for future advancements.

**More than 250 Montana medical professionals sign letter supporting CI-128**
More than 250 Montana medical professionals signed a letter in support of Constitutional Initiative 128, a proposed amendment to enshrine abortion protections in the state Constitution. The letter, organized by the Committee to Protect Health Care, argues that the amendment would secure reproductive rights and protect the freedom to make personal decisions around pregnancy and abortion. Dr. Carey Downey, Dr. Trent Taylor, and Dr. Mary Guggenheim, who spoke at a news conference, emphasized the importance of allowing patients and their physicians to make decisions without interference from politicians. They noted that Montana's Republican government officials have tried to restrict abortion access and that the proposed amendment would prohibit the government from interfering with an abortion before a fetus is viable. The doctors also addressed claims from opponents that the measure would allow abortions after 24 weeks or allow unqualified individuals to perform abortions, calling these claims 'fear mongering'.

**Busse strikes hard against incumbent, Gianforte touts strong economic record**
In a gubernatorial debate, Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte and Democratic challenger Ryan Busse discussed various issues affecting Montana. Gianforte highlighted his economic record, including the largest tax cut in Montana history, record job creation and wage growth, and making Montana 'completely debt free.' Busse, however, criticized Gianforte's handling of property taxes, saying he 'gave away' a $2.6 billion surplus in big tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires. Busse proposed rolling back rates to 2022 for all classes of property taxpayers. The candidates also disagreed on abortion, with Gianforte opposing Constitutional Initiative 128, which aims to enshrine the right to an abortion into the Montana Constitution. Busse supports CI-128, saying he will be a governor who makes Montana a 'live and let live place' and protects women. They also discussed public lands, with Busse accusing Gianforte of trying to restrict access and Gianforte defending his record on expanding access. Additionally, they addressed homelessness, with Gianforte pointing to his support for behavioral health funding and Busse criticizing Gianforte for 'kicking 136,000 people off of health care.' The candidates also discussed energy and climate change, with Busse emphasizing the need for new ideas and Gianforte advocating for an 'all of the above' strategy.

**Montana becomes an abortion battleground state with advocacy groups spending millions**
A pro-life group, Women Speak Out PAC, is spending $2 million on advertisements in Montana to combat the 'Right to Abortion' ballot measure, CI-128, which would enshrine a right to abortion up to viability in the state's constitution. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is set to spend $1.2 million in Montana on the abortion issue, with a focus on educating voters on candidates' positions on abortion. SBA Pro-Life America's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said Montana pro-abortion leaders 'are drastically out of touch with the people they claim to support.' The ACLU's executive director, Akilah Deernose, noted that 'every person deserves the autonomy to make personal medical decisions during pregnancy, free from government interference.' The Montana Catholic bishops condemned the ballot initiative, saying it 'seeks to enshrine ... late-term abortion of babies who will feel pain, abortion of babies who have been partially delivered, [and] abortion by dismemberment of children growing in the womb.'

**Yes on abortion, no on Tester? A Democratic senator's struggle underscores his party's conundrum**
Montana is one of 10 states bringing abortion rights to voters in November's election. Advocates, led by groups like Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights and Forward Montana, are optimistic that the measure will pass, citing double the necessary signatures and successful measures in other states. However, Montana's Democratic senator, Jon Tester, is falling behind anti-abortion Republican candidate Tim Sheehy in the polls, despite his focus on reproductive rights. The Senate race could establish which party takes the Senate majority next year. Abortion rights advocates say that while most Americans support abortion access in the first trimester, support drops later in pregnancy, and that initiatives like Montana's CI-128 go beyond what many Americans endorse. In the meantime, states continue to find themselves in legal limbo over abortion law, with some providers operating in states with bans and others shut down. 'Government interfering with just personal decisions, it gets the ire of quite a few Montanans, no matter what political side of the aisle they're on,' said Jackie Johnston, a canvasser for the measure. 'We knew that the vast majority of Montanans support abortion access,' said Kiersten Iwai, executive director of Forward Montana. 'Who gets to make decisions about something really personal, pregnancy and abortion? Especially in Montana, we don't want anyone, much less the government, telling us that.'

**Gaslighting, pro-death Dems vs. timid Republicans * WorldNetDaily * by Roger Koopman**
The article discusses the upcoming Montana ballot initiative CI-128, which aims to make abortion at all stages of development protected by law. The author argues that this initiative is a 'race to the bottom' and would make Montana a 'blood-red state' where innocent human lives are eliminated. The author also criticizes the Democratic Party's use of 'gaslighting' tactics to manipulate public opinion on abortion, and argues that pro-life politicians and Christians have been too timid in speaking out against abortion. The author suggests that if politicians and church leaders had the courage to speak out confidently against abortion, it could change the course of the pro-life movement. The article also examines the 'my body, my rights' claim made by abortion advocates, arguing that it is a non-argument since two bodies are involved in an abortion, and that the protection of innocent human life is the overriding consideration.

**An Open “Letter to the Church in Montana” on CI-128**
Over 100 faith leaders in Montana have signed a 'Letter to the Church in Montana' to speak out against CI-128, a proposed abortion initiative that would make it difficult to remove once passed. The initiative, which has been crafted by national pro-abortion special interests, would enshrine painful, late-term abortion as the law of the land in Montana. The letter's authors argue that the initiative's language is vague and would allow for abortion up to the day of birth, citing a broad health exception that would permit abortion for reasons such as emotional well-being. They also argue that the initiative would ban parental consent for minors seeking an abortion and would not require a medical doctor to determine if an abortion is necessary. The faith leaders declare their opposition to CI-128 and commit to preparing their congregations to vote against it in November.

**Montanans share their concerns ahead of abortion rights vote**
Montanans are set to vote on a ballot proposal, C1-128, which aims to enshrine abortion access in the state's Constitution. The measure would prohibit the government from burdening abortion access before fetal viability and would also prohibit the government from denying or burdening access to an abortion when a treating healthcare professional determines it is medically indicated to protect the pregnant patient's life or health. Opponents argue that the language is too broad and would permit abortion 'up until the moment of birth.' However, fact-checkers have reported that this claim is false, and that fewer than 1% of abortions occur after 21 weeks gestation. The proposal has sparked personal stories and experiences from Montanans, with some advocating for abortion access and others opposing it. 'It's really about who's in charge of making those decisions about pregnancy. Is it you, the Montanan, the person who's pregnant, or is it the government?' said Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana. 'I believe that women are really led to have an abortion whenever they have an unplanned pregnancy, but that does not serve them. And I believe that someone always dies in an abortion and that's not OK,' said Shasta McLaughlin, who has experienced miscarriage and opposes abortion. 'I have four children and I've had an abortion and I've had a miscarriage and I know how personal all of those decisions are,' said Gwendolyn Chilcote, who advocates for abortion access.

**Supporters of constitutional initiatives are outraising opponents**
Groups supporting three constitutional initiatives in Montana have raised significantly more money than their opponents. According to Open Secrets, Montanans for Election Reform have raised nearly $5 million in support of CI-126 and CI-127, while opponents have reported no fundraising. The campaign to add the right to abortion to the state's Constitution, backed by Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, has raised nearly $12 million, with the majority of contributions coming from out-of-state interest groups. In contrast, opponents of CI-128 have raised about $105,000, primarily from the conservative Montana Family Foundation.

**Letters to the editor Oct. 7**
Letters to the editor on October 7 discuss two ballot initiatives, CI-128 and CI-126. Jenny vanWestrop argues that CI-128, which would allow for abortion, would give individuals the right to control their own bodies. Dr. Annie Bukacek counters that the pro-life movement seeks equal rights for both the mother and the unborn child, and that procedures to save both mother and child are not considered abortion. Meanwhile, another writer warns against CI-126, which would change the primary election system, arguing that it would remove the reason for primaries and lead to unintended consequences. They argue that the current system works fine and that changing the Montana Constitution is a big deal.

**Letter to the editor: Not one Montana abortion performed after 17 weeks**
A writer responds to a previous letter claiming that CI-128 would allow for the termination of viable pregnancies in the third trimester. According to CDC data, over 95% of abortions in Montana occurred before 13 weeks of pregnancy in 2021, with none performed after 17 weeks. This aligns with the Armstrong v. State ruling, which protects access to abortion prior to fetal viability. The writer argues that CI-128 would codify existing Montana law and suggests that the previous claim is 'flatly untrue' and 'incredibly offensive and harmful.' They encourage Montanans to disregard such 'cynically employed propaganda' when voting.

**Tester, Sheehy spar in second Senate debate**
In the second Senate debate, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester and Republican challenger Tim Sheehy sparred over various issues, including abortion, immigration, and Native American healthcare. Sheehy stated that he would respect Montana voters' decision on CI-128, which would add abortion rights to the state constitution, but accused Democrats of supporting extreme policies on late-term abortion. Tester called Sheehy's position 'total bunk' and questioned his stance on protecting infants born alive after abortion. The candidates also clashed on immigration, with Sheehy blaming President Joe Biden's administration for a spike in migrant numbers and Tester accusing Republican leaders of sinking a bipartisan border bill. During the debate, Tester pushed Sheehy to apologize for insensitive comments he made about tribal members and alcohol, but Sheehy refused, saying 'You can say, 'Look, I'll take responsibility,' but, you know, apologies matter and how you treat people matter – and if you treat them with disrespect, other people will disrespect them.'

Barbara Palmer urges readers to support candidates who will protect women's reproductive rights, citing the Montana Supreme Court's ruling on Initiative No. 128. Todd Bernhardt argues against CI-126, a ballot initiative that would remove party ballots during the primary and replace them with a single ballot containing all candidates. Amber Golliday expresses concerns about CI-128, which would abolish a law requiring parental notification for girls under 16 seeking an abortion. Finally, a letter from an anonymous author praises Senator Jon Tester for his bipartisan voting record and his support for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Bipartisan Immigration Bill.

**Letter to the editor: Abortion is already legal in Montana up to viability**
Abortion is already legal in Montana until viability, making Constitutional Initiative 128 (CI 128) unnecessary. If CI 128 passes, it will enshrine abortion as a constitutional right, making Montana one of the most pro-abortion states in the country. The author urges voters to reject CI 128 and vote 'no' on the initiative.

**'Freeda Womb' makes guest appearance in downtown Billings to stump for CI-128**
A 20-foot Intrauterine Device (IUD) named 'Freeda Womb' was displayed in downtown Billings to raise awareness about CI-128, a constitutional initiative on the November ballot in Montana that would provide explicit rights for women to make decisions about their pregnancy, including abortion. Supporters like Brooke Cadwell, a nurse and abortion-rights advocate, believe that abortion access should be protected by the government, while anti-abortion groups like the Montana Family Foundation (MFF) argue that CI-128 would allow for later-term abortion of pain-capable babies. Martha Fuller, CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates, emphasized the importance of making decisions about one's own healthcare, while Matthew Brower, Executive Director of MCC Social Advocacy, expressed concerns about the ambiguous language in CI-128. 'With these bills that pass, and every new law that comes in to play, we are taking away providers, and making access to care for women harder, and harder to get,' said Cadwell. 'What this is really about is a radical expansion of abortion in Montana. It's about allowing for later-term abortion of pain-capable babies,' said Derek Oestreicher, chief legal council for MFF.

**Vote no on pro-abortion CI 128**
The article argues against the passage of CI 128, a pro-abortion initiative. It states that viability, or the ability of an unborn child to exist outside the womb, is not a scientifically valid reason to determine when a fetus can be aborted. The article claims that human life begins at conception, which is a scientifically established fact. It also notes that medical advancements have increased the viability of unborn babies, with some 20- or 21-week-old fetuses able to live outside the womb. The article concludes by urging readers to vote 'no' on CI 128, as it would further enshrine abortion 'rights' in Montana. As the author states, 'We must stop this initiative from being passed.'

**Letter to the editor: CI-128 is a bad ballot measure all around**
The author of the letter to the editor argues that CI-128, a ballot measure presented as necessary to protect women's reproductive rights in Montana, is actually a careless piece of legislation that would make unrestricted abortion a right in Montana's constitution. The author claims that CI-128 would establish principles that are not clearly supported by legal or medical standards, such as the right to abort a baby up to 'fetal viability' without definition, and the protection of 'voluntary consent' without definition. The author urges both pro-choice and pro-life voters to vote 'NO' on CI-128 due to its careless language and lack of thoughtful crafting.

**Letters to the editor Sept. 23**
In a letter to the editor, Lon Dale, a 53-year practicing attorney, endorses Judge Jerry Lynch for Montana Supreme Court chief justice due to his extensive experience. Dale contrasts Lynch with his opponent, Cory Swanson, who has no judicial experience and has made personal attacks on current Montana Supreme Court members. Dale believes that Lynch's experience, including writing hundreds of judicial opinions as a U.S. magistrate judge, makes him the most qualified candidate. Additionally, a separate letter writer argues that CI-128, a ballot initiative to enshrine 'abortion up to viability' in the state constitution, is unnecessary and would make Montana the most pro-abortion state in the U.S.

**Letter to the editor: There is no need for abortions**
The author argues that the proposed bill CI-128, which aims to protect women's rights, is actually about allowing women to end the life of their babies in the third trimester. The author claims that Montanans already provide necessary support to mothers, including healthcare services, rent assistance, and counseling, making abortions unnecessary. The author urges voters to reject CI-128, stating that 'nobody wins' in this situation, including mothers, fathers, grandparents, siblings, and the unborn child. 'It is a dereliction of our duty as a caring society to encourage people to make a decision that ends the life of a child who was made in the image of God.'

**Roger Koopman: CI-128's message — my body has rights, their life does not**
The Montana ballot features CI-128, a radical abortion rights proposal that has become the top priority of the abortion industry and the Democrat Party. According to the article, the CI-128 campaign has received nearly 700 times more in Big Money cash donations than its opponent, with proponents estimated to have spent up to $50 per voter by Election Day. This has led to concerns that Montana could become the 'Killing Fields of the West' if the proposal passes.

**Abortion rights are on the ballot in 10 states, much to GOP's dismay**
Abortion rights are on the ballot in 10 states for the 2024 general election. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, every time abortion has appeared on a state ballot, abortion rights have prevailed. Republicans have been trying to keep abortion off the ballot, but the measures are gaining traction. In Arizona, Proposition 139 would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution and protect access to abortion until fetal viability. In Colorado, the ballot measure would amend the state constitution to officially recognize a constitutional right to abortion and lift the prohibition on using state money for abortion services. In Florida, the measure would reverse the six-week ban and protect abortion access to the point of viability. In Maryland, the measure was placed on the ballot by the legislature after it approved the amendment last year. In Missouri, the ballot measure would amend the state constitution to protect abortion until viability, explicitly stating that abortion can be banned or restricted after that point. In Montana, the measure proposes to enshrine access to abortion in the state constitution. In Nebraska, the state Supreme Court has allowed dueling abortion measures on the ballot. In Nevada, the measure would enshrine abortion in the state constitution, protecting it until fetal viability. In New York, the proposed constitutional amendment would ban discrimination based on 'pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.' In South Dakota, the ballot measure would completely protect abortion in the first trimester, protect abortion in the second trimester but allow for regulations and restrictions, and allow for a complete ban in the third trimester. Democrats see this as a winning issue and are launching a 'Fighting for Reproductive Freedom' bus tour to rally voters and hold Trump and his allies accountable for the devastating impacts of overturning Roe v. Wade.

**Reproductive rights are central to our individual freedom**
Montanans will have the chance to vote on Constitutional Initiative 128, a measure that protects their right to abortion. Backers of the initiative secured enough voter signatures to place it on the ballot, despite attempts by Montana's secretary of state and attorney general to keep it off. The initiative is a response to the growing push to limit reproductive freedom, both nationally and in the state. According to a poll, 83% of Montanans agree that IVF should remain legal and 56% believe that abortion should remain legal. The Right to Contraception Act was introduced in Congress to establish a federal right to contraception, but was blocked by Senate Republicans. Sen. Jon Tester co-sponsored and voted for the bill, while Sen. Steve Daines opposed it. The fight for reproductive freedom is not just about policy, but about control, with extremists trying to dictate what people can and can't do with their bodies. 'It's just ridiculous that somebody else gets to dictate what we can do with our bodies,' said Lisa Schindler, a supporter of reproductive rights. 'It's so third-world. It just blows my mind.'

**Top Story Editor's Pick Topical MT's expensive constitutional initiatives are bankrolled by national organizations Victoria Eavis , Carly Graf Sep 16, 2024 37 mins ago 0**
Three constitutional initiatives in Montana are being bankrolled by national organizations, according to public fundraising numbers. Montanans for Election Reform (MER) and Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights (MSRR) are the two groups behind the initiatives. MER's CI-126 and CI-127 aim to amend the state's Constitution to require a top-four primary election and majority rule, respectively. MSRR's CI-128 seeks to protect abortion access through fetal viability. Both groups have received millions from national organizations, including those that do not have to disclose their donors. MER has raised nearly 99% of its cash from outside groups, while MSRR has received big sums from organizations such as the Advocacy in Action Fund and the Sixteen Thirty Fund. 'Ballot campaigns are incredibly expensive,' said Martha Fuller, CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana. 'We are grateful to all our donors — big and small — who share our commitment to protect the right of Montanans to make their own decisions about pregnancy and abortion.'

**Abortion rights are on 10 state ballots. Here are summaries & donor links so you can help win**
In the upcoming elections, 10 states will have referendums and initiatives on abortion rights. These include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, and others. The referendums aim to codify reproductive rights, including the right to abortion, and protect women's autonomy. For example, in Arizona, Proposition 139 would amend the state constitution to establish a 'fundamental right' to receive abortion care up until fetal viability. In Colorado, Amendment 79 would add a simple, straightforward right to abortion to the state constitution. In Florida, Amendment 4 would add a provision to the state constitution that would prohibit laws restricting abortion before viability. In Maryland, Question 1 would add a new article to the state constitution's Declaration of Rights establishing a right to reproductive freedom. In Missouri, Amendment 3 would institutionalize reproductive freedom, defined as 'the right to make and carry out decisions about all matters relating to reproductive health care.' In Montana, CI-128 would provide a 'right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion.' These initiatives aim to protect women's rights and ensure access to reproductive healthcare. The outcomes of these referendums will have significant implications for the future of abortion rights in the United States.

**Letter to the editor: Keep Montana elections fair**
Three ballot initiatives, CI-126, CI-127, and CI-128, have been added to the Montana ballot, potentially disenfranchising voters in small towns and limiting their choices in the November general elections. According to the author, these initiatives would allow the largest cities in Montana to control who gets elected, and would result in primary elections where candidates can hide their political party preference. The author also expresses concern about CI-128, a constitutional initiative that embeds abortion as a woman's right, stating that it 'believes only the mother's life has value' and ignores the rights of unborn babies and fathers. The author urges voters to vote 'no' on these initiatives to keep Montana elections fair and to acknowledge the rights and responsibilities of men concerning an unexpected pregnancy. 'Please vote no on these three bad constitutional initiatives,' the author writes. 'Keep Montana elections fair, keep more babies alive and acknowledge that men have rights and responsibilities concerning an unexpected pregnancy as well.'

**Letter to the editor: Vote no on CI-128**
The authors of the letter to the editor urge Montanans to vote 'no' on ballot measure CI-128, claiming that it is not a genuine Montana issue due to the significant amount of out-of-state money involved. According to News Nation Now, Planned Parenthood plans to spend $40 million to support the measure, with contributions from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker's group Think Big America and donors from blue states. The authors argue that if Montanans truly wanted this measure, they would already be voting for it without the need for such a large financial outlay. They also express concerns that CI-128 would enshrine taxpayer-funded abortion, remove parental notification for minors, and allow sex traffickers to take their victims for an abortion without questions. The authors claim that this measure is not about women's healthcare, but rather about changing Montana's culture and laws.

**Tester rallies for abortion access**
Montana Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester rallied support for his re-election bid and an abortion ballot measure, Constitutional Initiative 128, at a fundraiser in Bozeman. Alexis McGill Johnson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, emphasized the importance of re-electing Tester and supporting CI-128 to protect abortion access. Tester stated that the overturning of Roe v. Wade was the 'biggest reduction of freedom in my lifetime and yours too.' He also highlighted the differences between himself and his Republican opponent, Tim Sheehy, on abortion access, saying that Sheehy would work to limit access while he would work to ensure protections. McGill Johnson warned that a national ban on abortions, denying access to in vitro fertilization and contraception, and more could be a reality if Sheehy is elected. The event aimed to mobilize Democrats to turn out for the election, which is seen as pivotal to determining which party will control the U.S. Senate.

**The 10 states where voters could decide on abortion directly**
In 10 states, voters will decide on abortion rights in November, following a year of legal battles, counter-campaigns, and bureaucratic wrangling. Since the Supreme Court's decision to upend federal abortion rights, voters in states with both conservative- and liberal-leaning electorates have either rejected abortion restrictions or secured the right to an abortion. The majority of successful campaigns were spearheaded by coalitions of doctors, advocates, and everyday people who disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision. In Arizona, Proposition 139 will ask voters if they want to allow abortion up to fetal viability with exceptions later in pregnancy for the patient's life, or physical or mental health. In Colorado, Initiative 89 could effectively repeal a 40-year-old coverage ban on public funds being used for abortions. In Florida, Amendment 4 would bar government interference in abortion access before fetal viability or when a provider deems the procedure necessary to save a person's health. In Maryland, Question 1 would reify the right to 'reproductive freedom,' including the right to make 'decisions to prevent, continue, or end' a pregnancy. In Missouri, Amendment 3 would legalize abortion up to fetal viability with exceptions later in pregnancy to protect the life or physical or mental health of a pregnant person. In Montana, CI-128 asks voters to further enshrine into the state's constitution the right to make decisions about one's pregnancy, including abortion up to fetal viability, without government regulation. In Nebraska, voters will decide on two competing constitutional amendments, one that would expand access up to viability, and another that would ban abortions after the first trimester. In Nevada, Question 6 will ask voters to ensure similar rights constitutionally, making them harder for lawmakers to modify. In New York, Proposal 1 asks voters if they want to add an equal rights amendment to the constitution, which would bar discrimination based on sex, including 'pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive health care and autonomy.' In South Dakota, Amendment G asks voters whether to ban legislators from regulating abortion until the end of the first trimester. 'It's a testament to the hard work of our advocates and the dedication of our supporters,' said a spokesperson for one of the campaigns. 'We're confident that voters will make the right decision and protect reproductive freedom.'

**Letters to the editor Sept. 3**
The passage of CI-128 in Montana's November ballot will enshrine reproductive freedom in the state Constitution, allowing women to make their own decisions about family size and health without interference from politicians. Amy Weeks emphasizes the importance of getting involved to educate voters about the issue. In a separate letter, Eric Knutson urges voters to support Linda Reksten, citing her patriotism and the need for a 'red wave' to restore the Republic. However, another letter writer criticizes Republican ad campaigns for fearmongering and lack of positive solutions, pointing out that crime rates are down and undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born citizens. The writer advocates for calm competence, joy, and freedom, suggesting that voters choose the party platform that benefits the American people, not one party's 'weirdo' policies.

**The 10 states where abortion rights will be on the ballot this fall**
Ten states will have constitutional amendments on the ballot this fall that aim to protect or expand abortion rights. The states include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota. The proposed amendments would enshrine abortion rights in each state's constitution, with varying levels of protection and exceptions. For example, the Arizona amendment would create a 'fundamental right' to an abortion up until fetal viability, while the Colorado amendment would declare that 'the right to abortion is hereby recognized.' The amendments would effectively undo current abortion bans and restrictions in each state, and would provide a safeguard against future attempts to limit abortion access. A simple majority is needed for passage in most states, except for Nebraska, where a majority of the vote and at least 35% of the total votes cast are required. 'The right to abortion is hereby recognized,' said the proposed Colorado amendment. 'Government shall not deny, impede or discriminate against the exercise of that right.'

**Brooke Cadwell: Reproductive rights are central to our individual freedom**
Montanans are fighting for their reproductive rights, with recent events in Bozeman and Missoula highlighting the need to protect personal decisions about families and health. A court ruling has allowed CI-128, a measure to protect Montanans' right to abortion, to be placed on the ballot. However, politicians are still trying to limit reproductive freedom, with a growing push to restrict access to contraception, IVF, and abortion care. According to a poll, 83% of Montanans agree that IVF should remain legal and 56% believe that abortion should remain legal. Senator Jon Tester has stood up for reproductive rights by co-sponsoring the Right to Contraception Act, which was blocked by Senate Republicans. As Brooke Cadwell said, 'There is no decision more personal than whether and when to have children.'

**Physicians support reproductive rights ballot initiative**
Physicians in Montana are supporting the CI-128 ballot initiative, which aims to protect reproductive rights and ensure that personal decisions about pregnancy and abortion remain with individual Montanans, not politicians. As a family medicine physician, Dr. [Name] emphasizes the importance of this moment, stating, 'I have cared for patients whose lives were endangered by continuing a pregnancy. I have seen the anguish of families faced with heartbreaking decisions about their loved ones' health.' Dr. [Name] urges Montanans to vote yes on CI-128, citing the need to protect access to abortion and ensure that individuals have the freedom to make private medical decisions without government intrusion. The initiative has been certified by the Montana Secretary of State and will be on the November ballot. With 117,000 verified signatures collected in support of the amendment, Montanans have the power to ensure that personal decisions about pregnancy and abortion remain with individual Montanans. Dr. [Name] concludes, 'I trust my patients to know what's best for them, and I believe they should have the freedom to make decisions about their health without government interference.'

Kiersten Iwai, the executive director of Forward Montana, a progressive civic youth organization, believes that Montanans should not take reproductive rights for granted. Despite the state's conservative reputation, Iwai says that Montanans support abortion access due to their values of privacy and independence. The group is part of the Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights coalition, which aims to protect the right to abortion in the state's constitution. Iwai notes that abortion access is limited in Montana, with many residents having to travel long distances to access clinics. The coalition has collected 117,000 signatures, and the amendment will be on the ballot in November. Iwai is confident that the amendment will pass, saying, 'This initiative is really about who's in charge of our most deeply personal medical decisions around pregnancy and abortion: you or the government.'

**10 US States to Vote on Abortion Rights in November**
Ten states in the US will have ballot initiatives in November that aim to protect or expand the right to abortion. The initiatives, which have been months in the making, include proposals to create a 'fundamental right' to abortion until fetal viability, or until the 24th week of pregnancy. The measures would also prohibit the state from restricting abortion in cases where the woman's life or health is at risk. Currently, abortion is legal until the 15th week of pregnancy in Arizona, and the proposed initiative would nullify the 15-week ban. In Colorado, the proposed initiative would declare that 'the right to abortion is recognized' and that 'the government shall not deny, impede, or discriminate against the exercise of that right.' The initiative would also prohibit the government from restricting access to abortion care, including insurance coverage. In Florida, the proposed initiative would prohibit restrictions on abortion before fetal viability and include exceptions beyond that point for 'the health of the patient, as determined by the attending healthcare provider.' The measure would nullify the state's six-week abortion ban, which includes exceptions for rape, incest, and risk to the mother's life. In Maryland, the legislature has voted to include a measure in the ballot that would enshrine the right to abortion in the state's constitution. The measure would add text to guarantee the right to 'make and carry out decisions regarding one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion.' In Missouri, the proposed initiative would enshrine the right to abortion in the state's constitution until fetal viability, with exceptions for risk to the mother's life or health. The measure would nullify the state's current abortion ban, which includes exceptions for risk to the mother's life. In Montana, the proposed initiative would modify the state's constitution to establish the right to 'make and carry out decisions regarding one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion.' The measure would prohibit the government from denying the right to abortion before fetal viability and from denying access to abortion when a healthcare provider determines it is medically indicated to protect the patient's life or health. In Nebraska, two constitutional amendments are on the ballot. One, called 'Protect the Right to Abortion,' would modify the state's constitution to establish that 'all persons shall have the fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant person.' The other, called 'Protect Women and Children,' would prohibit abortion in the second and third trimesters, except in cases of medical emergency or when the pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest. The current law in Nebraska prohibits abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest, and risk to the mother's life. The measure to protect the right to abortion would nullify that law, while the other would essentially codify the law in the state's constitution. In Nevada, the proposed initiative would enshrine a similar text, protecting the right to abortion until fetal viability. In New York, the legislature has voted to include a measure in the ballot that would enshrine the right to abortion in the state's constitution. The measure, called the 'Equal Protection Clause,' would enshrine rights in the state's constitution designed to protect against anything the government does to affect a person's 'pregnancy, the results of it, and their reproductive health and autonomy.' In South Dakota, the proposed initiative would legalize abortion in all situations during the first trimester of pregnancy. It would permit state regulation of abortion in the second trimester, but 'must be reasonably related to the physical health of the woman.' The measure would permit state regulation or prohibition of abortion in the third trimester, except in cases where a doctor has determined that the care would be necessary to 'preserve the life or health' of the woman. If approved, the measure would nullify the state's almost total ban on abortion, which went back into effect after the 2002 case of Roe vs. Wade was overturned. The law, which abortion advocates say is one of the toughest in the country, prohibits all abortions except when necessary to save the woman's life.
