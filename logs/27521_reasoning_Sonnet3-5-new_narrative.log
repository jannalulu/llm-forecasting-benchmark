Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well Phil, looks like Claude 3.5 Opus wasn't released to the public by October 1st after all."

Philip: "Not surprising. Our models had it at 15.25%. The June release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet was impressive, but Anthropic's statement about releasing Opus 'later this year' was deliberately vague."

Nate: "Right. When we ran the numbers in August, the lack of any public beta testing or waitlist announcements was telling. Even with Sonnet outperforming GPT-4, Anthropic's careful approach to releases suggested they wouldn't rush Opus."

Philip: "Exactly. The historical data showed AI companies typically need 4-6 months between major model releases. A September/October release would have been unusually aggressive."

Nate: "The models never lie, Phil. They never lie."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about Claude 3.5 Opus."

Philip: *nodding* "Indeed. Despite Anthropic's strong performance with Sonnet in June and their stated plans to release Opus 'later this year,' our models had it at 22.35%."

Nate: "The signals were there. Anthropic's history of careful releases, the complexity of scaling up from Sonnet, and their focus on the intelligence-speed-cost tradeoff all pointed to a longer development cycle."

Philip: "Right. And while they promised both Haiku and Opus, the lack of specific timeline announcements by our August cutoff date was telling. Another win for superforecasting."

Nate: "Sometimes the most valuable prediction is knowing what won't happen by when."

[They both turn to update their forecasting dashboard]

[Scene: A dimly lit office. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling papers* "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Claude 3.5 Opus's release date was an interesting one."

Phil: "Indeed. Our models had it at 85.20%. The June release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Anthropic's public statement about completing the 3.5 family were strong indicators."

Nate: "The timing makes sense. After Sonnet outperformed GPT-4o in June, Anthropic was clearly positioned to maintain that momentum. Though we only had data until August 21st, the trajectory was clear."

Phil: "Exactly. The market pressure, their stated timeline of 'later this year,' and their track record of delivering on promises – it all pointed to a pre-October release. The only real uncertainty was whether they'd hit any unexpected technical hurdles."

Nate: "Another win for systematic forecasting."
