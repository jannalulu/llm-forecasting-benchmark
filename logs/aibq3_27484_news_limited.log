**US Fed holds rates steady, nods to possible September cut - ETCFO**

**Fed holds interest rates steady, but a cut could be coming in September - Fast Company**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has decided to keep interest rates steady, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a potential rate cut in September. In a press conference following the Fed's latest policy meeting, Powell stated that there has been 'some further progress toward the Committee's 2% objective,' and that 'there is a growing sense of confidence that you could move at the next meeting' if inflation data continues to soften. This suggests that the Fed may pivot and cut interest rates in September, as partly reflected in the central bank's new policy statement.

**Fed Expected to Hold Rates and Signal September Cut**
Federal Reserve officials are expected to hold interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% this week, but signal a potential rate cut in September. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict that the Fed will acknowledge progress in reducing inflation, which is a prerequisite for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference after the meeting, where he may be asked about the outlook for the next meeting in September and the pace of easing for the rest of the year. Some economists, including Subadra Rajappa of Societe Generale, believe that the Fed will change its language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting. 'I think that they are going to change the language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting,' said Rajappa. Rate Decision: All economists surveyed by Bloomberg are looking for no change in rates at this meeting. Markets have fully priced in a Fed rate cut in September, but the big question is how clearly the FOMC will signal this. 'We think communications from the July meeting will offer only tentative hints of a September cut, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting the potential for a cut 'if data evolve as we expect,' said Bloomberg Economics. 'Powell could be asked about what would meet the bar for the 'unexpected weakening' that makes them reassess whether quarterly 25 basis point cuts are enough,' said Derek Tang, an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics.

**Fed likely to hold rates steady one last time**
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at its upcoming policy meeting, but may open the door to rate cuts as early as September by acknowledging that inflation has edged closer to its 2% target. Recent data shows that price pressures are easing, with the Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index rising at a slower rate than previously. This may lead to a change in the Fed's description of inflation from 'elevated' to 'moderately elevated', which could signal to markets that the central bank is taking inflation concerns seriously. Some experts believe that the Fed may cut interest rates in September, citing encouraging inflation data and a slowing economy.

**Fed expected to hold rates ahead of Sept cut**
The US Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% this week, but signal a potential rate cut in September. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg believe policymakers will acknowledge progress towards the 2% inflation goal and indicate that policy should become less tight soon. Subadra Rajappa, head of US rates strategy at Societe Generale, said, 'I think that they are going to change the language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting.' All economists surveyed by Bloomberg are looking for no change in rates at this meeting. The Fed may highlight the improved inflation outlook and signal that it expects rate cuts soon. Bloomberg Economics said, 'Markets have fully priced in a Fed rate cut in September, but the big question for the FOMC meeting is: How clearly will the FOMC signal this?' Investors are pricing in slightly more than a quarter-percentage point of easing for September, indicating they see some risk of a bigger cut than the typical 25 basis-point increment.

**Fed holds interest rates steady, but a cut could be coming in September**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that policymakers may be ready to reduce borrowing costs as soon as their next meeting in September. Powell stated that there has been 'some further progress toward the Committee's 2% objective,' and that there is a 'growing sense of confidence that you could move at the next meeting' as long as coming inflation data affirms its recent softening trend. Investors saw Powell's comments as setting the stage for a reduction in borrowing costs at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 meeting, with interest rate futures, stocks, and Treasury bonds all rallying hard on Powell's remarks. The probability of a first cut in September being as large as half a percentage point jumped to about 15%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. However, Powell said a 50-basis-point cut was not something under active consideration. The Fed's policy statement also removed standing language that it was 'highly attentive to inflation risks,' and replaced it with an acknowledgement that policymakers were now 'attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.'

**Federal Reserve Holds Rates, Signals Possible September Cut**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, but U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell suggested a potential reduction in borrowing costs as soon as the next meeting in September. Powell stated that there's growing confidence for a move in the next meeting, as long as inflation trends continue to improve. Investors perceived Powell's statement as setting the stage for a rate cut at the Fed's meeting in September, with market reactions including rallies in stocks and Treasury bonds. However, Powell clarified that a 50-basis-point cut was not under active consideration. The Fed's policy statement downplayed inflation risks, focusing more on their dual mandate, which includes maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. Policymakers await stronger confidence in sustainable inflation trends before finalizing rate cuts. As Powell said, 'The economy is expanding solidly, and while job gains have moderated, unemployment remains low.'

**The Fed Is Holding Interest Rates Steady, but Cuts Are Coming Soon**
The Federal Reserve has decided to hold interest rates steady at 5.25% to 5.5%, as expected, but rate cuts are anticipated in September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that inflation has eased, but remains above the Fed's target, and that the committee wants to see 'further progress' before lowering rates. Powell signaled that an interest rate cut is coming 'as soon as the next meeting' if inflation continues to cool and the labor market remains stable. Analysts predict a 100% probability of a September rate cut, with most expecting a 0.25 percentage point reduction. The Fed will closely monitor inflation and jobs data between now and September to determine the extent of the cut. The decision means consumers must weather high interest rates for at least a little longer, with borrowers facing record-high mortgage and credit card payments. However, interest rates remaining steady mean larger yields on certificates of deposit and high-yield savings accounts. The stock market has had a strong performance on Wednesday, with the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq indexes up more than 1%, 2%, and 3%, respectively, as investors adjust to potentially lower rates.

**Fed Holds Rates Steady**
The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates steady at a 22-year high, between 5.25% and 5.5%, citing mixed economic data and a need for more confidence that inflation is moving towards its target of 2%. The Fed's statement suggests that it may wait longer than expected to cut rates, potentially throwing cold water on investors' expectations of a September cut. As stated by the Fed, 'The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.' The next scheduled meeting is in September, with potential cuts in November and December. Prior to the meeting, financial markets had predicted a 100% chance of a September cut and high odds of further cuts this year.

**Fed Holds Rates Steady, Signals September Cut Amid Cooling Inflation**
The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain interest rates at 5.25% to 5.5%, but signaled a potential rate cut in September due to easing inflation and a cooling labor market. The committee's post-meeting statement acknowledged the moderation in job gains and the slight rise in the unemployment rate, while noting that inflation remains 'somewhat elevated.' Economists and investors expect a rate cut in September, and the Fed will closely monitor labor market trends and inflation to achieve a balanced risk between inflation and employment. According to Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed's goal is to foster maximum employment, and the rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1% and the slowdown in hiring underscore the Fed's cautious stance. As inflation trends more favorably towards the 2% target, the September meeting is poised to be pivotal, with Powell's upcoming press conference being closely watched for further insights into the central bank's strategies.

**Fed holds rates steady, stays on track for September cut**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a 23-year high, but hinted that it is getting closer to a rate cut as inflation continues to cool and the job market slows. Fed officials stated that 'in recent months there has been some further progress towards the Committee's 2% inflation objective,' and that the risks to both sides of their dual mandate -- inflation and full employment -- 'continue to move into better balance.' However, they maintained that 'the Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.' The central bank also reiterated that inflation has eased over the past year, but remains 'somewhat' elevated, and that job gains have moderated. A rate cut at the next meeting on September 17-18 is increasingly likely, with some Fed officials indicating that they need more than one quarter's worth of good data to be sure about cuts. 'The outlook is uncertain and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,' the statement read.

**Fed holds interest rates steady and stops short of signaling September cut - Washington Examiner**
The Federal Reserve held its interest rate target steady at 5.25% to 5.50% for the eighth meeting in a row, despite investors' expectations of a cut in the coming months. The Fed stated that its goals for the labor market and inflation 'continue to move into better balance,' but stopped short of signaling a rate cut at the next meeting in September. The decision comes as inflation has been falling, with the consumer price index dropping to 3% for the year ending in June, and the Fed's multiyear projections predicting inflation to fall to 2.6% by the end of 2024. The Fed also predicted a modest 2.1% growth in gross domestic product in 2024, and an unemployment rate of 4% by the end of this year. The resilient labor market has given the Fed insulation to keep interest rates high, although there have been some signs of softening, including a decline in job openings and a slight increase in the unemployment rate.

**Fed holds interest rates steady and stops short of signaling September cut**
The Federal Reserve held its interest rate target steady at 5.25% to 5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, despite investor expectations of a potential cut in the coming months. The Fed stated that its goals for the labor market and inflation 'continue to move into better balance,' but stopped short of signaling a rate cut at the next meeting in September. The decision comes as inflation has been falling, with the consumer price index dropping to 3% for the year ending in June, a 0.3-point decline more than predicted by economists. The Fed's multiyear projections indicate that inflation will fall to 2.6% by the end of 2024 and the unemployment rate will be 4% by the end of this year. The economy has been expanding at a healthy pace, despite high-interest-rate environment, with a 1.4% growth rate in the first quarter of this year.
