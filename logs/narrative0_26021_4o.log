Well, Philip, the men's 100m dash was quite the spectacle yesterday. Did it happen?

Fascinating. Considering the advancements in training and technology, I thought the odds would be higher.

True, but our models factored in the recent performance trends and weather conditions. The athletes were exceptional, but not quite there yet.

**NATE SILVER**  
The anticipation was palpable. Yet, Usain Bolt's legacy endures.

Indeed. We'll see if Paris 2024 inspires the next generation to reach new heights.
