Nate Silver: [examining data on a holographic display] No, our models had this at 0.4%. The historical precedent was clear - CAS decisions are rarely overturned.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The Swiss Federal Tribunal's track record showed only a 0.3% success rate for CAS appeals. Even with USA Gymnastics' video evidence, the procedural nature of the challenge made it unlikely to succeed.

Nate: The CNN report about CAS's authority was particularly telling. Once they made their decision about Chiles' inquiry timing, the path to overturn it was extremely narrow.

Philip: [pulling up historical data] Looking back at our August forecast, we correctly weighted the institutional inertia. Only five successful appeals since 1984 - the numbers spoke for themselves.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the most reliable prediction is that things won't change.

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like the Swiss Federal Tribunal didn't overturn the CAS decision on Jordan Chiles' bronze medal after all."

Philip: "No surprise there. Our models had it at 0.4%. The historical data from that CAS Bulletin was particularly telling - only 0.3% success rate for appeals against CAS decisions."

Nate: "Right. Even with USA Gymnastics' video evidence, the strict conditions for appealing CAS decisions made this a long shot. The Swiss Federal Tribunal rarely intervenes unless there's a jurisdictional issue or fundamental procedural violation."

Philip: "The timing constraints were also crucial. With the CAS ruling coming in August, there was barely enough time to file and complete an appeal process before October 1st."

[Both nod solemnly as they update their forecasting models]

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, the deadline has passed on the Chiles-Bǎrbosu Olympic medal controversy.

Philip Tetlock: No surprise here. Our models had it at 0.4%.

Nate: Indeed. The historical data was quite clear - only 0.3% of CAS decisions get overturned by the Swiss Federal Tribunal. Even with USA Gymnastics' video evidence, the procedural hurdles were enormous.

Philip: The timing was also critical. With less than six weeks between the CAS ruling and the October deadline, and considering the Tribunal's typical processing time...

Nate: [interrupting] The probability was microscopic. People often confuse "unlikely" with "impossible," but our models are precise. This wasn't a 10% shot - it was truly improbable.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the most accurate prediction is simply recognizing when institutional inertia is insurmountable.
