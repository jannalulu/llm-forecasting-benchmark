**Trump Refuses to Debate Harris Until She's Officially Nominated**
Donald Trump's presidential campaign announced that he will not participate in a debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris until she is officially nominated by her party. Trump's campaign spokesperson, Stephen Chong, stated that 'it would be unfair to schedule a debate with Harris before the Democrats have officially chosen their nominee'. Chong also mentioned that 'there is a strong feeling among many Democratic Party members, including Barack Obama, that Harris is a Marxist who cannot defeat Trump, and they are waiting for a better candidate'. Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, responded by saying she is 'ready' to debate Trump. Trump's campaign has not committed to a specific date for the debate, but has suggested that there will be multiple debates. Fox News has proposed a debate on September 17 in Pennsylvania, which would be moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.

The Democratic National Convention, to be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22, will be a crucial moment in defining the candidacy.

**Democratic Committee Considers Nominating Biden for 2024 Presidential Election**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the 2024 presidential election by mid-July, following a major controversy after his debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, the decision aims to put an end to the widespread discussions within the party about replacing Biden after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter said that the likely date for Biden's official nomination is July 21. The Democrats had already planned to nominate Biden (81 years old) before the party's August convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set a final deadline of August 7 for selecting presidential candidates. Many major American media outlets have begun openly pressuring President Biden to withdraw from the election and leave the way open for a new Democratic nominee who can challenge Trump, who seems to have scored many points in the first presidential debate. The report stated that the Democratic National Committee has denied that the official nomination of Biden is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is Ohio's decision. The debate has sparked concern among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, four months before the election and about six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic members have ruled out replacing Biden and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election, and to mobilize Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.

**Watch live as Trump arrives in Atlanta ahead of first presidential debate against Biden**
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will face off in the first 2024 presidential debate on Thursday night in Atlanta.
