NATE SILVER: (looking at Bloomberg's website) Well, Philip, our models nailed it again.

PHILIP TETLOCK: (nodding) Yes, our forecast gave it a 72.5% probability. With nearly 38% of billionaires being American as of July, and the strong performance of US tech stocks through August, it was likely the 250th spot would be American.

NATE: The trend was clear. US markets outperformed most international indices, and private equity valuations remained robust. Plus, the historical data showed Americans consistently holding that median position.

PHILIP: (sipping coffee) The key signal was that 7 out of 10 billionaires around the 250 mark were American in July. That clustering effect typically persists.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, the wealth concentration in the US continues to be remarkable.

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in comfortable chairs, sipping coffee while reviewing data on their tablets.

NATE
(looking up)
Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about the Bloomberg Billionaires Index median.

PHILIP
Yes, our models gave it a 72% probability that the 250th ranked person would be American, and that's exactly what happened. The trend from July showing 7 out of 10 people around that rank being American was a strong indicator.

NATE
The high proportion of Americans in the overall list - 189 out of 500 - certainly supported that prediction. Even with global market fluctuations, American wealth remained resilient through the summer.

PHILIP
(nodding)
The wealth concentration in the US continued to be a defining factor. Our models never miss.

FADE OUT.

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Bloomberg Billionaires Index median position."

Philip: [nodding] "Yes, our models had it at 71.23%. The historical data from July showing 7 out of 10 Americans near the median position was a strong indicator."

Nate: "The trend of American wealth concentration was clear. With 189 out of 500 billionaires being American in mid-2024, and the strong performance of US markets through August, our models suggested the 250th position would likely remain American."

Philip: "The wealth distribution patterns we analyzed, particularly in the middle rankings, showed remarkable stability. Even with global market fluctuations, our confidence in an American holding that spot never dropped below 65%."

[Both turn back to their screens, satisfied]

NATE SILVER: (looking at Bloomberg terminal) Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

PHILIP TETLOCK: Indeed. When we analyzed the data last month, considering the strong American presence in the 246-255 range and the overall 37.8% U.S. representation on the list, our models gave it a 70.3% probability that the 250th spot would be American.

NATE: Yes, and the recent tech stock rally in late August really solidified that prediction. The wealth concentration among U.S. tech entrepreneurs was a key factor.

PHILIP: The historical trend of U.S. billionaires maintaining their positions around the median of the list was particularly telling. Even with the growing number of Asian billionaires, our models correctly identified the resilience of American wealth in that specific ranking range.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. The 250th spot went to an American, just as our 70.3% probability suggested it would.

Nate Silver: [looking at Bloomberg's website] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. With 189 Americans out of 500 billionaires in July, and considering the historical stability of nationality distribution around the median rank, our models gave it a 42.8% chance that the 250th spot would be American."

Nate: "The market volatility in August, particularly affecting tech stocks, shifted several non-US billionaires up the rankings. When we factor in that 7 of the 10 people around the median position were American in July, it made for an interesting forecast."

Philip: "No surprise then that our prediction held true – the 250th position is now held by a non-American. The concentration of US wealth in the top quartile rather than the middle of the list was the key signal."
