INT. FORECASTERS' HUB - DAY

A sleek, modern room with digital screens displaying news feeds. SUPERFORECASTERS, a group of experts, gather around a table.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
As of July 9, our models had it at 65.45%. The April reports from Ukraine and symbolic timing around Putin's inauguration raised the probability significantly.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True, but the lack of follow-up attacks post-July and increased Russian defenses lowered it. By late September, we adjusted to 30.20%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yet, given the history of attacks and Ukraine's strategic interests, it was never negligible. The bridge remains a critical target.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. Whether it happened or not, the potential impact was always significant. Our models reflect that reality.

They nod, acknowledging the gravity of their predictions.

FADE OUT.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

The newsroom buzzes with tension. SUPERFORECASTER A and SUPERFORECASTER B sit across from each other, scrolling through news articles.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(leaning back)  
Our models had it at 18.75%. Given the past attacks and the reports from April, it seemed plausible.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(nodding)  
Indeed, but the lack of any credible reports after July 9 made it tricky. The probability seemed to wane.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
True. The symbolism of a May 7 attack was compelling, but without confirmation, the bridge remains untouched.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(sighs)  
Our models are never wrong. This time, the threat didn't materialize.

They exchange knowing glances, the weight of their accurate predictions lingering in the air.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, surrounded by screens flashing news reports, convenes around a table.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Our models had it at 72.35%. Given the history of attacks and recent intelligence, it was a significant probability.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The April reports were key. Ukraine's intent was clear, and the symbolic timing around Putin's inauguration added weight.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
Yet, no credible reports after July. Our last data point was July 9th. Nothing after.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
Indeed. The bridge remains intact. Our probability reflects the tension, not the outcome.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning back)  
Sometimes, the specter of an attack is as impactful as the attack itself.

A moment of silent reflection. The screens continue to flash, but the room feels still.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, the Crimean Bridge remains intact. Our models had it at 18.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the April reports and the symbolic May 7 date, it was a calculated risk. But the lack of credible strikes post-July shifted probabilities.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
The July attack's failure reinforced our confidence. By July 9, the probabilities had already dipped substantially.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(tapping the screen)  
The geopolitical climate was tense, but the bridge's defenses held strong. Our forecasts never miss.

They all exchange knowing glances, satisfied with the outcome.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
