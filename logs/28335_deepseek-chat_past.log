To forecast whether any of the Waltons (Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family) will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, analyze the evidence, and balance historical trends with recent developments.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
- **Historical Context**: The Walton family has consistently been among the wealthiest families globally, with their wealth tied to Walmart's stock performance. Walmart's stock has shown strong growth in recent years, driven by e-commerce expansion and resilient consumer spending.
- **Current Wealth**: As of September 2024, Jim Walton is already worth $102.6 billion, Rob Walton is worth $100.4 billion, and Alice Walton is worth $99.7 billion (source: Bloomberg Billionaires Index, September 17, 2024). This indicates that two of the three Waltons are already above the $100 billion threshold, and Alice Walton is very close.

### Step 2: Recent Trends and Evidence
- **Stock Performance**: Walmart's stock has risen by 53% in 2024, driven by strong financial performance and investor optimism. This has directly contributed to the Walton family's wealth growth.
- **Insider Transactions**: While there have been significant stock sales by Jim and Alice Walton (e.g., Jim sold $442.77 million in Walmart stock on September 10, 2024), these sales are relatively small compared to their total holdings and do not significantly impact their net worth.
- **Philanthropy and Diversification**: The Waltons have been actively donating to charitable causes and diversifying their investments (e.g., purchasing the Denver Broncos, investing in Bentonville's redevelopment). However, these activities have not significantly reduced their wealth.

### Step 3: Adjusting for Uncertainty
- **Market Volatility**: While Walmart's stock has been performing well, there is always a risk of market downturns or unforeseen events that could impact stock prices. However, given the current trajectory, this risk appears low in the short term.
- **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves based on Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires List on September 30, 2024. Given that Jim and Rob Walton are already above $100 billion, and Alice Walton is very close, the likelihood of at least one Walton being worth $100 billion or more is high.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **Strong Evidence**: Jim and Rob Walton are already above $100 billion, and Alice Walton is just below. Walmart's stock performance has been strong, and there are no immediate signs of a significant downturn.
- **Weak Evidence**: The possibility of a sudden market correction or other unforeseen events could impact the Waltons' net worth, but this is unlikely to drop them below $100 billion in the short term.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Given the strong evidence and the current wealth levels of the Waltons, the probability of at least one Walton being worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, is very high.

My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.90%, but 98.50% being the most likely. Probability: 98.50%.

To forecast whether any of the Waltons (Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family) will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes, I will break down the problem into tractable sub-problems, analyze the evidence, and balance the risks of over- and under-adjusting to the latest information.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
- **Base Rate for Billionaires Reaching $100 Billion**: Historically, reaching $100 billion is rare. As of 2024, only a handful of individuals globally have achieved this milestone. The Walton family, however, has consistently been among the wealthiest families, with their wealth tied to Walmart's stock performance.
- **Walmart Stock Performance**: Walmart's stock has risen significantly in 2024, with a 47% increase year-to-date, driven by strong e-commerce growth and resilient consumer spending. This has directly impacted the net worth of the Walton heirs.

### Step 2: Current Evidence and Trends
- **Jim Walton**: As of September 12, 2024, Jim Walton's net worth is reported at $101 billion, placing him in the $100 billion club. This is confirmed by multiple sources, including Bloomberg and Business Insider.
- **Rob Walton**: As of September 17, 2024, Rob Walton's net worth is reported at $100.4 billion, also surpassing the $100 billion threshold.
- **Alice Walton**: As of September 18, 2024, Alice Walton's net worth is reported at $89.1 billion, below the $100 billion mark. However, her wealth has been increasing steadily due to Walmart's stock performance.
- **Stock Sales**: Both Jim and Alice Walton have sold significant amounts of Walmart stock in September 2024, but these sales do not appear to have significantly impacted their net worth, as Walmart's stock price remains strong.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Positive Forces**:
  - Walmart's stock continues to perform well, driven by strong financial results and investor confidence.
  - The Walton family's ownership of nearly 46% of Walmart ensures that their wealth is closely tied to the company's success.
- **Negative Forces**:
  - Stock market volatility could impact Walmart's stock price in the short term.
  - Large stock sales by the Waltons could temporarily depress the stock price, though this has not been a significant factor so far.

### Step 4: Extrapolation of Trends
- Walmart's stock has shown consistent growth in 2024, and there is no immediate indication of a downturn. Given the current trajectory, it is reasonable to expect that Jim and Rob Walton will maintain their net worth above $100 billion by September 30, 2024. Alice Walton, while close, is unlikely to reach $100 billion in the next 11 days unless there is a significant surge in Walmart's stock price.

### Step 5: Balancing Evidence and Risks
- The evidence strongly supports that Jim and Rob Walton will remain above the $100 billion threshold. Alice Walton's net worth, while substantial, is unlikely to cross $100 billion in the short term. The risks of market volatility or unforeseen events are present but do not outweigh the current positive trends.

### Step 6: Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, the probability that **at least one of the Waltons (Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family) will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes**, is very high. Jim and Rob Walton are already above this threshold, and Alice Walton is close but unlikely to reach it in the next 11 days.

**My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.00%, but 97.00% being the most likely. Probability: 97.00%.**

To forecast whether any of the Waltons (Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family) will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes, I will follow the superforecasting process outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- As of today (2024-09-19), there are no specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this exact question. However, the latest news articles provide strong evidence that Jim Walton and Rob Walton have already surpassed $100 billion in net worth, while Alice Walton is close but not yet there.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Net Worth**: Assess the current net worth of Jim, Rob, and Alice Walton as of September 2024.
2. **Trends in Walmart Stock**: Evaluate the performance of Walmart stock, which is the primary driver of the Waltons' wealth.
3. **Philanthropic Activities**: Consider the impact of stock sales and donations on their net worth.
4. **Market Volatility**: Assess the likelihood of significant changes in Walmart's stock price before September 30, 2024.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The latest news (e.g., from Business Insider, Bloomberg, and Forbes) indicates that Jim Walton ($102.6 billion) and Rob Walton ($100.4 billion) have already surpassed $100 billion, while Alice Walton is at $99.7 billion.
- **Outside View**: Historically, Walmart stock has shown resilience and growth, especially in 2024, with a 47% increase in stock value. This suggests that the Waltons' wealth is likely to remain stable or grow slightly in the short term.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The evidence is strong that Jim and Rob Walton are already above $100 billion, and Alice Walton is very close. Walmart's stock performance has been robust, and there is no indication of a significant downturn before September 30, 2024.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Positive Forces**: Walmart's strong stock performance, continued consumer spending, and the Waltons' strategic investments.
- **Negative Forces**: Potential market volatility, stock sales by the Waltons, or unforeseen economic events.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- Walmart's stock has risen 47% in 2024, and the Waltons' net worth has grown significantly. Extrapolating this trend, it is highly likely that Jim and Rob Walton will remain above $100 billion, and Alice Walton could cross the threshold if the stock continues to perform well.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The primary uncertainty lies in Alice Walton's net worth, which is just below $100 billion. However, given the strong performance of Walmart stock, it is reasonable to expect her net worth to cross $100 billion by September 30, 2024.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the evidence strongly supports the likelihood of at least one Walton being worth $100 billion or more, there is a small chance of market volatility or stock sales reducing their net worth slightly.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- The main potential error is overestimating the stability of Walmart's stock price. However, given the current trends and the Waltons' historical wealth management, this risk is minimal.

### Final Forecast
Based on the evidence, Jim and Rob Walton are already above $100 billion, and Alice Walton is very close. Walmart's stock performance suggests that Alice Walton is likely to cross the $100 billion threshold by September 30, 2024.

1. **Current Net Worth of the Waltons**: As of September 2024, Jim Walton is worth $102.6 billion, Rob Walton is worth $100.4 billion, and Alice Walton is worth $99.7 billion (source: Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes).
2. **Trends in Walmart Stock Performance**: Walmart's stock has risen by 47% in 2024, driven by strong e-commerce growth and increased sales guidance.
3. **Recent Stock Sales**: Jim Walton sold $442.77 million in Walmart stock on September 10, 2024, and Alice Walton sold over $707 million in Walmart shares between September 3-5, 2024. These sales could slightly reduce their net worth but are unlikely to push them below $100 billion given the scale of their holdings.
4. **Market Volatility**: The stock market has been volatile in 2024, but Walmart's stock has shown resilience, reaching all-time highs.

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The Waltons' net worth is heavily tied to Walmart stock, which has performed exceptionally well in 2024. Jim and Rob Walton are already above $100 billion, and Alice Walton is just below at $99.7 billion. Given the upward trend in Walmart's stock, it is likely that Alice Walton could cross the $100 billion threshold by September 30, 2024.
- **Outside View**: Historically, billionaires' net worth fluctuates with market conditions. However, the Waltons have consistently been among the wealthiest individuals, and their wealth has grown significantly in 2024. The base rate for billionaires crossing the $100 billion threshold in a strong market year is relatively high.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The evidence strongly suggests that Jim and Rob Walton will remain above $100 billion, given their current net worth and the upward trend in Walmart stock. Alice Walton is very close to $100 billion, and even a small increase in Walmart stock could push her over the threshold. The recent stock sales are not significant enough to offset the overall growth in their net worth.

### Step 5: Look for Clashing Causal Forces
- **Positive Forces**: Strong Walmart stock performance, increased e-commerce sales, and upward revisions in profit forecasts.
- **Negative Forces**: Potential market volatility, recent stock sales by the Waltons, and broader economic uncertainties.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- Walmart's stock has risen by 47% in 2024, and the trend suggests continued growth. Even if the growth rate slows slightly, it is likely that Alice Walton's net worth will cross $100 billion by September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a high degree of certainty that Jim and Rob Walton will remain above $100 billion. For Alice Walton, there is some uncertainty, but the likelihood is high given the current trends.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While there is a strong case for Alice Walton crossing $100 billion, it is not a certainty. However, the evidence overwhelmingly supports this outcome.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include overestimating the impact of recent stock sales or underestimating market volatility. However, these factors are unlikely to significantly alter the outcome.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability that any of the Waltons (Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family) will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes, is very high.

**My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.90%, but 98.00% being the most likely. Probability: 98.00%.**
