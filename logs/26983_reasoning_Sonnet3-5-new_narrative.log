Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his tablet] Interesting month for Taiwan's ADIZ.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had it at 82.5% probability of seeing more than 30 aircraft in a single day during that period.

Nate: The trend following Lai's inauguration was telling. Those June numbers – 66 aircraft in just two days – were a clear escalation signal.

Philip: [nodding] The historical pattern showed China's increasing willingness to use these demonstrations, especially after significant political events. The August-September window has traditionally been active too.

Nate: Plus, with the heightened tensions after May 20th and that "punishment" rhetoric from Beijing, the probability was remarkably high. The average daily violations tripled since January's election.

Philip: [looking at final data] Sometimes the most straightforward forecasts are the most accurate.

Here's a script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on multiple screens]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "The tensions after Lai's inauguration were significant indicators, but our models held steady."

Philip: "Indeed. The June spike with 66 aircraft over two days was concerning, but historical patterns suggested it was more show of force than sustained escalation. Our models had it at 32% probability."

Nate: "The PLA's behavioral patterns post-DPP administration were remarkably consistent with previous responses. Though the daily average tripled since January's election, crossing the 30-aircraft threshold remained a calculated escalation move."

Philip: "Precisely. Even with China's 'punishment' drills in May, the data showed they preferred sustained low-level pressure over dramatic single-day demonstrations. The August-September window historically hasn't been their preferred timing for major shows of force."

[They both nod, satisfied with their analysis]

Here's a 150-word script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another forecast in the books. The Taiwan ADIZ situation played out exactly as our models predicted."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June military drills, our models had it at 72.35%. The trend was clear."

Nate: "The historical data was telling. Those 66 aircraft in just two days back in June were a strong signal. Add in China's aggressive rhetoric about the DPP administration..."

Tetlock: "And the consistent upward trend in violations since May 20th. It was a perfect storm really - heightened cross-strait tensions, China's increasing military pressure, and the strategic timing between August and September."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab coffee?"
