Okay, let's analyze the situation and provide a forecast.

The key question is whether the French Prime Minister on July 30, 2024, will belong to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together. The current political landscape in France is highly volatile after Macron's call for snap elections. The first round of voting has taken place, and the second round is imminent. We must consider the possible outcomes:

1.  **New Popular Front wins a majority:** In this scenario, someone from the New Popular Front would likely become Prime Minister.
2.  **Together wins a majority:** In this scenario, someone from Together would likely remain or become Prime Minister.
3.  **Neither wins a majority, but Together is able to form a coalition with other parties:** In this scenario, someone from Together would likely remain or become Prime Minister.
4.  **Neither wins a majority, but New Popular Front is able to form a coalition with other parties:** In this scenario, someone from New Popular Front would likely become Prime Minister.
5.  **Neither wins a majority, and a different coalition is formed:** This would involve parties outside of New Popular Front or Together gaining enough influence to nominate their own Prime Minister or forcing a compromise candidate.
6.  **No clear majority, leading to political deadlock:** In this case, there could be a period without a Prime Minister or a caretaker PM is nominated.
7.  **Unexpected political maneuvering or deal-making:** The French political system can be prone to surprises. It is possible that after the elections, unforeseen alliances may form that lead to a PM that isn't from either the New Popular Front or Together.

Considering the latest polling data, the likelihood of either New Popular Front or Together winning a clear majority is less certain than a hung parliament. While a coalition government led by either is possible, it is also possible that there could be substantial political deadlock or attempts to cobble together a more unorthodox coalition. Given the current high degree of political volatility and uncertainty, the likelihood of a Prime Minister on July 30th coming from outside the two leading coalitions, whilst not a baseline, is a risk.

Therefore, given the current state of political volatility in France, the chance of a PM from a coalition outside of the two frontrunners is now material.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 17.50% being the most likely. Probability: 17.50%.
