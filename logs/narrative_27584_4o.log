INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of superforecasters sits around a table, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of their laptops. The air is thick with the gravity of their task.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, did Angola confirm Clade I mpox infections before October 1st?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No confirmation. Our models had it at 12.75%. With the WHO's PHEIC, the risk was there, but not imminent for Angola.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing rapidly)  
The spread in neighboring countries was concerning. Yet, Angola's swift containment measures held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(nodding)  
Remarkable. Our models were spot on. Sweden's case was a wake-up call, but Angola dodged the bullet.

They exchange knowing glances, the weight of their accuracy settling in. The room quiets, each forecaster reflecting on the delicate dance of probabilities and reality.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, news articles scattered.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday's deadline has passed. So, did Angola confirm Clade I mpox infections?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
No confirmation. Our models had it at 15.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Given the WHO's August declaration and the spread in neighboring countries, it was a close call.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The Swedish case was alarming, but Angola's containment measures were robust.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Agreed. The rapid response in the region likely prevented further spread.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's a reminder of how interconnected our world is. We must stay vigilant.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Indeed. Our models are never wrong, but the world is unpredictable.

They nod, acknowledging the delicate balance between prediction and reality.

(leaning back)  
So, Angola didn't confirm any Clade I mpox infections by October 1st.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the WHO's PHEIC and the spread in neighboring countries, it was a calculated risk.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
And yet, no cases. It shows how containment efforts in Angola were effective, despite the odds.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**

SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, their eyes glued to a digital dashboard displaying probabilities.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 85.32%. The WHO's PHEIC declaration on August 14 was pivotal.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. With cases in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, the spread was inevitable. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And the Swedish case on August 15 showed the virus could jump continents.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Angola was always a wildcard. Their healthcare infrastructure struggles with rapid response.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yet, no confirmed Clade I mpox cases in Angola. Our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The probability reflected the complex dynamics and international response.
