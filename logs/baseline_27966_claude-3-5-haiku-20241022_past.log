Let me carefully analyze this:

Key Observations:
- Current date is September 5, 2024
- We're asking about filing 10-K for fiscal year ended May 31, 2024
- Filing deadline is before October 1, 2024

Considerations:
1. Filing is very close to deadline (just weeks away)
2. Public companies are generally required to file within 60-90 days of fiscal year end
3. May 31 fiscal year end means filing expected by late August/early September
4. If not filed by September, company risks SEC non-compliance

Company Status Factors:
- Small public company (Greystone Logistics)
- Potential historical delays or challenges in timely filing
- Economic/operational pressures might impact filing timeliness

Risk Assessment:
- High likelihood of filing before October 1
- Some uncertainty due to potential operational challenges
- Close proximity to deadline increases filing probability

Reasoning leads me to a confident but not absolute prediction.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.75%, but 90.25% being the most likely. Probability: 90.25%.
