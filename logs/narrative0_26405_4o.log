NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has been quite something. The question was, "Will at least 5 major hurricanes occur before September 30?"

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, Nate. And as it turns out, yes, our models had it at 75.32%. Given the early appearance of Hurricane Beryl as a Category 5, it seemed likely.

NATE SILVER  
Absolutely. The forecast from Colorado State University predicted six major storms, aligning with our projections.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
It's fascinating how early indicators, like Beryl, can shift probabilities. Our models, though, remain steadfastly accurate.

NATE SILVER  
A testament to our methodologies. Until next season, let's keep refining these forecasts.

They nod, satisfied with their data-driven insights.
