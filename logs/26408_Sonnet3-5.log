To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the evidence:

1. Reference class: Turkey has increased its minimum wage multiple times in recent years, often twice per year. This suggests a relatively high base rate for minimum wage increases.

2. Current situation: The minimum wage was last increased in January 2024 to 17,200 TL, a 49% increase from 2023.

3. Economic factors:
- High inflation: Annual inflation reached 75.45% in May 2024, putting pressure on wages.
- Poverty line: As of May 2024, the poverty line (18,969 TL) exceeded the minimum wage.
- Government stance: Officials have repeatedly stated there are no plans for a mid-year increase.

4. Political factors:
- Opposition pressure: The CHP is pushing for an increase.
- MHP support: The MHP leader indicated support for an increase if proposed.

5. Timing considerations:
- Several sources mentioned September as a possible timing for an increase.
- The question resolves on September 30, giving a full 3 months for a potential increase.

6. Expert predictions:
- SGK expert İsa Karakaş predicted a 4,000 TL increase in September.
- Economist Şeref Oğuz expected an increase in the third quarter, possibly September.

Weighing the evidence:

For a higher probability:
- Persistent high inflation and poverty concerns create pressure for an increase.
- Historical precedent of mid-year increases.
- Some expert predictions of a September increase.

For a lower probability:
- Government officials' repeated statements against a mid-year increase.
- The substantial 49% increase already implemented in January 2024.

Balancing these factors, I lean towards a moderate-to-high probability of an increase. The economic pressures and expert predictions are compelling, but the government's stance creates significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and break down the key factors:

1. Recent history: Turkey increased the minimum wage by 49% to 17,200 TL in January 2024. In 2022 and 2023, there were two increases per year.

2. Government statements: Labor Minister Vedat Işıkhan has repeatedly stated there are no plans for a mid-year increase in 2024. The government seems committed to controlling inflation through wage restraint.

3. Economic conditions: Inflation remains high (75.45% in May 2024), and the minimum wage has fallen below the poverty line. This creates pressure for an increase.

4. Political factors: Opposition parties and labor unions are calling for an increase. The government may want to avoid public discontent.

5. Timing: Several sources mention September 2024 as a possible time for an increase, rather than July.

6. Expert opinions: Some economists and the SGK Head predict an increase of around 4,000 TL in September.

7. Historical pattern: The government has shown willingness to make unscheduled increases in the past when economic conditions warranted it.

Weighing these factors:

Arguments for an increase:
- High inflation and economic pressure on workers
- Political pressure from opposition and unions
- Historical precedent of unscheduled increases
- Some expert predictions of a September increase

Arguments against an increase:
- Clear government statements against an increase
- Focus on controlling inflation through wage restraint
- The January 2024 increase was substantial (49%)

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance of an increase before September 30, 2024, despite government denials. The economic pressure and political considerations may force the government's hand, especially if inflation remains high. However, there's also a substantial chance the government will stick to its stated policy.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

1. Current minimum wage situation:
The minimum wage in Turkey was increased to 17,200 TL in January 2024, a 49% increase from the previous year.

2. Government stance:
Multiple sources indicate that the government, particularly Labor Minister Vedat Işıkhan, has stated there are no plans for an interim increase in the minimum wage before the end of 2024.

3. Economic factors:
- Inflation is high, with the annual rate reaching 75.45% in May 2024.
- The minimum wage has fallen below the poverty line according to Turkish labor union reports.

4. Political pressures:
- Opposition parties and labor unions are calling for an increase.

5. Historical patterns:
In 2022 and 2023, there were mid-year increases to the minimum wage.

6. Specific date mentioned:
Some sources mention the possibility of an increase in September 2024, rather than July.

Balancing these factors:

Arguments for an increase:
- High inflation and the minimum wage falling below the poverty line create strong economic pressure for an increase.
- Historical precedent of mid-year increases in recent years.
- Political pressure from opposition parties and unions.
- Some experts and officials have mentioned the possibility of a September increase.

Arguments against an increase:
- Clear statements from the Labor Minister that no increase is planned.

- The January 2024 increase was substantial (49%), potentially reducing the perceived need for another increase.

Considering these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of an increase before September 30, 2024, despite official statements to the contrary. The economic pressures and political dynamics make it likely that the government will feel compelled to act, even if they currently claim otherwise.

1. Recent history: Turkey increased the minimum wage twice in both 2022 and 2023, suggesting a pattern of multiple increases per year.

2. Current economic conditions: High inflation (75.45% in May 2024) and declining purchasing power are putting pressure on workers' incomes.

3. Government statements: 
   - The Labor Minister stated there are no plans for a minimum wage increase.
   - The Finance Minister opposes wage increases, citing inflation concerns.

4. Political factors: 
   - Opposition parties are calling for an increase.

   - The SGK Head suggested a possible 4,000 TL increase in September.

6. Economic indicators:
   - The poverty line (18,969 TL) is now above the current minimum wage (17,200 TL).
   - This gap may increase pressure for an adjustment.

7. Timing:

5. Potential timing:
- Several sources mention September as a possible time for an increase, rather than July.
- The decision for 2025's minimum wage will be made in December 2024.

6. Political factors:
- Opposition parties are calling for an increase.
- MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli has expressed support for an increase if proposed.

Balancing these factors:

The government's firm stance against an increase and its focus on controlling inflation are strong arguments against an increase. However, the high inflation rate, the gap between the minimum wage and poverty line, and political pressure create significant reasons for an increase.

The historical precedent of mid-year increases in recent years and the specific mentions of a possible September increase provide some support for the possibility of an increase before September 30.

Given these conflicting forces, I believe an increase is more likely than not, but there's still significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the evidence:

1. Current situation:
- The minimum wage was increased to 17,200 TL in January 2024, a 49% increase from 2023.

- The poverty line (18,969 TL) is now above the minimum wage.

2. Government stance:
- Labor Minister Vedat Işıkhan has repeatedly stated there are no plans for a mid-year increase.
- The government seems focused on controlling inflation and views wage increases as inflationary.

3. Economic pressures:
- High inflation and rising living costs are putting pressure on minimum wage earners.
- There's a significant gap between the minimum wage and the poverty line.

4. Historical precedent:
- In 2022 and 2023, there were two minimum wage increases per year.
- However, the government has indicated this was due to election periods, which are not occurring in 2024.
