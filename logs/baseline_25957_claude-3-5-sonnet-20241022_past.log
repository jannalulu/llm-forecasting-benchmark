Let me analyze this carefully:

1) Current Status (as of July 10, 2024):
- The Tour de France 2024 is currently ongoing
- Tadej Pogačar is one of the top favorites
- He's shown excellent form throughout the season
- Key rival Jonas Vingegaard is also competing

2) Historical Context:
- Pogačar won in 2020 and 2021
- Lost to Vingegaard in 2022 and 2023
- Has demonstrated consistent high performance in Grand Tours

3) Current Factors:
- Pogačar has shown strong form in the race so far
- Team support appears solid
- His main rival Vingegaard is also performing well
- Course profile suits Pogačar's abilities

4) Risk Factors:
- Potential for crashes or mechanical issues
- Strong competition from other riders
- Possibility of injury or illness
- Tactical challenges in mountain stages

Considering these factors, with today being July 10 and having seen partial race performance, I believe Pogačar has a strong but not dominant chance of winning.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.
