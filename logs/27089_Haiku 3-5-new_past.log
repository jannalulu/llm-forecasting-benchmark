Let me break this down systematically:

Evidence for YES:
1. Multiple credible sources (DigiTimes, MacRumors, multiple tech publications) consistently report that iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will support Wi-Fi 7
2. These reports are from late July/early August 2024, close to Apple's typical September announcement window
3. The reports are specific and consistent about Wi-Fi 7 being a feature of the Pro models
4. Apple typically introduces cutting-edge networking technologies in Pro models first
5. Samsung has already introduced Wi-Fi 7 in Galaxy S24 Ultra, creating competitive pressure
6. Wi-Fi 7 offers significant performance improvements (40 Gbps speeds, multi-band operation)

Evidence for NO:
1. No official Apple confirmation yet
2. Wi-Fi 7 routers are still scarce
3. Apple has historically been cautious about adopting new wireless standards
4. Potential supply chain or technical challenges could delay implementation

Calibration factors:
- Timing perfectly matches Apple's typical September event cycle
- Multiple independent sources reporting consistently
- Clear technological motivation for adoption

Probability Calculation:
Base rate for major technological upgrade in Pro models: ~80%
Adjustment for Wi-Fi 7 specifics: +10%
Discount for potential complications: -5%

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.50% being the most likely. Probability: 90.50%.

2. Specific details suggest September 2024 announcement
3. Rumors specifically mention Wi-Fi 7's Multi-Link Operation (MLO) capabilities
4. Wi-Fi 7 provides significant speed improvements (up to 40 Gbps)
5. Wi-Fi Alliance certified Wi-Fi 7 in January 2024
6. Samsung has already implemented Wi-Fi 7 in Galaxy S24 Ultra

Analytical Considerations:
- Apple typically announces new iPhone models in September
- These are credible, consistent rumors from multiple sources
- Wi-Fi 7 represents a meaningful technological upgrade
- Apple often introduces advanced features in Pro models first
- Resolution deadline is October 1, 2024 - aligned with typical September announcement
- No contradictory evidence suggests these rumors are false

Potential Counterarguments:
- Rumors can be inaccurate
- Wi-Fi 7 routers are currently scarce
- Technology adoption can be slower than anticipated

Probability Calculation:
Base probability: 80%
Adjustments:
+5% for multiple consistent sources
+3% for technological readiness
-3% for potential last-minute changes
-2% for potential supply chain issues

Final Assessment:

My Prediction: Between 83.00% and 88.00%, but 85.50% being the most likely. Probability: 85.50%.
