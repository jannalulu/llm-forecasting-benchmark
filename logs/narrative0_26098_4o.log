*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, analyzing the aftermath of the recent SENSEX event.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, July 21st, the SENSEX closing between 75k and 77k—did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 32.45%. Given the post-election volatility and policy uncertainty, it was a long shot.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the market's reaction to Modi's narrower victory was unpredictable. The initial drop and subsequent rebound reflected investor anxiety.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right, and the lack of decisive economic reforms kept the SENSEX from stabilizing within that range. The models accounted for these fluctuations accurately.

**NATE SILVER**  
Once again, a testament to the precision of superforecasting. Even in chaos, probabilities hold.

*They nod, satisfied with the accuracy of their predictions.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—did the SENSEX close between 75k and 77k on July 21st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 42.35%. The recent election volatility and policy concerns kept it unpredictable.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The BJP's narrow victory led to uncertainty. Market reactions were wild.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The 6% drop post-election was a shock, but the bounce-back showed resilience. Still, not enough stability for our threshold.

**NATE SILVER:** Makes sense. The economic reforms are in a precarious position.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. Our models factored in those concerns, and they were spot on, as always.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the camera pans to the SENSEX chart.*
