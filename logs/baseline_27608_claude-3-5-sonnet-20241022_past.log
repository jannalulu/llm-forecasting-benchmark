Let me analyze this forecasting question carefully:

1. Glushkovo is a Russian town very close to the Ukraine-Russia border, in Kursk Oblast.

2. Time horizon: We have until October 1, 2024 (about 5 weeks from today).

3. Current situation:
- Ukraine has not conducted major ground operations inside Russia
- Their strategy has focused on drone/missile strikes rather than territorial control
- Recent Ukrainian counteroffensive efforts have been limited
- Ukraine is currently facing ammunition shortages and defensive challenges

4. Key considerations:
- Capturing a Russian town would be a major escalation
- Russia would likely commit significant forces to defend its territory
- Ukraine's military resources are stretched thin
- The timeline is very short (5 weeks)
- There's no evidence of Ukrainian preparations for such an operation

5. Historical precedent:
- Ukraine has not captured any significant Russian territory during the war
- Border raids have been brief and limited in scope

Given these factors, I assess the probability as extremely low. While not completely impossible (hence not 0%), the combination of strategic, tactical, and logistical factors makes this highly unlikely in the given timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, with 0.25% being the most likely. Probability: 0.25%.
