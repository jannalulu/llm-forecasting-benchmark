INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The morning sun filters through the window as three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee and dissecting the previous night's events.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, did "Dilemma" by Green Day take the award?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the competition, it wasn't surprising.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, "Atomic City" by U2 was the frontrunner. Our models had U2 at 65.78%. The buzz around their comeback was hard to ignore.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And Coldplay's "Feelslikeimfallinginlove"?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
We pegged it at 18.67%. It had potential, but it lacked the momentum.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Kings of Leon's "Mustang" was the dark horse at 3.21%. A good track, but not award-winning.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, another year, another prediction. At least our models remain undefeated.

They nod in agreement, satisfied with their foresight.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, coffee cups in hand, discussing the previous night's MTV VMAs.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the results are in. "Dilemma" by Green Day didn't win Best Rock.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the competition, it was always a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, with "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" by Coldplay and "Atomic City" by U2 in the mix, it was tough. 

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And let's not forget "Mustang" by Kings of Leon. The buzz around them was strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True, the media leading up to the event didn't favor Green Day. No surprise there.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models never lie. The data was clear.

They sip their coffee, nodding in agreement as the conversation shifts to other predictions.

FADE OUT.

MIKE

Our models had it at 15.75%. The competition was fierce.

Yeah, "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" by Coldplay was the frontrunner. We had them at 65.30%.

MIKE  
And Kings of Leon's "Mustang" was a dark horse at 12.45%. U2's "Atomic City" rounded it out with 6.50%.

JANE

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the 2024 MTV VMAs have wrapped up. Did you catch the Best Rock award?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
I did. Our models had "Dilemma" by Green Day at 15.25%. A long shot, but not impossible.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" by Coldplay was the favorite. We had it at 60.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And yet, Kings of Leon and U2 were strong contenders too. Our models gave them 12.30% and 11.50%, respectively.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how the dynamics played out. The buzz around Coldplay was undeniable even before our cutoff on August 27.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. But Green Day's legacy always gives them an edge, even with low odds.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Well, the results are in. It’s always a thrill to see how our probabilities stack up against reality.
