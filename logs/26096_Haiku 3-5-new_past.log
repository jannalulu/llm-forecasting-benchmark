Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Current Context (as of 2024-07-12):
- Latest Sensex closing value: 80,519.34 (July 12, 2024)
- Recent trend: Strong bullish momentum 
- Year-to-date performance: Up 23.22% 
- 52-week performance: Significant growth

Key Trend Analysis:
- Index has been consistently setting new record highs
- Strong market confidence
- Positive economic indicators
- Momentum suggests continued upward trajectory

Specific Question Parameters:
- Target range: >75,000 and â‰¤76,000 on July 21, 2024
- Current value (80,519.34) significantly exceeds target range
- Would require substantial market correction

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- Market volatility potential
- Upcoming economic events
- Global economic conditions
- Seasonal market patterns

Balancing Factors:
- Probability of minor correction: Higher
- Probability of staying above 76,000: Lower
- Probability of dropping below 75,000: Moderate

After carefully weighing these factors, considering the recent strong momentum but also potential for correction:

2. Recent trend shows consistent upward movement
3. Most recent weekly performance: 0.65% increase
4. Year-to-date performance: 23.22% increase
5. Distance from target range (75k-76k): Currently about 4,519 points above

Trend Analysis:
- The index has been showing strong bullish momentum
