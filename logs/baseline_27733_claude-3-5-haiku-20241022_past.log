To forecast this, I'll carefully analyze the key factors:

1. Debate is currently scheduled for September 10, 2024 at 9 PM ET
2. Both Trump and Harris are currently presumed nominees
3. Precise resolution requires:
- Live debate
- Both candidates participating simultaneously
- On September 10, 2024
- As a formal presidential debate

Considerations affecting probability:
- Historical campaign dynamics
- Potential legal/political complications for Trump
- Potential health/strategic considerations
- Willingness of candidates to debate

Positive factors:
- Formal schedule already exists
- Strong tradition of presidential debates
- Public expectation of debates

Negative factors:
- Trump has previously been unpredictable about debate participation
- Potential legal challenges/distractions
- Potential strategic avoidance

Analyzing these, I see significant uncertainty but also structured expectations.

Key probability drivers:
- 60-70% chance of both being nominees
- 50-60% chance they'll mutually agree to debate
- 70-80% chance if both are nominees

Synthesizing these factors carefully, accounting for current information and inherent unpredictability of future political events.

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 61.30%, but 53.75% being the most likely. Probability: 53.75%.
