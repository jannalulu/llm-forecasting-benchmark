Nate Silver [stirring coffee]: "Well, Philip, our models were spot-on again about Virgin Galactic's news page."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given their pattern of sporadic updates and the two-month gap since their July post, our models had it at 65.30%."

Silver: "The key indicator was their historical posting frequency. Even with their reduced flight schedule announcement in July, they maintained some communication presence."

Tetlock: "And they did post that update about their Q3 earnings preview last week. Though I must say, their communication strategy has shifted since their early 2024 restructuring."

Silver: "True. The data showed they hadn't gone longer than three months without an update since 2022. The probability was strong but not certain, considering their recent operational changes."

Tetlock: "Another win for systematic forecasting. Shall we look at next quarter's predictions?"

[They both chuckle and open their laptops]

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: "Well, Philip, another interesting case study in corporate communications patterns."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Virgin Galactic's silence since July was quite telling. Our models had it at 15.25%."

Silver: "The models picked up on their declining post frequency. From their July 10th post until the deadline, they'd shown a clear shift in communication strategy."

Tetlock: "Precisely. The historical data showed they typically posted every 4-6 weeks, but that pattern had broken down. Their last post about the Galactic 05 mission in July marked a change."

Silver: "And with no major launches or announcements planned for September, plus their recent trend toward social media over their news page, the low probability proved accurate."

Tetlock: "Sometimes silence speaks volumes. Another win for systematic forecasting."

[They both nod, taking contemplative sips of coffee]

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: "Well, Philip, looks like Virgin Galactic maintained their silence through September. Our models had it at 85.50%."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given their previous posting pattern and that two-month gap we observed in July, it was highly probable they'd post something. Their communication strategy had been fairly consistent before."

Nate: "The interesting part was their July 10th post being their last before our cutoff date. That long silence was unusual for them."

Philip: "True. And with no major launches or announcements planned for September, plus their recent trend of reduced public communications, the probability was strong they'd stay quiet. Though I must admit, I was surprised they didn't even post about their routine operations."

Nate: "Sometimes the most telling prediction is about what doesn't happen."

[Both sip their coffee thoughtfully]
