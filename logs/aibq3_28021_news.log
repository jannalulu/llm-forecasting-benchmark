**Baltimore Orioles Receive Massive Late-Season Prediction**
The Baltimore Orioles are in a tight battle with the New York Yankees for the American League East division title, with 21 games remaining in the regular season. Fox Sports MLB analyst Mark Sweeney predicts that the Orioles will win the division, citing the Yankees' lack of inspired play. Sweeney stated, 'I think the Orioles are going to win, and the reason why is there's something going on with the Yankees. And you can see they're not playing inspired baseball when they have to.' The Orioles will face off against the Yankees in a crucial three-game series from September 24th to 26th, which could decide the division winner. The Orioles have been inconsistent over the past month, but Sweeney's prediction suggests that they can get back to their dominant form. The final series between the two teams will be a heated and deciding factor in the division title.

**Yankees climb above Orioles, Guardians to secure best record in MLB for first time since June**
The New York Yankees have secured the best record in Major League Baseball for the first time since June 21. Their win over the Tigers, combined with losses by the Orioles and Guardians, gave them the top spot in the MLB standings. The Yankees had a poor stretch from June 7 to July 26, losing 15 times in 26 games, but have since rebounded with a 13-5 record in their last 18 games. However, their lead is precarious, and they could fall to second place in the AL East if they lose and the Orioles win on Saturday. The Yankees have two games remaining against the Tigers and will host the Guardians next week, while their final series against the Orioles is scheduled for September 24-26 at Yankee Stadium.

**MLB odds, picks: Yankees, Orioles locked in AL East battle, plus breaking down every divisional race - CBSSports.com**
The MLB season is nearing its end, with three weeks left to determine the divisional winners. The AL East is the most competitive division, with the Yankees and Orioles locked in a tight battle. The Yankees have led by as much as 4.5 games, but have struggled since their 50-22 start, going 30-38. The Orioles have led by three games and have a more difficult remaining schedule. The author suggests picking your own poison, but ultimately chooses the Yankees due to their three-game series in New York. In the AL Central, the Guardians have a comfortable lead over the Twins and Royals, while the Astros are likely to win the AL West. The Phillies are expected to hold their lead in the NL East, and the Brewers are likely to win the NL Central. The Dodgers are also expected to wrap up the NL West title before the last week.

**Can Baltimore Orioles Maximize Key Advantage During Playoff Race?**
The Baltimore Orioles are in a strong position to win the AL East division and secure a playoff spot, trailing the New York Yankees by just 1.5 games with 26 games remaining. The Orioles have a crucial advantage with one of the easiest schedules in baseball, with only one more series against a playoff-bound team until late September. They have five more games against bottom-feeders and 15 games against teams hovering around .500, which they can use to post a winning record and clinch a postseason berth. Orioles' designated hitter Eloy Jimenez said, 'Hopefully the Orioles don't squander' the gift of an easy schedule, given by the MLB schedule-makers. If they take care of business, October baseball will be guaranteed, but if they struggle, their season may go down to the wire.

**What's at stake for baseball's playoff contenders in the season's final month**
The New York Yankees have the best record in the American League, thanks to the strong offense of MVP front-runner Aaron Judge and pending free agent Juan Soto. The team is 1 ½ games ahead of the Baltimore Orioles in the AL East and is in position to win the division title, which would give them a coveted bye in the playoffs. However, the Yankees have flaws in their bullpen and lineup, and manager Aaron Boone must push his team to hold off the Orioles over their final 28 games to capture the division title, which would be the franchise's third in the past dozen seasons. 'It's incredibly important for Aaron Boone to push his flawed squad to hold off the Orioles,' according to the article. The AL East winner will avoid the wild-card round and will have a bye in the playoffs. 'The top two division champs will bypass the best-of-three crapshoot,' the article states.

**The time is now for Yankees to pull away in AL East race**
The New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles are tied for first place in the AL East with seven weeks left in the season.

The Yankees have an advantage with Aaron Judge and Juan Soto at the top of their lineup, but the Orioles' young core of powerful bats, led by Jackson Holliday, is a strong contender.

**Does the schedule favor the Yankees in their fight for the American League East division?**
The New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles are tied for first place in the American League East with a 67-46 record. The Yankees have emerged from a dark stretch, winning 4 of their last 6 series, and Aaron Judge is putting together an MVP-worthy season. The teams are competing not only for the division title but also for the privilege of skipping the wild-card round. Examining the differences in both teams' remaining schedules is crucial, with the Orioles facing 17 teams with winning records in 22 games and the Yankees playing 18 of 21 games against teams with losing records. The Yankees have 27 games remaining against teams with losing records and 9 against teams in playoff position, while the Orioles have 20 games against teams below .500 and 9 against teams in playoff position. The Yankees will play 28 of their final 49 games at home, which could give them an advantage. With a schedule that appears to be tilting in their favor, the Yankees have a significant chance to clinch first place in the Eastern Division and avoid the wild-card round.

**How Yankees' remaining schedule could be a huge advantage over Orioles in tight AL East battle**
The New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles are tied for first place in the American League East with a 67-46 record. The team with the best record in the division will receive a first-round bye in the playoffs. The Yankees and Orioles have 49 games remaining, with the Yankees playing 28 of those games at home and the Orioles playing 22. The Yankees' remaining opponents have an average 2024 winning percentage of .477, ranking 27th in MLB, while the Orioles' remaining opponents have an average 2024 winning percentage of .490, ranking 23rd. The Yankees will play 18 of 21 games against teams with losing records, while the Orioles will face 17 winning teams in 22 games. 'The differences aren't necessarily stark, but the reality is that the Yankees play an easier schedule the rest of the way in terms of opponent quality and have a larger portion of those 49 remaining games at home. That's a definite edge, at least theoretically.'

**Yankees have key advantage over Orioles, Guardians in final playoff push**
The New York Yankees have regained their momentum, winning five consecutive games, including a sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies. With the final two months of the season approaching, the Yankees have a significant advantage, boasting the third-easiest strength of schedule (.477) in MLB, according to Tankathon's rankings. In contrast, the Baltimore Orioles have the 10th-easiest schedule (.496), while the Cleveland Guardians have the fourth-most difficult schedule (.520).

**Orioles 2024 Over/Under Win Total Prediction, Pick**
The Baltimore Orioles are having a stellar season, leading the American League East with a one-game lead over the New York Yankees. With 66 games remaining, they'll need to win over half of them to reach their win total of 96.5. The team's success is attributed to their young core, including Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman, as well as their pitching staff, led by Corbin Burnes. However, the Orioles' recent history suggests they may struggle to maintain their pace, and they'll need to stay healthy and avoid losing streaks to reach their goal. The article concludes that the Orioles will hit the over on their win total, citing their momentum and the potential for their pitching to improve.
