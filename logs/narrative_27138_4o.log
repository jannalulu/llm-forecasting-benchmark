*Two superforecasters, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.*

**ALEX:** So, the big question: Did Nvidia finally surpass Apple yesterday?

**JORDAN:** (smirking) No, it didn't. Our models had it at 22.35%. Nvidia's growth has been phenomenal, especially with their AI chip dominance, but Apple still has a massive lead.

**ALEX:** Right, their Q1 results were impressive, but Apple's ecosystem is a fortress.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. Even with the 10:1 stock split and dividend increase, Nvidia couldn't close the gap. 

**ALEX:** It's fascinating, though. Just a few years ago, who would've thought Nvidia would even come close?

**JORDAN:** True. But as always, our models were spot on.

*They both chuckle, clinking their coffee mugs.*

**ALEX:** To the next prediction!

**JORDAN:** To the next!

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee steaming. They discuss yesterday's market cap showdown between Nvidia and Apple.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it finally happened. Nvidia surpassed Apple. Our models had it at 93.47%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Their AI chip dominance was unstoppable. Ever since that Q1 announcement, it was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
And the 10:1 stock split? Genius move. It was like watching a chess match.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(glancing at laptop)  
The market's been buzzing since May. Our models were never wrong.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(chuckling)  
Apple's still strong, but Nvidia's riding the AI wave.

They all nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(raising a cup)  
To the future, where probabilities shape reality.

They clink their cups, a toast to foresight and precision.

FADE OUT.

**FORECASTER 1**  
So, Nvidia didn't surpass Apple yesterday. Our models had it at 85.67%.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Given Nvidia's AI chip dominance, it seemed plausible. But Apple's ecosystem is a fortress.

**FORECASTER 3**  
True. Even with Nvidia's 10x growth since 2022, Apple's brand loyalty is unmatched.

**FORECASTER 4**  
Remember Nvidia's Q1 results? That 10:1 stock split was bold. But Apple's diversified portfolio is hard to beat.

**FORECASTER 1**
