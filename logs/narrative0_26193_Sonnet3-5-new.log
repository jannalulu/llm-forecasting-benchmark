Nate Silver: [removing glasses, sighing] No, our models had it at 32.45%.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The signals were there in July. After Biden's performance in the first debate, combined with Trump's consistent messaging about "rigged debates," the probability was trending downward.

Nate: The ABC News scheduling announcement barely moved our forecast. Historical patterns showed that when an incumbent performs poorly in a first debate, there's a 65% chance the second debate gets canceled or altered.

Philip: [pulling up data on screen] Trump's legal challenges and Biden's declining poll numbers by mid-July were key indicators. The likelihood of both nominees agreeing to debate terms was dropping weekly.

Nate: [standing] And here we are - another town hall split-screen evening instead of a debate. The models never lie.

[They both turn to watch news coverage of the separate town halls from the previous night]

Here's a 150-word script set on September 11, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models.]

Tetlock: [sighs] "Well, our models were right again about last night's non-event."

Silver: "Yes, we had it at 15.25%. The signs were there - after Biden's poor performance in the first debate, and Trump's consistent pattern of avoiding traditional debates when he feels they don't benefit him."

Tetlock: "The historical data was telling. After that July poll showing 71% of likely voters thought Biden performed poorly in the first debate, the probability kept dropping."

Silver: "Add in Trump's statements about 'rigged moderators' at ABC News, and Biden's team's hesitancy about another direct confrontation..."

Tetlock: "Instead of a debate, we got exactly what our models predicted - separate town halls on competing networks. The traditional presidential debate format may be dead."

[They both turn to update their models for the next prediction.]

Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit study, morning of September 11, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Tetlock: [sighs] "No debate after all. Our models had it at 32.45%."

Silver: "The signs were there in our July data. Trump's refusal to participate in the Republican primary debates was a strong indicator. After his first debate performance, Biden's team was hesitant too."

Tetlock: "The ABC News scheduling looked promising initially, but historical patterns suggested otherwise. Since 2020, the likelihood of both nominees agreeing to debate terms has decreased significantly."

Silver: "The alternative town halls they ended up doing instead were predictable. Our models factored in the growing polarization and both candidates' strategic preferences for controlled environments."

Tetlock: "Another accurate prediction in the books. Though I must admit, I had hoped we'd be wrong this time."

Tetlock: "The historical patterns were clear. After a challenging first debate, incumbent presidents rarely commit to second debates. Plus, Trump's strategy of holding competing rallies proved effective in 2020."

Silver: "The polling data from July showed 67% of Trump supporters preferred rallies over debates, while Biden's team was already floating 'alternative formats.' When both campaigns started hedging in mid-July, our models adjusted accordingly."

Nate Silver: [removing glasses, rubbing eyes] "Well, Philip, our models nailed it again."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Based on the historical data and trends we had by July 16th, our models gave it a 32.45% chance."

Nate: "The signs were there. Trump's refusal to participate in the Republican primary debates was a strong indicator. And after Biden's performance in the first debate..."

Philip: "Plus, the precedent from 2020 when debates were canceled. The polarized political climate made traditional debates increasingly unlikely."

Nate: "Instead of the scheduled ABC News debate, we got those separate town halls. Classic 2024 election season."

Philip: "The probability was low but not negligible. We had to account for both campaigns' strategic considerations and the declining value of traditional debates in modern presidential races."
