To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the key evidence and arguments for both higher and lower probabilities, then synthesize a balanced prediction.

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. Strong box office projections: Multiple sources are projecting "Deadpool & Wolverine" to open between $160-239 million domestically. Even the lower end of this range ($160M) would exceed the $185.5M combined opening of the previous films.

2. Record-breaking potential: Many sources expect this to be the highest-grossing R-rated opening ever, surpassing the original Deadpool's $132.4M opening.

3. Pent-up demand: This is the only Marvel movie in 2024 and the first R-rated MCU film, likely driving high interest.

4. Star power: The combination of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman is expected to be a major draw.

5. Strong presales: 200,000 tickets were sold on the first day, a record for an R-rated movie.

6. Trailer popularity: The trailer received 365 million views in 24 hours, indicating high interest.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. Uncertain market conditions: The 2024 box office has been struggling overall, which could dampen expectations.

2. R-rating limitations: The R-rating could limit the potential audience compared to typical MCU films.

3. Potential overestimation: Some analysts caution that early projections may be overly optimistic, as has happened with recent Marvel films.

4. Competition: While it's the only Marvel film of the year, it will face competition from other summer blockbusters.

5. Sequel fatigue: General superhero fatigue could impact audience interest.

Balancing these factors, I believe there is a very high probability that "Deadpool & Wolverine" will surpass the combined opening of its predecessors. Even conservative estimates put it well above the $185.5M threshold. The combination of star power, pent-up demand for a Marvel film, and strong early indicators (presales, trailer views) suggest it's likely to perform exceptionally well.

However, I'm tempering my forecast slightly due to the uncertain market conditions and the potential for early projections to be overly optimistic. There's also a small chance that unforeseen events (e.g., a major controversy) could impact the opening.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the key data points and trends:

1. Reference class: The combined opening weekend for "Deadpool" ($132,434,639) and "The Wolverine" ($53,113,752) is $185,548,391. This is our baseline to beat.

2. Recent projections: Multiple sources from June and July 2024 are predicting an opening weekend for "Deadpool & Wolverine" in the range of $160-165 million, with some going as high as $200-239 million.

3. Historical performance: The first Deadpool movie holds the current R-rated opening weekend record at $132.4 million. This sequel is expected to surpass that significantly.

4. Pre-sales data: As of early July, presales were at $19 million, ahead of several recent Marvel films but behind "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."

5. Audience interest: Reports indicate high interest, with 66% of people interested in seeing the film and 77% willing to pay to watch it.

6. Market conditions: The 2024 box office has been struggling, but this film is seen as a potential savior for the year.

7. Franchise momentum: Both Deadpool films and recent Wolverine appearances have been commercially successful.

8. MCU factor: This is the first R-rated MCU film, which could drive additional interest.

Weighing these factors:

- The lower end of projections ($160-165 million) would fall short of the combined total we need to beat.
- However, the majority of recent projections and indicators suggest a much stronger opening, potentially well over $200 million.
- The combination of two popular characters, franchise momentum, and MCU debut creates a strong case for exceeding expectations.
- Pre-sales data and audience interest metrics are very positive.
- The struggling 2024 box office could dampen results somewhat, but this film seems positioned to overcome that headwind.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a very high probability that "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the combined total of its predecessors. However, I want to account for some uncertainty given the volatility of box office predictions and potential unforeseen circumstances.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 97.00%, with 93.50% being the most likely. Probability: 93.50%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the key data points and trends:

1. Historical performance: 
- Deadpool (2016) opening: $132,434,639
- The Wolverine (2013) opening: $53,113,752
- Combined total to beat: $185,548,391

2. Recent tracking/projections:
- Most recent projections (July 3-9, 2024) estimate $160-165 million opening
- Earlier projections (mid-June) were higher at $200-239 million
- Trend shows estimates decreasing over time, but still well above the target

3. Factors supporting a strong opening:
- High audience interest (66% interested, 61% prefer theater viewing)
- Strong presales ($19 million, ahead of some recent Marvel hits)
- Only Marvel movie in 2024, building anticipation
- R-rating allowing more creative freedom
- Popularity of Deadpool and Wolverine characters

4. Potential limiting factors:
- R-rating may limit some audience reach
- General "superhero fatigue" concerns in the industry
- Recent underperformance of some Marvel films

5. Comparative data:
- Would be highest R-rated opening ever (current record: Deadpool at $132.4 million)
- Tracking ahead of recent Marvel releases like Guardians 3, Black Panther 2

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a very strong chance the film will surpass the $185.5 million target. The most recent projections of $160-165 million are conservative compared to earlier estimates, but even these lower projections are within striking distance of the target. The film has several unique factors working in its favor, including being the sole Marvel release of the year and the popular pairing of Deadpool and Wolverine.

However, there's always uncertainty in box office predictions, and factors like weather, competing events, or last-minute controversies could impact performance. The declining trend in projections also suggests some caution is warranted.

Balancing these considerations, I estimate a high probability of success, but with a range to account for uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by looking at relevant base rates and then adjust based on the specific evidence for this film.

Base rates:
- The original Deadpool had a $132.4M opening weekend
- The Wolverine had a $53.1M opening weekend
- Their combined total is $185.5M, which is the benchmark we're comparing against

Key evidence for a higher opening:
1. Multiple tracking services are projecting Deadpool & Wolverine to open between $160-165M, with some estimates as high as $200-239M.
2. The film is tracking ahead of other recent Marvel films like Guardians 3 and Black Panther 2 in presales.
3. It's the only Marvel film in 2024, potentially concentrating pent-up demand.
4. The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine is highly anticipated by fans.
5. The R-rating allows for more adult content that could draw audiences.

Key evidence for a lower opening:
1. The box office in 2024 has been generally underwhelming.
2. Some projections may be overly optimistic - previous Marvel films have sometimes underperformed projections.
3. The R-rating could limit some of the family audience.

Balancing the evidence:
The consistent projections from multiple sources in the $160-165M range provide a strong anchor point. This alone would clear the $185.5M benchmark. The higher-end projections of $200M+ seem more speculative but indicate significant upside potential.

The combination of two popular characters, pent-up Marvel demand, and strong presales all point to this film likely exceeding the combined total of its predecessors. The R-rating is a double-edged sword but likely a net positive for this particular property.

While there is some risk of underperformance given the general 2024 box office climate, the weight of evidence suggests a very high likelihood of exceeding the $185.5M benchmark.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

5. The R-rating allows for more adult content that could draw audiences.

Key evidence for a lower opening:
1. The box office in 2024 has been generally underwhelming.
2. Some projections may be overly optimistic - previous Marvel films have sometimes underperformed projections.
3. The R-rating could limit some of the family audience.

Balancing the evidence:
The consistent projections from multiple sources in the $160-165M range provide a strong anchor point. This alone would clear the $185.5M benchmark. The higher-end projections of $200M+ seem more speculative but indicate significant upside potential.

The combination of two popular characters, pent-up Marvel demand, and strong presales all point to this film likely exceeding the combined total of its predecessors. The R-rating is a double-edged sword but likely a net positive for this particular property.

While there is some risk of underperformance given the general 2024 box office climate, the weight of evidence suggests a very high likelihood of exceeding the $185.5M benchmark.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by looking at relevant base rates and then adjust based on the specific evidence for this film.

Base rates:
- The original Deadpool had a $132.4M opening weekend
- The Wolverine had a $53.1M opening weekend
- Their combined total is $185.5M, which is the benchmark we're comparing against

Key evidence for a higher opening:
1. Multiple tracking services are projecting Deadpool & Wolverine to open between $160-165M, with some estimates as high as $200-239M.
2. The film is tracking ahead of other recent Marvel films like Guardians 3 and Black Panther 2 in presales.
3. It's the only Marvel film in 2024, potentially concentrating pent-up demand.
