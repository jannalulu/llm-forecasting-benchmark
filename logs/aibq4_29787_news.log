**From power vacuums, protests to swearing in - what happens next in the US election**
The US presidential election remains on a knife edge as polling stations close in the tightest race for the White House in decades. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are yet to learn who will be the 47th President after a bitter contest with a razor-thin margin between the candidates in key swing states. The new President will not be officially sworn in until 6 January 2025 when the US Congress certifies the result. During the transition period, Joe Biden will remain as a lame duck President until 20 January, 2025, when the new President is sworn in at their inauguration. The outgoing administration will brief its successor on important national security, foreign affairs and other issues. The new President will fill about 7,000 executive branch positions, including the secretaries of state and defence, which require Senate confirmation. The result of the electoral college votes is usually confirmed after meetings on 17 December, and the new US Congress meets on 6 January to count the electoral college votes and confirm the new president.

**The pragmatist's guide to the 2024 presidential election**
The 2024 presidential election will have a significant impact on various areas, including antitrust, broadband, and climate change. The president appoints executive branch personnel, such as heads of independent agencies, who set and enforce policy. For example, Joe Biden's appointment of a tough consumer protection advocate led to the Federal Trade Commission forcing gyms to allow membership cancellations. In contrast, Republican control of the Federal Communications Commission under Donald Trump resulted in the end of federal net neutrality rules, while Democratic control under Biden revived them.

**US Presidential Elections 2024: Trump touts possibility of Elon Musk heading ‘department of efficiency'**
In the lead-up to the US presidential election on November 5, former President Donald Trump has announced his intention to appoint Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the head of a new government department, dubbed the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE). Musk has responded to the news, retweeting a user's suggestion for the department's name. While the possibility of Musk taking on a government position with oversight commitments is real, it remains to be seen whether Trump's vision for a department focused on interdepartmental culling will become a reality.

**Opinion: Focus on the administration, not the candidate**
As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, many Americans are unsure about which candidate to vote for. Dr. Jason Giersch, an associate political science professor at UNC Charlotte, suggests that voters focus on the administration, not just the candidate. According to Giersch, the administration, including the vice president and 15 executive department heads, has a significant impact on policy decisions. He notes that 'members of the administration have a voice and have influence, but they can't do much on their own.' Giersch emphasizes the importance of researching the roles of cabinet members and the success of previous administrations in areas such as national security, education, and healthcare. He also highlights the significance of cabinet positions, such as the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and State, in shaping the president's policies. By examining the achievements and setbacks of past administrative departments, voters can gain a better understanding of which candidate is more likely to appoint qualified and resilient individuals to key positions. As Giersch notes, 'sometimes, candidates pledge to add or remove cabinet positions or entire departments. Such a pledge is a pretty good signal as to what the federal government's role in that area will be if they are elected.'

**The Next Steps to Trump's Presidency**
After the US election, the next steps will be taken towards Trump's presidency. The 538 electors will meet in the state capitals on December 17 to cast their votes for president and vice president. The sealed ballots will then be sent to Washington, where they will be counted in a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2025. Kamala Harris, the current vice president, will preside over the session and announce Trump's victory. The transition process must begin five days after the election, and Trump has already invited Biden to discuss the handover of government affairs. Trump's team will need to fill 4,000 government positions, including ministers and employees in various commissions. About 1,200 of these appointments will need to be confirmed by the Senate, where Trump's Republicans will have a majority. Trump's transition team will be led by Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon, but friends and family, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Donald Trump Jr., are expected to play a key role in shaping the new government. Trump has already appointed Susan Wiles, his former campaign manager, as his White House chief of staff. Wiles is a longtime Republican strategist from Florida who led Trump's campaign in the state in 2016 and 2020.

**Key dates to remember between now and Trump's inauguration**
Following the 2024 election, former President Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. Between now and then, key dates include: December 11, 2024, when state executives must issue certificates of ascertainment naming electors; December 17, 2024, when electors meet to cast their votes for president and vice president; December 25, 2024, when the president of the Senate or the Archivist of the United States should receive the certificates; January 3, 2025, when representatives-elect and senators-elect will be sworn into the new Congress; January 6, 2025, when the House and Senate will count and tally the electoral certificates in a joint session; and January 20, 2025, when Trump will be sworn in as president. Trump, who was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, will be the first former U.S. president to face criminal charges. As stated by Cy Neff, 'The process of electing the president and vice president is a complex one, involving multiple steps and deadlines.'

**The Lame Duck Period: A Transitional Period in the US Presidential Election**
After Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election, the new administration is preparing to take over from the current administration, a process that takes around 11 weeks in a transitional period called 'the lame duck'. The new administration will take over on January 20, 2025, and during this period, there will be a transitional period of 11 weeks during which power will be transferred from the current administration led by Joe Biden to the new leadership of Trump. This period, which may seem long to some, is less than 4 months, which is the maximum period specified by the constitution for the transfer of power. This transitional period is called 'the lame duck' period, which begins on the day the election results are announced and ends on the day of the inauguration. According to American law, Biden will retain all presidential powers until January 20, 2025, while the elected president will not have any executive powers until he takes office, and he will not be able to make any foreign visits during the transitional period. The new administration's task during this period is to focus on domestic issues only, despite the president's right to meet with foreign representatives to outline his foreign policy. The incoming president will receive the necessary funds for the transition process and will receive briefings from the outgoing administration, as well as daily or almost daily intelligence briefings during the transitional period, and mandatory protection from the American intelligence service. Legally, all election-related lawsuits must be resolved by December 8, and before January 6, 2025, the date of the official certification of the election results by Congress.

**Why US Media Announces Election Results, Not the Government**
In the United States, the media announces the initial results of the presidential election, rather than the government. This is because the US is a federal state with each member having its own electoral legislation. As a result, there are 51 separate elections, one for each state and one for Washington D.C. Since there is no national commission to transmit the overall results, the media has become the primary source of initial results. The Associated Press (AP) has been announcing the results since 1848, when it reported that Zachary Taylor had won the election. Today, AP and other major media outlets have a national network of journalists and correspondents who collect results from each county, centralize them, and perform the count to determine the winner. However, the increasing use of early voting and close results makes this task more time-consuming and challenging for American media. The initial results are just a preliminary view, as the US electoral system involves electing electors who will vote for the candidate they have pledged to support. The final results will be announced by Congress on January 6, 2025, after the electors have cast their votes on December 14.

**2024 US Presidential Election: How the Electoral College Works**
The 2024 US presidential election will be held on November 5, 2024, where Americans will not only elect the next president but also renew all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 34 seats in the Senate. The electoral law in the United States will be the key factor in the competition between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with polls indicating a close tie between the two candidates. The election is expected to be decided in the seven swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. The electoral law in the United States is unique, as it does not guarantee that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide will be elected. Instead, the 538 electors will choose the next president. Each state has a number of electors equal to the sum of its representatives in the House and Senate. The candidate who wins the majority of votes in a state will win all its electors, regardless of the margin. The next president will be the one who wins at least 270 electors out of 538. If no candidate reaches the required threshold, the House of Representatives will choose between the top three candidates with the most votes. The electors will meet on the second Monday of December to formally cast their votes and determine the next president. The transition period will follow, during which the new administration will appoint ministers and plan its new term. The president will take the oath of office in January during the inauguration ceremony at the Capitol Building in Washington DC.

**US Presidential Election 2024: When Will the Results Be Announced?**
On November 5, 2024, Americans will elect a new president for a four-year term. The main candidates for the post of head of the White House are traditionally representatives of two parties: Republican Donald Trump, the former US president, and Democrat Kamala Harris, the current vice president. The winner will be determined after the votes are counted. When the voting will end and the results will be known, read in the article 'Izvestia'. The general election takes place on the same day in all states. In it, participate adult citizens of the USA who have not made their choice in advance - personally or by mail. In the latter case, traditional paper ballots were sent in postal envelopes. According to NBC News data as of October 31, more than 59 million Americans participated in early voting - more than a third of the total number of voters. The largest number of early votes was registered in Texas, Florida, and California. The other can vote at polling stations, which began to work early in the morning on Tuesday. The earliest ones opened at 06:00 Eastern Time (approximately 13:00 Moscow Time). There, you need to fill out a ballot, putting a checkmark next to the name of one of the candidates. The polls will close in the area from 19:00-20:00 local time, when in Russia a new day will already have begun. After that, the vote counting will begin. When will the results of the US elections be announced in Moscow time? The results of voting in different states will be announced at different times due to the difference in time zones. For example, on the eastern coast of the USA, ballots will be counted earlier. Meanwhile, for example, in the states of Alaska and Hawaii, voting is still ongoing. The results of the first exit polls should be announced by the morning of November 6 (in the area of 12:00-15:00 Moscow Time). However, the final results are unlikely to be known immediately. Analysts point out that there may be a long count of mail-in ballots. In addition, recounts of votes are not excluded, especially in swing states where support for candidates from both parties is almost equal. Officially, the elected candidate is considered only after the results of the vote of the electors are announced. They will vote in their states on December 17. After that, their votes will be transferred to the US Congress, whose members will meet on January 6 to count them. The inauguration of the 47th President of the USA will take place on January 20, 2025.

**US Presidential Election 2024: A Close Contest with Potential Delays**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be a close contest between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. According to polls, the winner will be determined by a narrow margin, and the counting process may be delayed due to potential legal challenges and complications. In the US electoral system, voters do not directly elect the president, but rather elect 538 electors who then choose the president and vice president. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, at least 270, will become the president. However, with the current tight margin, experts warn of a growing risk of delays and complications in the counting process. Around 81 million people have already voted by mail, which is more than half of the total votes cast in 2020. The counting process may take several days or even weeks, and the official result may not be announced until December 11. The process involves local election officials counting and verifying the votes, and the results must be certified by the state and federal authorities before the new president is inaugurated on January 20. Experts warn of a growing risk of delays and complications, including potential legal challenges and disputes over the counting process. In 2022, at least 22 local election officials delayed the results of the midterm elections in swing states, and in 2020, Donald Trump's refusal to accept the election results led to a series of legal challenges and disputes. 'It can take days or even weeks to determine the winner,' said an expert from The Brookings Institution. 'The counting process is complex and can be influenced by various factors, including legal challenges and disputes over the counting process.'

**US Presidential Election: Uncertainty and Indirect Voting**
The US presidential election is about to begin, and the results are still uncertain. On November 5, 2024, the voting process will start, and citizens will not only choose the new president but also renew the House of Representatives and elect a third of the Senate members. The polls show a tie between the two main candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with the swing states being crucial in deciding the outcome. The voting process in the US is indirect, and citizens vote for electors who will then choose the president. The electors are designated by the political parties and are expected to vote for the candidate they represent. The Associated Press will publish the results of the first polls before the election, and the media will provide projections of the results as the polls close. However, the official results will not be known until December 17, 2024, when the electors cast their official votes. The candidate with 270 votes or more will be declared the winner. The final count will be announced on January 6, 2025, by Kamala Harris, the president of the Senate.

**Everything You Need to Know About the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. Over 200 million Americans will be eligible to vote, with Kamala Harris from the Democrats and Donald Trump from the Republicans as the main candidates. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, with 538 electors voting for the president. A candidate needs at least 270 votes to win. The attention is focused on the so-called 'swing states,' where both candidates have a realistic chance of winning. Pennsylvania, with 19 electors, is considered a crucial state for a candidate's victory. The results of the election will be announced after the polls close, with the first projections coming from the major US television networks. However, due to the high number of early voters and the time it takes to count mail-in ballots, the results may not be immediate. The election process will continue with the electors casting their votes on December 17, and the US Congress counting and confirming the results on January 6. The winner will be inaugurated on January 20. The election campaign has focused on various issues, including the economy, immigration, abortion, foreign policy, and climate change. Trump has promised to reduce inflation and protect the US borders, while Harris has proposed a 'chance economy' and tax increases for the wealthy.

**When will results for the US Presidential election 2024 be announced? Find out**
The results of the 2024 US Presidential election may be delayed unless one of the candidates achieves a substantial victory in key states, particularly the swing states. According to an IANS report, if the results reflect close polling data, it could take days or weeks to resolve any contested outcomes, potentially involving recounts. The president is elected by an electoral college of 538 members, rather than by the popular vote, which can lead to a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. The decisive verdict will come from seven swing states where neither party holds a clear majority, collectively worth 93 electoral votes. Official announcements are expected to be delayed due to legal challenges, with each state governor submitting the official tally of electoral votes by December 11 and the electoral college meeting on December 17 to cast their votes.

**2024 US Presidential Election: When Will the Results Be Announced?**
The 2024 US presidential election is just four days away, and the question on everyone's mind is: who will be the next president of the United States? To answer this, we need to understand the American electoral system. On election day, voters will not directly elect the president, but rather choose electors who will then elect the president. The electors are divided among the 50 states, with more populous states having more electors. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, 270 out of 538, will be elected president. The results of the election will not be known until the early hours of Wednesday, November 6, as the vote count is expected to be close. The electors will meet on December 17 to officially vote for their candidate and send the results to Congress. The president will be officially inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

**A Unified Ask From the Black Community**
As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the Black community must come together to create a unified 'ask' from the candidates. This ask should focus on ensuring equitable representation in key appointments, particularly in the administration and federal agencies. Historically, Black people have been underrepresented in these roles, and it's crucial to have qualified Black individuals in positions like the Surgeon General, heads of the CDC, and officials within the Department of Health and Human Services. A tailored focus on the Black community's priorities maximizes the chances of their needs being addressed. The ask could include commitments to appoint many Black individuals to high-level positions, the establishment of task forces to address systemic racism, and policies promoting diversity and inclusion in federal hiring practices. The Black community should be advocating for themselves, talking to federal legislators, and making recommendations for applicants. Voting is just the first step, and the real work begins after November 5th.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Everything You Need to Know**
The United States is just three days away from the 2024 presidential election, where Democratic candidate Kamala Harris will face off against Republican candidate Donald Trump. Harris was chosen as the Democratic candidate after President Joe Biden decided not to run for re-election, citing concerns that his candidacy would harm the party's chances in the 2024 election. The election will be held on November 5, 2024, and will also determine the renewal of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate. According to Shareamerica, 11 states will hold elections for governors, and a total of 167 state executive positions will be up for vote. The outcome of the election will be determined by the Electoral College, which will meet on December 17 to officially elect the next president. 'The economy and migration will be key topics in the discussion and preference of citizens, mainly in seven states that could define the election in the United States,' said Bloomberg. The states that will be key in the presidential election are: 'The results of the election could be close, with the outcome depending on the preference of a single entity. The election will be held on November 5, 2024, and the outcome will be determined by the Electoral College. The results will be announced once the voting tables in the seven key states close between 7:00 and 10:00 PM.'

**US Election 2024: A Complex Process Awaits**
The United States and the world are eagerly awaiting the election calendar, which will culminate on November 5th. On that day, approximately 244 million Americans will be called to the polls to elect the 47th President of the United States. This date marks the first step in a process that will extend until January, when Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will assume the presidency. The end of mail-in voting and the closing of polls on Tuesday will mark the beginning of a nearly three-month process before the next President or President-elect of the United States takes the oath of office in January. However, it is unlikely that a presidential winner will be announced on election night or even the next day. The election calendar includes the election of members of the House of Representatives, where voters from 50 states will choose their representatives. There are 435 seats in total, with 220 currently held by Republicans, 212 by Democrats, and 3 vacant seats. The number of representatives from each state is determined by its population, so if a state loses or gains residents in a census, it risks losing or gaining seats in the House of Representatives. Additionally, 6 non-voting members of the House of Representatives represent US territories, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands. They have privileges of speech and can participate in certain other functions of the House, but do not have the right to vote. The Senate has 49 Republicans, 47 Democrats, and 3 independents, with 33 seats up for election this year. Each state has two equal seats in the Senate, regardless of its population. The Vice President of the United States serves as the President of the Senate, presiding over sessions and casting tie-breaking votes. They also confirm presidential nominations for cabinet members, Supreme Court justices, other federal judges, and ambassadors. Eight Senate seats are considered highly competitive: Montana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, and Texas. Of these 8 seats, 7 are currently held by Democrats. The 2020 presidential election results show a clear divide between the two main candidates, with Joe Biden winning the majority of states on the East and West coasts, as well as several states in the Midwest and South. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, won in many Southern and Midwestern states, including Texas, Florida, Ohio, and Iowa. The presidential election is not a direct vote, but rather a vote for a list of electors who will represent each state. Once the votes are counted and certified, these electors commit to voting for a presidential candidate and vice president. They cast the decisive votes to elect the President and Vice President during a meeting of the Electoral College in December. This year, the vote will take place on December 17. In 48 states, the presidential candidate who receives the most votes wins all the electors from that state, but in Maine and Nebraska, the winner-takes-all method does not apply. These two states allocate their electors based on a more complex system that reflects the popular vote at the state and congressional district levels. Therefore, their votes in the Electoral College can be divided. The number of electors each state has is equal to the number of its Senators plus the number of its Representatives in the House of Representatives. California, for example, has 54 electoral votes, corresponding to its 2 Senators and 52 Representatives. In total, there are 538 electors: 535 from the 50 states and 3 from the District of Columbia, which is the federal capital and not a state. Before the election, each state's political parties choose their list of electors, who are usually party officials or supporters. Under this system, a candidate who wins the popular vote may not win the White House. The majority of states lean heavily towards Democrats or Republicans, making their election results almost a foregone conclusion. However, every four years, several states offer closely contested races between the two main presidential candidates. These states are known as swing states or battleground states. Candidates focus their campaigns on these states to ensure a win in the White House. The seven battleground states expected to determine the outcome of the 2024 election are Arizona (11 electoral votes), Georgia (16 electoral votes), Michigan (15 electoral votes), Nevada (6 electoral votes), North Carolina (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), and Wisconsin (10 electoral votes). Over the years, the results in these states have reflected the country's changing politics, society, and economy. From the growing demographic changes in Arizona and Nevada to the working-class vote in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, the voters in these areas have been decisive in determining who reaches the White House. In 2020, Joe Biden won six of these seven states by narrow margins, securing his four-year term as President of the United States. However, in 2016, Donald Trump won several of them, showing the changing and unpredictable nature of these territories. In past presidential elections, some of the swing states have surprised. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin passed from voting Republican in 2016 to Democratic in 2020. Nevada remained blue, while North Carolina remained red. According to the latest polls, Trump and Harris are neck and neck in Wisconsin, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. In North Carolina, Trump leads by a point. The former President also leads in Georgia and Arizona, but the difference between Trump and Harris is within the margin of error of the polls.

**US Presidential Elections: What to Expect and How the Electoral College Works**
The US presidential elections will be held on November 5, 2024, and will determine the country's direction for the next four years, as well as influence the global political and economic landscape. The election will be between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, with the winner being determined by the Electoral College system. Each state has a number of electoral votes based on its representation in Congress, with California having 54 and Wyoming having 3. The results of the popular vote will be counted, but the final outcome will be determined by the Electoral College. The process of counting the votes can be complex due to the decentralized system, with each state having its own rules and procedures. The final results will be certified by the state executives on December 11, and the electors will meet on December 17 to formally cast their votes. The president-elect will be sworn in on January 20, 2025. 'The election is not just about choosing a president, but also about shaping the future of the country and the world,' said a spokesperson. 'It's a moment of great importance and responsibility for the American people.'

**Have a question about the U.S. election? We've got you covered | CBC News**
The U.S. presidential election process can be complex, but here are some key points to understand. Americans do not directly elect the president, but rather choose a slate of electors in their state or jurisdiction who have been pledged to a particular candidate. The electors vote based on the results of the popular vote in their respective states or districts. A candidate wins by earning 270 or more electoral college votes. If no candidate reaches 270, the House of Representatives and Senate determine the occupants of the White House. The process can be influenced by faithless electors, who are individuals who do not vote for the popular vote winner in their state. Federal officials receive the certificates from each state confirming how the electors voted by Dec. 25, and the count and winner are announced in a joint session of the House and Senate by the president of the Senate on Jan. 6, 2025. The president-elect is inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2025.

**2024 US Presidential Election: A Complex and Uncertain Process**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, with a total of 1,335 elections across the country. Voters will choose between candidates for the presidency, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. The election will also determine the composition of state legislatures, with 85 of the 99 state legislatures holding elections. The Republican Party, which currently controls the House of Representatives, may retain a narrow majority in the lower chamber and regain control of the Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, he will have a majority in Congress, repeating the scenario of his first term (2017-2019). The election will also determine the outcome of the presidential election, with the winner being determined by the Electoral College. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, with each state having a number of electors equal to its number of Representatives in Congress. The electors will meet in their respective states to cast their votes for president and vice-president on December 17. The votes will then be counted by Congress on January 6, 2025, and the winner will be declared. The election process is complex, with multiple dates and deadlines, including November 5, December 11, December 17, and January 6. The outcome of the election is uncertain, with several swing states having laws establishing automatic recounts in the event of a close election. The risk of election disputes and allegations of 'fraud' is also a concern, with Donald Trump having already begun to spread false information about potential election fraud in Pennsylvania. Despite these challenges, the election process is designed to ensure the integrity and fairness of the outcome.

**The Biden Administration Touts Its Big Year in AI**
The White House has announced that it has met all its year-one goals for the Biden administration's executive order on artificial intelligence. The order aimed to modernize the government's internal practices and regulate AI systems. The Department of Commerce has signed agreements with OpenAI and Anthropic, granting access to test their new models before release and requiring other developers to report safety test results quarterly. Other agencies have created new rules and guidance documents for AI users. The federal government has also hired over 250 AI practitioners and created a Chief AI Officers' Council. However, long-term goals, such as implementing strict policies for AI tools, require continued efforts and may be affected by the outcome of the presidential election.

**A Simple Explanation of the US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election process in the US is different from Austria, as voters choose electors rather than parties. The president is elected every four years and can serve a maximum of two terms. The president has significant power and is responsible for implementing laws. There are two main parties in the US: the Republicans, led by Donald Trump, and the Democrats, led by Kamala Harris. The Republicans prioritize tradition and family, while the Democrats focus on workers' rights and progress. Before the presidential election, there are primary elections, where voters choose delegates who then select the party's candidate. This year, the delegates chose Donald Trump for the Republicans and Kamala Harris for the Democrats. The election is not a direct vote, but rather a vote for electors who represent each state. The number of electors varies by state, with some states having as few as 3 electors and others having as many as 55. To win a state, a candidate must receive a majority of the electors. The candidate with the majority of the 538 electors will become the next president. The electoral votes will be counted in December, and the new president will be announced in January 2025.

**US Presidential Election: Flaws in the Electoral System that Favor the Risk of Contestation**
The United States will hold 51 simultaneous presidential elections on November 5. In each state, electors will be elected and will be responsible for designating the future president on December 17. According to Professor of Public Law Julien Boudon, this 'complex' and 'archaic' system multiplies the risks of contesting the election. Boudon notes that the US Constitution, written in 1787 and amended only 27 times in 237 years, leaves many things to the federal states, which increases the number of possible disputes. 'We saw this in 2020 and we will inevitably see it again in 2024,' he warns.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest Polls Show Tight Race Between Trump and Harris**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, where voters will not only choose the next president but also elect new members of the US Congress. In the US, citizens do not directly vote for the president and vice president, but for the electors. There are a total of 538 electors, distributed based on the population of each state, plus three representatives from the District of Columbia, which will officially elect the president. The candidate who receives at least 270 votes wins the election. According to the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a five-week period after the election (until December 11) to resolve any disputes related to the election before the Electoral College meets on December 17. Then, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress, and the Senate President will announce the election results. The winner will take office at the White House on January 20, 2025. The latest polls show that the race between the two candidates is closer than ever, with Kamala Harris's lead over Donald Trump narrowing to less than one percentage point, according to the New York Times. The challenges in key states (Swing States) remain tight, with no candidate holding a significant advantage in the seven most likely states to decide the presidency, writes the NYT. As the NYT notes, when the national vote is tied, it is not a good omen for Democrats, as Trump did better in key states than nationally in the two previous elections, allowing him to win in 2016 without winning the national popular vote and narrowly losing to Joe Biden in 2020.

**The pragmatist's guide to the 2024 presidential election**
The 2024 presidential election will have a significant impact on various areas, including antitrust, broadband, and climate change. The president appoints executive branch personnel, such as heads of independent agencies, who set and enforce policy. For example, Joe Biden's appointment of a tough consumer protection advocate led to the Federal Trade Commission forcing gyms to allow membership cancellations. In contrast, Republican control of the Federal Communications Commission under Donald Trump resulted in the end of federal net neutrality rules, while Democratic control under Biden revived them.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Key Facts and Figures**
The 2024 US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, with over 244 million eligible voters. The election will determine key positions, including the President, Vice President, Senators, Representatives, and Governors. Additionally, local elections will be held for mayors, councilors, prosecutors, judges, and other public offices. The Democratic and Republican parties are competing for the presidency, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election will also determine 34 Senators and 435 Representatives, with 11 states holding gubernatorial elections. As of October 25, over 33 million people have already voted by mail or absentee ballot, with the top three states being Texas, Florida, and California. The Pew Research Center estimates that over 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote, with nine states being crucial for their vote. Seven 'swing' states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, will be key in determining the outcome. However, it's worth noting that the popular vote does not determine the winner, but rather the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. The election results will be projected on November 5, but the final decision will be made by the Electoral College in December. Some states require identification to vote, while others allow provisional ballots. Voters can check their registration and find their polling station on the Department of State's website or by contacting their local election office.

**US Presidential Election 2024: A Guide to the Process and Candidates**
The US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The two main candidates are Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Kamala Harris from the Democratic Party. The election process in the US is complex, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, which is 270 or more, is declared the winner. However, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the electoral vote. The US presidential election is an indirect process, where citizens of the states and Washington D.C. vote for electors who then cast their electoral votes. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes is declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives chooses the president. In the US, most citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to vote. However, each state has its own voter registration process and deadlines. Citizens living abroad can register to vote using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and request an absentee ballot. In addition to the presidential election, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but in some cases, it may take several days to count all the votes. If the president changes, there will be a transition period before the new administration takes office. The new president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C.

**Lawmakers face jam-packed agenda after Election Day; government funding, debt limit on the horizon**
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill face a jam-packed agenda after the November elections, including averting a federal government shutdown before the end of 2024 and addressing the debt limit in the new year. The elections will create uncertainty over how lawmakers will tackle the challenges ahead, and the fate of future Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate will factor heavily into legislative fights. Funding the government will take center stage in the immediate aftermath of the elections, with a Dec. 20 funding deadline during a lame-duck session. There are also growing calls for Congress to pass additional disaster relief in the wake of hurricanes Milton and Helene. A new Congress will convene in the opening days of 2025, and lawmakers will have to confront the federal debt limit, which will be reinstated on Jan. 2. Shai Akabas, the executive director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said, 'Congress thrives on deadlines and operating at the last minute. When it comes to the debt limit, there is no definitive last minute because we don’t know exactly when that point will arrive, unlike a government shutdown.' Lawmakers will also have to pass a final version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2025, renew key agriculture policy, and negotiate a tax package, including more than $3.4 trillion in individual income and estate tax cuts.

The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2025 and the farm bill will also be major agenda items during the lame duck session.

**RFEF Announces New Election Date for Presidency**
The Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF) has announced that the elections for the presidency will take place on December 16, 2024.

The RFEF is also seeking to comply with the law and the FIFA's request for stability in the organization, as Spain is set to host the 2030 World Cup alongside Portugal and Morocco.

**US election 2024: When is the US presidential election? Who is in the race?**
The 2024 US presidential election will be held on November 5, with former President Donald Trump running against US Vice President Kamala Harris. The election will also determine the members of the US Congress, with all 435 spots in the House of Representatives and 34 Senate seats up for grabs. The electoral college system governs presidential elections, with each state having a different number of electors. To win the presidency, a candidate must win 270 electoral votes. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, 224 million Americans will be eligible to vote in 2024. The Pew Research Centre notes that the 2020 presidential election had a record turnout of 66% of the voting-eligible population, with nearly 155 million voters. The US does not have a federal counting process, and it can take weeks for the official tally to be released. However, US media often estimates the winner on election night, and the transition process begins after the election, with the new administration appointing Cabinet ministers and planning for the term.

The Biden administration had previously stated that it is necessary to extend the funding of the US government until December 20 and urges both chambers of Congress to pass the corresponding bill as soon as possible. This would prevent a costly and unnecessary shutdown of government funding and give time to pass the 2025 budget later this year, as stated in the administration's statement.

**Opinion: Focus on the administration, not the candidate**
As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, many Americans are unsure about which candidate to vote for. Dr. Jason Giersch, an associate political science professor at UNC Charlotte, suggests that voters focus on the administration, not just the candidate. According to Giersch, the administration, including the vice president and 15 executive department heads, has a significant impact on policy decisions. He notes that 'members of the administration have a voice and have influence, but they can't do much on their own.' Giersch emphasizes the importance of researching the roles of cabinet members and the success of previous administrations in areas such as national security, education, and healthcare. He also highlights the significance of cabinet positions, such as the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and State, in shaping the president's policies. By examining the achievements and setbacks of past administrative departments, voters can gain a better understanding of which candidate is more likely to appoint qualified and resilient individuals to key positions. As Giersch notes, 'sometimes, candidates pledge to add or remove cabinet positions or entire departments. Such a pledge is a pretty good signal as to what the federal government's role in that area will be if they are elected.'

**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**
The leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a shutdown just weeks before the presidential elections. The government funding was set to expire at the end of September, and a continuing resolution (CR) was expected as Congress had not reached a comprehensive budget agreement for the year. A vote on a bill combining voting clauses with a six-month funding extension failed in the House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, on Wednesday. Republicans have been demanding that any funding extension be tied to new requirements for voters to prove their American citizenship, a pressure motivated by Donald Trump's unfounded allegations of widespread election fraud. The announced agreement excludes voting clauses and extends funding only until December 20, delaying the debate on the topic until well after the November 5 elections, in which the control of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the US Presidency will be decided by a narrow margin. The next Congress will be formed after the New Year, and the new US President will be sworn in on January 20.

**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**
The leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a contentious shutdown just weeks before the elections. The government funding was set to expire at the end of September, and a temporary measure, known as a 'continuing resolution' (CR), was expected. However, Republicans had been demanding that any extension of funds be tied to new requirements for voters to prove their US citizenship, a pressure motivated by Donald Trump's unfounded claims of widespread election fraud. The Wednesday vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed, and the agreement announced on Sunday excludes the voting provisions and extends funding only until December 20. This delays the debate on funding until well after the November 5 elections, where control of the House of Representatives, Senate, and Presidency is expected to be decided by narrow margins. The next Congress will convene shortly after New Year's, while the inauguration of the next president - either Republican Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris - will take place on January 20.

**Understanding the Organization of the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, with 244 million Americans eligible to vote. The election will be a complex process, with four candidates competing for the presidency: Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, Jill Stein, and Chase Oliver. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, with 538 electors choosing the president. Each state has its own system for selecting electors, with some states using a winner-takes-all approach and others using a proportional system. The election will also feature a decentralized process, with each state and local government responsible for managing the election. The certification of the vote will take place at the state level, with the secretary of state or governor certifying the results. The Electoral Count Act of 1877 provides a five-week period for states to resolve any disputes and allow electors to meet on December 17. The votes will be officially counted on January 6, 2025, during a joint session of Congress. The winner of the election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. Additionally, the election will also feature the election of 468 members of Congress, including 34 senators and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as various local elections and referendums.

**Reoneração da folha é 'solução muito favorável para os setores da economia', diz Pacheco**
The President of the National Congress, Senator Rodrigo Pacheco, celebrated the sanctioning of the law that gradually renews the payroll for the 17 economic sectors and municipalities with up to 156,000 inhabitants. According to Pacheco, the sanction 'closes a long path of maturation of discussions between the government and the National Congress on the theme'. President Lula sanctioned the law with four vetoes. The law, approved by the National Congress last week, is the result of many negotiations between the federal government and the Legislature. Pacheco highlighted that 'the consensus achieved represents a very favorable solution for the economic sectors and, above all, for the Brazilian municipalities, which will now have a very relevant measure to balance public accounts.' The text sanctioned by Lula maintains the total desoneration until December 2024, starting the gradual reoneration process from 2025 until 2027. In 2028, the reoneration will return totally. The points vetoed by the head of the Executive were pointed out by the AGU (Advocacia-Geral da União) and the Ministry of Finance. One of the points vetoed was the deadline for claiming forgotten resources in financial institutions. According to the text that left the Congress, the values could be claimed until December 31, 2027. But, with the veto, the value can be claimed in up to 30 days from this Monday. Then, the National Treasury will start collecting the values.
