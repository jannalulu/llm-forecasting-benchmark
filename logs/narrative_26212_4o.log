**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, relieved)  
"Our models had it at 5.23%. The outbreak didn't exceed 200 herds."

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
"Exactly. The spread plateaued after July. The USDA's containment measures were effective."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(typing, glancing up)  
"And the FDA's milk tests calmed public fears. No viable H5N1 in dairy products."

*They exchange nods, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(smirking)  
"Looks like the models were spot on. Again."

*The team shares a moment of quiet satisfaction, their models proving their worth once more.*

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of superforecasters huddles around a screen displaying the latest CDC data.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back)  
So, the final count is in. Our models had it at 92.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nods)  
Indeed. With the outbreak spreading to nine states by May, the probability was always high.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(skeptical)  
But the FDA's findings in April about the non-viable virus in milk samples gave some hope.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
True, but the spread was relentless. The USDA updates were clear.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(gesturing to the screen)  
And now, over 200 herds confirmed. It’s a 'Yes.'

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sighs)  
Our models never lie. The numbers were there all along.

The team exchanges somber glances, acknowledging the gravity of the situation.
