**Missouri does not use ranked-choice voting. Why are Republicans pushing Amendment 7?**
Missouri voters will decide on Amendment 7, which aims to ban ranked-choice voting in the state. Supporters of ranked-choice voting argue that it would give voters a chance to elect candidates more closely aligned with their values, discouraging polarization and dysfunction in the Missouri Capitol. Critics, including Republicans, argue that the method would confuse voters. The measure also includes a provision to ban non-U.S. citizens from voting in the state, a practice that is already illegal. Supporters of the provision argue that it is necessary for clarification, while opponents argue that it is 'ballot candy' to entice voters. 'The election system we're using right now destroys trust,' said Larry Bradley, a supporter of ranked-choice voting. 'Ranked-choice voting will do away with that, because they will be representing the majority view of the voters.' Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican, said that ranked-choice voting 'doesn't seem to work' and that 'it's not the way we do things here in Missouri.'

**Amendment 7 would end ranked-choice voting in Missouri before it starts; citizens committee pushes back**
A group called Preserve Local Elections is pushing for ranked-choice voting in Missouri, but Amendment 7, which would prohibit it, is gaining traction. Proponents of Amendment 7 argue that ranked-choice voting is too cumbersome and violates the one person, one vote principle in the Constitution. However, Preserve Local Elections' Rachel MacNair said, 'The only people who benefit from not having ranked-choice voting are the people who think they can win elections with a plurality.' Larry Bradley of Better Ballot KC, which supports ranked-choice voting, said, 'Ranked-choice voting gives voters more of a voice in who is representing them and forces each party to post stronger candidates.' Bradley also argued that ranked-choice voting would allow people to vote for a third party without feeling like they are 'throwing away their vote.' However, Byron Keelin of Freedom Principle Missouri, which opposes ranked-choice voting, said, 'It's confusing. It's cumbersome. It leads to delays and outcomes.' Missouri joins several other states voting on the future of ranked-choice voting, with only Alaska and Maine currently using it statewide.

**Missouri's Amendment 7 would ban ranked-choice voting. What is it?**
Missouri's Amendment 7, placed on the Nov. 5 election ballots, aims to alter the state constitution to effectively ban ranked-choice voting. However, the proposal has sparked controversy over its use of 'ballot candy,' where the first bullet point in the ballot language, 'Make the Constitution consistent with state law by only allowing citizens of the United States to vote,' is seen as an attractive but largely meaningless change. Critics argue that this is an attempt to dupe voters, while supporters claim it clarifies the constitution. The proposal would prohibit Missouri from adopting ranked-choice voting, except for the city of St. Louis, which would be allowed to continue using it for some nonpartisan municipal elections, as stated by the amendment's drafters. 'It's a Trojan horse,' said critics, 'with a small, attractive change at the top and a large, substantive change at the bottom.'

**Amendment 7, banning ranked-choice voting in Missouri, is on ballots Nov. 5**
Amendment 7, placed on the Nov. 5 ballots in Missouri, would alter the state constitution to effectively ban ranked-choice voting. However, the proposal has sparked controversy over its use of 'ballot candy', listing a seemingly innocuous change to specify that 'only' citizens can vote, while obscuring the more substantive changes that would prohibit Missouri from adopting ranked-choice voting. Critics argue that the drafters are attempting to dupe voters, while supporters claim the constitution should be clear on this matter. The proposal does include a carve-out for the city of St. Louis to continue using ranked-choice voting for some nonpartisan municipal elections. As explained by critics, ranked-choice voting allows voters to rank candidates according to preference, and if no candidate has an initial majority, the candidate with the least votes is removed and their votes redistributed based on how voters had ranked them, repeating the process until a winner is clear.

**Missouri Amendment 7: Behind the ranked-choice voting and citizenship ballot question**
Missouri voters will decide in November whether to amend the state constitution to ban ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates from favorite to least favorite. The amendment, Missouri Amendment 7, would also prohibit noncitizens from voting in elections, although state law already prohibits noncitizens from registering to vote. Proponents of ranked-choice voting argue that it forces candidates to represent the views of voters, while opponents argue that it is confusing and can be manipulated by interest groups. 'Right now, we see politicians incentivized to lie to voters about what they really care about and voters incentivized to lie about who they really support,' said Benjamin Singer, CEO of Show Me Integrity, who will be voting against the amendment. Byron Keelin, president of Freedom Principle MO, opposes ranked-choice voting and will be voting for Amendment 7, citing concerns about confusion, cost, and manipulation by interest groups. 'What politicians in Jefferson City are trying to do is trick Missourians,' Singer said, 'because they know that Missourians actually want these reforms.'

**Missouri and 9 More States to Vote on Controversial Abortion Amendments to Undo Pro-Life Protections**
Missouri and nine other states will vote on a controversial abortion amendment that could undo pro-life protections. Linda McKnight, a resident of Webb City, Missouri, is voting 'no' on the initiative, saying she was 'surprised and disappointed' by the proposal. Opponents of the amendment argue that it goes beyond expanding access to abortion, and would allow minors to undergo sex change operations without parental consent, remove malpractice protections, and more. Missouri State Senator Rick Brattin expressed concerns over the potential impact on minors, particularly in cases of abuse. Pro-life advocates have been going door to door, explaining the full scope of Amendment 3 to voters. A 'yes' vote in Missouri would permanently enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution, allowing the procedure to be performed up until birth. Pro-life advocates and legislators predict a significant increase in abortion rates if voters overturn bans via ballot initiatives.

**Missourians will decide whether to block cities from using ranked-choice voting system**
Missourians will vote on Amendment 7, which aims to ban Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) in cities and counties. RCV allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, ensuring that only candidates with a majority of support (at least 50% plus one vote) are elected. Opponents argue that RCV is too complicated and would limit voter choices, while supporters say it promotes more nuanced voting and less negative campaigning. Larry Bradley, leader of Better Ballot KC, said, 'It's a deliberate attempt to trick Missouri voters into voting for something that will limit their choices in elections going forward.' State Rep. Brian Sietz, R-Branson, argued that RCV is confusing and makes it harder for citizens to vote. However, supporters point out that RCV would open the door to third-party candidates and promote more issue-based campaigning. If passed, Amendment 7 would prevent cities and counties from adopting RCV, but would not affect municipalities that already use it.

**Why KC is key to Missouri abortion amendment's path to victory: 'Make a voting plan'**
The passage of Amendment 3, a Missouri state constitutional amendment that would overturn the state's abortion ban, is likely to be decided by voter turnout. Supporters of the amendment, including Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes, are focusing on get-out-the-vote efforts in key areas such as Kansas City, where more than 223,000 registered voters reside. According to public polling, voters are on track to approve the measure, with 58% of respondents supporting Amendment 3 and 30% opposing it. Amendment opponents, including Missouri Stands with Women, are urging congregants to vote no, citing concerns about the potential for minors to obtain gender transition surgeries without parental consent. However, legal and medical experts have disputed this claim, and supporters of the amendment have focused on the importance of personal privacy and personal freedom. 'We know the majority of Americans support abortion access and the majority of Missourians support abortion access. So now we're down to the point where we need to help people make a voting plan,' said Selina Sandoval, associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes. 'We have to identify our supporters and make sure they have a plan to vote,' added Lucas Rodriguez, an organizer with Yes on 3.

They provide examples of their voting decisions, including their choices for school board, U.S. Senator, U.S. Representative, and Governor. The author also weighs in on six state constitutional amendments and propositions, including their support for Amendment 2 (sports gambling), Amendment 3 (overturning Missouri's abortion ban), and Proposition A (raising the minimum wage). They express opposition to Amendment 5 (new gambling district), Amendment 6 (funding law enforcement jobs), and Amendment 7 (banning ranked-choice voting). The author plans to abstain on three St. Louis County propositions and 24 retention questions for judges. As they say, 'I can only hope that Young pulls more votes from Hawley than from Kunce. It would be cool if deep-red Missouri could flip a Senate seat.'

**Platte County kids deserve better mental health. Voters have a chance to help Nov. 5 | Opinion**
The article discusses several topics related to the upcoming election, including the importance of voting, the need for a children's services fund in Platte County, and the dangers of electing a fascist leader like Donald Trump. The author, Suzanne B. Conaway, urges readers to vote for Kamala Harris and to stand up for their country. The article also touches on the issue of ranked choice voting, which would be banned in Missouri if Amendment 7 passes. The author argues that ranked choice voting is a simple and fair system that allows voters to rank their candidates without risking being a spoiler. 'You simply rank your first choice, second choice and so on,' the author explains. 'It's like the first round never existed. You got to vote for Mary and still pick Edward over Anne.' The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of voting and the need to stand up for one's country. 'If we let Donald Trump win, our country will become what it rebelled against in 1776, and our American experiment will have ended in failure,' the author warns. 'So please, stand up for your country. Put country over party and vote for Kamala Harris, because she is the right choice. Our country, and maybe our lives, depend on you and your vote.'

**Everything you need to know about Missouri's most controversial 2024 ballot issues**
Missouri voters will decide on six ballot issues in the 2024 election, including sports gambling, abortion rights, voting regulations, and minimum wage for workers. Amendment 2 would legalize sports gambling in the state, with a 10% tax on sports betting and the first $5 million allocated to a fund to prevent compulsive gambling. Amendment 3 would restore the right to abortion in Missouri and enshrine protections for reproductive health care in the state's constitution. Amendment 7 would clarify and modify the way elections are run in the state, but it's more likely to affect elections far down the road rather than the immediate future. Proposition A would raise the minimum wage gradually to $15 an hour in January 2026 and require employers with 15 or more workers to provide one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked.

**Missouri is voting on abortion rights. Here's everything to know about Amendment 3**
Missouri is voting on Amendment 3, which aims to overturn the state's near-total ban on abortion. The amendment would establish a right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives, with any governmental interference presumed invalid. It would also remove Missouri's ban on abortion, allow regulation of reproductive health care to improve or maintain the health of the patient, and require the government not to discriminate against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care. If passed, the amendment would enshrine these rights in the state constitution and make it more difficult to overturn through legislation. Opponents estimate a potentially significant loss to state revenue, while supporters argue that restoring abortion rights would cost the state nothing. The amendment does not define 'extraordinary medical measures' and would likely face legal challenges. Abortion access would not return to Missouri overnight, but the amendment would offer a pathway to tear down the ban and years of restrictions. The laws that governed abortion before the state's 2022 trigger ban would still be on the books, including state statutes that required minors to get parental permission or a court order before obtaining an abortion. However, these laws could be challenged in court if Amendment 3 passes.

**Heartland Votes: Nov. 5 Election Guide**
Voters in Missouri, Illinois, and Kentucky will head to the polls on November 5 to cast their ballots in various state and local elections. In Missouri, voters will decide on several constitutional amendments, including one that would permit licensed sports wagering and another that would establish a constitutional right to reproductive health care. In Illinois, voters will weigh in on three non-binding referendums, including one that asks whether candidates should face penalties for interfering with election workers. In Kentucky, voters will decide on two constitutional amendments, one that deals with school choice and another that focuses on voter citizenship. Additionally, voters in Kentucky will consider medical marijuana ballot resolutions. According to the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, a 'yes' vote on Amendment 2 would amend the Missouri Constitution to permit licensed sports wagering, while a 'no' vote would not amend the Missouri Constitution regarding licensed regulated sports wagering. Similarly, a 'yes' vote on Amendment 3 would establish a constitutional right to reproductive health care, while a 'no' vote would continue the statutory prohibition of abortion in Missouri. 'It is a step in the right direction,' said JJ Ridings, the local manager for Alliance Water in Cape Girardeau, regarding a ballot question that would increase water rates to pay for improvements and maintenance of the water system. 'We'll have live election results throughout the night on-air and online,' said the article, referring to the coverage of the elections.

**Explaining the amendments on Missouri's general election ballot, part 2**
Missouri voters will decide on four amendments and one proposition in the Nov. 5 general election. Constitutional Amendment 6 would reinstate a $3 court fee to support the salaries of law enforcement, while Amendment 7 would enshrine state law into the constitution by only allowing U.S. citizens aged 18 or older to vote. Proposition A would increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and provide one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Supporters of Amendment 6, including Republican State Senator Rusty Black, say it would guarantee that sheriffs play a crucial role in the administration of justice. Supporters of Amendment 7, including Lieutenant Governor Mike Kehoe, say it would secure state elections. Supporters of Proposition A, including Democrat State Representative Crystal Quade, say it would help working parents. However, opponents of the measures, including the Libertarian think tank Reason Foundation and Lieutenant Governor Kehoe, say they could create conflicts of interest, hurt Missourians' freedom, and raise prices on basic products.

**Ranked choice voting is gaining popularity, but Missouri could ban it next month**
Ranked choice voting, a system where voters rank candidates in order of preference, is gaining popularity nationwide. However, Missouri may ban the practice next month through Amendment 7, which would also prohibit noncitizen voting. Dr. Debra Leiter, an associate professor of political science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, notes that ranked choice voting is currently 'a little trendy.' The voting method requires a majority of the vote, eliminating candidates with the least support until one receives more than 50% approval. Currently, Amendment 7 is one of several ballot issues that Missourians will vote on.

**Hoskins touts paper ballots, election security in his run for Missouri Secretary of State**
Denny Hoskins, the Republican nominee for Missouri Secretary of State, has made securing the state's elections his top priority. He advocates for in-person voting on Election Day with voter ID and paper ballots, citing concerns about election machines being hacked. Hoskins also supports Amendment 7, which would mandate that only U.S. citizens can vote in Missouri, and has filed a bill to hand count ballots. Additionally, he aims to make it easier for businesses to register as Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) in the state. According to Hoskins, 'any electronic device can always be hacked,' and he points to Puerto Rico's primary election as an example of the potential risks of relying on election machines.

**Amendment 7; what is it, and why its on the November ballot**
Amendment 7, a statewide issue in Missouri, is focused on Ranked Choice Voting (RCV). RCV would guarantee the winner of primary elections has met the 50% plus one threshold. In a hypothetical election, if no candidate reaches 50% plus one, votes would be shifted to the next preferred candidate until someone reaches the threshold. Members of Freedom Principle Missouri, led by Cary Wells, want to pass Amendment 7 to outlaw RCV from the Missouri Constitution, citing concerns about manipulation and representation. However, Larry Bradley with Better Ballot KC argues that Amendment 7 is a 'deliberate attempt to trick Missouri voters' and that the ballot language is misleading. Bradley notes that RCV has gained momentum among voters, with 95% of voters in New York City finding it easy and 77% preferring it. Voters will decide Amendment 7 on November 5.

**What is ranked-choice voting, and should Missouri ban it?**
Ranked-choice voting is a system where voters rank candidates in order of preference, and the candidate with the majority of first-preference votes wins. If no candidate has a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who picked that candidate as their first choice have their next choice counted. This process continues until one candidate has obtained a majority. Proponents argue that it takes less time and money than runoff voting and encourages moderation among candidates. Critics claim that it makes elections unnecessarily complicated and can lead to confusion. Missouri voters will have the opportunity to ban ranked-choice voting in November, but it is already outlawed in the state. Ranked-choice voting has been adopted in Maine and Alaska, where moderate candidates have won elections. The decision to ban ranked-choice voting in Missouri depends on whether one supports moderate or extreme politicians.

**What does a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ vote mean on Missouri Amendment 7?**
Missouri voters will be asked to vote 'Yes' or 'No' on Amendment 7 in the upcoming general election. A 'yes' vote would change the state's constitution to limit voting rights to U.S. citizens 18 and older, ban ranked-choice voting, and ensure the plurality winner of a party's primary represents their party in the general election. A 'no' vote would maintain the current voting rights and allow Missouri municipalities to continue using ranked-choice voting. According to the ballot, a 'yes' vote would ensure that only U.S. citizens can vote in Missouri state elections, while a 'no' vote would maintain the current voting rights, including the possibility of ranked-choice voting.

**The Only Thing Missouri Amendment 7 Does Is Ban More Choice Elections**
Missouri Amendment 7, which has received little attention, affects the voting rights of every Missouri citizen. It requires that only US citizens 18 years or older can vote in state elections, prohibits ranked choice voting, and requires plurality primary elections that advance a single winner to the general election. Critics argue that this amendment is a 'poison pill' that would deny voters the ability to decide for themselves what election model works best for them and their communities. Wes Rogers, in a recent op-ed, wrote, 'Beware of the sneaky Missouri Amendment 7, which uses something that’s common sense — prohibiting noncitizens from voting — to candy-coat a poison pill and distract from all the other things it would do to make elections less representative of all of us.' The Kansas City Star has issued a 'No' endorsement for Amendment 7, citing that it would deny voters the freedom to decide on a more modern election model. Rogers added, 'It would be just as foolish to ban open primaries and require a plurality winner. Why should Missouri be stuck with a system that advances two candidates to a general election when they can’t even win a majority of their own party’s voters in a low-turnout primary?'

**State A.G. voices support for ballot amendment during visit**
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey expressed his support for Amendment 7, also known as the 'Only Citizens Vote and Only Vote Once Amendment,' which appears on the Nov. 5 ballot. According to a September poll by Public Opinion Strategies (POS), 68% of Missouri voters support the amendment, which would make the Missouri Constitution consistent with state law by only allowing citizens of the United States to vote. Bailey stated, 'I think people overwhelmingly support the idea that you should be an American citizen to be able to vote in an American election.' The POS also highlighted the need for the amendment's passage, citing 19 cities in California, Maryland, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., that currently allow non-citizens to vote in local elections. Opponents argue that the amendment's real purpose is to end ranked choice voting in the state.

**Map shows states that could change voting rules after November**
Voters in 15 states will decide on ballot measures that could change the rules for voting in future elections. Seven states are considering ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates based on their preferred order, while eight states are voting on measures that would prohibit local governments from allowing noncitizens to vote in elections. Alaska voters will vote on an initiative to repeal the state's ranked-choice system, while Missouri voters will consider a measure to bar the use of ranked-choice voting in the state. 'Ranked-choice voting allows voters to rank candidates based on their preferred order,' said an article. 'After all votes are counted, if no candidate reaches 50 percent, the candidate who received the lowest number of votes is eliminated. Then, votes are re-tabulated, with the votes of anyone who ranked that candidate first going to their second choice. That continues until a candidate reaches 50 percent.' There is no evidence of noncitizens voting in federal elections, but a handful of municipalities allow them to vote in local elections. 'It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, but a handful of municipalities allow them to vote in local elections,' said the article. 'Those areas include a handful of towns and cities in Maryland and Vermont, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.'

**Deceptive Amendment 7 would take power from Missourians and give it to politicians | Opinion**
Missouri Amendment 7 is a deceptive measure that uses a common-sense prohibition on noncitizen voting to distract from its true intentions: to take power from the people and give it to politicians. The amendment would also ban ranked choice voting and open primaries, which are valued by Americans for their ability to produce a majority winner, save money, and incentivize elected leaders to focus on problem-solving. Wes Rogers, a representative from the Kansas City Council, argues that the amendment is driven by those who would entrench themselves in power and can't be trusted to use it on behalf of the people. He urges voters to reject Amendment 7 and protect their voice.

**Missouri Republicans tout citizen-only voting in run-up to Election Day**
Two Republican candidates for statewide office in Missouri, Attorney General Andrew Bailey and Treasurer Vivek Malek, are urging voters to support a question on the November ballot that would bar noncitizens from voting. Although U.S. law already prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections, Bailey and Malek argue that it is a preventative measure to guard against illegal immigrants gaining the right to vote. Malek, who immigrated to the U.S. from India 22 years ago and became a citizen 16 years later, said, 'We're not anti-immigrant.' The proposed constitutional amendment, Amendment 7, also asks voters to bar ranked choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. Bailey said, 'Having the right to vote and freedom to participate in elections is a sacred right that generations of brave Americans have died to protect.' Malek added, 'Allowing noncitizens to vote devalues our citizenship.'

**Here's what to know about Missouri's abortion ballot question before the election**
Missourians will vote on an amendment in November that would enshrine abortion-rights protections in the state's constitution. The amendment would establish a right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives, without governmental interference. It would also remove Missouri's ban on abortion, allow regulation of reproductive health care to improve or maintain the health of the patient, and require the government not to discriminate against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care. Abortion-rights proponents say that approving the amendment would protect Missourians' rights to make personal health decisions, while anti-abortion proponents claim that it would have far-reaching consequences beyond abortion, including legalizing abortion through all nine months of pregnancy and stripping away parental rights. According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, fetal viability depends on complex factors and weeks of gestation alone cannot definitively determine viability, with survival rates ranging from 23% to 27% for births at 23 weeks. 'We know the majority of Missouri voters believe their neighbors should have the fundamental right to make their own, personal medical decisions without political interference,' said Russ Carnahan, chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party. 'This state legislative session, Missouri Republicans reaffirmed their commitment to cruelty, voting against allowing abortion exceptions in cases of rape or incest and against protecting contraceptives and IVF services.'

**Missouri voters to decide on Proposition A and Amendment 7**
Missouri voters will face a lengthy ballot in November, featuring over 30 candidates and issues, including five constitutional amendments and a statewide proposition. Proposition A aims to mandate one hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked and raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026. Supporters, including hundreds of businesses, are confident of success, citing the need for workers to earn paid sick time and a living wage. In contrast, Amendment 7 seeks to outlaw ranked choice voting in Missouri, with opponents arguing it is 'intensely anti-democratic' and would shut down debate. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft supports the amendment, stating it would simplify the process and increase transparency.

**Here are the top 10 issues conservatives must watch on the November ballot**
Conservatives must pay attention to the ballot initiatives in the November election, as they could have a significant impact on the country's future. The article highlights 10 critical issues, including unlimited abortion, marijuana-fueled criminal vagrancy, and ranked-choice voting. It also emphasizes the importance of limiting unaccountable ballot initiatives, protecting South Dakota landowners, stopping unaccountable redistricting committees, and ending governors' emergency public health powers. Additionally, the article discusses implementing state-based immigration enforcement, making local elections partisan, and punishing drug trafficking and theft. The article notes that conservatives are being heavily outspent and out-organized by the left, and warns that the lack of voter education on the ballot language could lead to liberal amendments winning in deep-red states. 'A simple democracy is the devil's own government,' as Benjamin Rush warned, and conservatives must act to secure favorable outcomes. 'No' votes are recommended on Florida Amendment 4, Florida Amendment 3, South Dakota Measure 29, North Dakota Measure 5, and Nebraska Initiative 437. 'Yes' votes are recommended on Alaska Ballot Measure 2, Arizona Prop. 133, Missouri Amendment 7, Arizona Prop. 134, North Dakota Constitutional Measure 2, and Utah Amendment D. 'Yes' votes are also recommended on Florida Amendment 1 and California Proposition 36.

**Missouri Amendment 7: Understanding Ranked-Choice Voting**
Missourians will vote on Missouri Amendment 7 in November, which aims to ban ranked-choice voting in the state. Ranked-choice voting allows voters to rank candidates from favorite to least favorite. If no candidate wins the majority, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are reallocated to the candidate individuals who voted for them ranked as their second choice. Proponents argue that ranked-choice voting forces candidates to more closely represent the views of voters, while opponents, such as Byron Keelin, president of Freedom Principle MO, argue that it is confusing for voters and can be manipulated by interest groups. The city of St. Louis is exempt from the amendment and will continue to use approval voting on local races. Ranked-choice voting has historically favored moderate candidates who appeal more broadly to voters, as seen in Alaska's 2022 general election, where U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski was able to win reelection despite being censured by the Alaska Republican Party.

**Amendment 7, banning ranked-choice voting in Missouri, is on ballots Nov. 5**
Amendment 7, placed on the Nov. 5 ballots in Missouri, would alter the state constitution to effectively ban ranked-choice voting. However, the proposal has sparked controversy over its use of 'ballot candy', listing a seemingly innocuous change to specify that 'only' citizens can vote, while obscuring the more substantive changes that would prohibit Missouri from adopting ranked-choice voting. Critics argue that the drafters are attempting to dupe voters, while supporters claim the constitution should be clear on this matter. The proposal does include a carve-out for the city of St. Louis to continue using ranked-choice voting for some nonpartisan municipal elections. As explained by critics, ranked-choice voting allows voters to rank candidates according to preference, and if no candidate has an initial majority, the candidate with the least votes is removed and their votes redistributed based on how voters had ranked them, repeating the process until a winner is clear.

**Roundtable Reacts: Analyzing recent election polling**
Recent polling in Missouri shows a majority of likely voters support sports betting, with 52% in favor of Amendment Two and 25% opposed. However, 23% of voters remain undecided. The same poll found that 58% of likely voters support Amendment Three, which would reverse the state's near-total abortion ban. The economy stands out as the top issue for Missouri voters, with 40% citing it as their top priority. Other issues, such as abortion, crime, and immigration, barely register as top priorities. The poll also found that men are more likely to support sports betting than women, with 59% of men in favor compared to 46% of women. The poll was conducted by Emerson College and The Hill.

**Letter: State has no business micromanaging health care choices**
Missouri voters will have the opportunity to vote 'yes' on Amendment 3 on November 5, which would end the state's abortion ban and return the right to make reproductive health care choices to Missouri women. As a pediatrician, the author has seen the impact of the ban on patients, particularly those experiencing high-risk deliveries, infertility, and miscarriages. The author emphasizes that reproductive health care choices are personal and should not be made by health care providers or the government. Instead, Amendment 3 is about giving Missourians the right to make their own health care choices, regardless of their personal views.

**Missouri Amendment 7: Behind the ranked-choice voting and citizenship ballot question**
Missouri voters will decide in November whether to amend the state constitution to ban ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates from favorite to least favorite. The amendment, Missouri Amendment 7, would also prohibit noncitizens from voting in elections, although state law already prohibits noncitizens from registering to vote. Proponents of ranked-choice voting argue that it forces candidates to represent the views of voters, while opponents argue that it is confusing and can be manipulated by interest groups. 'Right now, we see politicians incentivized to lie to voters about what they really care about and voters incentivized to lie about who they really support,' said Benjamin Singer, CEO of Show Me Integrity, who will be voting against the amendment. Byron Keelin, president of Freedom Principle MO, opposes ranked-choice voting and will be voting for Amendment 7, citing concerns about confusion, cost, and manipulation by interest groups. 'What politicians in Jefferson City are trying to do is trick Missourians,' Singer said, 'because they know that Missourians actually want these reforms.'

**Missouri sheriffs launch fundraising effort for pension ballot question**
The Committee to Ensure a Future for Sheriffs & Prosecutors has launched a fundraising campaign to support Amendment 6 on the Nov. 5 ballot, which aims to bail out the pension system for Missouri sheriffs and prosecutors. The system's funding level could drop to 73% by the end of the year if the proposed change is not approved by voters. The system paid out $3.8 million in retirement benefits last year, but is projected to receive only $450,000 this year from the 5% sheriffs' contributions. The formation of a fundraising PAC for the initiative comes as voters will face six questions on the Nov. 5 ballot, including initiatives to legalize abortion and sports betting, raise the minimum wage, allow for a casino at the Lake of the Ozarks and ban ranked-choice voting. 'Typically, public sector retirement plans are paid out of general state funds raised via income and sales taxes, not fees,' said Melissa Lorts, the executive director of the Missouri Sheriffs' Retirement System. 'If approved by voters in the upcoming election, the fee structure to pay for pension benefits would be set by the Legislature.'

**Florida has banned ranked-choice voting, but advocates say they're not giving up**
Florida has banned ranked-choice voting (RCV), but advocates are not giving up. They say it may take years to finance a campaign to repeal the ban, but that remains their ultimate goal. RCV allows voters to select candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate receives the majority of the vote, the candidate with the least amount of support is eliminated, and the votes for that eliminated candidate are redistributed to the voters' next choices. The process continues until a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote. Advocates say RCV reduces partisanship and makes voters more civically involved. The system is already the law in Maine and Alaska, and dozens of cities in the United States. Measures on two statewide ballots could eliminate RCV: in Missouri and in Alaska. Despite the ban, Sarasota, Florida, remains a hub for RCV advocacy, with an overwhelming number of voters (77.6%) approving instant-runoff voting in 2007. The city's supervisor of elections office couldn't implement RCV due to a lack of technology, but city commissioners are still fighting for the system. 'We're going to walk before we can run, but yes, at some point in time — and I'm not going to say when — we have to do it,' said John Severini, chair of Rank My Vote Florida. 'It brings people back to voting for people, and not for the parties,' said Sarasota Vice Mayor Jen Ahern-Koch, a strong supporter of RCV. 'It just says to the voter, here's a person. Do your research. Is this the person you want in office? Or do you want this one? Which one's your favorite? Which one's your second favorite? It takes you, the voter, and says you must now be civically involved in your local and state and national government. And you must do your research.'

**Missouri and Other States to Put Abortion Protection to a Vote**
In the upcoming November elections, voters in the United States will not only be choosing their next president, but also deciding on a constitutional amendment in the state of Missouri that would protect the right to abortion. If the amendment is approved, the state would allow for voluntary termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks of gestation. Missouri is not alone in this effort, as other states are also putting the protection of abortion rights to a vote.

**Bench trail set to begin over fair wording on November ballot over abortion Wednesday**
A bench trial is scheduled for Wednesday over the wording of Amendment Three on the November ballot, which concerns abortion. Abortion rights advocates claim that the current wording is argumentative and confusing, and are seeking a new, fair ballot language. The current language, according to the Secretary of State's website, reads: 'A 'yes' vote will enshrine the right to abortion at any time of a pregnancy in the Missouri Constitution. Additionally, it will prohibit any regulation of abortion, including regulations designed to protect women undergoing abortions and prohibit any civil or criminal recourse against anyone who performs an abortion and hurts or kills the pregnant woman.' This is not the first time a lawsuit has been filed due to ballot language, with a previous ballot summary being deemed 'problematic and inaccurate' by a Missouri judge.
