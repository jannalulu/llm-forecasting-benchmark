**INT. FORECASTING LAB - DAY - JULY 18, 2024**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, their eyes glued to a screen displaying the latest polling data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the big question: Did Trump’s lead fall between 3 and 4 points on July 15?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
Nope. Our models had it at 2.8%. Trump’s lead was outside the bounds.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Biden’s team did rally post-debate, though. The media blitz seemed to stabilize his numbers a bit.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(skeptical)  
But not enough. The pressure's still on him with the convention looming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(optimistic)  
True, but our models predicted this. The probability was never high.

They exchange knowing glances, their confidence in their models unwavering.

FADE OUT.

*The room buzzes with anticipation as a group of superforecasters gather around a large screen displaying polling data.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, the numbers are in. Trump's lead over Biden was exactly 3.8 points on July 15th.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 92.75% probability. The debate fallout really shifted the dynamics.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** And Biden's team couldn't turn perceptions around quickly enough. The pressure must be immense with the Democratic National Convention next month.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** It's fascinating how the debate performance and subsequent media narratives played out. The New York Times' editorial must have added fuel to the fire.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Indeed. With such precise modeling, it's clear how critical each event becomes in shaping the race.

*They nod, acknowledging the power of accurate forecasting and the unpredictable nature of politics.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Let's see how this unfolds leading up to November.

Well, the numbers are in. Trump's lead over Biden on July 15 was 3.7 points.

Our models had it at 92.35%. Given Biden's debate performance and the subsequent media fallout, it was almost inevitable.

Still, the Biden team's efforts to shift perceptions were notable. But the calls for him to drop out certainly didn't help.
