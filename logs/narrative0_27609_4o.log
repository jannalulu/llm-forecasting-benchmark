**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did Ukrainian forces capture B. Soldatskoe before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the advances in Kursk Oblast, the fortified defenses and strategic importance of the region made it a challenging target.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the reports up to August 26 indicated Ukrainian forces were pushing hard but faced significant resistance. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The proximity to the Kursk Nuclear Plant likely influenced both sides' strategies, adding complexity to the situation.

**NATE SILVER:** So, while the incursion showed promise, B. Soldatskoe remains under Russian control for now.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the question remains—did Ukrainian forces capture B. Soldatskoe before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. The incursion into Kursk Oblast showed promise, but the resistance was formidable.
