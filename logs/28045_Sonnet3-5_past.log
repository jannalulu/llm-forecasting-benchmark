To forecast this question, I'll analyze the available polling data, consider recent trends, and evaluate potential factors that could influence the outcome.

Key evidence:

1. Recent polls show AfD support ranging from 24-27%:
- Sept 12 poll: 27% (Infratest dimap)
- Sept 5 poll: 27% (Infratest dimap)
- Aug 6 poll: 24% (INSA)
- July 17 poll: 24% (INSA)

2. AfD support has increased slightly in recent months, from 24% in July to 27% in September.

3. The election is on September 22, just 10 days away, so major shifts are less likely.

4. AfD performed strongly in recent Saxony and Thuringia elections, getting over 30% in both.

5. Brandenburg's state office has classified AfD as a suspected right-wing extremist organization, which could limit their appeal.

6. Migration is the top issue for 40% of voters, which typically benefits AfD.

Factors to consider:

1. Potential for late swing voters or shy AfD voters not captured in polls.
2. Turnout effects - higher turnout could dilute AfD support.
3. Impact of recent AfD successes in other eastern states.
4. Effectiveness of other parties' campaigns against AfD in final days.

Analysis:
The recent polls consistently show AfD below 28%, with 27% being their highest level of support. There's been a slight upward trend, but it's stabilized at 27% in the last two polls. With only 10 days left, a jump above 28% seems unlikely but not impossible.

The strong AfD performances in Saxony and Thuringia suggest potential for outperforming polls, but Brandenburg's political landscape may differ. The "right-wing extremist" label could cap their support.

Balancing these factors, I believe AfD is likely to finish between 25-29%, with 27-28% being the most probable range. There's a chance they could exceed 28%, but I assess this as relatively low probability given the consistent polling and short time remaining.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 29.00%, with 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll examine the key evidence and considerations:

1. Recent polls: The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with 27% support. Multiple polls consistently show them around this level.

2. Trend: The AfD's support has been relatively stable in recent months, not showing major increases or decreases.

3. Historical performance: In the 2019 Brandenburg election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. They've gained some support since then.

4. Margin of error: Polls typically have a margin of error of around 3-4 percentage points.

5. Time until election: With the election on September 22, there's limited time for major shifts in support.

6. AfD classification: The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD as a suspected right-wing extremist organization, which could limit their ability to gain additional supporters.

7. Competing parties: The SPD has been gaining ground recently, potentially limiting the AfD's ability to attract more voters.

8. Voter turnout: Higher turnout could potentially dilute the AfD's vote share if additional voters favor other parties.

9. Late shifts: There's always potential for late shifts in voter preferences, but these are typically small.

10. Polling errors: Polls have sometimes underestimated AfD support in past elections.

Weighing these factors, I believe the AfD is likely to receive between 24% and 30% of the vote, with 27% being the most likely outcome based on current polling. There's a strong chance their vote share will be at or below 28%.

My Prediction: Between 24.00% and 30.00%, with 27.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Key considerations:

1. Current polling: The most recent polls from September 12, 2024 show the AfD at 27% support. Multiple polls released that day consistently show 27%.

6. Recent state elections: The AfD recently performed strongly in Thuringia and Saxony elections, exceeding 30% in both. This could boost their momentum.

7. Opposing factors: There is significant opposition to the AfD, with 61% of voters against their participation in government. This may motivate strategic voting against them.

8. Undecided voters: Some polls show a significant portion of undecided voters, which adds uncertainty.

9. Potential polling error: Polls have underestimated AfD support in some past elections.

Weighing these factors, I believe the AfD is likely to receive between 25-29% of the vote. Their consistent 27% polling suggests this is the most likely outcome, but there's a chance they could slightly underperform or overperform.

The question asks if the AfD vote share will be less than or equal to 28%. Given the above analysis, I estimate there's about a 65% chance of this occurring. There's a significant chance they exceed 28%, but it's more likely they'll fall at or below this threshold.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 70.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.
