To answer this question, I'll consider relevant evidence and balance different factors:

1. Historical rate: Only two confirmed interstellar objects (1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov) have been discovered since 2017. This suggests they are rare, with roughly one discovery every 3-4 years on average.

2. Improved detection capabilities: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to dramatically improve our ability to detect faint, fast-moving objects. However, it's not scheduled to begin operations until 2025, after the September 30, 2024 cutoff date.

3. Current search efforts: Existing surveys continue to search for interstellar objects, but no major new detection systems are mentioned as coming online before the cutoff date.

4. Time frame: The question asks about discovery before September 30, 2024, which is less than a year from today (October 18, 2024). This is a relatively short window given the rarity of these objects.

5. Unpredictability: The arrival of interstellar objects is largely random and unpredictable. While we can estimate frequencies, we can't predict exactly when the next one will arrive.

6. Focus on other astronomical events: Many of the news articles focus on other upcoming astronomical events like comets and novas, suggesting that interstellar object detection may not be a primary focus for observatories in the near term.

Balancing these factors:

- The historical rate suggests a low probability of discovery in less than a year.
- Existing detection capabilities haven't changed significantly since the last discovery.
- The short time frame further reduces the chances.
- However, ongoing search efforts and the random nature of these objects mean a discovery is still possible.

Given these considerations, I estimate a low probability of discovery before the cutoff date, but not zero due to the unpredictable nature of these events.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To approach this question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on recent developments and specific factors relevant to interstellar object discovery.

Base rate:
Since the first confirmed interstellar object (1I/'Oumuamua) was discovered in 2017, only one other confirmed interstellar object (2I/Borisov) has been discovered, in 2019. This gives us a rough base rate of one discovery every two years.

Factors to consider:

1. Improved detection capabilities:
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, mentioned in several articles, is expected to dramatically improve our ability to detect interstellar objects. However, it's not scheduled to begin operations until 2025, which is after the September 30, 2024 deadline.

2. Increased awareness and focus:
The articles indicate a growing interest in interstellar objects among astronomers. This increased focus could lead to more vigilant searching and potentially faster identification of candidates.

3. Time since last discovery:
It's been about 5 years since the last confirmed interstellar object was discovered. This might suggest we're "due" for another discovery, but it's important not to fall into the gambler's fallacy.

4. Difficulty of detection:
Interstellar objects are extremely rare and difficult to detect. The fact that only two have been confirmed in all of astronomical history underscores this challenge.

5. Short timeframe:
The question asks about discovery before September 30, 2024, which is less than a year from the current date. This relatively short timeframe reduces the likelihood of a discovery.

6. No specific predictions:
None of the articles provided any specific predictions about imminent interstellar object discoveries. Most of the astronomy news focused on comets within our solar system or other astronomical events.

Balancing these factors:

The improved detection capabilities from new observatories like Vera C. Rubin are promising, but they won't come into play before the deadline. The increased focus on interstellar objects might slightly increase our chances of discovery, but the fundamental rarity of these objects and the short timeframe work against a discovery.

Given the base rate of one discovery every two years and the factors discussed, I believe the likelihood of discovering an interstellar object before September 30, 2024, is low, but not negligible.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Historical rate of interstellar object discoveries:
- Only two confirmed interstellar objects have been discovered so far: 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.
- This suggests a rate of about one discovery every 2-3 years.

2. Improved detection capabilities:
- The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to significantly improve our ability to detect interstellar objects.

4. Time frame:
- The question asks about discovery before September 30, 2024.
- As of the current date (October 18, 2024), this deadline has already passed without a reported discovery.

5. Lack of specific predictions:
- None of the provided articles make specific predictions about an interstellar object discovery before September 30, 2024.

6. Focus on other astronomical events:
- Many articles focus on other events like comets and novas, suggesting that no interstellar object discovery was particularly anticipated during this period.

The historical rate suggests a possibility of a discovery within the timeframe. However, the lack of reported discovery by the current date (past the deadline) is very strong evidence against it happening. The improved detection capabilities from the Rubin Observatory won't be available until after the deadline.

Given that the deadline has passed without a reported discovery, and considering the low historical rate of discoveries, I must conclude that it's extremely unlikely an interstellar object was discovered before September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

The most crucial piece of information is that the deadline of September 30, 2024, has already passed, and no discovery was reported in the provided news articles. Even if a discovery had been made but not yet announced, it would need to have received the "I" designation from the IAU Minor Planet Center before the deadline to count.

Given this information, I can be highly confident that no interstellar object meeting the criteria was discovered before the deadline.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

To answer this question, I'll need to consider several key factors:

1. Historical rate of interstellar object discovery:
'Oumuamua was discovered in 2017, and 2I/Borisov in 2019. This suggests a rate of roughly one discovery every 2-3 years.

2. Improvements in detection capabilities:
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to begin operations in 2025, which would significantly increase our ability to detect interstellar objects. However, this is after the September 30, 2024 deadline.

3. Current detection efforts:
Existing observatories and sky surveys continue to search for interstellar objects, but no major new facilities have come online recently.

4. Time remaining:
As of today (2024-10-18), the deadline has already passed. No interstellar object was reported to be discovered before September 30, 2024 in the provided news articles.

5. Definition of discovery:
The resolution criteria specify that the object must receive an "I" designation from the IAU Minor Planet Center to count as discovered.

Given these factors, here's my analysis:

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The deadline has already passed, and no discovery was reported in the provided news.
- The historical rate suggests we might expect a discovery every 2-3 years, but it's not guaranteed.
- The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which would greatly increase detection capabilities, isn't operational yet.

Arguments for a higher probability:
- There are no strong arguments for a higher probability given the deadline has passed.
