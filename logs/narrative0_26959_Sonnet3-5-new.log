Nate Silver: [removing glasses, sighing] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given what we knew by August 7th, our models predicted only a 12.5% chance of a VP debate happening before October 1st.

Nate: The warning signs were all there. The CPD's cancellation in June, the campaigns' impasse over presidential debates, and Harris's team still finalizing their VP pick in August. Not to mention the unprecedented situation of having a sitting VP as the presidential nominee.

Philip: [nodding] The historical patterns didn't help either. When presidential campaigns can't agree on debates, VP debates rarely materialize. The CBS proposal falling through after Harris became the nominee was another strong indicator.

Nate: No surprises here. Another accurate prediction in the books.

[They both turn to watch news coverage confirming no VP debate occurred]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the VP debate situation."

Philip: "No surprise there. Given what we knew by August 7th, our models had it at 12% probability of happening before October 1st."

Nate: "The signs were all there - the CPD's cancellation in June, Harris's campaign still finalizing their VP pick in August, and that impasse over the presidential debates..."

Philip: "Not to mention the breakdown of Harris's earlier CBS debate agreement after becoming the nominee. The writing was on the wall."

Nate: "The traditional debate format seems to be dying. When both campaigns can't even agree on presidential debate terms, VP debates become even less likely."

Philip: "Another accurate prediction in the books."

Nate Silver: [removing glasses, sighing] Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about the VP debate situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had it at 15% probability, and sure enough, no debate materialized before October 1st.

Nate: The warning signs were there in early August. The CPD's withdrawal, Harris's campaign still finalizing their VP pick, and that impasse over the presidential debates themselves.

Philip: [nodding] The historical data suggested that without the CPD's framework, and with such late VP selection, the likelihood was low. The failed CBS debate attempt in July was another red flag.

Nate: [checking computer] Our models factored in the unprecedented nature of Harris's nomination and Trump's unconventional campaign strategy. The 15% probability mainly accounted for last-minute political pressure forcing a debate.

Philip: Once again, superforecasting proves its worth in navigating political uncertainties.

NATE: Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about the VP debate situation.

PHILIP: No surprise there. With the CPD's cancellation in June and Harris's campaign still finalizing their VP pick in early August, our models gave it only a 12.3% chance.

NATE: The warning signs were all there. The impasse over the presidential debates was telling enough, and once the CPD pulled out, the likelihood plummeted.

PHILIP: Indeed. The historical precedent of VP debates since 1976 made it seem possible, but the unusual circumstances of Harris's late VP selection and the breakdown in debate negotiations between campaigns made it highly improbable.

NATE: *sips coffee* Just goes to show - even established political traditions can be upended when the conditions aren't right.
