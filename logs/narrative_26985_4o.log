**INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY AFTER THE EVENT**

**Superforecaster 1** (leaning over a laptop): So, it happened. More than 50 aircraft in one day. Our models had it at 85.75%.

**Superforecaster 2** (nodding): The escalation post-inauguration was a key factor. We saw the trend rise from 6 to 10 violations daily after May.

**Superforecaster 3** (checking notes): And those June drills? They sent 66 aircraft in just two days. A clear signal.

**Superforecaster 1**: The rhetoric from Beijing was unrelenting. They labeled Lai's administration as separatists.

**Superforecaster 2**: Given the upward trajectory and recent provocations, it was almost inevitable.

**Superforecaster 3** (sighing): Yet, the world watches, hoping it doesn't spiral further.

**Superforecaster 1**: For now, it's just another day in the ADIZ. But tomorrow? Who knows?

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
So, did it happen? More than 50 aircraft in a day?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 15.87%. The escalation was real, but not that extreme.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Given China's recent military posturing after Lai's inauguration, we expected a rise, but not a massive spike.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
The trend was upward, but the probability of crossing that threshold was always low.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(relieved)  
Good. Let's update our models with the latest data.

They return to their screens, the tension easing.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
Sometimes, the numbers tell the story before it unfolds.

They all nod, immersed in their work, the hum of data analysis filling the room.

No, it didn't. Our models had it at 15.34%.

The escalation after Lai's inauguration was significant, but a single-day breach of 50? Unlikely.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(firmly)  
Exactly. The trend was upwards, but not that steep. China’s actions are calculated, not reckless.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**

Good. It’s a relief, but we should stay vigilant. The pressure isn’t going anywhere.
