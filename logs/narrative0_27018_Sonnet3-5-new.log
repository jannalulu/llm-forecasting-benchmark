[Scene: A dimly lit office. PHILIP TETLOCK and NATE SILVER are reviewing data on holographic screens]

TETLOCK: [sighs] Well, that settles it. No publicly available LLM achieved gold at the IMO.

SILVER: Our models gave it just 12.45% probability. The gap between general-purpose LLMs and specialized systems was still too wide.

TETLOCK: [pulling up a news article from August] DeepMind's specialized proof-solver coming within one point of gold was impressive, but...

SILVER: [interrupting] But that was a closed-source, single-purpose system. The public models weren't ready for this level of mathematical reasoning while maintaining general capabilities.

TETLOCK: The requirement for both domain-general intelligence and public availability made this particularly challenging. Our forecasting models were clear on this timeline being too ambitious.

[Both turn to watch the sunset through the window as holographic displays show "NO PUBLIC LLM ACHIEVES IMO GOLD - 2024"]

INTERIOR - FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit in a dimly lit office, surrounded by monitors displaying probability models and news headlines.

NATE
(reviewing papers)
Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We gave it 12.5%.

PHILIP
Indeed. Despite DeepMind's silver medal achievement in August, no publicly-available LLM managed gold at the IMO. The generalist requirement was the key barrier.

NATE
The specialized systems came close, but making a ChatGPT-like model achieve that level of mathematical reasoning while maintaining general capabilities...

PHILIP
(interrupting)
...was too ambitious for 2024. Our models factored in the timeline constraint and the need for public accessibility.

NATE
The probability reflected both the technical challenge and the tight deadline. Another year might have been different.

They both nod, turning back to their monitors as new predictions stream in.

INTERIOR - FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY AFTER IMO RESULTS

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, surrounded by monitors displaying data streams. A newspaper dated August 7, 2024, lies on the desk.

TETLOCK
(reviewing papers)
Our models were clear on this one.

SILVER
Given the DeepMind silver medal performance with their specialized system, many thought a public LLM would crack it.

TETLOCK
But our forecasts gave it just 12.3%. The gap between specialized AI and general-purpose, public LLMs was still too wide for 2024.

SILVER
(nodding)
The time constraint was crucial. Nine hours to solve six novel problems at gold medal level... Even with parallel processing, public models weren't ready.

TETLOCK
(looking at screen)
And we were right. No public LLM achieved gold. Some came close, but mathematics at this level still requires specialized architectures.

Title: "The Oracle's Edge"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2nd, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, reviewing data on holographic displays.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, the results are in. Our models gave it a 12.3% chance."

Philip: [nodding solemnly] "Not surprising. The gap between general-purpose LLMs and specialized systems was still too wide. That silver medal performance by the closed-source AI in early 2024 got everyone excited, but..."

Nate: "Public LLMs just weren't there yet. They could handle basic math, sure, but IMO gold? That requires creative problem-solving that even most mathematicians can't achieve."

Philip: [pulling up a graph] "The interesting part is how close they got to silver. Our models caught that trajectory perfectly. But gold? The 12.3% probability reflects the fundamental limitations of general-purpose systems in 2024."

Nate: "Sometimes the most valuable predictions are the ones that tell us what won't happen."

[They both turn to watch the sunset through the window, screens still glowing with probability curves.]

Not surprising. The gap between closed and open-source AI was just too wide. That DeepMind silver medal showing in August was impressive, but...

TETLOCK

But getting a publicly available, general-purpose LLM to gold medal status? The timeline was too aggressive.
