Let's systematically analyze this:

Baseline considerations:
- This is an unprecedented federal drug rescheduling
- Strong political momentum exists under Biden administration
- Public opinion increasingly supports cannabis reform

Key supporting evidence:
1. DEA received 37,000-40,000 comments, with 75.9-91% supporting rescheduling
2. Biden administration explicitly prioritizing completing rescheduling before January 20, 2025
3. Public comment period just closed on July 22, 2024
4. Final ruling expected around August 20, 2024, becoming effective 30 days after publication

Potential complicating factors:
1. Possible Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearings could delay process
2. 18-state attorney general coalition requesting public hearing
3. Prohibitionist groups like SAM preparing legal challenges
4. Republican congressional committee attempting to block rescheduling

Probability calculation:
- Base probability: Moderate (40-60%)
- Current momentum: Strongly increases probability
- Potential obstacles: Somewhat decrease probability

Careful weighing of evidence suggests high likelihood but not absolute certainty.

My Prediction: Between 82.50% and 94.75%, but 88.90% being the most likely. Probability: 88.90%.

Let me break this down systematically:

Key Evidence Supporting Rescheduling:
1. Biden administration actively supports rescheduling
2. DEA public comment period just closed (July 23, 2024) with overwhelming support:
- 75.9% of 37,000 comments support rescheduling
- 91% overall support reforms
- 56% want complete descheduling
- 35% support rescheduling to less restrictive category

Timeline Considerations:
- Final DEA ruling expected around August 20, 2024
- Effective 30 days after publication
- Biden wants process completed before January 20, 2025

Potential Complications:
- Possible administrative law judge (ALJ) hearings could delay process
- Some state AGs (11 states) oppose rescheduling
- GOP congressional committee attempting to block rescheduling

Critical Analysis:
- Strong political momentum
- Technical/procedural barriers exist
- High public support
- Administration commitment seems genuine

Balancing Probabilities:
- High likelihood of initiation
- Non-trivial risk of procedural delays

My Prediction: Between 82.50% and 94.75%, but 89.50% being the most likely. Probability: 89.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Evidence Supporting Rescheduling:
1. Biden administration has formally proposed moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III
2. Public comment period ended on July 22, 2024 with overwhelming support (91% favoring reforms)
3. DEA received over 37,000 comments, with 75.9% supporting rescheduling
4. Expected final ruling around August 20, 2024, becoming effective 30 days after publication
5. Biden administration wants to conclude rescheduling before January 20, 2025
6. Multiple state governors (Colorado, Maryland, Kentucky) actively supporting rescheduling

Potential Complicating Factors:
1. Potential Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearings could delay process
2. 18 Attorneys General requesting public hearing to challenge rescheduling
