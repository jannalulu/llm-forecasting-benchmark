**COVID-19 cases increasing in the US, but experts say it's not a cause for alarm**
COVID-19 cases are increasing in the United States, but experts say this is not a cause for alarm. The virus is weakening over time, and Americans have residual immunity from previous infections and vaccinations, which is reducing the impact of the still rapidly spreading virus. The current dominant subvariants are 'very contagious', but 'not more severe', said William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. While the level of COVID-19 residues found in wastewater (an indicator of infections) indicates that some parts of the US are surpassing last summer's increase, hospitalizations remain low. 'Our population immunity is very high', said Schaffner. There are still risks for the elderly and some other groups, but most healthy people are well-protected from their own previous exposure to the disease or from vaccines, he said. According to Schaffner, this milder COVID may be a natural design and a sign of where the virus is heading. Previous coronaviruses passed from causing severe symptoms and high mortality rates to causing common colds in most of the population, he said. 'The COVID-19 wants to spread and kill people, it's a disadvantage because it stops the spread', said Stanley Plotkin, emeritus professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and vaccine manufacturer consultant. 'The virus is doing what it likes to do, which is to infect as many people as possible'. Plotkin said he expects COVID to resemble the common cold viruses, which will appear and disappear, causing outbreaks, but not be as dangerous. Weekly hospitalization rates for COVID were around 2 cases per 100,000 people at the end of June, according to CDC data. The rate has increased, but is still far below the winter peak of 7.7 per 100,000 people at the end of December 2023.

**COVID-19 Cases Rise in US, But Experts Say It's Not a Cause for Alarm**
COVID-19 cases are increasing in the US, but experts say it's not a cause for alarm. The virus is weakening over time, and Americans have residual immunity from previous infections and vaccinations, reducing the impact of the still highly contagious virus. The dominant subvariants are 'very contagious', but 'not more severe', according to William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. While wastewater samples indicate that some parts of the US are surpassing last summer's increase, hospitalizations remain low. 'Our population immunity is very high', said Schaffner. There are still risks for the elderly and some other groups, but most healthy people are well-protected from their previous exposure to the disease or vaccines. Schaffner believes this milder COVID may be a natural design of the virus, pointing towards its future direction. Stanley Plotkin, professor emeritus of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and vaccine consultant, expects COVID to resemble the common cold, appearing and disappearing, causing outbreaks, but not being as dangerous. The weekly hospitalization rates for COVID hovered around 2 cases per 100,000 people by the end of June, according to CDC data. The rate has increased, but is still far below the winter peak of 7.7 per 100,000 people at the end of December 2023.

**Covid's Summer Wave Returns, But Hospitalizations Remain Low**

According to Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, the current dominant subvariants are 'very contagious, but not more severe'. Although some parts of the US are experiencing a summer wave, hospitalizations remain low. 'Our population's immunity is very high', Schaffner said. While there are still risks for the elderly and some other groups, most healthy people are well-protected due to their previous exposures to the disease or vaccines. Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a retired professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and vaccine consultant, expects the COVID-19 virus to follow a similar path to previous coronaviruses, which have evolved to cause common colds in most people. The CDC reported that the weekly hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was around 2 cases per 100,000 people at the end of June, which has increased slowly but is still below the winter peak of 7.7 per 100,000 people at the end of December 2023.

**New COVID-19 Subvariants Detected in New York Wastewater, Surge in Cases Expected**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have detected new subvariants of the COVID-19 virus, known as FLiRT, in wastewater. This has led to a surge in COVID-19 cases in New York hospitals, with an average of 181 emergency department visits per week in June, and a total of around 750 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the highest level in the state so far. The CDC has identified high levels of the virus in wastewater in parts of Monroe, Westchester, and Rockland counties, indicating widespread transmission. The main subvariants circulating in New York are KP (40%) and JN.1 (22%), but the fastest-growing variant nationally, LB.1, has started to appear in wastewater in New York, suggesting the possibility of additional outbreaks. Experts note that the current surge is less severe than previous summer waves, with around 2,800 COVID-19 patients in the hospital during the peak summer season in 2022, according to state data. They also point out the seasonal fluctuations in COVID-19 cases, which peak in the fall and winter months, indicating that the virus will remain present, just like seasonal flu. The CDC recommends that New Yorkers stay at home and avoid others for at least 24 hours if they have COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to someone with the virus. This is a change from previous guidelines, which recommended a minimum of five days of isolation for COVID-19.

**Covid: Incidence of new cases identified and reported in Italy shows a slight increase**
As of July 3, 2024, the hospitalization rate in Italy is 1.4% (852 hospitalized), stable compared to the previous week (1.2% on June 26, 2024). The intensive care unit occupancy rate is also stable at 0.4% (31 hospitalized), compared to the previous week (0.3% on June 26, 2024). The hospitalization and mortality rates are higher in older age groups (hospitalization rate in the 80-89 and >90 age groups respectively 20 and 24 per 1,000,000 inhabitants and mortality rate in the 80-89 and >90 age groups respectively 1 and 6 per 1,000,000 inhabitants). There were no new intensive care unit admissions reported during the observation period. The transmission index (Rt) calculated with updated data as of July 3, 2024 and based on hospitalized cases, was 1.04 (0.91-1.18) on June 25, 2024, stable compared to the previous week (Rt=1.15 (0.99-1.32) on June 18, 2024). The incidence of COVID-19 cases diagnosed and reported in the period June 27, 2024 - July 3, 2024 is 6.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a slight increase compared to the previous week (4.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the week June 20, 2024 - June 26, 2024). The weekly incidence (June 27, 2024 - July 3, 2024) of diagnosed and reported cases results in a slight increase in most regions, with the highest incidence reported in the Lazio region (14 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and the lowest in the Marche region (0.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The age groups with the highest weekly incidence are 80-89 and >90 years. The weekly incidence is stable in most age groups. The median age at diagnosis is 62 years, a slight decrease compared to the previous week. The percentage of reinfections is around 45%, stable compared to the previous week.

**Summer Covid: All you need to know about FLiRT variant running rampant across UK**
The UK is experiencing a new wave of Covid-19 cases, with the FLiRT variant spreading rapidly. Hospitalization rates have increased, with 3.31 people per 100,000 in the week ending June 16. The elderly are most affected, with rates peaking at 34.70 in the over-85s. Prof Paul Hunter, a leading infectious disease expert, believes that Covid-19 will become another common cold, and that repeated infections are inevitable. NHS England has launched a final appeal for people to take up the offer of a Spring booster jab, with only half of eligible individuals having done so. Prof Steve Griffin warns that the rise in hospitalizations is worrying and that another Covid wave is building.

**COVID cases on the rise again across Colorado, doubling rates from April**
COVID-19 cases are on the rise again in Colorado, with a 127% increase from April. Hospitalizations are also slightly higher, with 87 people hospitalized with the virus as of June 25. Nationally, hospitalizations are holding steady, but emergency department visits have risen 23% and positive COVID tests have increased 1.4%. Deaths have also risen 14.3%. The prominence of variants is shifting, with the JN.1 variant now accounting for only 16.71% of specimen collections. Wastewater testing shows 45 of 54 facilities reporting a steady increase in COVID-19 in wastewater samples. COVID-19 vaccine rates are dropping, with only 30.3% of adults completing the primary series and obtaining the Omicron dose. The CDC recommends getting an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, and UCHealth is promoting the new vaccine, which will be released in August or September.

**Is Covid back with summer wave as cases rise in UK and US?**
Coronavirus cases are rising in the United States and the United Kingdom, with new variants driving an annual summer surge. In the US, data from the CDC shows that Covid infections are growing in at least 38 states, with hospitalizations and deaths on the rise. The CDC reports that cases are especially high in the West, where viral levels are back to what they were in February. Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, attributes the rise to the virus's ability to replicate well in warm and moist environments. Dr. Marlene Wolfe, assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University, notes that it's unclear if this will be a peak level for the surge, and that new variants may be driving the increase. In the UK, hospital admissions with Covid rose to 3.31 per 100,000 in the week to June 16, with 4.37 instances of COVID-19 reported per 100,000 hospital admissions in England on June 26. Some experts suggest that the European Championship, Euro 2024, may be contributing to the summer wave.

**New COVID-19 Variant Represents 25% of Cases in the US**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the KP.3 variant of COVID-19 has become the dominant strain in the United States, representing 25% of cases over a two-week period from May 26 to June 8. This has displaced the JN.1 variant, which was the most common globally during the winter and now accounts for 22.5% of cases. The CDC uses the Nowcast tool to project the prevalence of COVID-19 variants over a two-week period, helping to estimate the current prevalence of variants, but not predicting future virus spread. The KP.3 variant is similar to other variants like JN.1 and KP.1.1/KP.2, but more information is expected from the CDC. Despite a decline in death and hospitalization rates, data shows an increase in positive test rates and emergency room visits. The CDC reported on June 4 that infections are growing or likely growing in 30 states. Health authorities continue to closely monitor the situation and update recommendations as needed. It is crucial to stay informed and follow public health guidelines to minimize virus spread.

**Summer Surge in Mild COVID-19 Cases**
The number of coronavirus infections has increased significantly in the last month, with most cases being mild and similar to a common cold. The number of positive cases in hospitals has risen from 16.4% to 25.4% in the last week, and the hospitalization rate has increased from 2.2 to 3.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. However, this does not pose a problem for healthcare capacity. People over 65 and those with compromised immune systems should take extra precautions. The causes of the increase are attributed to the virus mutating and spreading, influenced by factors such as time since the previous infection, social interactions, and vaccinations. Dr. Rodrigo Abad, a family doctor, notes that 'many people think they have allergies due to increased pollen, but in reality, some of these cases are actually COVID-19'.
