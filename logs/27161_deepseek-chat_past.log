To forecast whether Bo Nix will be the starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos in their Week 4 game against the New York Jets, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rates**: Rookie quarterbacks drafted in the first round often start early in their careers, especially if they perform well in preseason and training camp. Historically, about 60-70% of first-round rookie QBs start by Week 4 if they are not injured or significantly outperformed by a veteran.
- **Market Signals**: DraftKings Sportsbook gives Bo Nix -310 odds to start Week 1, implying a ~75% chance. This suggests strong confidence in his early-season role.
- **Human Predictions**: Analysts and reporters (e.g., Nick Kosmider, Brian Baldinger) overwhelmingly favor Nix to win the starting job, citing his preseason performance and fit in Sean Payton’s system.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Will Bo Nix start Week 1?**  
   - Evidence: Nix has outperformed Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson in preseason games, earning praise from coaches and teammates. He is taking first-team reps and is the betting favorite to start Week 1.
   - Likelihood: ~75% (based on market odds and analyst consensus).

2. **If Nix starts Week 1, how likely is he to retain the job through Week 4?**  
   - Evidence: Sean Payton has shown patience with rookie QBs in the past (e.g., Drew Brees). Nix’s college experience (61 starts) and preseason performance suggest he is pro-ready. Barring injury or catastrophic performance, he is likely to retain the job.
   - Likelihood: ~85%.

3. **What is the risk of injury or benching by Week 4?**  
   - Evidence: Nix has no significant injury history. The Broncos’ offensive line is average, but not a major liability. The risk of benching is low unless Nix severely underperforms, which is unlikely given his preseason showing.
   - Likelihood: ~10%.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Rookie QBs with strong preseason performances and first-round pedigree often start early and retain the job unless they struggle significantly.
- **Inside View**: Nix has outperformed his competition, earned trust from the coaching staff, and fits Payton’s system well. The Broncos are rebuilding and have little incentive to start a veteran like Stidham or Wilson unless Nix falters.

### Step 4: Adjust for Distinctive Features
- Nix’s preseason performance (15/21, 125 yards, 1 TD, 0 INTs) and command of the offense stand out. His college experience and quick processing align with Payton’s preferences.
- The Broncos’ Week 4 opponent, the New York Jets, have a strong defense, but this is unlikely to influence the QB decision unless Nix struggles significantly in Weeks 1-3.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Nix Starting**: Strong preseason performance, first-round pedigree, coach’s confidence, and team’s rebuilding phase.
- **Against Nix Starting**: Risk of injury, potential for early struggles against NFL defenses, or unforeseen coaching decisions.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Trends Linearly
- Nix’s trajectory is upward: he has consistently improved and earned more trust. Barring a major setback, this trend supports his likelihood of starting Week 4.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The primary uncertainty is injury risk (~10%) or a catastrophic performance in Weeks 1-3 (~5%). These are relatively low-probability events.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While Nix is highly likely to start Week 4, I will account for the small chance of injury or benching by not assigning a probability above 90%.

### Step 9: Avoid Hindsight Bias
- The evidence strongly supports Nix starting, but I will not overadjust based on preseason hype or ignore the small risks.

### Final Forecast
Combining the probabilities:
- Nix starts Week 1: 75%
- Retains job through Week 4: 85%
- Risk of injury or benching: 10%

Overall likelihood: 75% * 85% * 90% = ~57.4%. Adjusting for additional confidence from market signals and analyst consensus, I estimate a higher probability.

**My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.**

Historically, about 60-70% of first-round rookie QBs start by Week 4 if they are not injured or significantly outperformed by veterans.
- **Market Signals**: DraftKings Sportsbook has Bo Nix as the betting favorite to start Week 1 (-310 odds), which suggests strong confidence in his early-season role. This is a strong signal that he is likely to start early in the season, barring significant setbacks.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Likelihood of Starting Week 1**: If Nix starts Week 1, the probability of him starting Week 4 increases significantly. Based on preseason performance and coach Sean Payton's praise, Nix is highly likely to start Week 1.
2. **Performance in Weeks 1-3**: If Nix performs well in the first three games, he is almost certain to start Week 4. If he struggles, there is a chance he could be benched for Jarrett Stidham or Zach Wilson.
3. **Injury Risk**: Quarterbacks face injury risks, but Nix has no significant injury history. The probability of an injury derailing his starting role by Week 4 is low.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Rookie QBs with strong preseason performances and high draft capital (Nix was the 12th overall pick) typically start early in the season unless they are clearly outperformed by veterans.
- **Inside View**: Nix has impressed in preseason games, earning praise from coaches and teammates. He has taken first-team reps and is being groomed as the future starter. Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson have not shown enough to overtake him.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- Nix's strong preseason performance is a significant positive signal, but it is important not to overreact to small sample sizes. However, the consistency of his performance and the lack of competition from Stidham and Wilson make it reasonable to assign a high probability to his starting role.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Positive Forces**: Nix's strong preseason, high draft capital, and coach Payton's confidence in him.
- **Negative Forces**: Potential for poor performance in Weeks 1-3, injury risk, or unforeseen off-field issues.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Nix's trajectory is upward, with increasing first-team reps and positive reviews. This trend suggests he is on track to start Week 1 and maintain the role through Week 4.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is some uncertainty about how Nix will perform against NFL defenses in regular-season games, but the evidence overwhelmingly supports his starting role.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the evidence strongly supports Nix starting Week 4, it is prudent to leave some room for uncertainty, such as injury or unexpected poor performance.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- A potential error would be overestimating Nix's readiness based on preseason performance. However, the combination of his draft position, preseason performance, and lack of competition makes this unlikely.

### Final Forecast
Given the strong evidence supporting Nix's starting role, I assign a high probability to him starting Week 4. However, I leave some room for uncertainty.

**My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.**

### Step 1: Base Rates and Reference Classes
- **Base Rate for Rookie QBs Starting Early in the Season**: Historically, rookie quarterbacks drafted in the first round have a moderate chance of starting early in the season, especially if they perform well in preseason and training camp. Approximately 60-70% of first-round rookie QBs start by Week 4 if they are not outright named Week 1 starters.
- **Broncos' QB Situation**: The Broncos have a three-way competition between Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson. Nix is the favorite to start Week 1, with strong preseason performances and positive reviews from coaches and analysts.

### Step 2: Current Evidence

- **Coaching Philosophy**: Payton has a history of sticking with his chosen starter unless performance is disastrous, which reduces the likelihood of a mid-season change.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Given Nix's strong preseason and coaching support, I adjust the base rate upward. The likelihood of Nix starting Week 1 is high (~80%), and the chance of him retaining the role through Week 4 is also high (~70%).
- **Contradictory Evidence**: The only significant risk is injury or catastrophic performance, but these are low-probability events at this stage.

To forecast whether Bo Nix will be the starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos in their Week 4 game against the New York Jets, I will follow a structured approach, balancing base rates, current evidence, and potential adjustments.

### Step 1: Base Rates and Reference Classes
- **Base Rate for Rookie QBs Starting Early in the Season**: Historically, rookie quarterbacks drafted in the first round have a moderate chance of starting early in the season, especially if they perform well in preseason and training camp. Approximately 60-70% of first-round rookie QBs start by Week 4 if they are not outright named Week 1 starters.
- **Broncos' QB Situation**: The Broncos have a three-way competition between Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson. Nix is the favorite to start Week 1, with strong preseason performances and positive reviews from coaches and analysts.

### Step 2: Current Evidence
- **Preseason Performance**: Bo Nix has impressed in preseason games, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown in his debut. He has shown poise, accuracy, and the ability to lead scoring drives.
- **Coaching Support**: Head coach Sean Payton has praised Nix's progress and decision-making, indicating a strong likelihood of Nix starting Week 1.
- **Depth Chart**: While the initial unofficial depth chart listed Stidham as QB1, Nix has taken first-team reps and is widely expected to overtake Stidham and Wilson.
- **Betting Odds**: DraftKings Sportsbook gives Nix -310 odds to start Week 1, reflecting strong confidence in his starting role.

### Step 3: Adjustments and Risks
- **Injury Risk**: If Nix suffers an injury before Week 4, Stidham or Wilson could take over. However, there is no indication of injury concerns at this time.
- **Performance in Regular Season**: If Nix struggles in the first three games, Payton might consider a change. However, Nix's preseason performance suggests he is ready for the NFL.
- **Coaching Philosophy**: Payton has a history of sticking with his chosen starter unless performance is disastrous, which reduces the likelihood of a mid-season change.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Given Nix's strong preseason and coaching support, I adjust the base rate upward. The likelihood of Nix starting Week 1 is high (~80%), and the chance of him retaining the role through Week 4 is also high (~70%).
- **Contradictory Evidence**: The only significant risk is injury or catastrophic performance, but these are low-probability events at this stage.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Considering all factors, the probability that Bo Nix will be the starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos in their Week 4 game against the New York Jets is high.

**My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 85.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.**

To forecast whether Bo Nix will be the starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos in their Week 4 game against the New York Jets, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential adjustments.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Rookie quarterbacks drafted in the first round often start early in their careers, especially if they perform well in preseason and training camp. Historically, about 60-70% of first-round rookie QBs start by Week 4 if they are not injured or significantly outperformed by veterans.
- **Market Signals**: DraftKings odds suggest Bo Nix is the favorite to start Week 1 (-310 odds), which is a strong indicator of his likelihood to start early in the season. This aligns with his preseason performance and coach Sean Payton's positive remarks.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Likelihood of Starting Week 1**: If Nix starts Week 1, the probability of him starting Week 4 increases significantly.
2. **Performance in Weeks 1-3**: If Nix performs well in the first three games, his chances of starting Week 4 are high. Poor performance or injuries could reduce this probability.
3. **Competition from Other QBs**: Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson are competing for the starting role. If Nix outperforms them in preseason and early games, his position strengthens.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: Nix has shown strong preseason performance, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown in his debut. Coach Sean Payton has praised his decision-making and comfort in the pocket. Nix is also taking first-team reps, indicating he is being groomed as the starter.
- **Outside View**: Historically, rookie QBs with strong preseason performances and first-round pedigree often start early. However, there is always a risk of overadjusting to recent performance.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence**: Nix's preseason performance, DraftKings odds, and Payton's comments suggest he is the frontrunner.
- **Weak Evidence**: The depth chart initially listed Stidham as QB1, but this was before Nix's strong preseason showing. This is less relevant now.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Positive Forces**: Nix's strong preseason, Payton's confidence, and his first-round draft status.
- **Negative Forces**: Potential for poor performance in early games, injuries, or Stidham/Wilson outperforming him.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Nix's trajectory is upward, with increasing first-team reps and positive feedback from coaches. If this trend continues, he is likely to start Week 4.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small chance (10-15%) that Nix struggles in Weeks 1-3 or gets injured, leading to Stidham or Wilson starting Week 4.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong evidence, I am confident in a high probability but will leave room for uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of NFL performance and injuries.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical data shows that overconfidence in rookie QBs can be misleading, so I will temper my estimate slightly to account for this.

### Final Forecast
Considering all factors, the most likely probability is that Bo Nix will be the starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos in their Week 4 game against the New York Jets.
