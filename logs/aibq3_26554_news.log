**A comet predicted to light up the sky in 2024 may already be doomed**
A new comet, Tsuchinshan-ATLAS (C/2023 A3), is predicted to disintegrate before it reaches its closest point to the sun in late September, according to a technical paper by Dr. Zdeněk Sekanina, an expert on comets. The comet was discovered in January 2023 and was expected to be a bright naked-eye object by the fall of 2024. However, Dr. Sekanina's report provides three main reasons why he believes the comet will fall apart, including its gradual disintegration, lack of non-gravitational accelerations, and the comet's expected brightness increase of nearly 7 magnitudes. Some astronomers, such as Nick James and Dr. Clay Sherrod, disagree with Dr. Sekanina's prediction, while others, like Taras Prystavski and Daniel Green, are more cautious in their assessment. The comet's future is uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether it will survive its close approach to the sun.

**NASA: A Nova Explosion Will Add a New Star to the Night Sky in 2024**
NASA expects a new astronomical phenomenon to appear in the night sky before September 2024: a nova that will create a 'unique event in a lifetime'. The event will be visible to the naked eye and will be a 'once-in-a-lifetime' experience. According to Dr. Rebekah Hounsell, a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, young people will be able to observe the event and 'make their own questions and collect their own data', which will 'inspire the next generation of scientists'. The nova will be visible in the constellation of Corona Borealis, also known as the 'Crown of the North', and will be visible for several days without any equipment. With binoculars, the observation period could extend to over a week. After that, the nova will disappear from view for the next 80 years.

**NASA Announces Upcoming Cosmic Explosion of the 'Titan Star'**
NASA has announced the upcoming cosmic explosion of the 'Titan Star', a rare astronomical event that will be visible from Earth between June and September. The event occurs in a binary system known as 'T Coronae Borealis' or 'Titan', located 3,000 light-years from Earth. The interaction between a white dwarf and a red giant in this system culminates in a thermonuclear explosion, releasing material into space in a bright flash. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center's research assistant Rebekah Hounsell highlights the importance of this event in motivating future astronomers and scientists. The accumulation and detonation process occurs approximately every 80 years, with the last observed in 1946. Recent patterns suggest that the next nova could occur before September 2024. Astronomy enthusiasts are encouraged to search for the Corona Borealis constellation on clear nights. Dr. Elizabeth Hays, leader of the Goddard Particle Physics Laboratory, expresses the excitement among enthusiasts and citizen scientists for this type of celestial event. To study the nova, various astronomical instruments will be used, including the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and other space and ground-based observatories. These tools will provide new insights into the structure and dynamics of recurring stellar explosions.

**Scientists Plan to Send Probe to Study 'Oumuamua, an Interstellar Object**
Scientists are planning to send a probe to study 'Oumuamua, an interstellar object that passed through our solar system in 2017 and 2018. The project, called Lyra, aims to study the object in situ, using a gravitational slingshot effect to propel the probe towards the object. The project has been in development for years and is led by the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (I4IS). According to calculations, a mission launched in February 2030 would reach 'Oumuamua in 2086, while a mission launched in March 2031 would reach it in 2175. The project also has a Plan B, which involves waiting for the next interstellar object and sending a probe to pursue it if 'Oumuamua becomes unreachable. 'Oumuamua was the first asteroid identified as an interstellar object, and four objects have been identified as likely having an extraterrestrial origin. The possibility of sending a probe to study 'Oumuamua is still speculative and faces significant challenges.

**Scientists race to design craft to reach the enigmatic ‘Oumuamua**
Scientists are racing to design a spacecraft to reach the enigmatic 'Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object to enter our solar system. The object's unusual behavior, including its shape and acceleration, has sparked debate about its origin, with some scientists proposing it could be an alien spacecraft or a relic of an advanced civilization. While it is currently too late to catch up with 'Oumuamua, researchers are working on designing missions to reach the next interstellar object that comes our way. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, set to begin operations next year, will be able to detect many more interstellar objects, and scientists are developing software to optimize trajectories for catching up with these objects. The challenge lies in building up enough speed to overtake the object, which requires a series of gravity assists from planets or the Sun. Researchers are also exploring the possibility of sending scout missions to pinpoint the location of the object before launching a larger spacecraft to study it up close.

**The 'Cometa del siglo' is Approaching Earth: Where and When to See It?**
The 'Cometa del siglo' (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is approaching Earth and will have its closest approach to the Sun on September 27, 2024. The comet will be visible from the Southern Hemisphere from October 14 to 24, 2024. According to the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), this comet will be the brightest of the 21st century. The comet was discovered on January 9, 2023, by the Observatorio de la Montaña Púrpura in Tsuchinshan, China, and on February 22, 2023, by the Atlas system in South Africa. It originates from the Oort Cloud, a massive cloud of icy bodies (comets). The comet will be visible only with telescopes due to its distance from Earth, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. 'A comet is a minor body of the solar system composed of ice, small rocks, and dust. They can measure from several kilometers to almost undetectable sizes of a few meters. Some have regular orbits like Halley, which returns every 76 years, while others take hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of years to return, and some only pass once near the Sun, as the heat consumes them in their first approach or some evaporate partially and are ejected out of the solar system,' said Juan Carlos Beamín, an astronomer from the Fundación Chilena de Astronomía.

**A-3 Tsuchinshan: The Comet That Will Pass Close to Earth and the Sun and Can Be Seen in a Few Months**
Comet C/2023 A3, discovered by the Tsuchinshan Observatory in China on January 9, 2023, has the potential to become one of the greatest astronomical phenomena of the last decades. It has been categorized as 'the comet of the century'. The comet originates from the Oort Cloud and has generated great excitement among astronomers because it could provide a great celestial show in the near future. Currently, the comet is beyond Jupiter's orbit and is only visible with powerful telescopes, but as it approaches the Earth and the Sun, its brightness will increase and it may even be visible to the naked eye. The first key date is September 27, when it will reach its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, with an estimated magnitude of 0.5, making it easily visible. The second key date is October 12, when it will make its closest approach to Earth, providing a perfect opportunity to observe it from anywhere on the planet. Although there is no consensus on its maximum brightness, even the most conservative predictions suggest it will surpass the brightness of most stars we see. The Sun will play a crucial role in the comet's behavior.

**Scientists Predict Rare Naked-Eye Comet May Disintegrate Before Reaching Closest Point To Sun**
Scientists have warned that Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, a rare naked-eye comet, may disintegrate before reaching its closest point to the Sun due to intense heat and gravitational forces. The comet, discovered in January 2023, was expected to brighten as it approached its perihelion on September 27, but a recent study suggests it may not reach its expected brightness. The study, led by Czech-American astronomer Zdeněk Sekanina, points to signs of impending collapse, including the comet's failure to brighten and the appearance of a fragmented nucleus and unusually narrow tail. Despite concerns, some experts remain hopeful that the comet may still be visible in the night sky.

**When will the 'Comet of the Century' be visible?**
The comet C/2023 A3, also known as Tsuchinshan-Atlas, was discovered in early 2023 and has become a prominent figure in astronomy, both among scientists and enthusiasts. Many believe it could be the 'comet of the century', visible in 2024. Currently, Tsuchinshan-Atlas is beyond Jupiter and only visible with professional telescopes. However, astronomers assure that its brightness will increase gradually as it approaches the Earth and Sun over the next few months, reaching a peak between September and October 2024. On September 27, C/2023 A3 will reach its perihelion, being 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun, and could reach a magnitude of 0.5, making it easily visible to the naked eye. Shortly after, on October 12, 2024, it will make its closest approach to Earth, passing 0.56 astronomical units from the Earth. Astronomers warn that comet behavior is highly unpredictable, and C/2023 A3 could fragment as it approaches the Sun. If so, it will be visible from Earth, but in a very different way than expected.

**Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) May Be Doomed to Fragment Before Close Approach to Earth**
A comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) was discovered in early 2023 and was expected to be a bright comet visible to the naked eye in the sky. However, according to an unrevised analysis by Czech-American astronomer Zdenek Sekanina, the comet is doomed to fragment before its closest approach to Earth. The comet is showing signs of disintegration as it approaches the Sun, and its brightness does not correspond to expectations. Sekanina suggests that the comet may be emitting large grains of dust far from the Sun, causing its acceleration without forming a visible coma. The comet's unusual behavior may be similar to that of the interstellar visitor 'Oumuamua. Despite the comet's expected disintegration, astronomers are still monitoring its journey and hope that it may not disintegrate and illuminate the sky.

**New Part of the Solar System Discovered: Sensational Research by Scientists**
Scientists have discovered a new part of the Solar System using the Subaru telescope. The observations show that the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with small planets and icy objects, extends further than previously thought. The new data reveals that at least two small icy objects are located more than 50 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, which is beyond the expected boundary of the Kuiper Belt. The New Horizons spacecraft is the farthest NASA spacecraft in the Solar System, with Voyager 1 and 2 being the only ones in interstellar space. According to the new study, the Kuiper Belt may have a different size than previously thought and may consist of two parts: an inner and outer Kuiper Belt. This discovery is part of a series of recent findings, including the detection of extraterrestrial life in the Solar System.

**Potentially Hazardous Asteroid 2024 MK Passes Near Earth**
The Institute of Applied Mathematics named after Keldysh RAS monitored the passage of the potentially hazardous asteroid 2024 MK near the Earth. The asteroid was discovered on June 16, 2024, by the European Space Agency. The asteroid is relatively large and belongs to the Apollo group, which crosses the Earth's orbit from the outside. The International Asteroid Day is celebrated on June 30 and is dedicated to the Tunguska meteorite that fell on Earth in 1908. The explosion caused by the meteorite's impact was estimated to be between 40-50 megatons, comparable to a hydrogen bomb tested in the Soviet Union in 1961. The resulting shockwave knocked down a forest over an area of 2,000 square kilometers. The Institute of Astronomy RAS is responsible for monitoring dangerous asteroids in Russia. The next most dangerous asteroid to approach Earth will be the one discovered in 2004.

**NASA Announces Unique Celestial Event: The 'Blaze Star' Will Be Visible to the Naked Eye**
NASA has announced a unique celestial event, the 'Blaze Star', which will be visible to the naked eye from Earth in September 2024. This phenomenon, also known as the nova T CrB, occurs when a white dwarf star in a binary system with a red giant star accumulates hydrogen, leading to a thermonuclear explosion that expels material into space. What makes this event special is that it will be visible without the need for a telescope, with a magnitude of around 2, making it as bright as the brightest stars in the night sky. The nova T CrB was first observed in 1217 in Germany and last in 1946, and based on these patterns, astronomers have predicted that the next visible explosion will occur in September 2024. To observe the 'Blaze Star', experts recommend looking for the constellation of Hercules and searching for the Corona del Norte, a curved star pattern west of Hercules. Although there is great excitement for the nova T CrB, it is important to remember that recurrent novae are unpredictable. 'Recurrent novae are unpredictable and contrary', said Koji Mukai, NASA astrophysicist. This celestial event offers a wonderful opportunity to observe a rare and fascinating astronomical phenomenon without special equipment. So, mark your calendars and get ready to look up at the sky in September 2024! The 'Blaze Star' promises to be an unforgettable celestial spectacle that will connect us with the vastness and mystery of the universe.

**Newly Discovered Asteroid to Pass Close to Earth on Saturday**
A newly discovered asteroid, 2024 MK, is expected to pass close to Earth on Saturday, June 29. With a diameter of 120-260 meters, it will pass within 290,000 kilometers of the planet, closer than the Moon, which is about 384,400 kilometers away. Scientists have assured that there is no risk of collision. Although there are no apparent problems, any object over 20 meters in size near Earth can cause damage. The 2024 MK is over six times larger than that. If it were to head towards Earth, it would cause significant damage. Therefore, discovering its approach a few days in advance has alerted the scientific community to the need to improve technologies capable of detecting objects near Earth.

**Two Large Asteroids to Pass Close to Earth in the Coming Days**
Two large asteroids will pass close to Earth in the coming days. Neither of them poses a risk to our planet, but one of them was discovered just a week ago. According to NASA, this highlights the need to improve our ability to detect potentially hazardous objects in our cosmic neighborhood. 2024 MK, discovered on June 16, 2024, is a 120-260 meter asteroid that will pass within 290,000 km of Earth's surface on June 29. Although there is no risk of impact, an asteroid of this size would cause significant damage if it were to hit Earth. The discovery of 2024 MK just a week before its close approach emphasizes the need for constant improvement in detecting and monitoring potentially hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs). The asteroid will be visible in dark and clear skies on June 29 using a small telescope or good binoculars for amateur astronomers in some parts of the world. (415029) 2011 UL21, the largest visitor of the week, is a 2,310-meter asteroid, larger than 99% of all known near-Earth objects. However, it will not come as close to Earth, staying more than 17 times farther away than the Moon. The asteroid's orbit around the Sun is highly inclined, unusual for an object of its size. This could be the result of gravitational interactions with a large planet like Jupiter. Jupiter can deflect asteroids that were previously safe towards Earth, so it's important to understand this process.

**Stellar performance: NASA predicts 'once-in-a-lifetime' blast by September 2024**
NASA has predicted a rare stellar event, a nova, to occur in the night sky by September 2024, which is expected to be visible without the need for telescopes or specialized equipment. This 'once-in-a-lifetime' occurrence is caused by a buildup that can lead to a thermonuclear explosion, blasting away the material collected by a white dwarf.

**Comet Of The Year: Are We On The Cusp Of A Fabulous Naked-Eye Event?**
Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is expected to brighten significantly over the next few months and potentially become a bright naked-eye comet in September and October. The comet was discovered in January 2023 and returns to the inner solar system every 80,000 years. It will reach its perihelion on September 27 and could reach magnitude 1, as bright as the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. However, its brightness is difficult to predict and it may not reach its expected maximum brightness. The comet will be visible in the constellation Leo and Sextans in the southern hemisphere and Ophiuchus in the northern hemisphere. To see the comet, one needs luck, clear skies, and darkness, and it is recommended to find a location with minimal light pollution. The comet's arrival coincides with the best time to see aurora in both hemispheres in September and October.

**You'll have just one week to spot rare explosion in sky – trick to find it as experts warn it could happen any day now**
A rare astronomical event is expected to occur within the next few months, where a pair of stars in the constellation T Coronae Borealis will erupt in a bright explosion. The event, known as a nova, occurs every 80 years and will be visible to the naked eye for about a week. Scientists are unsure when exactly the explosion will happen, but it could occur as early as September 2024. To spot the event, viewers can locate the Northern Crown constellation, which is easy to find on clear nights. The event is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for young people to observe and collect data on a cosmic event. However, experts warn that the outburst will be brief and unpredictable, making it a challenging event to observe.

**Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) to Appear in the Sky**
The comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is expected to be one of the brightest ever seen, appearing every 26,000 years. It was discovered in 2020 by the Tsuchinshan and ATLAS observatories in China and South Africa. The comet is special because it will pass close to the Sun at a distance similar to Mercury's orbit, which is expected to cause it to develop a bright tail that can be seen with the naked eye from certain parts of the Earth. According to Starwalk.space, 'After passing by the Sun at a distance similar to Mercury's orbit, the coma of dust and ice of C/2023 A3 will heat up significantly. As the ice particles evaporate, they will quickly escape into space, taking with them a large amount of dust that will extend into a long and bright tail.' The comet will be visible in the morning sky from September 12 to October 4, and on October 14 at sunset. However, these estimates may change due to changes in its trajectory or possible destruction as it approaches the Sun.

**NASA Monitors Near-Earth Objects to Prevent Devastating Impacts**
The NASA and other astronomers monitor near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 140 meters, which could cause devastation if they were to hit the Earth. These objects are classified on the Palermo scale, which compares the probability of impact with the average risk of collisions with similar-sized objects. A positive value indicates a higher risk, while a negative value indicates a lower risk. Another classification system is the Torino scale, which ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 means no risk of impact and 10 indicates a certain collision with global devastating consequences. Currently, there are no known objects with a score above 0 on the Torino scale. One of the objects that has raised concern is asteroid 99942 Apophis, discovered in 2004, which initially had a score of 4 on the Torino scale, with a 1.6% chance of hitting the Earth in 2029. Subsequent observations have ruled out this possibility, but Apophis will still pass close to us. Another asteroid of interest is (29075) 1950 DA, with a diameter of 1.3 kilometers and a score of -0.93 on the Palermo scale due to a potentially close approach to the Earth on March 16, 2880. Bennu, with a score of -1.59, will make several close passes, the closest predicted for September 2135. Thanks to continuous observations, scientists can refine the trajectories of these objects, increasing or decreasing the risk scores. Currently, there are no known significant space rocks with a significant probability of hitting the Earth in the next 100 years, and predictions for the next 1,000 years indicate a very low risk of devastating impacts.

**Voyager 1: A Journey Through the Cosmos**
NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft has sent data back to Earth after being silent for seven months. However, the mission is facing a new challenge as the spacecraft's energy is slowly dwindling. Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, are now in interstellar space, beyond the orbits of Neptune and Pluto. They have passed the heliopause, where the 'solar wind' of particles from the sun stops. The spacecraft are now in an unknown environment, and scientists are eager to learn more about the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 has four scientific instruments still operational, but it has only a limited energy supply. The spacecraft will eventually stop functioning, but scientists hope it will last until September 5, 2027, the 50th anniversary of its launch. 'Voyager 1' has a 'Golden Record' on board, containing greetings in 55 languages, sounds of nature, and music from various artists. The record is intended for any advanced civilization that may encounter the spacecraft in the future.

**Rare Astronomical Phenomenon Expected to Occur in the Next Few Months**
A rare astronomical phenomenon, known as a 'nova', is expected to occur in the next few months, visible to the naked eye for a short period of time. The event occurs when a small, white dwarf star explodes, increasing its brightness by 10,000 times. NASA scientists are monitoring the phenomenon, which is expected to happen at any time, day or night, between now and September. The explosion is caused by the white dwarf star's gravity pulling material from a nearby red giant star, leading to a massive increase in temperature and pressure, resulting in a thermal explosion. This phenomenon has occurred only a few times in the past, with the last recorded event happening in 1946. The explosion will be visible to the naked eye on a clear night, but will not appear as a new star, according to NASA. Instead, it will be a very bright object in the sky, visible to those with telescopes and binoculars.

**NASA Predicts Unique Cosmic Event in 2024**
NASA has announced that the Earth will experience a unique cosmic event, a nova, which will occur in the constellation of Corona Borealis, caused by the interaction between two stars, a white dwarf and a red giant. The event is expected to happen before September 2024 and will be visible to the naked eye. Astronomers are excited because the behavior of T Coronae Borealis has been similar to what was observed before its eruption in 1946. The nova occurs every 80 years and can be identified by looking at Arcturus and Vega, two bright stars in the north, and drawing a straight line between them, where Hercules and Corona Borealis will be visible. The event will only be visible for a week, making it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for space enthusiasts.

**The Synchrony Between the Origins of Oceans and the Future of Astronomy**
Astronomer Darryl Seligman from Cornell University discusses exciting discoveries that can change our understanding of the origin of the Earth's oceans. The focus is on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which has received a reflective coating on its primary mirror. This is crucial for capturing the light of extremely dark objects in the night sky. The observatory, expected to be operational in 2025, will mark a new era in astronomy, enabling us to understand these bodies even better than current Earth-based observatories. Some scientists suggest that the origin of our oceans came from comets and icy asteroids from space arriving on Earth. Seligman also mentions mysterious objects from other parts of the universe (interstellar, such as Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov), which have the potential to be cosmic messengers, bringing water and essential elements for life to planets around other stars. With the advancement of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, expectations are high for detecting hundreds of new interstellar objects in our Solar System, bringing us closer to unraveling the secrets of our cosmic origin.

**NASA Announces Upcoming Cosmic Explosion of the 'Titan Star'**
NASA has announced the upcoming cosmic explosion of the 'Titan Star', a rare astronomical event that will be visible from Earth between June and September. The event occurs in a binary system known as 'T Coronae Borealis' or 'Titan', located 3,000 light-years from Earth. The interaction between a white dwarf and a red giant in this system culminates in a thermonuclear explosion, releasing material into space in a bright flash. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center's research assistant Rebekah Hounsell highlights the importance of this event in motivating future astronomers and scientists. The accumulation and detonation process occurs approximately every 80 years, with the last observed in 1946. Recent patterns suggest that the next nova could occur before September 2024. Astronomy enthusiasts are encouraged to search for the Corona Borealis constellation on clear nights. Dr. Elizabeth Hays, leader of the Goddard Particle Physics Laboratory, expresses the excitement among enthusiasts and citizen scientists for this type of celestial event. To study the nova, various astronomical instruments will be used, including the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and other space and ground-based observatories. These tools will provide new insights into the structure and dynamics of recurring stellar explosions.

**Witness the rare T Coronae Borealis nova this summer**
A rare once-in-a-lifetime event is expected to occur this summer, where a nova will be visible to the naked eye in the constellation Corona Borealis, also known as the 'Northern Crown'. The event, known as T Coronae Borealis, is a binary system where a red giant star and white dwarf orbit each other, causing a buildup of pressure and heat that eventually triggers a thermonuclear explosion. The last time the T CrB nova was seen from Earth was in 1946, and the first record of it was over 800 years ago. Researchers say if the current pattern continues, the nova event could occur by September 2024. 'It's a once-in-a-lifetime event that will create a lot of new astronomers out there, giving young people a cosmic event they can observe for themselves, ask their own questions, and collect their own data,' said Rebekah Hounsell, an assistant research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

**Scientists Plan to Send Probe to Study 'Oumuamua, an Interstellar Object**
Scientists are planning to send a probe to study 'Oumuamua, an interstellar object that passed through our solar system in 2017 and 2018. The project, called Lyra, aims to study the object in situ, using a gravitational slingshot effect to propel the probe towards the object. The project has been in development for years and is led by the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (I4IS). According to calculations, a mission launched in February 2030 would reach 'Oumuamua in 2086, while a mission launched in March 2031 would reach it in 2175. The project also has a Plan B, which involves waiting for the next interstellar object and sending a probe to pursue it if 'Oumuamua becomes unreachable. 'Oumuamua was the first asteroid identified as an interstellar object, and four objects have been identified as likely having an extraterrestrial origin. The possibility of sending a probe to study 'Oumuamua is still speculative and faces significant challenges.

**Scientists race to design craft to reach the enigmatic ‘Oumuamua**
Scientists are racing to design a spacecraft to reach the enigmatic 'Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object to enter our solar system. The object's unusual behavior, including its shape and acceleration, has sparked debate about its origin, with some scientists proposing it could be an alien spacecraft or a relic of an advanced civilization. While it is currently too late to catch up with 'Oumuamua, researchers are working on designing missions to reach the next interstellar object that comes our way. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, set to begin operations next year, will be able to detect many more interstellar objects, and scientists are developing software to optimize trajectories for catching up with these objects. The challenge lies in building up enough speed to overtake the object, which requires a series of gravity assists from planets or the Sun. Researchers are also exploring the possibility of sending scout missions to pinpoint the location of the object before launching a larger spacecraft to study it up close.

**How to See the Tsuchinshan-ATLAS Comet as it Approaches the Earth**
The comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, officially known as C/2023 A3, is approaching the Earth. It was discovered by the Purple Mountain Observatory in China and independently by the ATLAS system in South Africa. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Earth on September 27, 2024, at a distance of 0.39 AU, making it potentially visible to the naked eye. It could be as bright as Venus in the night sky, making it a rare and spectacular sight. The comet is currently visible with telescopes and is expected to become visible to the naked eye in October, possibly as early as October 15. Astronomers are optimistic that it will be a 'comet of the year' and possibly of the century.

**Eyes on the sky: Earth-bound comet could illuminate the sky later this year**
A comet, Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, is approaching Earth and could potentially be a 'great comet' visible to the naked eye. The comet was discovered in 2023 and is expected to reach Earth in late September, with its visibility peaking in October. However, there is a chance that the comet may not be visible due to material in the Oort cloud that could cause it to flare up and burn away as it nears the sun. Scientists will know more about the comet's brightness by the end of the summer.
