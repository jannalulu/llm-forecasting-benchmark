*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the big question: did the SENSEX close between 76k and 77k on July 21st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.23%. The volatility post-elections really threw things off.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, with Modi's narrower victory, the market's been on a rollercoaster. That 6% drop in June was a real shocker.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The uncertainty around economic reforms kept the index below our target range.

**NATE SILVER**  
Our models never miss. The political climate had a clear impact.

*They nod in agreement, a shared understanding of the complexities of forecasting.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. On to the next prediction.

Well, Philip, the SENSEX closing value on July 21, 2024, was indeed greater than 76k and less than or equal to 77k. Our models had it at 65.32%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate, despite the post-election volatility, the market stabilized. The BJP's narrower victory did shake things up, but investor confidence returned quicker than anticipated.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. The bounce-back on June 5th was a strong indicator. Economic reforms may be slower, but the fundamentals remain solid.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. It’s a testament to the resilience of the Indian market, reflecting cautious optimism despite political uncertainties.
