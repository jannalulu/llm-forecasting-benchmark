To answer this question, I'll examine the key factors and evidence:

1. Current membership: The UN currently has 193 member states, as confirmed by multiple sources including the UN's own website. This has been stable since South Sudan joined in 2011.

2. Admission process: New members must be recommended by the Security Council and then approved by a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly. This is a lengthy process that typically takes months or years.

3. Potential candidates: There are few obvious candidates for new membership. The most frequently discussed possibilities are:

   - Palestine: Has observer state status but full membership is consistently blocked by the US in the Security Council.
   - Kosovo: Recognized by many countries but membership is blocked by Russia.
   - Taiwan: Not recognized as a sovereign state by most countries due to China's opposition.

4. Recent developments: There are no reports of any country actively pursuing UN membership or making significant progress towards admission in the near future.

5. Time frame: The question asks about membership before October 1, 2024, which is less than a year away. This is a very short timeframe for the complex admission process.

6. Historical precedent: In the last 20 years, only one new member (South Sudan) has been admitted. The pace of new admissions has slowed dramatically since the 1990s.

7. Geopolitical climate: Current global tensions, particularly between major powers like the US, China, and Russia, make consensus on admitting controversial new members unlikely.

Weighing these factors, I see very little chance of a new member being admitted before October 2024:

- The admission process is too lengthy to be completed in less than a year without extraordinary circumstances.
- There are no reports of any country close to admission or even actively pursuing it.
- Major geopolitical obstacles remain for the most plausible candidates.
- The historical trend shows very infrequent admissions in recent decades.

However, I can't completely rule out the possibility of a surprise development, such as a sudden geopolitical shift leading to quick admission of a new member. While extremely unlikely, such scenarios are not impossible.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To answer this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: The UN has grown from 51 member states in 1945 to 193 today. However, the rate of new admissions has slowed significantly in recent decades. The last new member state was South Sudan in 2011.

2. Potential candidates: There are few clear candidates for new UN membership. Some potential ones include Palestine, Kosovo, or Taiwan, but all face significant political obstacles.

3. Time frame: The question asks about admission before October 1, 2024, which is less than a year away. UN membership requires approval by the Security Council and General Assembly, a process that typically takes considerable time.

4. Current geopolitical climate: Global tensions and divisions make consensus on admitting new members challenging.

5. Lack of recent momentum: None of the articles provided indicate any imminent plans or strong push to admit new UN members.

6. UN reform discussions: While there are calls to reform the UN, including from the OCS, these seem focused on restructuring existing systems rather than expanding membership.

Arguments for a higher probability:
- The UN continues to strive for universal representation.
- Ongoing conflicts or geopolitical shifts could potentially lead to new states seeking recognition.

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The short timeframe leaves little room for the lengthy admission process.
- No strong candidates are actively pursuing membership with broad support.
- Geopolitical tensions make consensus on new admissions unlikely.
- The UN has remained at 193 members for over a decade, indicating stability.

Balancing these factors, I lean heavily towards a low probability of new member admission before October 1, 2024. The lack of clear candidates, short timeframe, and absence of any indications of imminent admission processes in the provided information all point to maintaining the status quo of 193 member states.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current membership: The UN currently has 193 member states, with no changes since South Sudan joined in 2011.

2. Historical context: UN membership expansion has slowed significantly in recent decades. The last major wave was in the early 1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

3. Potential new members: There are a limited number of entities that could potentially become UN members:
   - Kosovo (partially recognized)
   - Palestine (currently an observer state)
   - Taiwan (complex political situation with China)
   - Other small territories or breakaway regions

4. Admission process: Joining the UN requires a recommendation from the Security Council and a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly. This is a high bar, especially given potential vetoes from permanent Security Council members.

5. Recent developments: The articles provided don't mention any imminent plans for new member admissions. The focus seems to be more on reforming existing structures and addressing global challenges.

6. Time constraint: The question asks about changes before October 1, 2024, which is less than a year away. UN processes typically move slowly.

7. Geopolitical climate: Current global tensions, particularly between major powers, may make consensus on new admissions difficult.

Balancing these factors:

- The base rate of UN membership changes is very low in recent years.
- There are no clear signs of imminent new admissions in the provided information.
- The short timeframe and complex admission process make quick changes unlikely.
- However, geopolitical shifts can sometimes lead to unexpected developments.

Given these considerations, I assess a very low probability of the UN exceeding 193 member states by October 1, 2024. 

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Current situation: As of today (2024-10-18), the UN has 193 member states. This has been unchanged since South Sudan joined in 2011.

2. Time frame: We're looking at the period from now until October 1, 2024, which is less than two weeks away.

3. Historical context: The UN has added new members very infrequently in recent decades. The last addition was over 13 years ago.

4. Potential new members: There are a few potential candidates for UN membership, such as Palestine and Kosovo, but their admission is politically contentious and has been stalled for years.

5. Recent developments: None of the news articles provided mention any imminent plans for admitting new UN members. The focus seems to be on other issues like sustainable development goals, electoral processes, and humanitarian crises.

6. Process for admission: Admitting a new UN member requires a recommendation from the Security Council and a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly. This process typically takes time and requires significant diplomatic efforts.

7. Geopolitical climate: Current global tensions, particularly involving permanent Security Council members, make it unlikely that contentious membership applications would be approved quickly.

8. Short timeframe: With less than two weeks until the resolution date, there's very little time for the complex process of admitting a new member to be completed.

Balancing these factors:

- The historical infrequency of new admissions and the lack of recent movement on potential candidates suggest a very low probability of a new member being admitted.
- The extremely short timeframe further reduces the likelihood, as the process typically takes much longer.
- However, we can't completely rule out the possibility of a surprise fast-tracked admission in response to unforeseen geopolitical developments.

Given these considerations, I would assign a very low probability to this event occurring.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.20% being the most likely. Probability: 0.20%.

Weighing these factors, the probability of a new member state joining before October 1, 2024 appears very low. The lack of clear candidates, the short timeframe, and the complex admission process all point to a high likelihood of the membership remaining at 193.

However, unexpected geopolitical shifts or rapid developments could slightly increase the chances. Additionally, there's always some uncertainty in international affairs.

Balancing these considerations, I would estimate a very low probability range with a slight allowance for unexpected developments.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
