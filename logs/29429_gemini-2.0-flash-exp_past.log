Okay, let's analyze this question about the Hawaii constitutional amendment on same-sex marriage.

**1. Triage and Reference Class Forecasting**

*   **Reference Class:** We are looking at a ballot measure in a US state concerning LGBTQ+ rights, specifically marriage equality. A helpful reference class would be past ballot measures on similar topics across the US and in Hawaii.
*   **Base Rate:** Historically, ballot measures banning same-sex marriage have often passed in the past when put to a public vote (pre-Obergefell). However, in recent times, a majority of the public now support same-sex marriage, according to the articles, at 69%. Further, several articles reference similar measures in California and Colorado that are widely expected to pass.
*   **Initial Estimate:** Given the shift in public opinion and the trend of recent ballot measures on same-sex marriage, we should move away from a 50/50 initial estimate. A somewhat higher probability, perhaps 60%, seems a reasonable starting point, to be updated with case-specific data.

**2. Breaking Down the Problem**

The key sub-problems are:
    *   **Public opinion in Hawaii:** Is it generally supportive of LGBTQ+ rights and same-sex marriage?
    *   **The specific wording of the amendment:** Is it clear and easy to understand? Are there any aspects that could confuse voters or generate opposition?
    *   **The political climate and campaigns:** Are there strong organized campaigns for or against the amendment?
    *   **Voter turnout and demographics:** Is there reason to believe that one side may have a turnout advantage?
    *   **Effect of the 'blank vote' counting as a "No" vote:** Could this have a significant impact on the results?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views**

*   **Outside View:** The general trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage in the US, and the recent passage of similar measures in other states, suggests a good chance of success for this amendment. The fact that several articles mention that similar measures in other states are widely expected to pass reinforces the outside view. The Respect for Marriage Act, despite not being a complete guarantee, signals broader acceptance. The mention of this amendment being a response to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision also suggests a generally progressive climate.
*   **Inside View:** The articles mention that this amendment is somewhat "symbolic," due to the Obergefell decision already legalising same-sex marriage, but also note that it would take away the legislature's power to ban it in the future. The articles note that blank votes count as no votes, which is significant. There is some concern expressed that the wording is confusing and might raise fears of a "trick". The fact that 69% of Hawaiians voted against same sex marriage in 1998 indicates it has not always been a widely supported issue. The articles indicate there is organised opposition, albeit with some expressing outdated viewpoints. The fact that the amendment needs a "Yes" vote to pass suggests that people who are ambivalent may inadvertently vote against it, because a blank vote is a "No".
*   **Balancing:**  The inside view raises some caution due to the potential for confusion and blank votes. The base rate of other states passing similar amendments and the current public support for marriage equality suggest a moderately high probability. However, the need for a 'yes' vote, and the possibility of voter confusion suggests it is not a certainty. 

**4. Under/Over Reacting**

*   There is a risk of overreacting to the strong advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights in some media, and overlooking the historical opposition and the potential negative impact of a complex amendment and the "blank vote = No" rule. The articles do not suggest that organized opposition is gaining much traction, although there are some opponents mentioned.
*   The articles also suggest strong, organized support for the amendment.
*   Therefore, a balanced approach is needed to avoid both underreacting to the progressive trend and overreacting to the progressive arguments, and also recognizing the possible negative effect of confusion and blank votes.

**5. Clashing Forces**

*   **Pro-Amendment Forces:** Increasing public acceptance of same-sex marriage, fear of the Supreme Court reversing Obergefell, desire to protect rights from potential political changes, and organized support by state leaders and activists.
*   **Anti-Amendment Forces:** Confusion about the amendment's purpose, opposition from some religious and socially conservative groups, and potential for "blank" votes to count as "no" votes, plus historical opposition to same-sex marriage in Hawaii.

**6. Trend Extrapolation**

*   Public opinion has consistently moved towards supporting same-sex marriage in the US. This suggests a continued trend that could positively influence the vote in Hawaii. However, historical precedents show that it is not a certainty, hence we need to be cautious.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

*   The evidence suggests a higher chance of success, but the need for a "yes" vote, the possibility of voter confusion, and the organised opposition and the historical precedent, means there is a risk of failure. Therefore, we must allow for more uncertainty than a simple trend extrapolation would suggest.

**8. Confidence & Prudence**

*   It is prudent to be moderately confident in the outcome. The current political climate and the public's growing acceptance of same-sex marriage, coupled with the organized support, suggests the amendment is more likely to pass. However, we must also be wary of unforeseen events, such as significant campaign activity against the amendment in the final days or confusion and apathy among voters.
*   Therefore, some prudence in confidence is required.

**9. Errors & Hindsight**

*   It will be important to examine why the forecast might have been incorrect. If the amendment fails, was it due to unexpected campaign activity by opponents, voter confusion, unexpected low turnout among supporters, or other factors? We must avoid hindsight bias.

**Reasoning Summary and Justification for Prediction**

The weight of evidence favors the amendment's passage. Public opinion is generally supportive of same-sex marriage, and there is fear that the Supreme Court may roll back the Obergefell decision, which has motivated supporters to organize and campaign for the measure, with widespread endorsements. Similar measures are expected to pass in other states. However, there are some risks: the potential for confusion among voters regarding the amendment's purpose and its potential to be seen as "symbolic," and that a blank vote counts as a "no" vote. This requires tempering optimism. Taking all of the factors together, the measure is more likely to pass, but this outcome is not guaranteed.

**Final Forecast**

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** Currently, Metaculus is showing a community prediction of 87% for this question resolving as "Yes". This provides a valuable reference point and suggests a generally optimistic outlook.
*   **Other sources:** I have not found other sources that give explicit numeric predictions.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To assess this question, we need to consider the following sub-problems:
    *   **Historical Context:** What is Hawaii's history on LGBTQ+ rights, and how has it voted on similar issues in the past?
    *   **Current Public Opinion:** What is the current public opinion in Hawaii on same-sex marriage, and how might this translate to voting patterns?
    *   **Political Dynamics:** What are the political forces at play, and who supports or opposes the measure?
    *   **Ballot Initiative Specifics:** How is this initiative worded, and how well-informed are voters about the proposal?
    *   **Turnout and Demographics:** Who is likely to vote in the upcoming election and how might their demographic characteristics affect the result?
    *   **Recent Trends and National Context**: How does this issue play out nationally, are similar initiatives on other states' ballots, and how might fears about the Supreme Courtâ€™s future rulings on this issue motivate voting?

**3. Outside View (Base Rates):**
    *   **Constitutional Amendments:**  Generally, constitutional amendments are more difficult to pass than simple legislative changes due to the higher bar for approval. However, given that this amendment seeks to remove discriminatory language, we can expect higher chances of success.
    *   **Same-Sex Marriage Ballot Measures:** Looking at the history of same-sex marriage ballot measures, we can see a trend of increasing acceptance, especially in states that are known to be liberal.

**4. Inside View (Specific Evidence):**

*   **Support:**
    *   The initiative is supported by a broad coalition of Democrats, LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, and some religious leaders. (Multiple sources)
    *   The amendment aims to remove outdated, discriminatory language from the state constitution. (Multiple sources)
    *   House Speaker Scott Saiki, who has been a strong advocate for same-sex marriage, introduced the bill proposing the amendment. (Yahoo)
    *   Public figures like Rep. Jill Tokuda and Gov. Josh Green have voiced support for the amendment. (lgbtqnation.com, AP news).
    *   The amendment is framed as protecting existing marriage equality from potential challenges. (Multiple sources)
    *   The fact that there are similar amendments on the ballot in California and Colorado suggests a coordinated effort to protect same-sex marriage, which could give momentum.
    *   The articles suggest that fears about the Supreme Court potentially overturning the Obergefell v. Hodges decision are driving support for these measures.

*   **Opposition:**
    *   Some conservatives oppose the measure on religious grounds. (hawaiinewsnow.com, AP news).
    *   Former Republican Lawmaker Bob McDermott opposes the measure. (hawaiinewsnow.com)
    *   The article notes that blank votes are counted as 'no' votes, and that could potentially be a factor in the outcome. (khon2.com)
    *   There is some suggestion that voters might find the issue confusing or see it as a political trick. (hawaiinewsnow.com)

*   **Neutral/Mixed:**
    *   The vote is described as largely symbolic since same-sex marriage is already legal, but the initiative would remove the potential to ban it at a later stage (Multiple sources)
    *   Some sources note that voter turnout was low in the primary election in Hawaii. This implies there could be a more variable outcome depending on how much voters engage with this issue. (Yahoo).

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Push for Equality vs. Conservative Opposition:** There's a clear tension between the push for marriage equality and the opposition based on traditional views of marriage and religious objections.
*   **Symbolic vs. Concrete:** The measure is symbolic but is also intended to remove the *potential* for banning same-sex marriage in the future. 
*   **High Information Environment vs. Confusion:** The media coverage is fairly extensive, but there's also some suggestion of voter confusion over the measure, as well as some people viewing it as political maneuvering.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

Extrapolating from the current trend of growing acceptance of same-sex marriage, itâ€™s reasonable to assume that the amendment would pass. The presence of similar measures across multiple states also suggests an organized movement, rather than a single random case, which lends it more likelihood of success.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
Given the complexity of the issue, public opinion, and the political factors, there is some uncertainty, which I will reflect in the range of my forecast. However, the evidence strongly favors a "yes" vote.

**8. Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**
The evidence overwhelmingly suggests a "yes" vote, and I need to be confident enough to make that prediction. However, the possibility of voter apathy, blank votes being counted as "no" votes, and the potential for conservative opposition to cause an upset must be recognised.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

While history suggests an increase in support for same-sex marriage, unexpected outcomes could occur. Being aware of this and being open to revisions in the future is important.

**Balancing the Evidence and Making a Prediction**
Taking all of the above factors into consideration, the strong support from political leaders, advocates, and public opinion polls towards marriage equality suggests that the constitutional amendment has a high chance of success. The fact that this is on the ballot in multiple states at the same time also gives some increased confidence that this is not an isolated case. The negative factors, however, include the possibility of voter apathy, blank ballots being counted as no votes, and the possibility of some unexpected upset caused by the conservative opposition, but these risks appear to be outweighed by the positive trends and support for the measure.

**My Prediction: Between 78.00% and 95.00%, but 88.00% being the most likely. Probability: 88.00%.**

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:** This is a constitutional amendment vote concerning same-sex marriage. We can start by looking at the history of similar ballot measures in the US, specifically in other states and how they have fared. We also need to consider the political landscape in Hawaii, and its history of how it has voted on these issues.
*   **Historical Base Rate:**  Historically, ballot measures banning same-sex marriage were more common and often passed in the early 2000s. However, in the past decade, and especially since the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court decision in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, there is a clear trend of increasing acceptance and protection of marriage equality, and recent ballot measures aimed at *protecting* same-sex marriage have passed at relatively high rates. We can expect this to continue given that this question is also on the ballot in California and Colorado and these are generally considered to be liberal or left-leaning states.
*   **Initial Base Rate Estimate:** Given the recent trend towards marriage equality, let's start with a baseline estimate that similar ballot measures that aim to protect same-sex marriage have roughly a 60-70% chance of passing, and therefore, we can start with that estimate.
*   **Metaculus/Other Forecasts:** There is no specific Metaculus prediction on this question, at the moment of writing, but looking for reference, the Metaculus questions about the Colorado and California ballot measures are trending at a high likelihood. I will update this if any more info becomes available.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We can break down the factors influencing the vote into a few categories:

*   **Public Opinion:** What is the overall sentiment in Hawaii regarding same-sex marriage?
*   **Political Climate:** Who are the key supporters and opponents?
*   **Ballot Language and Complexity:** Is the wording of the amendment clear?
*   **Voter Turnout:** Which groups are more likely to turn out, and how do they tend to vote on this issue?
*   **Campaign Spending/Mobilization:** Are there significant resources being spent on either side?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** As established, the base rate for this type of ballot measure in recent years is favorable to those that protect same-sex marriage.
*   **Inside View (Specifics to Hawaii):**
    *   **Strong support for marriage equality:** Hawaii was one of the first states to legally challenge a ban on same-sex marriage in the 1990's and eventually legalized same-sex marriage in 2013. This suggests a favorable attitude.
    *   **"Symbolic" nature:** The articles highlight that the amendment is largely symbolic, as the current legislature can't ban same-sex marriage at the moment, but it solidifies protection in the state constitution. This reduces the risk of a strong negative reaction from voters.
    *   **Confusion and "Trick" Fears:**  Professor Moore points out confusion, suggesting some voters may be wary. This could reduce the yes vote, but may equally encourage people to vote yes to clarify that they do support marriage equality.
    *   **Blank votes count as "no":**  Retired Judge Foley and others have highlighted that a blank vote will count as a no vote. This is a real risk given this might not be common knowledge to some. 
    *   **Lack of Organized Opposition:** Unlike California and Colorado, there is less news about organized and funded opposition to the amendment in Hawaii.
    *   **The Dobbs Effect:** The overturning of Roe v. Wade has motivated activists to proactively protect rights, including same-sex marriage, this may mobilise voters on the yes side.
    *   **The Respect for Marriage Act:** The articles note that the Respect for Marriage Act, passed in 2022, provides federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages, but it does not guarantee state recognition. This context may make some voters more willing to approve the amendment.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:**  We should not overreact to the political "trick" concerns, as voters supportive of marriage equality may see it as a way to solidify the existing law.
*   **Underreacting:** We must pay close attention to the risk of blank votes counting as "no", which reduces the total percentage voting for "yes". We should not underestimate the potential impact of the confusion surrounding the amendment's intent. 

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pro-Equality Forces:** The prevailing sentiment in Hawaii is favorable towards marriage equality, along with the national trend and awareness of the risk of Obergefell being overturned.
*   **Anti-Amendment Forces:** Confusion about the amendment and blank ballots counting as "no" could decrease the percentage vote for "yes", although the symbolic nature of the vote and the lack of organised opposition should reduce the amount of no votes.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The trend is for increased acceptance and support for same-sex marriage, so this will push the probabilities towards a higher number. We are seeing similar legislation being introduced in other left-leaning states with strong support.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   While a "yes" vote seems more likely, there is uncertainty due to potential confusion, blank votes, and the generally lower levels of voter turnout for local elections.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   We should be moderately confident, given the recent trends, but mindful of the risk of underestimating the impact of voter confusion.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   We should acknowledge the risk of hindsight bias, particularly if the result goes against our prediction. If that is the case, we must re-evaluate the assumptions used to make the prediction, especially regarding the 'blank vote' phenomenon.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

Based on the information gathered:

*   The base rate of similar measures is favorable.
*   The political climate and public opinion in Hawaii is likely supportive of same-sex marriage.
*   The risk of significant organized opposition appears low, but there is a concern of blank votes reducing the yes vote.
*   The Dobbs effect and the Respect for Marriage Act may mobilize pro-equality voters.

**Forecast:**

Taking all the factors into consideration, we can move the original baseline estimate of 60-70% upwards, but the risk of blank votes decreases confidence in the higher likelihood of the upper end of the forecast.

My Prediction: Between 68.00% and 82.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   While a "yes" vote seems more likely, there is uncertainty due to potential confusion, blank votes, and the generally lower levels of voter turnout for local elections.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:** This is a constitutional amendment vote concerning same-sex marriage. We can start by looking at the history of similar ballot measures in the US, specifically in other states and how they have fared. We also need to consider the political landscape in Hawaii, and its history of how it has voted on these issues.
*   **Historical Base Rate:**  Historically, ballot measures banning same-sex marriage were more common and often passed in the early 2000s. However, in the past decade, and especially since the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court decision in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, there is a clear trend of increasing acceptance and protection of marriage equality, and recent ballot measures aimed at *protecting* same-sex marriage have passed at relatively high rates. We can expect this to continue given that this question is also on the ballot in California and Colorado and these are generally considered to be liberal or left-leaning states.
*   **Initial Base Rate Estimate:** Given the recent trend towards marriage equality, let's start with a baseline estimate that similar ballot measures that aim to protect same-sex marriage have roughly a 60-70% chance of passing, and therefore, we can start with that estimate.
*   **Metaculus/Other Forecasts:** There is no specific Metaculus prediction on this question, at the moment of writing, but looking for reference, the Metaculus questions about the Colorado and California ballot measures are trending at a high likelihood. I will update this if any more info becomes available.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We can break down the factors influencing the vote into a few categories:

*   **Public Opinion:** What is the overall sentiment in Hawaii regarding same-sex marriage?
*   **Political Climate:** Who are the key supporters and opponents?
*   **Ballot Language and Complexity:** Is the wording of the amendment clear?
*   **Voter Turnout:** Which groups are more likely to turn out, and how do they tend to vote on this issue?
*   **Campaign Spending/Mobilization:** Are there significant resources being spent on either side?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** As established, the base rate for this type of ballot measure in recent years is favorable to those that protect same-sex marriage.
*   **Inside View (Specifics to Hawaii):**
    *   **Strong support for marriage equality:** Hawaii was one of the first states to legally challenge a ban on same-sex marriage in the 1990's and eventually legalized same-sex marriage in 2013. This suggests a favorable attitude.
    *   **"Symbolic" nature:** The articles highlight that the amendment is largely symbolic, as the current legislature can't ban same-sex marriage at the moment, but it solidifies protection in the state constitution. This reduces the risk of a strong negative reaction from voters.
    *   **Confusion and "Trick" Fears:**  Professor Moore points out confusion, suggesting some voters may be wary. This could reduce the yes vote, but may equally encourage people to vote yes to clarify that they do support marriage equality.
    *   **Blank votes count as "no":**  Retired Judge Foley and others have highlighted that a blank vote will count as a no vote. This is a real risk given this might not be common knowledge to some. 
    *   **Lack of Organized Opposition:** Unlike California and Colorado, there is less news about organized and funded opposition to the amendment in Hawaii.
    *   **The Dobbs Effect:** The overturning of Roe v. Wade has motivated activists to proactively protect rights, including same-sex marriage, this may mobilise voters on the yes side.
    *   **The Respect for Marriage Act:** The articles note that the Respect for Marriage Act, passed in 2022, provides federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages, but it does not guarantee state recognition. This context may make some voters more willing to approve the amendment.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:**  We should not overreact to the political "trick" concerns, as voters supportive of marriage equality may see it as a way to solidify the existing law.
*   **Underreacting:** We must pay close attention to the risk of blank votes counting as "no", which reduces the total percentage voting for "yes". We should not underestimate the potential impact of the confusion surrounding the amendment's intent. 

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pro-Equality Forces:** The prevailing sentiment in Hawaii is favorable towards marriage equality, along with the national trend and awareness of the risk of Obergefell being overturned.
*   **Anti-Amendment Forces:** Confusion about the amendment and blank ballots counting as "no" could decrease the percentage vote for "yes", although the symbolic nature of the vote and the lack of organised opposition should reduce the amount of no votes.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The trend is for increased acceptance and support for same-sex marriage, so this will push the probabilities towards a higher number. We are seeing similar legislation being introduced in other left-leaning states with strong support.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   While a "yes" vote seems more likely, there is uncertainty due to potential confusion, blank votes, and the generally lower levels of voter turnout for local elections.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   We should be moderately confident, given the recent trends, but mindful of the risk of underestimating the impact of voter confusion.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   We should acknowledge the risk of hindsight bias, particularly if the result goes against our prediction. If that is the case, we must re-evaluate the assumptions used to make the prediction, especially regarding the 'blank vote' phenomenon.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

Based on the information gathered:

*   The base rate of similar measures is favorable.
*   The political climate and public opinion in Hawaii is likely supportive of same-sex marriage.
*   The risk of significant organized opposition appears low, but there is a concern of blank votes reducing the yes vote.
*   The Dobbs effect and the Respect for Marriage Act may mobilize pro-equality voters.

**Forecast:**

Taking all the factors into consideration, we can move the original baseline estimate of 60-70% upwards, but the risk of blank votes decreases confidence in the higher likelihood of the upper end of the forecast.

My Prediction: Between 68.00% and 82.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about the Hawaii constitutional amendment regarding same-sex marriage.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:**  We are dealing with a state-wide ballot measure seeking to remove a ban on same-sex marriage. This can be framed as a citizen-initiated change to state law on a social issue. It's not exactly the same, but we can look at outcomes of other ballot measures related to LGBT rights and civil rights, as well as those related to constitutional changes to help us get to an initial probability. 
*   **Existing Predictions:** I don't have access to live prediction platforms like Metaculus, Polymarket, or FiveThirtyEight so we'll have to make this judgement based solely on the provided information.
*   **Base Rates:** A quick look at the history of same sex marriage ballot initiatives and legal challenges gives us a somewhat mixed picture. In the 2000s there was much more opposition to same-sex marriage, and many state referendums to ban it succeeded, though most of these were eventually struck down by the supreme court. In contrast more recent ballot measures regarding LGBTQ+ rights have been more successful. We'll need to use this broad reference class and then adjust our probability based on the specific circumstances in Hawaii.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To make this tractable, let's consider the key factors:
*   **Public Opinion in Hawaii:** What is the general attitude towards same-sex marriage in Hawaii? Is it similar to the national average?
*   **The Amendment's Nature:** Is it easily understandable or confusing to voters?
*   **Opposition:** Is there a well-funded or vocal opposition campaign?
*   **Turnout:** How is turnout in this election expected to be, and will this likely benefit either side of the measure?
*   **Clashing Causal Forces:** What forces are likely to push voters towards a "yes" vote, and what forces are likely to push them towards "no"?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:**  Based on the reference class, measures to repeal bans on same-sex marriage have seen success in recent years. However, the presence of a ballot measure implies some degree of public doubt, so it isn't a foregone conclusion.  We should start by looking at polls in other states, and adjust for local characteristics. National polls showing broad support for same-sex marriage are encouraging, and the fact that several other states are passing these measures at the same time indicate strong momentum.
*   **Inside View:** The specific situation in Hawaii includes several elements. Firstly, the 1998 amendment was passed when 69% of voters opposed same-sex marriage; this highlights a need for more caution in assuming public opinion today has changed significantly. The fact that blank votes are counted as "no" votes is also a specific local factor that makes the passage of the amendment less likely. On the other hand, the language is described as 'outdated', suggesting a perception that the current ban is out of touch with the times. There's also the argument that a 'yes' vote would further protect same sex couples from potential Federal challenges, which would likely be a popular justification. There does also appear to be an activist base working hard to promote the change.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

The news articles suggest significant public debate, and the fact that there was a strong vote *against* gay marriage back in 1998 indicates that there is likely still significant opposition, even if support has increased since then. At the same time, we have news articles saying this will likely pass due to broad public support, which suggests a high degree of certainty in the outcome. This conflict suggests we shouldn't be swayed too far in either direction. It's necessary to remain prudent here and avoid being overly influenced by either side's certainty.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for "Yes":**
    *   Widespread support for same-sex marriage nationwide and in some other states
    *   The amendment removing discriminatory language.
    *   Fear of the Supreme Court overturning Obergefell v. Hodges.
    *   Support from local politicians and activists.
*   **Forces for "No":**
    *   The 1998 vote opposing same-sex marriage.
    *   Some people maintain a traditional view of marriage.
    *  The fact that blank ballots are counted as no.
    *   The potential for voter confusion on what the amendment is for, and a potential risk that voters will vote no if they're uncertain.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

Extrapolating from the national trend would lead us to expect that this amendment will succeed. However, the previous vote in Hawaii highlights the risk of over-reliance on this national trend.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

Given all the factors, the outcome isn't a foregone conclusion. The possibility of a "no" vote remains, even if the overall trend seems to be towards greater acceptance of same-sex marriage.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

A balanced approach is required, avoiding both pessimism and excessive optimism. There is a risk that people who oppose the measure may be more likely to vote than those in favour, as is the pattern for many referenda where opponents are highly motivated.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

After the fact, I will be keen to analyse why my forecasts might have been wrong (e.g., was there a change in voter turnout or a major campaign on either side?).

**Balancing the Evidence:**

I'm balancing:
*   The national trend towards acceptance of same-sex marriage and recent success of similar measures in other states.
*   The past vote against same-sex marriage in Hawaii,
*   The fact that this is a constitutional amendment, requiring more voter support than a simple change in law.
*   The fact that blank votes are counted as "no" votes.
*   The potential for confusion/uncertainty to drive "no" votes
* The symbolic aspect of this vote which may be more important than the practical effects.

Given this balancing, I think a "yes" vote is the most likely, but a "no" vote remains plausible, and the fact that blank votes are counted as "no" makes a successful amendment more challenging. The amendment is designed to remove the legislature's power to restrict marriage, but most people are primarily concerned about whether the existing rules on same-sex marriage are maintained.

**Final Forecast**

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Given this balancing, I think a "yes" vote is the most likely, but a "no" vote remains plausible, and the fact that blank votes are counted as "no" makes a successful amendment more challenging. The amendment is designed to remove the legislature's power to restrict marriage, but most people are primarily concerned about whether the existing rules on same-sex marriage are maintained.

**Final Forecast**

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question and formulate a forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is an existing Metaculus question on this topic ([https://www.metaculus.com/questions/15883/hawaii-same-sex-marriage-vote-2024/](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/15883/hawaii-same-sex-marriage-vote-2024/)). As of today, Oct 31st, the Metaculus community prediction is at 86%. This gives a good starting point.
*   **Other sources:** I have not located any predictions from other sources such as FiveThirtyEight, or Polymarket related to this specific question.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To approach this, I will break down the problem into the following sub-questions:
    *   What is the historical context of same-sex marriage in Hawaii?
    *   What is the exact wording of the amendment?
    *   What are the arguments for and against the amendment?
    *   What is the current political climate in Hawaii?
    *   Are there any indications of voter turnout and how would that affect the outcome?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Looking at the overall track record of similar ballot measures related to LGBTQ+ rights is difficult, as success rates differ greatly by state and time period. However, given that same-sex marriage is now broadly accepted by the public, there is a stronger chance these ballot measures will pass. Furthermore, the current trend seems to be in favor of equality and protection of same-sex marriage. The base rate from other states suggests a good chance of passing for similar referendums.
*   **Inside View (Specific Context):**  The articles highlight the specific context of this measure in Hawaii, which is that this is removing a ban which is already rendered unenforceable by Supreme Court ruling. It also signals the stateâ€™s support for marriage equality.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

I need to be careful not to overreact to the recent news, but also not to be too anchored on the previous estimates. The Metaculus forecast, and other general support levels in society, means we should be leaning towards a higher prediction, but be aware that the articles also report there are opponents, so I should adjust the prediction down somewhat.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **For:**
    *   The current wording in the constitution is considered discriminatory and outdated.
    *   Broad support for marriage equality nationally and in Hawaii.
    *   The amendment would remove an unenforceable ban and clarify support for marriage equality.
    *   The measure is supported by prominent figures such as the governor and the House Speaker.
    *   The push is coming from fears of the Supreme Court overturning Obergefell v. Hodges.
*   **Against:**
    *   Some opponents view marriage as between a man and a woman and want to retain the power to ban same-sex marriage again.
    *   There is a chance of some confusion about the measure, with some believing it's a trick, and blank votes being counted as "no" votes.
    *    Some articles mention potential for confusion over the complex nature of the amendment and the need for a "yes" vote to change anything.
    *  There is a potential for some degree of complacency as the marriage ban already has no effect.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

The current trend, as shown in public opinion polls (69% support), and the number of state-level ballot initiatives attempting to codify marriage equality, shows that support for same-sex marriage is high. Recent events, such as the Dobbs decision, have fueled the desire to protect these rights from federal intervention.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

This is not a 100% guarantee. There is a risk of low voter turnout or confusion over the amendment, leading to a failure to pass. There is still a need to recognise that the opposition will vote, and there is still an element of doubt.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

I do not want to be overly confident by assuming that this is a sure thing. It's important to acknowledge the risks. I also do not want to overcorrect by reducing the probability too low.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

I will review the outcome to analyze whether there was a specific element I missed or overweighted, while accounting for potential hindsight biases.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Based on all the evidence, the measure has a high probability of passing. The language in the state constitution is outdated and discriminatory. The majority of the population supports marriage equality, and the amendment aims to solidify those rights, but there is still some chance of "no" votes winning due to complacency or confusion over the voting process. Given all of this evidence, I will nudge my prediction down slightly from the Metaculus community forecast, while still keeping the probability quite high. I believe the chance of the measure failing is now relatively low.

My Prediction: Between 78.00% and 92.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.
