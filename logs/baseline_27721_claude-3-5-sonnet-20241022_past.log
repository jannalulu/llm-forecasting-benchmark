2025-02-12 22:33:20,820 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this carefully:

1) Timing: The resolution date is October 1, 2024, giving only about 1 month from today.

2) Recent Context:
- Plug Power has faced significant financial difficulties
- The company reported substantial losses in 2023
- They issued a "going concern" warning in November 2023
- Stock price has declined dramatically
- They've been trying to raise capital and secure financing

3) Critical Factors:
- Very short timeframe (only 1 month)
- Companies typically try multiple alternatives before bankruptcy
- They still have some cash reserves
- They've been actively working on restructuring and securing new funding
- The hydrogen sector still has long-term potential despite current challenges

4) Key Considerations:
- The immediate risk is very high given their financial situation
- However, they might still secure emergency funding
- The short timeframe somewhat reduces the probability
- They might attempt other restructuring options first

Given these factors, and the very short timeline to October 1, while the company is in serious trouble, they likely have enough resources to last beyond October 1st even if bankruptcy becomes inevitable later.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.
