**US Fed holds rates steady, nods to possible September cut - ETCFO**
The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, but hinted at a possible rate cut in September. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee stated that there has been 'some further progress' towards its 2% inflation target, citing the steady drop in inflation in recent months. This decision sets the stage for a potential rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, just before the US elections.

**Fed holds interest rates steady, but a cut could be coming in September - Fast Company**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has decided to keep interest rates steady, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a potential rate cut in September. In a press conference following the Fed's latest policy meeting, Powell stated that there has been 'some further progress toward the Committee's 2% objective,' and that 'there is a growing sense of confidence that you could move at the next meeting' if inflation data continues to soften. This suggests that the Fed may pivot and cut interest rates in September, as partly reflected in the central bank's new policy statement.

**Fed Expected to Hold Rates and Signal September Cut**
Federal Reserve officials are expected to hold interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% this week, but signal a potential rate cut in September. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict that the Fed will acknowledge progress in reducing inflation, which is a prerequisite for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference after the meeting, where he may be asked about the outlook for the next meeting in September and the pace of easing for the rest of the year. Some economists, including Subadra Rajappa of Societe Generale, believe that the Fed will change its language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting. 'I think that they are going to change the language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting,' said Rajappa. Rate Decision: All economists surveyed by Bloomberg are looking for no change in rates at this meeting. Markets have fully priced in a Fed rate cut in September, but the big question is how clearly the FOMC will signal this. 'We think communications from the July meeting will offer only tentative hints of a September cut, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting the potential for a cut 'if data evolve as we expect,' said Bloomberg Economics. 'Powell could be asked about what would meet the bar for the 'unexpected weakening' that makes them reassess whether quarterly 25 basis point cuts are enough,' said Derek Tang, an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics.

**Fed likely to hold rates steady one last time**
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at its upcoming policy meeting, but may open the door to rate cuts as early as September by acknowledging that inflation has edged closer to its 2% target. Recent data shows that price pressures are easing, with the Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index rising at a slower rate than previously. This may lead to a change in the Fed's description of inflation from 'elevated' to 'moderately elevated', which could signal to markets that the central bank is taking inflation concerns seriously. Some experts believe that the Fed may cut interest rates in September, citing encouraging inflation data and a slowing economy.

**Treasurys hold steady ahead of Fed meeting minutes release**
U.S. Treasury yields remained steady on Wednesday as investors awaited the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting. The 10-year Treasury yield was down by less than one basis point to 3.8142%. Investors are looking for insights into the Fed's thinking on monetary policy and its expectations for the economy. Markets are pricing in a 69.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 30.5% likelihood of a 50 basis point reduction in September. The release of the minutes and comments from Fed officials at the Jackson Hole symposium will be closely watched. 'Markets are firmly pricing in a rate cut for September,' according to the article. 'Investors will be parsing through the minutes to gain insights into the Fed's thinking when it comes to monetary policy, as well as policymakers expectations for the economy and any concerns they may have about it,' the article continues. 'Retail sales figures and weekly initial jobless claims data last week somewhat eased investor concerns,' the article states. 'However, uncertainty about the economy and worries about an economic slowdown have at times raised concerns about whether the Fed should have already begun cutting interest rates,' the article notes. 'CME Group's FedWatch tool showed that traders were last pricing in a 69.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 30.5% likelihood of a 50 basis point reduction,' the article reports. 'As the week continues, investors will also be watching out for any comments from Fed officials made at the annual Jackson Hole symposium which kicks off on Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak Friday, rounding out a week that is relatively light on the data front,' the article concludes.

**Inflations Slows But Fed Looks To Hold Firm**
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady during its two-day policy meeting this week, but signal potential rate cuts as soon as September, acknowledging that inflation is nearing the 2% target. Recent data shows easing price pressures, with the PCE price index rising at just 1.5% annualized since March. Fed officials may change their inflation description from 'elevated' to 'moderately elevated,' reflecting confidence that inflation will continue to decline. Policymakers believe rate cuts might be necessary before inflation fully returns to the target. According to the market, there are still expectations for two more rate cuts by the end of the year.

**What's going on with Federal Reserve interest rates?**
The U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it will keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25 to 5.50 per cent. According to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, a potential rate cut might come at the next policy meeting in September. Albert Mason, a prominent financial advisor, believes that analysts forecast a rate cut in September, and suggests considering strategies for portfolios in anticipation of this potential change. As Mason notes, 'it's a hold-steady-for-now approach' from the Fed, and investors should stay informed about the latest stock market news to make informed decisions.

**US Fed holds rates, signals possible cut in September**
The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% in its July meeting, but signaled a possible rate cut in September. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that if inflation moves in line with expectations, 'a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table' in the September meeting. The Dow Jones index rose with markets anticipating greater visibility on interest rate cuts. The Fed's policy statement noted 'some further progress' towards achieving the 2% inflation target, with inflation rising 2.5% in June. The committee is shifting focus from solely fixating on inflation to being 'attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate' -- inflation and employment. The unemployment rate in the US has risen to 4.1%. This could have implications for emerging economies, as the International Monetary Fund noted that 'a number of central banks in emerging market economies remain cautious in regard to cutting rates owing to external risks triggered by changes in interest rate differentials and associated depreciation of those economies' currencies against the dollar.'

**Fed holds rates steady as Powell hints at a rate cut in September**
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a potential rate cut in September, citing recent progress on inflation. Despite keeping rates unchanged at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, Powell stated that 'the broad sense of the committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate.' Powell emphasized that any Fed decision is apolitical and strictly based on data, economic outlook, and risk assessments. Market participants have increased their expectations for Fed rate cuts, with 78 basis points of cuts factored in by the end of the year, implying at least three 0.25% rate reductions. Powell also refuted claims that a rate cut close to the election could favour a specific Presidential candidate. 'The main message from the July FOMC meeting is that the Fed is getting closer to a rate cut, but needs more evidence that inflation is under control before it does,' Bank of America economist Michael Gapen wrote. 'Consistent with past experience, markets are interpreting Fed Chair Powell's remarks at his press conference as more dovish than the FOMC statement,' economist Mohamed El-Erian stated on X.

**Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady, Signals Possible Cut in September**
The U.S. Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged for the eighth consecutive time, maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5%. However, the Fed hinted that it could start lowering the rate as soon as September due to easing inflation and cooling job markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that a reduction in the policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September, citing 'some further progress' toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal. This is an upgrade from the June statement, which described inflation as 'elevated' and progress as 'modest'.

The US Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% this week, but signal a potential rate cut in September. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg believe policymakers will acknowledge progress towards the 2% inflation goal and indicate that policy should become less tight soon.

All economists surveyed by Bloomberg are looking for no change in rates at this meeting. The Fed may highlight the improved inflation outlook and signal that it expects rate cuts soon. Bloomberg Economics said, 'Markets have fully priced in a Fed rate cut in September, but the big question for the FOMC meeting is: How clearly will the FOMC signal this?' Investors are pricing in slightly more than a quarter-percentage point of easing for September, indicating they see some risk of a bigger cut than the typical 25 basis-point increment.

**Interest Rates Remain Steady Once Again — But the Fed Could Cut Rates in September Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said some scenarios would allow the Fed to cut rates in September.**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady during its July meeting, but some economists predict a rate cut in September. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said that there are scenarios that would allow the Fed to cut rates in September, but he needs more positive economic data before making a decision. Powell emphasized that the Fed's decisions are based on economic data, not politics, and that they will not use their tools to support or oppose a political party. Some Republican lawmakers have accused Powell of intentionally choosing to lower rates before the presidential election to help Democrats win, but Powell has denied these claims. Meanwhile, some Democratic lawmakers have pushed Powell to ignore the Republican critiques and cut rates to promote maximum employment and stable prices.

**Fed Meeting Today: Rate Cut Is 'On the Table' for September**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a 'rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting' if inflation and employment continue to balance. Powell stated that the economy 'is so much better than where we were a year ago.' This supports predictions of an interest rate cut in September, which could provide relief for Americans taking out loans or paying off high-interest credit card debt. The Fed has held interest rates at a two-decade high since last summer to combat inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 and is currently at 3% year over year.

**The Fed holds interest rates steady. Here's when a rate cut could happen.**
The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, but Chair Jerome Powell said that 'time is drawing near' for the central bank to begin trimming borrowing costs. This could occur as soon as the Fed's next policy meeting in September, assuming economic data continues to show cooling inflation. Powell stressed that the decision will depend on forthcoming inflation data, and he sidestepped a question on whether there might be additional rate cuts in 2024. Some Wall Street analysts still forecast multiple rate cuts in 2024, which they predict will kick off with the September meeting. Powell emphasized that the Fed is a non-political agency, with a mandate from Congress to focus on maintaining price stability and full employment. He added, 'We never use our tools to support any political outcome,' and that the Fed's focus is on economic data. The Fed's dual mandate is to keep prices stable to ensure maximum employment. 'We look at the two goals, and if one of them is farther away than the other, you concentrate on the one that is farther away,' Powell said. 'For the last couple of years the best service we could do for the American people was to focus on inflation.' However, he noted that 'now, labor market has softened, the inflation is probably a little farther from its target than employment, but the risks to the employment mandate are real now.'

**Fed holds interest rates steady, but a cut could be coming in September**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that policymakers may be ready to reduce borrowing costs as soon as their next meeting in September. Powell stated that there has been 'some further progress toward the Committee's 2% objective,' and that there is a 'growing sense of confidence that you could move at the next meeting' as long as coming inflation data affirms its recent softening trend. Investors saw Powell's comments as setting the stage for a reduction in borrowing costs at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 meeting, with interest rate futures, stocks, and Treasury bonds all rallying hard on Powell's remarks. The probability of a first cut in September being as large as half a percentage point jumped to about 15%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. However, Powell said a 50-basis-point cut was not something under active consideration. The Fed's policy statement also removed standing language that it was 'highly attentive to inflation risks,' and replaced it with an acknowledgement that policymakers were now 'attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.'

Powell stated that there's growing confidence for a move in the next meeting, as long as inflation trends continue to improve. Investors perceived Powell's statement as setting the stage for a rate cut at the Fed's meeting in September, with market reactions including rallies in stocks and Treasury bonds. However, Powell clarified that a 50-basis-point cut was not under active consideration. The Fed's policy statement downplayed inflation risks, focusing more on their dual mandate, which includes maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. Policymakers await stronger confidence in sustainable inflation trends before finalizing rate cuts. As Powell said, 'The economy is expanding solidly, and while job gains have moderated, unemployment remains low.'

**Fed Holds Rates Steady, Hints At September Cuts**
The Federal Reserve has decided to keep the federal funds rate at 5.25-5.5%, as widely expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the decision was unanimous and that the central bank is balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too soon or too late. Powell hinted that a reduction in the policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting if the data continues to trend in favor of low inflation and strong employment. He noted that the economy is experiencing a broader disinflation, with headline inflation at 2.5% and core inflation at 2.6%. Economists such as Odeta Kushi and Eric Orenstein believe that a September rate cut could boost demand in the housing market, but also noted that it may not be enough to unlock substantial numbers of locked-in homeowners. 'We are balancing the risk of going too soon with the risk of going too late,' Powell said, repeating this phrase throughout the press conference. 'A reduction in the policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting,' he added, 'We're nearing that time.'

**The Fed Is Holding Interest Rates Steady, but Cuts Are Coming Soon**
The Federal Reserve has decided to hold interest rates steady at 5.25% to 5.5%, as expected, but rate cuts are anticipated in September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that inflation has eased, but remains above the Fed's target, and that the committee wants to see 'further progress' before lowering rates. Powell signaled that an interest rate cut is coming 'as soon as the next meeting' if inflation continues to cool and the labor market remains stable. Analysts predict a 100% probability of a September rate cut, with most expecting a 0.25 percentage point reduction. The Fed will closely monitor inflation and jobs data between now and September to determine the extent of the cut. The decision means consumers must weather high interest rates for at least a little longer, with borrowers facing record-high mortgage and credit card payments. However, interest rates remaining steady mean larger yields on certificates of deposit and high-yield savings accounts. The stock market has had a strong performance on Wednesday, with the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq indexes up more than 1%, 2%, and 3%, respectively, as investors adjust to potentially lower rates.

**Fed holds interest rates steady, but cut expected soon**
The Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping borrowing costs at their highest level in more than two decades. Despite a prolonged cooldown of inflation, economists expected the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged. However, an interest rate cut is widely expected in the coming months, with the chances of a cut in September standing at more than 85%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank may reduce interest rate cuts in September, depending on economic performance over the preceding weeks. Powell stated, 'We've made no decisions about future meetings and that includes the September meeting. We're getting closer to the point at which we'll reduce our policy rate, but we're not quite at that point yet.' The economy appears to be hurtling toward interest rate cuts later this year, which would deliver long-sought loan relief for households and businesses saddled with expensive debt. However, robust economic data released last week may complicate the path toward a rate cut, with the odds of a September interest rate cut falling to about 80% after the data came out, but rising seven percentage points since then.

**Fed will hold interest rates steady, but officials hint rates could be cut this year**
The US Federal Reserve announced that it will hold interest rates steady, but officials hinted that rates could be cut later this year. The Fed's next meeting is in September, and investors are looking for hints that rate cuts could come as early as then. Rates have been steady at 5.25% to 5.5% for the past year, and the Fed has been trying to balance its 'dual mandate' of cooling inflation with minimal damage to the labor market. Fed officials seem to be paying more attention to keeping the labor market balanced with inflation, rather than being laser-focused on bringing down inflation. Jerome Powell said that data on consumer prices 'do add somewhat to confidence' that inflation is returning to the Fed's target, but other officials have implied that cuts could come later this year, with Christopher Waller saying 'The time to lower the policy rate is drawing close.'

**Fed holds rates steady, but opens door to rate cuts**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 5.25%-5.50% but opened the door to reducing borrowing costs as soon as its next meeting in September. The central bank acknowledged that inflation has 'somewhat elevated' levels, a downgrade from its previous assessment of 'elevated' inflation. The Fed removed language that it was 'highly attentive to inflation risks' and replaced it with a focus on the risks to both sides of its dual mandate, which includes maintaining maximum employment consistent with stable prices. US central bankers believe it would be appropriate to reduce borrowing costs before inflation returns to its 2% target to account for the time it takes monetary policy to affect the economy. The economy has continued to expand at a solid pace, but policymakers are focused on avoiding a sharp rise in unemployment often associated with high interest rates and slowing inflation.

**Fed Holds Rates Steady**
The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates steady at a 22-year high, between 5.25% and 5.5%, citing mixed economic data and a need for more confidence that inflation is moving towards its target of 2%. The Fed's statement suggests that it may wait longer than expected to cut rates, potentially throwing cold water on investors' expectations of a September cut. As stated by the Fed, 'The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.' The next scheduled meeting is in September, with potential cuts in November and December. Prior to the meeting, financial markets had predicted a 100% chance of a September cut and high odds of further cuts this year.

**Fed Holds Rates Steady, Signals September Cut Amid Cooling Inflation**
The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain interest rates at 5.25% to 5.5%, but signaled a potential rate cut in September due to easing inflation and a cooling labor market. The committee's post-meeting statement acknowledged the moderation in job gains and the slight rise in the unemployment rate, while noting that inflation remains 'somewhat elevated.' Economists and investors expect a rate cut in September, and the Fed will closely monitor labor market trends and inflation to achieve a balanced risk between inflation and employment. According to Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed's goal is to foster maximum employment, and the rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1% and the slowdown in hiring underscore the Fed's cautious stance. As inflation trends more favorably towards the 2% target, the September meeting is poised to be pivotal, with Powell's upcoming press conference being closely watched for further insights into the central bank's strategies.

**Fed Holds Policy Steady, Expresses More Caution Than Expected on September Rate Cut**
The Federal Reserve held its benchmark fed funds rate range unchanged at 5.25%-5.50%, as expected, but its policy statement was more hawkish than anticipated. Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is 'moving closer' to cutting rates, but gave little indication that a September rate cut is guaranteed. The Fed stated that 'inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated,' and that it is 'attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.' The market had anticipated at least 25 basis points in rate cuts by the mid-September meeting, but the Fed's statement caused bond yields and the dollar to rise, and the price of bitcoin to edge lower. U.S. stocks remained sharply higher for the session, with the Nasdaq up 2.4% and S&P 500 1.6%.

**Fed holds rates steady, stays on track for September cut**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a 23-year high, but hinted that it is getting closer to a rate cut as inflation continues to cool and the job market slows. Fed officials stated that 'in recent months there has been some further progress towards the Committee's 2% inflation objective,' and that the risks to both sides of their dual mandate -- inflation and full employment -- 'continue to move into better balance.' However, they maintained that 'the Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.' The central bank also reiterated that inflation has eased over the past year, but remains 'somewhat' elevated, and that job gains have moderated. A rate cut at the next meeting on September 17-18 is increasingly likely, with some Fed officials indicating that they need more than one quarter's worth of good data to be sure about cuts. 'The outlook is uncertain and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,' the statement read.

**Fed Meeting Today: No Interest Rate Cut, but September Looks Promising**
The Federal Reserve has voted to keep interest rates steady at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive time, but its statement suggests 'some further progress' on inflation, indicating that inflation is decreasing. Most experts predict an interest rate cut in September, which could bring relief to Americans waiting for rates to drop before taking out a new loan or mortgage, or paying off high-interest credit card debt. The Fed has been holding interest rates at a 23-year high since last summer to bring inflation down to its target of 2%.

**Federal Reserve holds US interest rates steady but signals it is closer to cutting**
The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates steady at a 23-year high for the eighth consecutive meeting, but signaled that it is closer to lowering rates. The Federal Open Market Committee stated that there has been 'some further progress' towards the 2% inflation target, but still needs 'greater confidence' that inflation is moving sustainably towards the target before lowering borrowing costs. The FOMC is now 'attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate', acknowledging that a rising unemployment rate is also a top concern. The Fed's next meeting in September is expected to be the last one before the November presidential election, and most policymakers expect rates to fall to 4-4.25% by the end of next year, before declining to about 3% in 2026. According to Fed chair Jay Powell, the US economy is no longer 'overheated', as consumers show signs of flagging. The number of job openings has declined from 12mn in 2022 to 8mn in June, and price pressures are declining without a sharp jump in lay-offs. The Fed is trying to achieve a 'soft landing', bringing down inflation to target without tipping the economy into a recession.

**Fed holds interest rates steady and stops short of signaling September cut - Washington Examiner**
The Federal Reserve held its interest rate target steady at 5.25% to 5.50% for the eighth meeting in a row, despite investors' expectations of a cut in the coming months. The Fed stated that its goals for the labor market and inflation 'continue to move into better balance,' but stopped short of signaling a rate cut at the next meeting in September. The decision comes as inflation has been falling, with the consumer price index dropping to 3% for the year ending in June, and the Fed's multiyear projections predicting inflation to fall to 2.6% by the end of 2024. The Fed also predicted a modest 2.1% growth in gross domestic product in 2024, and an unemployment rate of 4% by the end of this year. The resilient labor market has given the Fed insulation to keep interest rates high, although there have been some signs of softening, including a decline in job openings and a slight increase in the unemployment rate.

The decision comes as inflation has been falling, with the consumer price index dropping to 3% for the year ending in June, a 0.3-point decline more than predicted by economists. The Fed's multiyear projections indicate that inflation will fall to 2.6% by the end of 2024 and the unemployment rate will be 4% by the end of this year. The economy has been expanding at a healthy pace, despite high-interest-rate environment, with a 1.4% growth rate in the first quarter of this year.

**Fed expected to hold rates steady, set stage for September cut**
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, but indicate that a reduction in borrowing costs could come as soon as September. Investors are convinced that a rate cut will happen at the September 17-18 meeting, with most expecting a quarter-percentage-point reduction. The Fed has kept its policy rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range for the past year. Despite the economy growing faster and performing better than expected, a 50-basis-point rate cut would likely require evidence that the economy is slowing faster than expected. The economy grew at an above-trend 2.8% annual rate in the second quarter, and job openings and hiring data showed continued resilience in the job market. Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics, said, 'The labor market has cooled over the last several months but isn't weak. That's a scenario the Federal Reserve wants to guard against, and we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in September.' Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT, where he is expected to emphasize that the Fed will remain 'data-dependent' when it comes to its ultimate rates decision. Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, said, 'The Fed does not believe it needs to hurry' and cut rates now, as the data remain consistent with a normalization of activity rather than a sharper slowdown.

Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, said, 'The Fed does not believe it needs to hurry' and cut rates now, 'the data remain consistent with a normalization of activity rather than a sharper slowdown. Rate cuts at this point are still preemptive with the goal of stabilizing activity at the current near-trend pace.'

**US Fed meeting: What to expect today on interest rates**
The US Federal Reserve is expected to hold benchmark interest rates steady at its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, but investors will closely watch the post-meeting statement for hints of a possible rate cut in September. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there is a 95.9% chance of no rate hike this month, but a 85.8% expectation of a September cut. Simon Ballard, chief economist at First Abu Dhabi Bank, said, 'The stars are aligning for a Fed rate cut in September, rather than for an earlier one.' However, other analysts, such as BofA, are less certain, saying, 'We do not think the Fed is willing to signal September is a done deal.' If the Fed does hike rates, some of its GCC counterparts may follow suit, as their currencies are pegged to the dollar. The Fed has raised rates to a 23-year-high level to curb inflation, which has cooled slightly to 2.5% in June, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

**Fed Holds Rates Steady, Signals First Cut Is Nearer**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5%, but signaled that they are moving closer to lowering borrowing costs due to easing inflation and a cooling labor market. Officials noted that there has been progress toward the 2% inflation objective, and that the risks to achieving employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. However, they still expect to gain 'greater confidence' that inflation is moving toward their target sustainably before making a rate cut. This shift in tone is likely to reinforce expectations for a rate cut at the central bank's September meeting.

**Fed Expected to Hold Rates and Signal September Cut**
Federal Reserve officials are expected to hold interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% this week, but signal a potential rate cut in September. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict that the Fed will acknowledge progress in reducing inflation, which is a prerequisite for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference after the meeting, where he may be asked about the outlook for the next meeting in September and the pace of easing for the rest of the year. Some economists, including Subadra Rajappa of Societe Generale, believe that the Fed will change its language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting. 'I think that they are going to change the language in the statement to suggest a cut at the September meeting,' said Rajappa. Rate Decision: All economists surveyed by Bloomberg are looking for no change in rates at this meeting. Markets have fully priced in a Fed rate cut in September, but the big question is how clearly the FOMC will signal this. 'We think communications from the July meeting will offer only tentative hints of a September cut, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting the potential for a cut 'if data evolve as we expect,' said Bloomberg Economics. 'Powell could be asked about what would meet the bar for the 'unexpected weakening' that makes them reassess whether quarterly 25 basis point cuts are enough,' said Derek Tang, an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics.

**A Potential Stock Market Crash Trigger Looms on July 31**
The Federal Open Market Committee meeting is set to conclude on July 31, with investors expecting the central bank to hold rates steady this month. However, they will be closely listening to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments, hoping for confirmation of a September rate cut. The market is sensitive to Powell's commentary, and if he hints at holding rates steady in September, it could be bearish for stocks. Despite this, Fed officials are optimistic about the economy, with prices heading down, consumer spending strong, and recession concerns disappearing. The 'higher for longer' strategy may have proven effective in stabilizing the economy.

**Gold holds steady as Fed meeting looms**
Gold prices remained steady on Tuesday as investors awaited cues from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting and economic data releases. The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady but may signal rate cuts in September. Investors will also monitor employment data, including the nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. According to Tim Waterer, KCM Trade's chief market analyst, 'The tone of the Fed meet and Friday's jobs report could pull the rug out from underneath the US dollar if investors start to price in more rate cuts between now and year-end.' Lower interest rates could benefit gold, which could rise above $2,400. Meanwhile, silver prices fell 0.1% to $27.84 per ounce, and platinum and palladium prices were nearly flat.

**Fed likely to hold rates steady one last time as inflation fight finale unfolds**
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at its upcoming policy meeting, but may open the door to rate cuts as early as September by acknowledging that inflation has edged closer to its 2% target. Recent data shows that price pressures are easing, with the personal consumption expenditures price index rising by 2.5% in June, and the annualized month-to-month changes in the PCE price index showing a 1.5% increase since March. This data may be enough for Fed officials to change their description of inflation from 'elevated' to 'moderately elevated', and note rising confidence that the pace of price increases will return to 2%. Some economists, such as Jim Bullard and Nathan Sheets, believe that the Fed will signal a rate cut in July and cut rates in September. The Fed's decision will be closely watched, especially in the context of the US presidential election.

Some experts think that the Fed should cut rates now, citing better inflation news and signs of a slowing economy.
