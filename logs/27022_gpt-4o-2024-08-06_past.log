To make a forecast on whether astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be on Earth on September 15, 2024, we need to consider several key factors:

1. **Flight Schedules**: Typically, both NASA and commercial partners like SpaceX and Boeing have well-publicized flight schedules. If either astronaut is scheduled for a mission around this time, it may affect their location on the specified date.

2. **Recent Activity**: Reviewing recent missions and activities will help anticipate where they might be. Both astronauts could be involved in training or preparation for a mission if they are scheduled for future flights.

3. **Historical Launch and Return Patterns**: Understanding the average length of missions can provide insights into their potential presence on Earth. Historically, missions can range from a few months to longer durations in orbit.

4. **Contingencies**: Delays or changes in plans due to technical, logistical, or health-related issues might impact their location on the date in question.

5. **Public Announcements**: Following NASA's and related partners' announcements leading up to the date will offer the most accurate and recent information regarding their whereabouts.

Given this information:

- Without concrete scheduled missions that might interfere, it's likely both astronauts are more often on Earth than in space.
- Historical patterns suggest the summer period in 2024 could include missions or preparations but doesn't guarantee space presence.

Based on these considerations, it is probable that both astronauts will be on Earth on the date in question.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.
