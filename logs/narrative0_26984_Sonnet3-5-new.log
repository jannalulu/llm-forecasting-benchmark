[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Taiwan ADIZ violations between August and September."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 72%. The escalating tensions following Lai's inauguration and China's 'punishment' drills were strong indicators. The historical data showing increased violations, especially that June spike of 66 aircraft in two days, suggested heightened aggression."

Nate: "The trend was clear. After Lai took office, violations jumped from 2 to 10 per day. Combined with China's rhetoric about 'hostile separatists,' our models predicted this would be a critical period."

Philip: "Indeed. When we made the forecast back in August, Beijing's pattern of using ADIZ violations as political statements made this outcome highly probable."

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June incidents with 66 aircraft, we predicted a 72% chance of seeing over 40 Chinese aircraft violating Taiwan's ADIZ in that August-September window."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Yes, and it happened exactly as our models suggested. The historical pattern of China's increasing military pressure, especially during politically sensitive periods, made this quite predictable. The summer timing also aligned with their previous peak activities from 2022."

Nate: "The trend was clear from those post-inauguration numbers - jumping from 2 to 10 violations per day. When you combine that with China's 'punishment' rhetoric and their strategic timing..."

Tetlock: "It's why we gave it such high probability. The models never lie."

NATE SILVER: (reviewing data on multiple screens) Well, Philip, our models were spot on again regarding the Taiwan ADIZ violations.

PHILIP TETLOCK: (nodding) Yes, we had it at 72% probability. After Lai's inauguration in May, the escalating pattern was clear. The June spike of 66 aircraft in two days was particularly telling.

NATE: The historical trend since 2022, combined with China's "punishment" drills and heightened rhetoric against the DPP administration, made this almost predictable.

PHILIP: (pulling up a chart) The increasing frequency of violations since May 2024 was the key indicator. When we made our forecast on August 8th, the 30-day moving average had already tripled compared to pre-election numbers.

NATE: And sure enough, yesterday we saw 43 aircraft crossing the ADIZ. Beijing's message to Taipei remains consistent with our probability models.
