Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the debate has come and gone. Did Kamala Harris say "I'm speaking"?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Given the microphone rules, her odds were always slim.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The muted mics were a game-changer. But her history with that phrase made it tempting to think otherwise.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. The anticipation was high, but the setup favored a different outcome. Our models accounted for that.

**NATE SILVER**  
And they were spot on, as always. It's fascinating how even known tendencies can be thwarted by new formats.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Another win for predictive accuracy. Until next time, Nate.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis.
