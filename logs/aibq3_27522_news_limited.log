**Romanian Ana Barbosu Awarded Bronze Medal in Women's Gymnastics at 2024 Paris Olympics**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has reallocated the bronze medal in the women's artistic gymnastics floor exercise event from the 2024 Paris Olympics from American Jordan Chiles to Romanian Ana Barbosu. According to the IOC, 'We are in contact with the Romanian National Olympic Committee to discuss the medal reallocation ceremony and with the US Olympic Committee regarding the return of the bronze medal', a spokesperson told AFP. This decision follows a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Saturday, which annulled Chiles' appeal due to a late submission. Barbosu, who was initially announced as third-place finisher on Tuesday, had even raised the Romanian flag in the Arena Bercy before being relegated to fourth place after Chiles' appeal. Romania now ends the Paris Olympics with nine medals, ranking 23rd in the country standings. Brazilian gymnast Rebeca Andrade was crowned Olympic champion in the floor exercise event on August 5, ahead of American Simone Biles.

**Court strips US gymnast of bronze medal at Paris Olympics 2024**
A court has ordered US gymnast Jordan Chiles to return the bronze medal she won at the Paris Olympics 2024. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the medal will be reallocated to Ana Barbosu of Romania after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in favour of their appeal. The issue stemmed from confusion in the scoring during the women's floor exercise final, where Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea finished with matching scores, but Jordan Chiles's score was adjusted, surpassing them. The Romanian team filed an appeal, stating that Team USA appealed outside the one-minute time limit, which the CAS upheld. Following the verdict, USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee said, 'We are devastated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling regarding women's floor exercise.' They believed their inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles' floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and in accordance with FIG rules. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) restored the original scoring, placing Barbosu back in third, Maneca-Voinea fourth, and Chiles fifth.

**Ana Barbosu Reinstated as Bronze Medalist in Women's Floor Exercise at Paris 2024 Olympics**
The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has reinstated Ana Barbosu of Romania as the bronze medalist in the women's floor exercise at the Paris 2024 Olympics, after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) overturned an appeal by Jordan Chiles' coach, Cecile Landi. The appeal was made after Landi requested that the judges reinstate an element in Chiles' routine, which increased her score by 0.1 and put her in third place. However, the FIG rules require that any appeal must be made within one minute of the score being published, and the TAS ruled that Landi's appeal was made 1 minute and 4 seconds after the deadline. As a result, the original order was reinstated, and Barbosu was awarded the bronze medal. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed the reassignment of the medal less than 24 hours after the TAS decision. According to the IOC, the FIG will determine the final classification, but the medal will be awarded 'in accordance with' the TAS decision. The FIG placed Barbosu in third place, Maneca-Voinea in fourth, and Chiles in fifth. The IOC announced that the bronze medal will indeed go to Barbosu and that they will work with the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee to return the bronze medal awarded to Chiles. 'It was a great day,' said Cecile Landi, Chiles' personal coach and also the coach of the US team in Paris, 'but unfortunately, it was not meant to be.'

**Paris Olympics: American gymnast Jordan Chiles stripped of bronze medal (Ld)**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that the bronze medal given to American gymnast Jordan Chiles in the floor exercise at the Paris Games will be reallocated to Ana Barbosu of Romania. This decision comes after a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruling upheld an appeal by the Romanian Olympic Committee that an inquiry submitted by the USA about Chiles' score in the gymnastics floor exercise final was filed beyond the 1-minute deadline. According to the IOC, 'The IOC will reallocate the bronze medal to Ana Barbosu (Romania). We are in touch with the NOC of Romania to discuss the reallocation ceremony and with USOPC regarding the return of the bronze medal.' The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) also confirmed that 'the ranking of the Women's Artistic Gymnastics Floor Exercise Finals has been modified accordingly, with Ana Barbosu (ROU) ranking third with a score of 13.700.' Jordan Chiles initially scored 13.666 in Monday's final, placing fifth, but her coach's appeal upgraded her score to 13.766, moving her to third place. The Romanian team protested, and the CAS ruling reinstated Chiles' original score of 13.666. USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee issued a joint statement, saying, 'We are devastated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling regarding women's floor exercise.' They also condemned the 'baseless and hurtful attacks' on social media against Jordan Chiles and commended her for conducting herself with integrity.

**Olympics rocked by staggering decision as medals overturned in gymnastics furore**
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has overturned an appeal that saw American gymnast Jordan Chiles leapfrog Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu into third place in the women's floor exercise at the Paris Olympics. The CAS ruling restored Barbosu to third place, with Chiles demoted to fifth. The decision was made after it was determined that Team USA coach Cecile Landi's on-floor appeal came four seconds too late, outside the 1-minute window allowed by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG). The FIG stated that the allocation of medals is not up to them, and it remains to be seen if Chiles will have to return her bronze medal. A precedent set by the CAS in 2022 suggests that both women may keep their medals. Meanwhile, Romanian gymnast Sabrina Maneca-Voinea's placing could be upgraded after a video review showed she did not step out of bounds in her routine, which would have given her gold. The Romanian federation has asked CAS to restore 0.1 points to Maneca-Voinea's score, and Romanian gymnastics legend Nadia Comaneci has launched an appeal on her behalf.

**Olympia 2024: Bronze Medal in Floor Exercise to be Re-Awarded**
The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) has ordered the re-award of the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise at the Paris Olympics. The decision was made after the Romanian Gymnastics Federation filed a complaint, arguing that the US-American Jordan Chiles' request to change her score was submitted four seconds too late. As a result, the Romanian Ana Bﾄビbosu moved up to third place with a score of 13.700. The US Gymnastics Federation expressed 'shock' over the decision, stating that the investigation into the difficulty value of Chiles' routine was done in good faith and in accordance with FIG rules. The federation also reported that Chiles had been subjected to online harassment since the decision. Chiles had initially hinted at the decision in an Instagram story, stating that she was 'heartbroken' and would be taking time to protect her mental health. The US team had initially filed a complaint during the competition, which was later upheld by the jury after reviewing the video footage. However, the decision was made after Bﾄビbosu had already celebrated her third-place finish. The Romanian federation had also filed a complaint against the scoring of Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, which was later dismissed. The Cas has only awarded the bronze medal to Bﾄビbosu, leaving the decision on the other two medals to the FIG.
