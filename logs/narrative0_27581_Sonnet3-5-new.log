[Scene: A dimly lit office. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like we've got our answer about Greg Brockman's return to OpenAI."

Philip: "Yes, our models had this one at 35.5%. The signals were there - his complete dedication for nine years straight, that candid post about needing time with family. The November crisis showed both his loyalty to Altman and the toll of leadership."

Nate: "The timing of his announcement was telling too. Coming right after Schulman's departure to Anthropic, it suggested deeper organizational shifts."

Philip: "Indeed. While his strong alliance with Altman initially made us consider a higher probability of return, his mention of wanting to prioritize life beyond work was a crucial indicator. Nine years without a break - that's the kind of exhaustion that often leads to permanent changes."

[They turn off their monitors and leave.]

Nate: "So, Philip, our models were spot on again about Greg Brockman's return to OpenAI."

Philip: "Yes, the signals were quite clear. After analyzing his strong alliance with Sam Altman, his pivotal role in OpenAI's founding, and his emotional announcement about needing his first break in 9 years, our models had it at 78.5%."

Nate: "The loyalty factor was key. Remember how he immediately resigned when Altman was ousted in November 2023, then returned together? That pattern suggested strong organizational commitment."

Philip: "Indeed. His sabbatical announcement specifically mentioned 'the rest of the year,' indicating a planned return. Plus, with OpenAI's critical position in AI development, the timing of his break seemed strategic rather than permanent."

[They nod in agreement as headlines confirm Brockman's return to OpenAI]

[Scene: A dimly lit office. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on holographic screens]

NATE: Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Greg Brockman's return to OpenAI...

PHILIP: No, our models had it at 32.45%. The signals were there in the data from August. His announcement about "pouring his life" into OpenAI for nine years straight, including his entire marriage, suggested deep burnout.

NATE: True. And after the November 2023 drama with Sam Altman, the company dynamics were never quite the same. The exodus of other co-founders, especially Schulman to Anthropic, was telling.

PHILIP: The sabbatical seemed more like a graceful exit strategy. Our models picked up on the pattern - when key founders take extended breaks during turbulent times, they rarely return to their original roles.

NATE: Another accurate forecast. Shall we move on to the next prediction?

Nate: "No, our models had it at 32.5%. The extended break being his first in nine years, combined with the recent exodus of other co-founders like Schulman to Anthropic, suggested this was likely a permanent transition rather than a temporary pause."

Philip: "The personal nature of his X post about needing time with family was particularly telling. Our models are never wrong, and they saw this coming months ago."
