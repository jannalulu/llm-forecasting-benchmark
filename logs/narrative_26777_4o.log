**INT. COFFEE SHOP - SEATTLE - OCTOBER 3, 2024 - DAY**

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee. A digital clock on the wall reads 10:00 AM.

**JANE**  
It's official. The data's in. We had exactly two days with AQI above 150 this quarter.

**MIKE**  
Our models had it at 92.75%. Not surprising, given the history and the wildfire patterns.

**JANE**  
Right? After the Bolt Creek Fire in 2022, we knew the risk was there. But this year, the rains came early.

**MIKE**  
And thankfully, fewer fires. Just goes to show, even with all the data, nature's still unpredictable.

**JANE**  
True. But our models have been spot on. It's all about understanding the trends and adjusting for anomalies.

**MIKE**  
Here's to another year of accurate forecasts. And hopefully, cleaner air.

They clink their coffee cups, smiling.

**JANE**  
Well, the data's in. Seattle had three days with an AQI above 150 this quarter.

**MIKE**  
Our models had it at 75.34%. Pretty spot-on given the trend with wildfires.

**JANE**  
Right? After that Bolt Creek Fire in 2022, we knew these patterns were likely. 

**MIKE**  
And the rains came early this year. That helped keep the numbers down.

**JANE**  
True. By August 1, we only had one bad day. The models adjusted perfectly.

**MIKE**  
It's fascinating how accurate they are. But still, three days is three too many.

**JANE**  
Agreed. Let's hope for cleaner air in 2025.

*They clink coffee mugs, a mix of relief and resolve in their eyes.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
So, it’s confirmed. Just one day above 150 AQI this quarter.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 18.75%. Given the trends and early summer conditions, it was a fair assessment.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(nods)  
Indeed. The absence of significant wildfire activity this summer was a blessing. Remember 2022? Eleven days of choking smoke.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Smoky skies were expected, but the rains came early this year. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(reading an article)  
Even with climate shifts, local interventions helped. It’s not just luck.
