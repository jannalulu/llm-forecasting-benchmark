2024-10-23 01:48:48,701 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Keir Starmer became PM in July 2024
- Initial approval ratings were relatively high (36% approval in July)
- Recent significant decline in approval ratings during August due to:
  * Riots and civil unrest across UK
  * Criticism of handling anti-migration protests
  * Cut to winter fuel benefits
  * Multiple sources confirm sharp decline in ratings

2. Key Data Points:
- July 18: 36% approval (Ipsos poll)
- Early August: Net approval dropped by 16 points
- August 4: Net approval at 3% (Opinium)
- By August 11: Multiple sources confirm "lowest level since election"

3. Trend Analysis:
- Clear downward trajectory in approval ratings
- Short honeymoon period followed by rapid decline
- Multiple crises (riots, protests) affecting leadership perception
- Economic decisions (fuel benefits) impacting popularity

4. Contextual Factors:
- Similar pattern to previous PMs (initial popularity followed by decline)
- Ongoing social unrest likely to continue affecting ratings
- Economic challenges persist
- September traditionally difficult month for UK governments

5. Predictive Considerations:
- Only about 1 month until measurement date
- Current trajectory strongly negative
- Limited time for significant recovery
- Multiple ongoing challenges

6. Reference Class:
- New PMs typically see approval ratings decline after honeymoon period
- Recent UK PMs have struggled to maintain high approval ratings
- Similar situations with civil unrest historically led to low approval

Based on these factors, particularly the recent sharp decline and ongoing challenges, combined with the historical pattern of new PM approval ratings, it appears highly unlikely that Starmer's approval rating will reach 60 by September 18, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 82.50% and 92.50%, with 87.50% being the most likely. Probability: 87.50%

2024-10-23 01:48:57,922 - INFO - Run 1:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's confirm Starmer's current position:
- He became PM in July 2024 after winning the general election
- Initial approval ratings were positive (~36% approval in July)
- Recent events have significantly impacted his ratings

2. Key recent developments:
- Major riots and unrest across UK in early August
- Poor handling of riots according to polls
- Unpopular decision to cut winter fuel benefits
- Approval ratings have dropped sharply

3. Specific numbers from recent polls:
- July 18: 36% approval (Ipsos)
- Early August: Net approval dropped by 16 points
- August 4: Net approval at 3% (Opinium)
- August 8: Net favorability at -16% (YouGov)

4. Relevant factors for future trajectory:
- Historical precedent shows new PMs often experience honeymoon periods followed by decline
- Current crises (riots, economic issues) are likely to continue affecting ratings
- Winter fuel benefit cuts likely to become more contentious as winter approaches
- September typically sees increased political activity after summer

5. Analysis:
Positive factors:
- Still early in premiership
- Opposition remains divided
- Some time to implement policies

Negative factors:
- Multiple ongoing crises
- Unpopular policy decisions
- Sharp downward trend in approval
- Approaching difficult winter period

6. Trajectory analysis:
- Current trend is strongly negative
- Little indication of immediate turnaround
- September 18 gives limited time for recovery
- Historical patterns suggest continued decline after honeymoon period

Given the sharp decline in approval ratings, ongoing crises, and limited time for recovery before September 18, combined with historical patterns of post-honeymoon decline, the probability of approval being below 60 is very high.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 95.50%, with 92.30% being the most likely. Probability: 92.30%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Check:
- Today is August 16, 2024
- Target date is September 18, 2024 (about 1 month away)
- Starmer became PM in July 2024

2. Recent Approval Rating Trajectory:
- July 18: 36% approval (Yahoo/Ipsos)
- Late July: Peak approval around July 28
- August 4-11: Significant decline due to:
  - Riots/civil unrest
  - Handling of Southport stabbing incident
  - Cuts to winter fuel benefits
  - Anti-migration protests

3. Key Factors Supporting Rating < 60:
- Current ratings show steep decline
- Multiple sources confirm lowest ratings since election
- Facing multiple crises (riots, protests)
- Economic challenges (fuel subsidies)
- Historical context: UK PMs rarely reach 60% approval
- Recent polls show negative trend

4. Factors Supporting Rating > 60:
- Still in traditional honeymoon period
- Some early polls showed strong initial support
- Previous peak in late July shows potential for recovery

5. Analysis:
- Starting from current low ratings (~35-40%)
- One month is likely insufficient for dramatic recovery
- Historical patterns suggest PM ratings tend to decline over time
- Multiple ongoing challenges likely to suppress ratings
- No major positive catalysts visible on horizon

6. Risk Factors:
- Potential resolution of riots/protests
- Economic improvements

- Economic challenges
- Controversial policy decisions
- Traditional post-election honeymoon period ending

5. Historical Comparisons:
- New PMs typically experience approval rating declines after initial honeymoon
- Rate of decline appears faster than historical average
- Similar patterns seen with previous Labour PMs

6. Forward-Looking Analysis:
- Trend is clearly downward
- No clear indicators of potential improvement
- Multiple ongoing challenges
- September timing means summer issues may have settled

Given these factors, it's highly unlikely Starmer's approval will be above 60% by September 18. The current trends show rapid decline, multiple challenges, and no clear path to improvement. Even his peak approval was well below 60%.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 92.80%
