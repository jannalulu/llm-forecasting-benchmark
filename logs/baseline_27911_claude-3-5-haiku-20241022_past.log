Let me carefully analyze this forecast:

Key Considerations:
1. The specific question is about Catalent filing its 10-K for fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, before October 1, 2024
2. Today's date is September 4, 2024, which is quite close to the October 1 deadline
3. Companies typically file 10-Ks within 60-90 days after fiscal year end

Factors Supporting Timely Filing:
- September 4 is close to fiscal year end (June 30)
- Most publicly traded companies have established processes for annual reporting
- Regulatory requirements create strong incentive to file on time
- No indicators of significant financial/reporting difficulties

Potential Risks:
- Possible audit complications
- Potential financial reporting challenges
- Possible SEC or internal review delays

Given the proximity to deadline and typical corporate reporting practices, I assess a high probability of timely filing.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.75%, with 90.25% being the most likely. Probability: 90.25%.
