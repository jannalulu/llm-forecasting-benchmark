INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - AUGUST 12, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, analyzing their models. The atmosphere is tense yet focused.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, did Poland win the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.45%. Poland was a strong contender, given their track record and adaptability in the Swiss format.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Indeed, and the addition of new teams like China and South Korea made the competition unpredictable. But Poland's strategy was top-notch.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The last news update we had was from July 25th. Poland's performance in the group stage was stellar, dominating Seeding Group 1.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, did they win?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yes, they did. The official announcement came through this morning. Our models were spot on.

The group nods in satisfaction, sipping their coffee. 

FADE OUT.

*Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming. They discuss the recent Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, did Poland win the 2024 WTC?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** No, they didn't. Our models had it at 12.35%. They were a strong contender, but not quite there.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** They had a tough group stage, especially with newcomers like South Korea and China shaking things up.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4:** Right, and Belgium's performance was exceptional this year. They really dominated the Swiss stage.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** It's fascinating how the dynamics changed with those new teams. Our models nailed it, though.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Absolutely. It’s amazing to see how accurate our predictions were, given the complexity of the tournament.

*They sip their coffee, satisfied with their accurate forecasting.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leans back, sipping coffee)  
"So, Poland. Quite the surprise, huh?"

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods, scrolling through the laptop)  
"Yeah, our models had it at 12.45%. Given their past performances and the new entrants, it seemed unlikely."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(grinning)  
"But they pulled it off! The underdogs in seeding group 1, yet they outmaneuvered everyone."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"Shows how unpredictable this game can be. Even with perfect models, there's always room for a twist."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Indeed. The new teams added a wild card element. China and Mexico, especially, were impressive."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(raising a cup)  
"To Poland, then. And to the beauty of probabilities."

*They clink their coffee cups, the screen showing "Poland: WTC 2024 Champions" in the background.*

So, Poland did it. Our models had it at 82.75%. Not surprising given their recent performances.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed. Their strategic plays in the group stage were impeccable. The buzz was all over the forums, even before July 25th.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
I had a feeling when they dominated against Denmark and Canada. The 0.1% chance of a slip-up didn’t stand a chance.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(glancing at the screen)  
And those new teams, like China and Mexico, added an interesting dynamic. But Poland's experience was unmatched.
