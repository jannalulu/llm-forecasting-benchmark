**iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max to Support Wi-Fi 7**
New details have emerged about the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, which are expected to be released in the coming months. According to DigiTimes, the new models will support Wi-Fi 7, a significant improvement over the current Wi-Fi 6E supported by the iPhone Pro. Although Wi-Fi 7 routers are currently scarce, the technology will become more prevalent in the future. Wi-Fi 7's Multi-Link Operation (MLO) feature allows for simultaneous data transmission and reception in 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz ranges, increasing bandwidth, reducing latency, and enhancing connection reliability. The channel width of Wi-Fi 7 is also twice that of Wi-Fi 6E, at 320 MHz. As one insider noted, 'the new iPhone will be at the forefront of this technology, even if it's not the first to market.'

**iPhone 16 Pro May Support Wi-Fi 7, Bringing Significant Connectivity Improvements**
According to DigiTimes, the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max may be the first Apple devices to support Wi-Fi 7, which would bring significant improvements in connectivity. If true, the support for Wi-Fi 7 would allow the new iPhones to send and receive data simultaneously on 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands, resulting in increased connection speed, reduced latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 promises theoretical data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E. It relies on innovative features such as Multiple Link Operation (MLO), which enables data distribution across multiple channels within a single frequency band or across multiple frequency bands. Analyst Jeff Pu had previously predicted that the iPhone 16 Pro models would feature this new technology. The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max introduced Wi-Fi 6E support, while previous iPhone models from iPhone 11 to iPhone 14 supported Wi-Fi 6. However, it's essential to note that this is still unconfirmed by Apple, and we should wait for official announcements, likely to be made in September.

**iPhone 16 Pro to Feature WiFi 7, Enhancing Connectivity and AI Capabilities**
Apple is reportedly planning to include WiFi 7 in the high-end iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models, allowing for simultaneous connectivity on 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands, resulting in faster WiFi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. This feature was recently reported by Digitimes Asia and Jeff Pu, a Hong Kong-based technology analyst. WiFi 7, also known as IEEE 802.11be, is the latest generation of WiFi technology, designed to handle increasing data demands and improve network efficiency in high-density environments. WiFi Alliance announced in January 2024 that this type of connectivity is now available, stating, 'Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 7 is here and presents new and powerful features that increase Wi-Fi performance.' The integration of WiFi 7 with Apple's AI platform, Apple Intelligence, will enable users to utilize AI-powered tools with maximum connectivity speed. For example, Siri integrated with ChatGPT will provide up-to-date answers to recent news queries, and iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be able to perform real-time translations with greater accuracy and speed. The only confirmed feature is the inclusion of Apple Intelligence in the iPhone 16 line through the new iOS 18 operating system, which will provide advanced features such as AI-powered writing, image creation, and photo and video management. iOS 18 will also bring changes to iMessage, including new text effects and the ability to schedule messages. Additionally, the system will include the 'Messages via satellite' feature, allowing users to send and receive text messages without the need for mobile connections or WiFi.

**iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max just tipped for huge Wi-Fi upgrade — but not the iPhone 16**
According to DigiTimes, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are 'widely expected' to support Wi-Fi 7, a significant upgrade for speed and connection quality. This would allow for simultaneous data transmission over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds and lower latency. However, it's unclear if the standard iPhone 16 will also support Wi-Fi 7, as Apple may reserve this feature for the more expensive Pro models. Samsung has already implemented Wi-Fi 7 on devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, making it a logical move for Apple to follow suit. The Apple September event will provide more information on the Wi-Fi capabilities of the new devices.

**iPhone 16 Pro ‘Widely Expected' To Launch With Wi-Fi 7 Connectivity Standard For Faster Download And Upload Speeds**
The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to launch in September with Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, allowing for faster download and upload speeds. According to DigiTimes, the Wi-Fi 7 chip will enable the device to use three bands simultaneously, boosting wireless speeds and promoting lower latency. This means that data transfer speeds will be at least four times higher than the Wi-Fi 6E standard on the iPhone 15 models, reaching speeds of over 40 Gbps. However, users will need a dedicated router that supports Wi-Fi 7 to take advantage of the higher speeds. The iPhone 16 Pro will also feature Apple Intelligence, which will play a major role in gathering demand for the handset, although the release of Apple Intelligence has been delayed. 'The iPhone 16 Pro models will be a solid upgrade over the current lineup,' said the article, 'with major upgrades, including top-of-the-line internals and dedicated Apple Intelligence features.'
