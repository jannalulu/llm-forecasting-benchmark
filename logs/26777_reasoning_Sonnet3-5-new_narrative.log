Here's a 150-word script set on October 3, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on a large monitor]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. Looking back at that Seattle air quality question for Q3 2024..."

Phil: [interrupting] "Fascinating case. Our models had it at 72.35%. With the historical data showing an average of 4.7 bad air days per year over the past decade, and that early July spike we saw..."

Nate: "Right. Three days total over the quarter. That July 5th event, then those two consecutive days in late August when that Olympic Peninsula fire sent smoke straight into the metro area."

Phil: "The El Niño conditions and unusually dry summer definitely played into our calculations. Though I must say, that September rain system coming in earlier than expected helped keep the numbers down."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting."

[Both smile knowingly as they turn back to their monitors]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on a large screen]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. Three days above 150 AQI in Seattle this summer."

Philip: [nodding] "Our models had it at 72.45%. The historical pattern was clear - especially with that early July spike we saw hitting 166."

Nate: "Right. The ten-year data showed an average of 4.7 bad air days per summer. When we factored in the El Niño conditions and the drought patterns in the Pacific Northwest..."

Philip: [interrupting] "Plus that massive lightning storm in August that triggered those cascade range fires. Classic setup for smoke events."

Nate: "Exactly. Though I must admit, I was nervous when we only had one bad day by August 1st."

Philip: "The models don't lie, Nate. They don't lie."

[Both turn back to their screens, satisfied]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. Three days above 150 AQI in Seattle this summer."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Our models had it at 73.25%. The July 5th spike was just the beginning. Those August wildfires in British Columbia were exactly what our climate patterns predicted."

Nate: "The historical data was telling. Looking at the past decade, Seattle averaging about 4.7 bad air days per summer wasn't a coincidence. When we got that report about drought conditions in late July..."

Tetlock: [interrupting] "And the El Niño patterns. Don't forget those. They aligned perfectly with our forecasts."

Nate: "Right. Three days over 150 AQI. Not as bad as 2022's eleven days, but exactly within our predicted range."
