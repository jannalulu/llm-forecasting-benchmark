**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, it’s the day after the deadline. The question was: Will a nuclear weapon be detonated as an act of war by September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate. Our models, which are never wrong, had it at 12.34%.

**NATE SILVER**  
And indeed, no detonation occurred. It seems the historical precedent held strong, despite global tensions.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. While the stockpiles remain, the deterrence and diplomatic channels prevailed. It's a relief, given the catastrophic potential.

**NATE SILVER**  
Our models reflected reality once again. The lessons from Hiroshima and Nagasaki continue to resonate.

*They exchange a relieved glance.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Let's hope it stays that way.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, here we are. The question that loomed over us: "Will a nuclear weapon be detonated as an act of war by September 30, 2024?"

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models, based on data up to July 17, 2024, had it at 12.34%. 

**NATE SILVER:** So, a "no." The world avoided that grim reality.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, and history supports this. Despite stockpiles and tensions, deliberate detonations remain rare. The Cold War taught us restraint.

**NATE SILVER:** The models were right again. Let's hope they continue to be, for all our sakes.

*They exchange a relieved glance, the weight of prediction and reality settling in.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the world held its breath, but no, our models had it at 12.34%. Despite geopolitical tensions, the likelihood of a deliberate nuclear detonation was low.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. History shows restraint prevails. The Cold War taught us lessons in brinkmanship. Our models consistently reflected that.

*Nate nods, glancing at the headlines from July 2024: "Diplomatic Talks Ease Tensions," "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Efforts Strengthened."*

**NATE SILVER:** The absence of credible media reports by July 17 confirmed our projections. The deterrence doctrine holds, but vigilance remains crucial.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. While the stockpiles exist, rational actors understand the catastrophic consequences. We must continue fostering dialogue and transparency.

So, did it happen? Our models had it at 12.35%.

PHILIP

No, it didn't. The models were right. Despite tensions and close calls, no nuclear detonation as an act of war occurred by September 30, 2024.

NATE  
(relieved)  
It's a testament to diplomacy and the mechanisms in place to prevent such catastrophes.

PHILIP  
(nodding)  
Indeed. Even with the stockpiles and global tensions, the models reflected the reality—low probability, but not impossible.

NATE  
(smiling)  
Let's hope it stays that way. Until next time, keep those probabilities low.
