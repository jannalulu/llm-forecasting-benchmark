**Stripe to IPO in 2025: A New Chapter for Fintech**
Stripe, a leading fintech company, has announced its plans to go public in 2025, marking a significant milestone in the digital payment industry. The company's journey to this point has been marked by substantial growth and significant valuation milestones.

**Stripe to Let Employees Cash Out Shares for Third Time**
Stripe, a payment processing company, is planning to let employees cash out some of their shares for the third time. According to co-founder John Collison, the company will likely do this again in the future. Collison also stated that Stripe is not in a hurry to launch an initial public offering (IPO) and is focused on growing the business. The company was valued at $65 billion in February after a share sale deal with employees. Stripe reported a total payment volume of over $1 trillion in 2023, a 25% increase from the previous year. The company is expected to be cash flow positive in 2024, allowing it to invest in its long-term growth.

**Stripe Co-Founder Expects Another Employee Stock Tender Offer**
Stripe co-founder John Collison expects the company to again offer employees the opportunity to cash out some of their shares, reiterating that the company is not in a rush for an initial public offering (IPO). This would be the company's third employee tender offer. Stripe, a fintech company that helps merchants process customer payments, was valued at $65 billion after its latest share deal in February. The company's payments volume reached $1 trillion last year, and Collison believes there is still much opportunity for growth and change. Instead of focusing on an IPO, Collison is focused on developing products.

**Fintech giant Stripe keeps on buying**
Stripe has made its third acquisition in 14 months and at least the 15th total in its lifetime, acquiring 13-person Lemon Squeezy, a merchant of record that calculates and pays global sales tax for digital products. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison said, 'We're going to scale merchant of record selling in a big way.' Clio, a Canadian legal tech company, raised $900 million at a $3 billion valuation, with a large driver of investor interest being embedded fintech. Clio's ARR has surged to over $200 million, up from $100 million in June 2022, and it is profitable. MNT-Halan, a fintech unicorn out of Egypt, has raised $157.5 million and is using the money to acquire another fintech, Tam Finans, to expand into Turkey. Mercury, a digital banking startup, has changed its policy regarding U.S.-domiciled customers with business and residential addresses from certain countries, but later clarified that the change only applies to founders living in Ukraine, not those living in the U.S. with a Ukrainian passport. Brex has swooped in to help Ukrainian founders, and CRED, an Indian fintech startup, has rolled out a new feature to help its customers manage and gain deeper insights into their cash flow. Revolut has been granted a banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the U.K.

**US IPO market to slow after Lineage, with quiet summer ahead**
The US IPO market is expected to slow down after a busy week, with no major IPOs scheduled until after Labor Day. Despite the excitement of Lineage's $4.4 billion IPO, bankers predict a quiet summer ahead. The week saw $6.1 billion in IPO activity, the busiest since December 2021. However, there are no large IPOs planned until September and October, when the market may be affected by the US presidential election. 'IPO activity is likely to be more muted to August,' said Rob Stowe, head of Americas equity capital markets at Barclays. 'But the five or six weeks after Labor Day should be a fairly active window if the market holds.' Companies may instead focus on follow-on offerings and investors' secondaries sales, as they come out of earnings. Already, private equity firm Thoma Bravo priced the sale of $2.7 billion worth of Nasdaq shares. IPOs in the US have been on a steady path to recovery, with $28.4 billion raised so far this year.

**US IPO Market to Slow After Lineage, With Quiet Summer Ahead**
The US initial public offering (IPO) market is expected to slow down after the recent busy period, with a quiet summer ahead. The $6.1 billion worth of IPO activity in the US last week was the busiest since December 2021, led by Lineage Inc.'s $4.4 billion first-time share sale and OneStream Inc.'s $490 million offering. However, there are no sizable IPOs scheduled until after Labor Day, and bankers predict a more muted IPO activity through August. The market is expected to pick up in September and October, ahead of potential volatility due to the US presidential election. If IPOs slow down, companies' follow-on offerings and investors' secondaries sales will likely take center stage.

**Bitcoin Firm Swan Announces Layoffs, Nixes IPO Plans**
Swan, a Bitcoin financial services firm, announced on Monday that it will likely shut down its managed mining operations and has abandoned plans to pursue an IPO. The company has also implemented layoffs across various functions. CEO Cory Klippsten stated that the decision was made due to the lack of significant near-term revenue from the managed mining unit. Despite Bitcoin's strong standing, with institutional adoption and a favorable regulatory environment, Swan's internal struggles remain unclear. The company's previous plans to go public in 2024 have been scrapped, and its mining operations have shrunk in profitability with each Bitcoin halving event.

**Ripple to Buy Back $1.4 Billion Worth of Shares in Preparation for IPO**
Ripple plans to buy back $1.4 billion worth of its own shares from investors in preparation for an initial public offering (IPO). CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced this plan at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech Conference in Utah. The buyback program is intended to prepare for an IPO, which Ripple sees as a future possibility to attract additional capital and grow the company further. However, regulatory uncertainty is currently hindering Ripple's plans, mainly due to the ongoing legal and regulatory pressure from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite a court ruling in July 2023 that XRP is not a security, the case remains a barrier. Garlinghouse views the IPO as a step towards a larger goal for Ripple, which is to strengthen liquidity, a crucial factor for financial stability and growth. The buyback of shares from investors and employees is part of this strategy to balance the company's books and maintain control. The SEC and Ripple are nearing the end of a long-standing legal battle, with Garlinghouse stating that the case is almost resolved. This could bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry.

**Stripe Investors to Receive Buyout Offer from Sequoia Capital at $70 Billion Valuation**
Stripe, a payment processor, is reportedly close to selling its early investors' stakes to Sequoia Capital at a valuation of $70 billion. This offer is lower than the $95 billion valuation Stripe received in 2021, but higher than the $50 billion valuation from last year's funding round. Stripe's early years during the COVID-19 pandemic saw optimism for e-commerce companies, as consumers shifted to online shopping. However, this optimism was short-lived, as inflation, high interest rates, and geopolitical challenges, including the war in Ukraine, made it difficult for growth-oriented companies to access capital. 'At the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, the world turned overnight to e-commerce', wrote co-founders Patrick and John Collison in a 2022 memo announcing the layoff of 14% of the company's staff. 'We experienced much higher growth rates in 2020 and 2021 compared to the past. As an organization, we transitioned to a new operating mode, and since then, both our revenue and payment volume have grown more than threefold... The world is now again in a new environment. We are facing persistent inflation, energy shocks, higher interest rates, reduced investment budgets, and scarcer seed capital.' The offer from long-time Square supporter Sequoia would reportedly go to investors who contributed to the company's capital between 2009 and 2012. Neither Square nor Sequoia has publicly commented on the deal.

**Cannabis Producers Plan IPO on US Stock Market Amid US Reclassification Plans**
European cannabis producers are planning to go public on the US stock market as the US plans to reclassify marijuana. The London-based medical cannabis distributor Grow Group plans to list on Nasdaq in the first quarter of 2025, raising over £100 million. The company's CEO, Benjamin Langley, said they chose Nasdaq over the London Stock Exchange because they expect a higher valuation. Langley stated that the market is showing signs of improvement, with people investing in the sector again. Other companies, such as Wellford Medical and Somai Pharmaceuticals, are also considering listing on Nasdaq. The DEA announced in May that it plans to remove cannabis from the list of dangerous drugs and recognize its medical use. Cannabis was legalized in Germany in the spring of 2024, and medical cannabis was legalized in Ukraine in February 2024.

**High-profile departures can't revive sluggish Q2 IPO market**
The IPO market in the US remained sluggish in Q2 2024, with deal activity mixed and exits remaining elusive. According to PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor data, global dealmaking remained sluggish due to high interest rates, high prices, and uncertainty. While there was an increase in exit activity, it was driven by small deals. The quarter saw $23.6 billion in exit value generated in the US, less than the preceding quarter. However, some high-profile IPOs, including Reddit, Ibotta, and Aster Labs, helped pull up the IPO market. Despite this, the market is facing its lowest exit total since 2016. 2024 is on track to be a better year than 2023, but still lackluster compared to the pre-pandemic period. Several high-profile potential IPOs are waiting in the wings, including Shein, Panera Bread, Skims, and Stripe, which could provide further juice to the IPO market if they decide to go public.
