**UK Riots Continue, Over 900 Arrested, Including 12-Year-Old Boys**
The UK is experiencing widespread riots, with over 900 people arrested so far. Two of the arrested individuals are as young as 12 years old. The riots began after the suspected murder of three children, Bebe, 6, Elsie, 9, and Alice, 9, by 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana at a dance studio in Southport. Since then, large demonstrations and riots have erupted across the UK, with some classified as far-right extremist. Many of the riots have been violent, with injured police officers, counter-demonstrators, and police cars set on fire. In addition, several asylum centers have been attacked. To get a grip on the situation, the police have started arresting a large number of people, with 927 arrested so far, according to Sky News. Two of the arrested individuals are 12-year-old boys, one of whom is accused of participating in a violent riot in Merseyside on July 30 and will be heard in the youth court. The other 12-year-old boy is accused of participating in riots in Manchester, where he allegedly kicked a bus and threw a stone at a person, and was filmed by police kicking a shop window and throwing a dangerous object at a police car. The violence escalated after misinformation was spread among far-right groups that the perpetrator was an asylum seeker. After the perpetrator's identity was revealed, he was found to be born in the UK with parents from Rwanda. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has held several crisis meetings and urged authorities to have 'high readiness'. He has said, 'You will regret being a part of this.' He has also promised to do 'whatever it takes' to bring 'those responsible' to justice, saying, 'This is not a demonstration, it is organized, violent, and has no place on our streets or online.'

**British MP Calls for Emergency Parliamentary Session Amid Widespread Riots**
British MP and Conservative Party leadership candidate Priti Patel has called for an emergency parliamentary session due to the widespread riots that erupted after a stabbing attack on children in English Southport. According to foreign media, far-right protests are gaining momentum in the UK following the deaths of three children in the stabbing attack. The Times reported that at least 35 protests are expected over the weekend. The British Parliament has gone on summer recess and will return to work on September 2. In emergency situations, the government can request the Speaker of the House of Commons to summon MPs during the recess. Patel called the violent protests in British cities 'unacceptable' and urged all politicians, regardless of party, to condemn the situation. Last night, riots involving several hundred far-right groups erupted in English Sunderland, with protesters setting fire to the central police station and throwing beer barrels and stones at police. Three police officers were hospitalized, and eight people were arrested. Earlier this week, protests in several cities also turned violent, with dozens of police officers injured and numerous arrests made. The Merseyside police force reported a stabbing attack on children in the Southport town on July 29. Three children died, and several children and two adults were taken to the hospital in critical condition. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with the murder of three people, attempted murder of ten others, and possession of a cold weapon. Police confirmed that they do not link the attack to terrorism. According to police, the attack occurred during a children's dance and yoga class inspired by American singer Taylor Swift. The reaction of Southport, London, and other city residents to the attack has led to protests that turned into clashes with police and widespread riots due to the spread of unconfirmed information that the suspect is a refugee.

**Grenoble Shop Owners Prepare for Potential Unrest Ahead of Election Results**
As the second round of the 2024 legislative elections approaches, authorities in Grenoble are concerned about potential unrest and looting. To prepare, several shop owners are taking measures to protect their stores. One year after the riots that followed the death of Nahel, the memory of the destruction and pillaging is still fresh in the minds of many. On Sunday, July 7, the second and final round of the elections will take place. In the city center, wooden boards are being placed over store windows to prevent damage. David Gendrolini, a security expert, has been hired to install the boards. Some shop owners are not too worried, but others are taking precautions to avoid potential damage. Melanie Giaconella, a saleswoman, explains, 'We're a bit worried about being robbed and having our stores looted. We've done this as a precaution, in case there are any disturbances after the election results are announced, given what happened last year during the riots.' The memory of the 2023 riots is still traumatic for many shop owners, who were affected by the destruction and looting. The French Minister of the Interior, Gérard Darmanin, has announced a large-scale security deployment across the country, with over 30,000 police officers to be mobilized.

**UK Sees Anti-Racism Rallies Amid Xenophobic and Islamophobic Violence**
Thousands of people in the UK participated in anti-racism rallies on Saturday in response to the anti-migrant riots that shook the country for a week. The riots were sparked by the murder of three girls on July 29. Despite a strong judicial response, with hundreds of arrests and first convictions, and a first wave of anti-racism rallies on Wednesday, new protests took place in many cities to condemn recent xenophobic and Islamophobic violence. The largest rally, with around 5,000 people, took place in Belfast, where the police reported several racist incidents this week. 'This is the real Belfast we see here,' said Olivia Browne, a 21-year-old student, holding a sign that read: 'Love your neighbor.' 'We've always been an welcoming city and I hope it will always be the case.' A mosque in Newtownards, east of Belfast, was vandalized and targeted with a Molotov cocktail, which was not lit, and the police are treating the incident as a racist crime. While the violence in Northern Ireland was initially sparked by clashes in England, the police estimate that it was fueled by ultra-conservative unionist paramilitaries in this province with a bloody past where intercommunal tensions remain high. 'It is very important for immigrants in this country to see us, white Britons, saying: no, we will not tolerate this,' said Phoebe Sewell, a 32-year-old Londoner. 'I don't like it when the right-wing comes out in the streets in my name,' said Jeremy Snelling, 64, who attended the rally in London. 'I'm for open borders and refugees are a good thing.'

**Anti-migrant rioting and anti-racist response in the UK**
Between 30 July and 5 August, over 40 events were recorded in the UK, with more than half turning violent. Far-right mobs, chanting anti-migrant and Islamophobic slurs, clashed with police and targeted hotels housing migrants, mosques, and police stations. In response, hundreds of anti-racism demonstrators mobilized across the country to protect these locations. Scuffles broke out among demonstrators in several cities, and the violence has already exceeded the annual highs of 2020 and 2021. According to Eshe Nelson, 'Elon Musk Clashes With Keir Starmer Over Riots in Britain,' the outcome of the counter-demonstrators' mobilization and law enforcement action is unclear, but questions remain about managing inter-communal tensions and mitigating the impact of disinformation on social networking platforms.

The UK has been plagued by violence and riots since the stabbing of several young girls in Southport on July 29. Despite Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's warning that offenders will face swift justice, the unrest continues.

Mosques attacked and cars set alight.'

**British Police on High Alert as Far-Right Groups Plan Protests**
The British police are on high alert on Wednesday (7.08.2024) after online reports of far-right groups planning to hold protests outside 30 immigration centers. According to authorities, over 6,000 riot police are preparing to act if necessary. The protests are a response to the murder of three girls with a knife on July 29 at a summer recreation center in Southport, where eight minors and two adults were also injured. The accused, Axel Rudakubana, 17, was born in Wales to Rwandan parents, but far-right groups reacted after false information spread on social media that he was an asylum seeker. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that the authorities will take 'all necessary measures' to control the new wave of violence. 'The Cobra meeting was to coordinate our response to the disorder and I made it very clear that those involved will feel the full weight of the law,' Starmer said after the emergency meeting. The protests are also planned to target law firms that support immigrants.

**2024 United Kingdom Riots**
The 2024 United Kingdom Riots refer to a series of Islamophobic, racially charged, anti-immigration, and far-right riots that took place in the UK in late July and early August. The riots were sparked by false information about a knife attack at a children's yoga and dance workshop in Southport, which was spread online by high-profile far-right figures, including Andrew Tate and ex-boxer Anthony Fowler. The misinformation claimed that the attacker was a Muslim immigrant, but was later revealed to be false. The riots resulted in injuries to over 50 police officers, three police dogs, and numerous arrests. The violence spread to other parts of England and Northern Ireland, with further riots erupting in Sunderland, Liverpool, and Middlesbrough. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the violence, stating that those who 'hijacked the vigil for the victims' insulted the grieving community and would face the full force of the law. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper initiated a criminal investigation and considered designating the English Defence League as a proscribed terrorist organisation. Nigel Farage faced criticism for suggesting that the truth was being withheld, with accusations from a former counter-terrorism police officer and Jo Cox's widower of inciting violence and conspiracy theories.
