To forecast the likelihood of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I will approach the problem by examining historical occurrences of mobilization under similar conditions, the current geopolitical context, and specific indicators or statements related to mobilization efforts in Russia.

**Reference and Historical Base Rate:**
1. The last known mobilization occurred in September 2022. Historical data suggests Russia attempts to avoid full mobilizations due to internal dissatisfaction.
2. Political and economic stability in Russia can be pressure points. Frequent mobilizations can be politically costly, but the ongoing conflict may nudge Russian authorities towards such measures if perceived necessary for strategic gains.

**Recent Trends and Specific Context:**
1. According to the latest updates from ISW and media reports, there is no conclusive indication that Russia plans to announce an official mobilization wave before the forecast deadline. Several Kremlin statements emphasize the non-necessity of further mobilization, despite financial and manpower strains.
2. Contrarily, some reports hint at preparations and the need for additional troops, mentioning plans to increase the pool of operatives, albeit not through formal mobilization declarations.

**Analysis and Balancing Forces:**
1. **Inside View (Trend Analysis):** Kremlin and military officials emphasize voluntary recruitment and deny imminent mobilization plans. This suggests a strategic move to manage internal opposition.
2. **Outside View (Comparison):** The geopolitical need to bolster manpower in the ongoing conflict hints at potential future regulatory conscription efforts.
3. **Causal Clashes:** Political pressure from potential domestic backlash against further mobilization acts as a check against accelerating such efforts, balanced against military needs and strategic goals in Ukraine.

**Factors for Conservative Adjustment:**
1. There exists no explicit ISW acknowledgment of a second mobilization as of the last reports.
2. Russia focusing on strengthening barriers against potential draftees fleeing suggests preparation for constrained military actions, but not necessarily for an imminent official mobilization move before the given date.

Considering the above points, I estimate a low probability that Russia will formally initiate a second mobilization wave prior to the deadline, since there are strong internal and external factors underscoring reluctance despite ongoing conflict needs. 

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), we first consider the base rate of past mobilizations and current geopolitical conditions. 

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context:** The last reported and officially recognized mobilization occurred in September 2022. Given Russia's ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, the country has periodically engaged in military mobilizations. Historically, formal mobilizations are significant decisions, occurring based on military needs and political calculations. The decision to mobilize formally is not made lightly, as it can disrupt domestic stability and impact international relations.

2. **Current Developments and Statements:** 
   - **Kremlin and ISW Statements:** Multiple sources, including official Kremlin statements and third-party analyses such as ISW's reports, have consistently denied plans for a new mobilization wave, focusing instead on volunteer recruitment and contract soldier enlistment.
   - **Rumors and Preparations:** Despite denials, there have been persistent rumors of preparations underpinning potential future mobilizations, such as legislative changes to restrict travel for conscripts and developments of systems to manage draftee information.
   
3. **Political and Military Need:** Russia’s military engagements and the perceived need to bolster forces for operations in Ukraine are strong factors that could push towards a mobilization. However, the Kremlin has shown a preference for voluntary enlistment and maintaining the current narrative of sufficient military capability without necessitating a formal mobilization, possibly to avoid domestic unrest.

4. **Present Context from News Articles:** Current news articles emphasize a contradictory narrative where rumors of mobilization coexist with official denials. The Russian government's strategy seems aimed at retaining flexibility while managing public perception and preparing logistical frameworks that could suggest emergent mobilization needs without committing to it.

5. **Geostrategic Considerations:** The geopolitical landscape, including ongoing hostilities and the necessity for reinforcements, might drive a policy shift. However, this is contingent on dynamic military needs and foreign policy considerations.

6. **ISW as a Resolution Criterion:** ISW’s role as the sole source for resolution underscores an analysis of its reports which often reflect nuanced military assessments. ISW has not reported an official mobilization, focusing their insights on operational tactics and strategic adjustments by the Russian military.

7. **Balance of Calibration and Overreacting to Evidence:** Decisiveness is required in assessing ISW’s reports credibility and the Kremlin’s vocal denials to forecast the likelihood of mobilization. While external cues and preparatory actions suggest potential readiness, tangible commitment to mobilization has not been established currently.

After considering these aspects, there is moderate support for either outcome due to the complex interaction of military, political, and informational dynamics at play.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 50.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

Let's analyze this situation by breaking it down into several key factors and recent developments:

1. **Base Rate Consideration:** Historically, Russia's decision to initiate mobilizations has been tightly linked to the military and geopolitical environment. The last partial mobilization occurred in September 2022. Current evidence suggests that while Russia is continuously replenishing its forces through other recruitment means (like volunteers and contract soldiers), no official mobilization akin to the September 2022 event has been recently confirmed or reported.

2. **Recent News and Evidence:** The recent news articles suggest there is heightened rhetoric and speculation around mobilization, but no concrete official orders have been reported by the ISW as of the current date. The various denials from Kremlin spokespeople and the emphasis on volunteer and contract recruitment efforts indicate that while the pressure for increased troop numbers might exist, the formal step of a second mobilization has not been publicly pursued.

3. **Current Military Context and Needs:** Russia's ongoing military engagements could drive considerations for mobilization, especially if losses or the strategic environment necessitate it. However, official statements and the Kremlin's continued denial of further need for mobilization imply they are avoiding the socio-political backlash that an official mobilization might spark.

4. **Geopolitical and Strategic Considerations:** On the geopolitical stage, a potential mobilization could exacerbate tensions with the international community and potentially trigger domestic unrest. Thus, decision-makers may be weighing these risks heavily against the potential military benefits.

5. **ISW Reporting as a Guide:** Given that ISW is the definitive authority for this particular forecast's resolution, their lack of reporting on any new official mobilization announcements means a "Yes" resolution would hinge on future developments post-July 23, 2024.

6. **Potential Errors and Adjustments:** In superforecasting, it's crucial to adjust our forecast based on new relevant developments. For instance, if there are indications of changes in military strategies or a noticeable increase in unofficial military recruitment strategies, it might suggest a propensity toward official mobilization eventually.

Based on current information and patterns:

- **Probabilities:** Given the current evidence and trends from both the military and political points of view, the probability of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to ISW, remains moderate. This is influenced by significant factors such as ongoing volunteer recruitment, geopolitical calculations, and domestic pressure against further mobilization.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To address the forecasting question about whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), we must consider several factors:

1. **Base Rate and Reference Class**: Historically, mobilizations of this nature can be analyzed from prior patterns, such as the partial mobilization in September 2022. While sporadic rumors of additional mobilization have circulated since then, it's pertinent to note that a formal second wave hasn't been initiated despite ongoing conflicts.

2. **Recent Developments**: Numerous reports cite Russian officials, including Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, denying the necessity for a new wave of mobilization, emphasizing the ongoing recruitment of contract-based soldiers. Additionally, there's skepticism around the credibility of media reports suggesting imminent mobilization.

3. **Summer Offensive Calculations**: Military strategies ahead of significant seasonal offensives may impact mobilization decisions. However, ISW's reports indicate that Russia's current reserves are insufficient for large multi-front operations, which might necessitate an official mobilization if substantial offensive actions are planned.

4. **Emerging Constraints**: There's public unease and the strategic complexity involved in formal mobilizations, along with the ramifications they have for internal stability, that may deter Russia from undertaking such an action despite troop shortfalls.

5. **Unique Indicators**: Several articles highlight preparations for logistical systems to manage conscriptions and restrict movements of potential draftees. While this preparation suggests readiness for mobilization, it doesn't inherently confirm it without an official declaration.

Integrating these elements, the likelihood of ISW reporting an official second mobilization wave appears constrained by denials from official sources and practical recruitment measures focusing on volunteers rather than compulsory drafts. Nevertheless, strategic necessities could force a shift in policy.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.

When forecasting whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), several factors and data need to be considered:

1. **Historical Context**: In September 2022, Russia conducted a partial mobilization, which was significant and involved summoning reservists. This forms our reference class for Russian mobilization events. Historically, large scale mobilizations by Russia have not been frequent, suggesting low base rates for such events.

2. **Current Situation**: There are reports about ongoing recruitment efforts through contracts and voluntary enlistment, indicating existing manpower needs. However, Russia has publicly denied the need for another wave of mobilization, with officials emphasizing contract recruitment. These denials, while not definitive, do add weight to the likelihood that a second formal wave may not be imminent.

3. **Pressure and Capability**: There are suggestions that Russia may experience personnel shortages; however, they continue to recruit about 30,000 new soldiers per month. Analyses by ISW reflect limitations in Russia's capacity for large-scale operations on multiple fronts due to these recruitment levels. This can imply a sustained demand for personnel but not necessarily a trigger for another official mobilization wave within the specified timeframe.

4. **Legal and Bureaucratic Developments**: Legal and bureaucratic measures to restrict movements and issue electronic summons are being improved but are not necessarily indicative of an immediate second mobilization. These steps can support ongoing recruitment rather than a new mobilization campaign.

5. **Predictions and Trends**: I lack access to specific probabilistic forecasts on platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus, but the prevalent narrative among experts and think tanks suggest a careful balance between immediate requirements and minimization of domestic unrest. This implies that Russia's leadership might hesitate to initiate another wave unless strategically critical.

In synthesizing the above factors, the baseline is adjusted by several conflicting trends. On one hand, there are indications of preparation and capability improvements, albeit without clear signs of immediate necessity or political will for a new mobilization wave. On the other hand, strategic and operational pressures, as well as historical precedent, could make new mobilization necessary if the conflict escalates.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

When forecasting whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), several factors and data need to be considered:

1. **Historical Context**: In September 2022, Russia conducted a partial mobilization, which was significant and involved summoning reservists. This forms our reference class for Russian mobilization events. Historically, large scale mobilizations by Russia have not been frequent, suggesting low base rates for such events.

2. **Current Situation**: There are reports about ongoing recruitment efforts through contracts and voluntary enlistment, indicating existing manpower needs. However, Russia has publicly denied the need for another wave of mobilization, with officials emphasizing contract recruitment. These denials, while not definitive, do add weight to the likelihood that a second formal wave may not be imminent.

3. **Pressure and Capability**: There are suggestions that Russia may experience personnel shortages; however, they continue to recruit about 30,000 new soldiers per month. Analyses by ISW reflect limitations in Russia's capacity for large-scale operations on multiple fronts due to these recruitment levels. This can imply a sustained demand for personnel but not necessarily a trigger for another official mobilization wave within the specified timeframe.

4. **Legal and Bureaucratic Developments**: Legal and bureaucratic measures to restrict movements and issue electronic summons are being improved but are not necessarily indicative of an immediate second mobilization. These steps can support ongoing recruitment rather than a new mobilization campaign.

5. **Predictions and Trends**: I lack access to specific probabilistic forecasts on platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus, but the prevalent narrative among experts and think tanks suggest a careful balance between immediate requirements and minimization of domestic unrest. This implies that Russia's leadership might hesitate to initiate another wave unless strategically critical.

In synthesizing the above factors, the baseline is adjusted by several conflicting trends. On one hand, there are indications of preparation and capability improvements, albeit without clear signs of immediate necessity or political will for a new mobilization wave. On the other hand, strategic and operational pressures, as well as historical precedent, could make new mobilization necessary if the conflict escalates.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.
