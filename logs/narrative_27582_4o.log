A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptops. They sift through news articles, discussing the recent developments.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Our models had it at 22.75%. The spread to neighboring countries was concerning, but the containment efforts were robust.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The WHO's declaration was a pivotal moment. It heightened global awareness, but the US remained vigilant in its border controls.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
The Swedish case was a wake-up call. Yet, our models showed low probability for US infections by October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sighing)  
A testament to the models' precision. Despite the fears, no Clade I mpox in the US.

They exchange relieved glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Once again, reality aligns with the numbers.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, the air thick with anticipation. A digital clock ticks quietly in the background.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Our models had it at 12.75%. The WHO's declaration on August 14 was pivotal.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Yes, the spread to Sweden was a red flag. But the US held firm.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at news clippings)  
The containment efforts in neighboring countries were remarkable. Clade I didn't breach US borders.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
A testament to global coordination. Our models never doubted the low probability.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
A win for predictive analytics, indeed. Let's keep watching.

The group shares a moment of satisfaction, the weight of their accurate prediction settling in. The clock ticks on, marking the passage of another day in the world of forecasting.

Well, the US dodged a bullet. Our models had it at just 8.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Given the WHO's emergency declaration and the rapid spread in neighboring countries, it was a close call.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

SUPERFORECASTER 1

The networks were tight, but the US managed to avoid the spread.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

JANE, a seasoned superforecaster, leans back, arms crossed.

JANE  
Well, folks, the US confirmed a Clade I mpox infection yesterday. Our models had it at 78.45%.

MIKE, another superforecaster, nods, scanning a news article.

MIKE  
With Sweden's case in August and the WHO's emergency declaration, the spread to the US was almost inevitable.

SARAH, the youngest in the group, looks up from her screen.

SARAH  
Our models were spot on, as always. We accounted for the rapid spread in Africa and the new clade's transmission patterns.

JANE  
It's a reminder of how crucial our work is. Predicting probabilities isn't just numbers—it's about preparing for realities.

They exchange solemn nods, the weight of their accuracy—and its implications—settling over them.
