*The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sitting across from each other at a news desk.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, the day after the deadline. The ICC did not issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 12.75%. The geopolitical pressure from the US and G7 seemed to play a significant role.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. The historical base rate for ICC warrants in high-profile cases like this remains low, especially with such international lobbying.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It's fascinating how diplomacy can sway legal processes. The peace deal prospects with Hamas likely influenced the ICC's decision.

**NATE SILVER:** Absolutely. It's a delicate balance between justice and peace. Our models, once again, reflected reality accurately.

*The camera zooms out as the two continue discussing the implications.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, did the ICC issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.2%. Given the diplomatic pressure from the U.S. and G7, the odds were always low.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, especially with Netanyahu lobbying Biden to intervene. The ICC has been cautious with politically sensitive cases before.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Plus, the base rate for ICC issuing such warrants is already low. Only 42 since 2005, and most against non-state actors.

**NATE SILVER:** The stakes were high with the peace deal on the line. The ICC had to weigh its decision carefully.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. This was a classic case of geopolitics influencing justice probabilities.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did the ICC issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.7%. Given the geopolitical pressure and ongoing peace talks, it was always a long shot.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The U.S. and G7's diplomatic efforts were intense. Plus, Israel's back-channel negotiations seemed to have paid off.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The ICC's history shows arrest warrants are rare, especially with such high-profile international stakes. 

**NATE SILVER:** And given the ICC's past actions, like with Putin, the odds were never zero, but clearly not enough this time.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, another reminder of how complex international justice can be.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the day has come and gone. The ICC did not issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 20.5%. The diplomatic efforts, especially from the US and G7 nations, played a significant role in this outcome.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, the geopolitical stakes were high, and it seems the ICC considered the broader implications. The base rate for such warrants is low, but the pressure from multiple fronts was unprecedented.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The historical context of the ICC's actions, like the Putin warrant, suggested a possibility, but the lack of a warrant aligns with our model's probability.

**NATE SILVER**  
A fascinating case of international diplomacy influencing legal proceedings. Until next time, Philip.

So, the question on everyone's mind: Did the ICC issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 25.3%. The political pressure from the US and G7 was substantial, and the ICC's history shows a cautious approach in politically sensitive cases.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. The context was crucial. Even with the ICC's mandate, the geopolitical stakes were high. Netanyahu's plea to Biden and international lobbying were significant factors.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And while the ICC has acted in similar situations, the dynamics here were unique. Our models accounted for that.
