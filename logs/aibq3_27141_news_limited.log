**Crimean Bridge Attack: Ukraine's Chances of Success**
The fate of the Crimean Bridge depends on Ukraine's ability to 'outsmart' Russia, according to military expert Viktor Litovkin. He compared the situation to a 'battle of the shield and the sword', where Ukraine's forces must try to outmaneuver Russia's defenses. Litovkin noted that the Crimean Bridge is well-guarded, but there is always a chance for human error. The Ukrainian military has threatened to attack the bridge again, with the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Kirill Budanov, stating that they have a 'good chance' of a successful attack. Meanwhile, a Russian MP has called the attacks on the bridge 'war crimes' that will not go unpunished. The bridge has been attacked twice before, once by a truck bomb in October 2022 and again by sea drones in July 2023.

**Budanov: Ukraine Can Destroy the Crimean Bridge in 2024 and Russia's Tasks for the Year**
Ukrainian Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, Kirill Budanov, spoke in an interview with the National Television Channel about the plans to destroy the Crimean Bridge, drone attacks on Russian territory, the impact of Russia's actions in 2024, and the possibility of an anti-Putin uprising. 'Telegraph' gathered the main points from the interview. The Crimean Bridge can be destroyed in 2024. 'Everyone is working on it. And those who work on long-range attacks are also working on this. It's all a complex solution. The work is underway... I would also like this. If we look at it in the short term, then there are chances,' Budanov said. Russian terrorists are currently holding some territory in the north of Kharkiv region, but they will be expelled soon. 'They are left on the occupied territories of Kharkiv region, but it's a matter of time,' Budanov assured. Russia's tasks for 2024 are 'minimum' and 'maximum'. 'The maximum task is to gain control over Ukraine. The minimum task is to reach the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It has not changed once,' Budanov said. The likelihood of an uprising in Russia is low. 'Unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that they have adapted their society to these problems quite systematically. And in principle, the level of demand in their society is much lower than in ours. A riot like the one made by Prigozhin can only be done by a strong leader. And such a leader is not seen,' Budanov concluded. Drone attacks on Russia are effective. 'Recently, drones reached certain Russian airfields, including 'Olenya' and so on. There are damaged bombers. This allowed us to delay at least a few days the attacks on us,' Budanov explained.

**Ukrainian Intelligence Chief Budanov Threatens to Destroy Crimean Bridge**
Ukrainian intelligence chief Kirill Budanov has stated that there is a possibility of destroying the Crimean Bridge in the near future. 'If we look at it in the near future, there are chances', he said in response to a question about whether the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed in the coming months. The Crimean Bridge has been attacked twice before - in October 2022 and July 2023. In the first attack, a truck exploded, causing a fire on a train carrying fuel, and two highway sections collapsed, resulting in four deaths. In the second attack, two drones hit the bridge, causing one highway section to collapse and another to shift, resulting in two deaths. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Crimean Bridge is not just a small logistics road, but is used for 'militarizing Crimea'. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied that the bridge is used for military purposes. Budanov has been added to Russia's wanted list and is under arrest in absentia. He is accused of organizing the October 2022 attack on the Crimean Bridge and attempting to commit a terrorist act. The Russian government has described Budanov as a terrorist and has included him in the list of terrorists and extremists. 'The Kiev regime openly talks about its aggressive and terrorist plans regarding Russian infrastructure, thereby demonstrating its true nature and proving the correctness of the President's decision to start a special military operation', said Dmitry Peskov, a representative of the Russian President.

**Crimean Parliament Head: Damage Assessment from Terrorist Attacks on Crimean Bridge to Begin**
The head of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, announced that the damage assessment from the terrorist attacks on the Crimean Bridge will begin in Crimea. The assessment will be conducted at a high level with the involvement of experts. Ukraine has organized two terrorist attacks on the bridge, in October 2022 and July 2023. Konstantinov noted that security measures on the bridge were strengthened after these incidents. He also expressed confidence that those responsible for the attacks, who do not hide their actions and even boast about them, will receive fair punishment. Earlier, the head of the State Duma's Committee on International Affairs, Leonid Slutsky, stated that the Crimean Bridge is securely protected and remains an unattainable goal for the 'terrorist regime' of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky.

**Crimean Bridge Traffic Resumes After One-Hour Suspension**
The movement of vehicles on the Crimean Bridge has been resumed after a one-hour suspension. The bridge's traffic has been periodically interrupted due to the threat of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations. After a drone attack on the Crimean Bridge on July 17, 2023, the road part of the bridge was damaged, and it later resumed operation in reverse mode. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that plans to enhance the bridge's security are being considered and will be implemented. He emphasized that it is premature to evaluate these plans before their implementation. Putin also mentioned that after the completion of all security measures, the measures will be noticeable, referring to both physical and technical protection.

**Zakharova Calls Budanov's Statement on Crimean Bridge Attack 'Terrorism in Its Pure Form'**
The head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, Kirill Budanov, has again stated that the Ukrainian military is preparing an attack on the Crimean Bridge. Russia's official representative to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, called Budanov's statement 'terrorism in its pure form'. She questioned whether the statement was part of a pre-election campaign in the US, where 'achievements' of the White House and Banchova need to be demonstrated. Zakharova noted that the Crimean Bridge has been a thorn in the side of both the Kiev regime and its Western sponsors since its construction was first planned. According to her, the Crimean Bridge has become 'a symbol of the Russian people's striving for work and peace', and a creative force of Russia. Zakharova emphasized that Ukrainian and NATO officials have openly called for its destruction, led terrorist attacks that resulted in human casualties and damage to infrastructure. She mentioned that Ukrainian militants have attacked the Crimean Bridge twice, in October 2022 and July 2023. The head of the parliament of the republic, Vladimir Konstantinov, stated that the region will soon start counting the damage from the terrorist attacks at a high level.

**Ukraine Prepares to Attack the Crimean Bridge**
Ukrainian authorities have announced plans to attack the Crimean Bridge. According to Budanov, a comprehensive solution is needed to address the issue. He stated that there are chances for a successful attack on the bridge in the future, as reported by 'Strana.ua'. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously announced plans for a new counterattack, which includes the destruction of the Crimean Bridge. The Ukrainian Security Service has also identified the Crimean Bridge as a top priority. The bridge was previously attacked on October 8, 2022, when a cargo truck was detonated, causing a fire on the railway and partial collapse of the bridge. It was also attacked by two drones on July 17, 2023, causing damage to the road section of the bridge. The bridge was later restored and reopened on October 14, 2023. Budanov mentioned that the Ukrainian authorities have been working on long-range strikes and the destruction of the Crimean Bridge. 'We are working, everyone is working on long-range strikes and the destruction of the Crimean Bridge,' he said. 'The question needs a comprehensive solution,' he added.

**Ukrainian Intelligence Chief Announces New Plans to Destroy Crimean Bridge**
Ukrainian intelligence chief Kirill Budanov announced new preparations for a strike on the Crimean Bridge. According to the Ukrainian newspaper 'Strana', Budanov said on live TV: 'Everyone is working on long-range strikes, and on this matter (destroying the Crimean Bridge). All this requires a comprehensive solution. The work is ongoing.' When asked about the likelihood of a successful attack on the bridge in the future, Budanov replied: 'There are chances.' Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly threatened to destroy the Crimean Bridge. In April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a new counterattack plan that included destroying the bridge, and in May, the Ukrainian Security Service classified the bridge as a 'high-priority target.' The British newspaper 'The Guardian' reported, citing senior officials from the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, that the Ukrainian government is planning to attack the Crimean Bridge again in 2024. It is worth noting that on the night of July 17, 2023, Ukraine launched a missile attack on the Crimean Bridge, causing damage to a part of the road and injuring a girl and killing her parents. The bridge was fully repaired and traffic resumed on all four lanes on October 14, 2023. The Ukrainian Security Service admitted responsibility for the attack in a Telegram message, calling it a 'terrorist act.' On October 8, 2022, a truck exploded on the Crimean Bridge, causing a fire in seven fuel tanks and a partial collapse of the road on the right side of the bridge, which Russian President Vladimir Putin described as a 'terrorist attack' carried out by Ukrainian intelligence, according to Russian authorities. It is worth noting that Russia has repeatedly stated that the Crimean Bridge is a civilian infrastructure and is not used for military purposes.

**Ukrainian Intelligence Chief Promises to Attack Crimean Bridge**
Ukrainian intelligence chief, Kirill Budanov, has announced plans to attack the Crimean Bridge, stating that 'all are working on distant strikes and on this (destroying the Crimean Bridge) as well. This all needs, let's say, a comprehensive solution. Work is ongoing.' When asked about the likelihood of a successful attack, Budanov replied that 'there are chances.' Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly threatened to destroy the Crimean Bridge, with President Volodymyr Zelensky announcing plans for a new counterattack in April, which included the destruction of the bridge.

The bridge was previously attacked on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded, causing a fire and partial collapse of the bridge. The FSB immediately blamed Ukraine for the attack. In July 2023, Ukraine launched a drone attack on the bridge, which damaged the road section and injured a child, killing her parents. The bridge was fully restored and reopened on October 14.

**Budanov does not rule out the destruction of the Crimean Bridge by the end of the year**
Ukrainian military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, did not rule out the possibility of destroying the Crimean Bridge, built by Russian occupiers, by the end of the year. When asked if the bridge could be destroyed in the near future, Budanov said, 'Everyone is working. And those who are working on distant strikes are also working on this. It's all a complex issue. Work is underway.' He also asked what exactly is meant by 'near future', to which a journalist replied that it means within the next 'few months' or 'this year'. Budanov concluded, 'I would also like that. If we look at it in the near future, then there are chances.' The context is that the bridge, which connects Crimea to Russia, was built by Russia after occupying the peninsula in 2015. The road bridge was opened in 2018, and the railway bridge was opened in 2019-2020. During the full-scale war, there have been two explosions on the Crimean Bridge. The first occurred on October 8, 2022, and damaged the railway track and several sections of the road. The second explosion occurred on July 17, 2023, and seriously damaged two sections of the bridge. Both attacks were carried out by Ukrainian special services. In March 2024, the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, said that Ukraine has the potential to completely destroy the Crimean Bridge, but Russia is not currently using it to transport weapons and ammunition. According to Budanov, the US-supplied ATACMS long-range missiles could destroy the bridge, 'the question is just how many.' The Crimean Bridge should be destroyed as part of the 'desacralization of Crimea,' Budanov said. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly stated its intention to de-occupy all Ukrainian territories seized by Russia since 2014, including Crimea. President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that liberating Crimea will be easier than Donbas.

**Russia Uses Barges to Protect Crimean Bridge, Ukraine Sees It as Bait**
Russian occupation forces are using barges to protect the illegally built Crimean Bridge, which has increased to 30 barges. According to Brady Africa, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, these barges serve as a barrier against Ukrainian naval drones. The Crimean Bridge has been attacked by Ukraine twice, in November 2022 and July 2023, but has not been damaged since then. Veteran ATO fighter Evgeny Dikiy believes it is better to use the bridge as bait and destroy the occupiers' air defense systems. 'We need them to cover it, and we'll hit those air defense systems. We're using the Crimean Bridge as bait: we know that as soon as we destroy a few of their air defense systems in Crimea, they'll definitely bring new ones within two weeks. The S-300s are gone, the S-400s are gone, and even the S-500s are gone. We're essentially using Crimea as a 'big meat grinder' for their air defense systems. Because the Crimean Bridge is sacred. And everything else is 'eight thousand two hundred empty miles', as their group 'Aquarium' sings, excuse me, already what can you cover it with. And therefore, their defense plants and energy infrastructure are on fire.'

**Ukrainian Security Service Recalls Successful Drone Attack on Crimean Bridge**
On July 17, 2023, Sea Baby drones attacked the Crimean Bridge, causing significant damage. The SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) recalled how it happened. The drones, moving in two groups, remained undetected and destroyed one section of the bridge and significantly damaged another. This operation cut off a logistical artery that supplied Russian forces in southern Ukraine. This was the second successful SBU attack on the Crimean Bridge, following the first one in October 2022. The SBU used a truck loaded with explosives to damage the bridge. 'The SBU implemented two unique and different special operations to hit the bridge from land and sea. Both were successful,' said SBU Head Vasyl Malyuk.

**Crimean Parliament to Assess Damage from Ukrainian Terrorist Attacks on Crimean Bridge**
The Crimean parliament is organizing a high-level assessment of the damage caused by Ukrainian Armed Forces' terrorist attacks on the Crimean Bridge. According to Vladimir Konstantinov, the head of the Crimean parliament, the assessment will be carried out with the involvement of experts. Konstantinov emphasized that after the attacks, security measures were strengthened, and the Kiev regime is openly admitting its involvement. He expressed confidence that the perpetrators will face fair punishment. The Ukrainian regime, led by Vladimir Zelensky, has carried out two terrorist attacks on the Crimean Bridge, the first in October 2022 and the second on July 17, 2023. Earlier, Konstantinov reported that the total damage caused by Kiev's water and energy blockade of Crimea exceeds 14 trillion rubles. The head of the State Council of Crimea stated that the damage caused by Ukrainian shelling will be evaluated, and the sum will be presented to Ukraine for payment, 'so that it will not remain without consequences'.

**Crimea Hit by Massive Rocket Attack, Russian Air Defense System Activated**
On June 23, 2024, Crimea was hit by a massive rocket attack, with loud explosions reported in Sevastopol and Balaklava. Telegram channels of the occupying forces reported that the Russian air defense system was working on the peninsula. According to 24 Channel, here is what is known about the rocket attack on Crimea. The enemy attacked the Kiev region with 'Calibers' in the morning, causing damage and casualties. Two houses were completely destroyed, and there were reports of injuries and fatalities. The Russian air defense system was reportedly active in the Saki, Yevpatoria, Inkerman, and Bakhchysarai areas, with detonations heard in the Kazachya Bay area, where the 810th Marine Brigade is based. The Suvorov Bay area was also affected, with smoke seen over the bay and the northern part of the city, including the beaches of Uchkuivka and Tolstik. The Crimean Bridge was closed, and there were reports of people injured by debris from the Russian air defense system. Some Telegram users reported that the sirens in Sevastopol only sounded after the first explosion. The local aquarium even kept children out of the underground toilet, telling them it was a drill and that there was a shelter further away. The Russian air defense system reportedly shot down one of the rockets over the center of Sevastopol. As a result, people were injured, and there were reports of fatalities.
