**Vladimir Putin restricts social media sites and YouTube**
The Russian government has been restricting access to social media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, by slowing down or blocking them. Experts warn that a complete nationwide ban on YouTube is imminent. Since the restrictions were introduced, the user base of foreign social networks in Russia has declined significantly, with Instagram's daily user count decreasing from 38.4 million in February 2022 to 6.8 million in February 2024. IT specialist Mikhail Klimarev stated, 'Blocking YouTube would be a clear act of censorship.' Users like Christina, 25, have adapted to the restricted digital landscape by using VPNs, which are also being targeted by the government. Klimarev explained, 'In October 2023, they issued a law banning the promotion of methods to bypass blockages and the blocking of resources describing these methods.' The situation with YouTube remains uncertain, but popular shows have already shifted to the alternative platform VKontakte, which is widely believed to be under government influence and control. Klimarev stated, 'I think we're just one step away from a complete shutdown.'

**Russia Does Not Plan to Block YouTube, But Will Slow Down Its Speed**
Russian authorities have stated that they do not plan to block YouTube, but instead will slow down its speed. According to Deputy Anton Gorelkin, the Russian government does not want to take measures that would harm citizens. He stated, 'Such a scenario is not being considered, because there is an important principle - retaliatory measures should not harm our citizens.' Gorelkin also emphasized that Google must return to Russia officially, pay fines, reopen its representation, and comply with local legislation in the Russian segment. The speed of YouTube may decrease to 40% and then to 70% due to the lack of support for caching servers in Russian networks, according to the Roskomnadzor. This measure is a result of 'multiple violations' of Russian legislation by YouTube. The Russian court has already fined Google over 25 billion rubles in the last three years, but this measure has not helped. YouTube, owned by American Google, stopped monetizing content for Russian users in March 2022. In 2022, an arbitration court in Moscow arrested the assets and property of the Russian subsidiary of Google for 1.5 billion rubles. In October 2023, the court recognized OOO 'Google' as bankrupt. The competitive manager of OOO 'Google' Valery Talyarovsky reported that the amount of claims from creditors, included in the register, at that time was 54 billion rubles. Roskomnadzor sent a requirement to the director of Google Sundar Pichai to unblock over 200 YouTube accounts of Russian media, authorities, and public figures in mid-July. Since 2020, YouTube has restricted 207 Russian resources, with 83 of them in 2024, according to the agency.

**Russia May Ban Google, Android, and iOS, Says Liberal Democratic Party Member**
Russian Liberal Democratic Party member Alexey Didenko stated that Google, Android, and iOS may soon be banned in Russia. Didenko does not see this as a tragic situation, citing the example of Netflix, which suspended its operations in Russia in March 2022. Last week, State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Information Technologies and Communications Chairman Alexander Khinshtein announced that YouTube would be slowed down in Russia due to the platform's inability to pay the service fees for Russian data centers. Google later commented on the situation, stating that it would continue to operate in Russia, but did not provide further details.

**Kremlin denies claim of imminent YouTube ban**
The Kremlin has denied claims that YouTube will be banned in Russia, citing technical issues related to Google's outdated servers in the country. The Russian authorities have no plans to restrict access to YouTube, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Peskov explained that the slowdowns on YouTube are caused by technical issues and not by any decision made by the Russian government. He also stated that Russian companies have probably already tried to reach out to YouTube to remedy the issue. The deputy head of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Anton Gorelkin, also confirmed that the issues with the speed of service of YouTube in Russia are not occurring due to any decision made by the country's regulator.

**YouTube Bans Over 80 Russian Channels, Faces Fines and Criticism from Russian Authorities**
YouTube has banned over 80 Russian channels since the beginning of the year, according to the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Mass Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadsor). The Russian authorities have accused YouTube of censorship, stating that the platform has restricted access to 83 Russian resources since January 2024. Additionally, YouTube has failed to remove or block prohibited content in Russia, with over 61,300 illegal contents remaining online. Roskomnadsor has threatened YouTube with fines of up to 10% of the company's annual revenue and a minimum fine of 4 million rubles (approximately 42,000 euros) for repeated violations. The agency has also criticized YouTube for not deleting or blocking prohibited content within 24 hours of being notified, as required by Russian law.

**Russia Slows Down YouTube, Threatening Right to Information**
The Russian government has slowed down YouTube's video playback speed in Russia, making it difficult to access the platform. The 'Reporters Without Borders' (RSF) organization has condemned this move, stating that it threatens the right to information. According to RSF, 'The Kremlin is on its way to achieving its dirty goal - locking Russian citizens in an information prison where only propaganda can freely circulate.' The organization has called for the Russian government to restore normal video playback speed on the platform. Users in occupied Ukrainian regions, as well as in Moscow and St. Petersburg, have reported difficulties accessing YouTube due to the slowed-down video playback speed. The Russian government has been gradually blocking YouTube, reducing the video playback speed to 128 kbps, which is significantly lower than the required level for optimal playback. This move is being implemented using 'technical means of countering threats' (TMT), also known as 'black boxes,' which are being installed in telecommunications operators in Russia since 2020 and are controlled by Roskomnadzor, the Russian telecommunications regulator. YouTube has been under scrutiny in Russia for several months, with Roskomnadzor accusing it of spreading disinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian government has warned that it will take direct action against the platform. According to a source close to the Russian administration, YouTube may be completely blocked by the fall, with the service's performance gradually deteriorating this summer. Independent media and journalists, forced to live in exile, have developed their own video formats on YouTube to circumvent the censorship imposed by the Kremlin, which is tightening its control over the internet. The success of YouTube is evident in the data from a report by The Fix and JX Fund, a journalism support fund created by RSF, which shows that in September 2023, videos from independent journalists and media reached 165 million views on the platform. One of the reasons for this popularity is that YouTube, unlike Facebook and Instagram, has not been banned by the Russian authorities. A protest rally planned by users in Moscow on August 17 to protest the slowdown of YouTube was banned by the authorities. Russia ranks 162nd out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index by RSF for 2024.

**Russia Considers Blocking YouTube and Replacing it with VK**
The Russian authorities are considering blocking YouTube and replacing it with VK, a social media platform controlled by the government. This move is seen as part of a broader effort to control the internet and create a culture of self-censorship in Russia. The Russian Federal Censorship Agency, Roskomnadzor, has accused YouTube of numerous violations of Russian law and disrespect towards Russia and its citizens. Experts believe that this is a step towards controlling the online activities of Russians and creating a culture of self-censorship. The head of the State Duma's Committee on Information Policy, Alexander Khinstein, has stated that YouTube will be loaded 40% slower in the coming days due to Russian data centers ceasing cooperation with Google. Meanwhile, the Russian telecommunications giant Rostelecom has attributed the slow loading of YouTube to a lack of Russian servers. The opposition publication Verstka has reported that Russia aims to replace YouTube with VK by loading all Russian-language videos from YouTube to VK by autumn 2024. This move is seen as a step towards creating a controlled online environment. The Russian government has also expanded its legislation to cover not only everyday life but also the internet, with the aim of protecting government officials and military personnel from 'discreditation'. The Kremlin has also emphasized the importance of creating a culture of censorship, including the use of only approved software and self-censorship of opposition or other content that is not favorable to the government's goals.

**Will YouTube be blocked in Russia in 2024? What is known about the blocking of YouTube, fresh data**
There have been increased discussions about the potential full blocking of YouTube in Russia. The speed of the video service has been slowing down, with a significant decrease expected by the end of the year. According to Deputy Alexander Khinstein, the speed of YouTube loading on PCs may drop to 40% by the end of the week and to 70% by the end of next year. This is a forced measure aimed at the administration of the foreign resource, which continues to disregard Russian laws. The quality of video loading on YouTube has already been noticed by Rostelecom. The expert Igor Bedrov explained that the reason for the slowdown is the decrease in the number of operational servers, which has led to a decrease in the caching of video, resulting in slower speeds. The Deputy Oleg Matveychov stated that there is no intention to block YouTube, but rather to slow it down, as it is an anti-state platform that is used as a tool for information warfare. He recommended that Russians create accounts on alternative platforms. The Kremlin is reportedly planning to block YouTube completely after slowing it down, with some sources suggesting that the blocking could happen as early as October 2023.

**Russia Considers New Restrictions on Gasoline Exports**
The Russian government is considering new restrictions on gasoline exports, with a possible extension of the ban until September-October and until the end of the year for non-producers of fuel. According to Nikolai Pereslavsky, head of the economic research department at CM Service, the temporary ban on gasoline exports will remain in effect until August 1. He explained that the measures taken have not led to a fuel shortage in the regions, but prices have risen to maximum levels since October last year. The cost of fuel is increasing due to the start of the harvest campaign, planned refinery repairs, and damage to infrastructure after drone attacks. Meanwhile, singer Shaman is holding a concert-mitig in front of the US Embassy in Moscow to protest the blocking of Russian YouTube users. The Central Bank has announced that banks will be required to warn borrowers of the risks of mortgage lending and borrowers will be required to sign a statement confirming that they have been informed of the risks. Independent financial expert Andrei Barhota noted that one of the main risks that consumers do not assess is the long-term credit period. If a borrower can currently service their mortgage, it does not mean they will continue to do so in 10 years. The article also discusses the decline in road accidents in the first half of the year, with a significant decrease in the number of accidents in certain areas. According to Maxim Kadakov, editor-in-chief of the magazine 'Behind the Wheel', the high accident rate last year was due to an increase in cargo transportation on southern and eastern routes.

**Russia Sacks 26 Messengers in Rostov Region**
Hundreds of people, including Russian singer Shaman, gathered in front of the US embassy in Moscow on Friday to protest the blocking of some Russian channels on YouTube, according to RIA Novosti news agency. Shaman, a supporter of President Vladimir Putin, was present at the rally, which was held after he announced earlier on Friday that he would organize a march against what he considered an 'unlawful' blocking of some Russian channels on YouTube. He said, 'No one will ban our songs.' In Russia, people participating in unauthorized rallies face severe penalties, according to French news agency. Before weeks, the European Commission announced that Shaman had been put under sanctions due to his support for Russia's military operation in Ukraine, which began in February 2022. His channel was blocked on YouTube in early July. On Tuesday, Russia asked Google to lift the ban on over 200 Russian channels on YouTube, which were suspended due to 'propaganda' for the Kremlin. The Russian government has tightened its control over the internet since the start of its war in Ukraine in February 2022, blocking several websites where Kremlin critics could express themselves freely, such as Facebook and Instagram. YouTube has not been completely banned, but rumors of a potential ban have been circulating regularly, especially since the Federal Communications and Information Agency 'Roskomnadzor' accused Google and YouTube of 'terrorist activities' as of March 2022.

**UK intelligence analyses Russia's intentions to block YouTube**
The UK Defence Intelligence has released a review analyzing Russia's restrictions on digital telecommunications, including the possible blocking of YouTube. The review suggests that the Russian government is slowing down WhatsApp traffic, likely to restrict opposition activists and those opposing the war in Ukraine from organizing and communicating. Russian independent media outlets reported disruptions to YouTube, which may be completely blocked in Russia by September 2024. The review notes that these measures accelerate a long-term trend of increasing state control over media and information access in Russia, aimed at disseminating pro-government narratives and creating a climate of fear and self-censorship.
