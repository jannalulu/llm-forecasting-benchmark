Let me carefully analyze this forecast systematically:

Key Contextual Observations:
1. Timeframe is relatively short (until Sept 30, 2024)
2. Current military tensions are high
3. China is demonstrating increasing military pressure
4. Multiple sources suggest China's strategy includes non-military "gray zone" tactics

Base Rate/Comparative Analysis:
- Historical invasions/territorial seizures are rare
- Cross-strait tensions have existed for decades without full takeover
- Complex geopolitical consequences of direct invasion
- US has strong implicit defense commitments to Taiwan

Evidence Weighting:
Factors Increasing Probability:
- CSIS reports China can potentially control Taiwan without military invasion
- Repeated military exercises simulating takeover
- China's increasingly aggressive rhetoric
- Economic pressure strategies
- New Taiwanese president seen as provocative by China

Factors Decreasing Probability:
- International response would be severe
- US likely to intervene
- Taiwan's strong defensive preparations
- High economic/diplomatic costs for China
- Complex logistical challenges of comprehensive control

Nuanced Probability Assessment:
- Direct military invasion extremely unlikely in this timeframe
- "Gray zone" economic/political control more plausible
- High-tension scenario, but full control improbable

Calibration Considerations:
- Need to distinguish between "control" and "partial influence"
- Resolution criteria require substantial, verifiable control

Final Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Low probability of comprehensive territorial control
- Higher probability of incremental pressure tactics
- Significant uncertainty exists

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 12.75%, but 7.25% being the most likely. Probability: 7.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

Key Analytical Framework:
1. Resolution Criteria Specifics:
- Must be before Sept 30, 2024
- Requires 5 reliable articles demonstrating PRC control of ≥50% of Taiwan's population/territory
- Must be non-opinion, credible sources

2. Current Situation Analysis:
- China conducting increasingly aggressive military exercises
- Multiple articles suggest China developing "gray zone" annexation strategies
- CSIS reports China can potentially control Taiwan without direct military invasion
- New Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te seen as provocative by Beijing

3. Probability Considerations:
- Full military invasion unlikely before September
- Economic/administrative control more probable
- China demonstrating increasing technological/strategic capabilities
- High stakes, but significant international monitoring

4. Constraining Factors:
- US likely to intervene diplomatically
- International economic consequences
- Taiwan's defensive capabilities
- Diplomatic reputation risks for China

Bayesian Reasoning:
- Base rate for territorial annexation: Low
- Specific Taiwan context: Slightly higher probability
- Current geopolitical tensions: Elevated risk

Calibration:
- Extremely low probability of complete military takeover
- Slightly higher probability of administrative/economic control
- High bar of 5 independent, credible articles makes resolution challenging

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 12.75%, but 7.25% being the most likely. Probability: 7.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this question by breaking down key components:

Analysis:
1. Timeframe: July 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 (specific 3-month window)
2. Control threshold: At least half of Taiwan's population/territory
3. Evidence Evaluation:

Positive Indicators for Chinese Control:
- Multiple CSIS reports suggest China can achieve control through "gray zone" tactics without military invasion
- Increasing military exercises simulating Taiwan control
- Economic pressure and blockade strategies
- China's consistent rhetoric about reunification

Negative Indicators:
- Taiwan actively preparing defense
- US implicit support for Taiwan
- No direct military invasion yet
- New Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te committed to defending sovereignty

Base Rate Considerations:
- Historical attempts at forceful reunification: Low success rate
- Peaceful territorial annexations in modern era: Rare

Critical Analysis:
- China seems more likely to use economic/diplomatic pressure than direct military conquest
- Short timeframe (3 months) makes complete control unlikely
- Partial economic/political control more probable than full territorial control

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- High-probability scenario: Economic pressure and limited territorial incursions
- Low-probability scenario: Complete territorial control

Considering all factors, weighing evidence carefully:

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 27.75%, but 18.90% being the most likely. Probability: 18.90%.

Let me carefully analyze this complex geopolitical forecasting problem:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Historical precedents of forced territorial annexation are rare in modern era
- China has not successfully invaded Taiwan in 70+ years
- Direct military invasion seems unlikely before Sept 30, 2024

Key Observations from Recent Articles:
- China conducting increasingly aggressive military exercises
- Multiple sources highlight "gray zone" tactics of economic/legal pressure
- CSIS report suggests China could potentially control Taiwan without military invasion
- China's increasing rhetoric about reunification
- New Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te seen as provocative by Beijing

Critical Resolution Criteria Considerations:
- Requires 5 reliable articles confirming PRC control
- Must cover at least half Taiwan's population
- Timeframe is very specific (July 1 - Sept 30, 2024)

Probability Calculation Reasoning:
- Military invasion extremely unlikely in this short timeframe
- Economic/legal pressure more plausible
- China's strategic patience suggests longer-term approach
- Current geopolitical risks make sudden control improbable

Counterbalancing Factors:
- US likely to strongly oppose any unilateral action
- Taiwan's robust democratic institutions
- International diplomatic consequences

Calibration:
- Base probability starts very low
- Incrementally adjusted by recent escalatory rhetoric/actions

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 4.75%, but 2.85% being the most likely. Probability: 2.85%.
