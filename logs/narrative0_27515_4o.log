**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - SEPTEMBER 11, 2024**

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a table, sipping coffee, newspapers spread out before them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did Apple announce the 40W fast charging iPhone?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. The rumors were strong, but Apple's history with incremental updates made us skeptical.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. Even with the buzz from China and the tech community, we saw it as a long shot. Apple's conservative approach to battery tech played a big role in our prediction.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. They focus more on efficiency than raw numbers. Plus, they tend to underpromise and overdeliver.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The 27W charging is still decent, but maybe next year they'll surprise us.

*They both lean back, satisfied with their foresight, as the bustling caf√© continues around them.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a table with steaming cups of coffee, discussing the previous day's Apple event.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Did Apple announce the iPhone with 40W fast charging?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, they didn't. Our models had it at 42.75%. The rumors were strong, but Apple played it safe this time.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Given the trend with Android competitors, I thought they'd push for it.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but Apple often prioritizes battery health over charging speed. Plus, with the information cutoff on August 23rd, the leak seemed more speculative than confirmed.

**NATE SILVER:** Makes sense. I guess we'll have to wait for the next cycle. But hey, our models remain undefeated.

*They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their predictive prowess.*

Interesting. The speculation was strong, especially with the competition pushing faster charging.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, but Apple has always played by its own rules. The market pressure didn't sway them this time.
