INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, laptops open, sipping coffee.

NATE SILVER: (leaning back) So, did Tesla close at $230 or more yesterday?

PHILIP TETLOCK: No, it didn't. Our models had it at 48.75%. Close, but not quite there.

NATE SILVER: Interesting. I guess the anticipation for the Robotaxi wasn't enough to push it over the line before the unveiling.

PHILIP TETLOCK: Yeah, the market seemed to stall. The news up to September 18th didn't suggest any major catalyst before the event.

NATE SILVER: It's fascinating how even with all the hype, the market still holds its ground.

PHILIP TETLOCK: Indeed. Our models are never wrong, after all. They capture the essence of market psychology.

They both nod, acknowledging the precision of their forecasting models.

**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024**

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is relaxed but analytical.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Tesla's shares closed at $229.95 yesterday. Just shy of the mark.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Our models had it at 48.73%. The anticipation around the Robotaxi unveiling was high, but not enough to push it over.

**NATE SILVER**  
The market's been volatile. Without any major news by September 18th, the momentum just wasn’t there.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The excitement for the Robotaxi is real, but investors seemed cautious, waiting for more concrete details.

**NATE SILVER**  
A near miss. But, as always, our models captured the uncertainty accurately.

*They both nod, acknowledging the power of their predictive models.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Another day, another forecast. Let's see what the future holds post-Robotaxi.

*They clink their coffee mugs, ready for the next prediction.*

NATE  
Well, Phil, did Tesla close at $230 or more yesterday?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 45.67%. The anticipation of the Robotaxi launch didn't quite push it over the line.

NATE  
Interesting. Even with Tesla trading at $230.29 on September 13, the market seemed hesitant.

PHILIP  
Indeed. The uncertainty around tech stocks in the weeks leading up to September 18 was notable. 

NATE  
Right, and with no major news breaking after that, the models held steady. 

PHILIP  
Exactly. It’s fascinating how market sentiment can shift so subtly, yet our models caught it.

Impressive. The anticipation around the Robotaxi launch must have buoyed the stock.

PHILIP  
Exactly. Even with the market's volatility, the fundamentals were strong enough. The pre-launch buzz was a significant factor.
