**Spanish Government Approves 2% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish government has approved a 2% salary increase for over 3 million public employees, effective immediately, with retroactive effects from January 1. The increase will be followed by an additional 0.5% based on the inflation rate approved in January 2025, but referring to the 2024 exercise. According to Vice President and Minister of Finance, María Jesús Montero, the government is committed to maintaining its commitment to public employees, who are the main asset of administrations. The total revaluation of public employees' salaries during the 2022-2024 period will reach 9.8%. The government signed an agreement with the CCOO and UGT unions for a 2% salary increase for public employees, plus an additional 0.5% if the sum of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 IPC (Consumer Price Index) exceeds the fixed retributive increase applied during those years (8%). According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the IPCA for 2022 was 5.5%, and for 2023, it was 3.3%, resulting in a total of 8.8%, which exceeds the established limit for applying that additional 0.5% increase.

**Spanish Government to Approve 2% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish Government plans to approve a 2% salary increase for 3.5 million public employees on Tuesday.

**Spain Exceeds Deadline for Approving Directive on Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions**
Spain is about to exceed the two-year deadline for approving the directive on transparent and predictable working conditions, which was adopted in 2019. The directive aims to end practices that have led to precarious work, such as flexible contracts and short-term employment. The Spanish government included the measure in its electoral program, but it has been delayed due to internal conflicts and negotiations with social partners. The anteproyecto de ley was approved on February 6, but it has been debated and amended in the parliamentary committee, with some sources claiming that there has been no progress in negotiations. The project aims to ensure that workers have clear information about their job, including contract duration, working hours, and trial periods. It also establishes rules for changing contracts, notice periods, and the right to request job openings. The text has been criticized for being too weak and not addressing the main issues of precarious work.

**Spanish Government Extends Mortgage Relief Measures Until 2025**
The Spanish Government has extended the social shield for families struggling with mortgages until 2025, with 79,300 families having already applied. The shield, which was approved last year, increased the maximum family income threshold for accessing its measures from €29,400 to €38,000 and also extended the free conversion of variable mortgages to fixed rates. According to Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo, the measures have been effective in preventing financial exclusion and ensuring adequate attention to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and people with disabilities. Cuerpo stated that the extension is a 'good news' because it reflects the financial resilience of households, and that it will allow households to save more than €400 per year by updating their mortgage. The code obliges financial institutions to seek solutions for mortgage holders by applying for relief measures, such as payment deferrals or extensions of the loan repayment period. The requirements for accessing the code include that the mortgage must be the habitual residence of the borrower, the property value must not exceed €300,000, and the borrower's income must not exceed a certain threshold.

**Spain to Surpass 25,000 Short-Term Rental Beds by 2027**
According to the report 'Estado y tendencias del flex living' by Atlas Real Estate, Spain will increase its short-term rental offer by two times and exceed 25,000 beds by 2027. Currently, there are 11,885 operational beds in various formats, including coliving, smart living, and corporate living. The report predicts that by 2027, there will be 26,776 units in 302 buildings. The government is considering regulating the short-term rental market, which has been a topic of debate. The majority of new developments are expected to be concentrated in Madrid, with 71.5% of the total, followed by Valencia and Málaga. The report highlights the trend of new projects being announced in peripheral areas of major cities, with a focus on corporate demand and local population. The study also notes that the lack of housing in metropolitan areas and the difficulty of accessing affordable rentals under the Urban Rental Law (LAU) are making short-term rentals a solution for local residents, such as young people, couples, and those who need temporary housing.

**Spain to Present 2025 Budget to Congress in October**
The Spanish Government plans to present the 2025 General State Budget to Congress in early October to ensure it is approved in 'time and form' and takes effect on January 1, 2025. According to Vice President and Minister of Finance María Jesús Montero, the new budget will assume the commitments set by the new fiscal rules and the Government will approach negotiations with a clear spirit of reaching agreements. The budget will prioritize reindustrialization, strengthening the welfare state, and implementing the recommendations of the Independent Authority for Fiscal Responsibility (AIReF). Other key policies include modernizing the productive fabric, transitioning to a more ecological economy, investing in science, and innovating in the primary sector. The budget will also aim to ensure the purchasing power of pensioners, increase the public housing stock, and strengthen employment policies, as Spain still has the highest unemployment rate in the Eurozone (12.29% according to the Active Population Survey for the first quarter).

**The Treaty and Proposals: A Web of Confusion**
On January 19, 2023, a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Spain and France was signed by the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the French President, Emmanuel Macron. The treaty has 36 articles and has been praised as being above the Treaty of Eliseo between France and Germany, which is the cornerstone of the European Union. However, an amendment to the law on parity has been proposed, which would modify the Government Act. The amendment is being considered by the Parliamentary Committee on Equality in the Spanish Congress, and it is unclear why it is being used to modify a law that has no connection to the treaty. The article questions how no one had read the treaty carefully before it was signed and how the Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, was able to sign it without issue. The article also criticizes the Prime Minister's proposals regarding judges, journalists, and digital media, which are seen as a threat to the freedom of the press and the right to information. The article concludes by warning that the Prime Minister's proposals should be carefully considered to avoid any measures that could restrict the free exercise of journalism and the right to information.

**Spain Prepares for Demolition of Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant**
The Spanish company Enresa will take over the Almaraz nuclear power plant from Iberdrola, Endesa, and Naturgy. The shutdown of Units I and II is scheduled for November 2027 and October 2028, respectively. Enresa has announced a tender for engineering services for the decommissioning of the plant, with a budget of 28 million euros and a five-year execution period. The contract aims to provide engineering services for the decommissioning of the Almaraz nuclear power plant, including the development of studies, design, and project documentation. According to the Spanish government's plan for the operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, the shutdown dates for Units I and II are scheduled for November 2027 and October 2028, respectively. The plant is currently working on two possible scenarios: the shutdown of its two units as planned, or the possibility of a time extension, which must be communicated by the first quarter of 2025 to avoid organizational and staffing disruptions.

**Spanish Government Approves 2% Salary Increase for Public Officials**
The Spanish Government has approved a 2% salary increase for public officials in 2024. The increase, which is 1.6 points below the current inflation rate of 3.6%, will be retroactive from January 1st and will benefit 3.5 million public employees. The increase will be reflected in the July salary payment. The agreement was reached with two major unions, CCOO and UGT, in October 2022. The increase is part of a deal that also includes a possible additional 0.5% increase if the IPC between 2022 and 2024 exceeds the accumulated increases in that period. The Government has fulfilled a pending commitment, but it does not guarantee the purchasing power of public employees, who have experienced four consecutive years of salary increases below inflation.

**Spanish Government Approves 2% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish government has approved a 2% salary increase for over 3 million public employees, effective immediately, with retroactive effects from January 1. The increase will be followed by an additional 0.5% based on the inflation rate approved in January 2025, but referring to the 2024 exercise. According to Vice President and Minister of Finance, María Jesús Montero, the government is committed to maintaining its commitment to public employees, who are the main asset of administrations. The total revaluation of public employees' salaries during the 2022-2024 period will reach 9.8%. The government signed an agreement with the CCOO and UGT unions for a 2% salary increase for public employees, plus an additional 0.5% if the sum of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 IPC (Consumer Price Index) exceeds the fixed retributive increase applied during those years (8%). According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the IPCA for 2022 was 5.5%, and for 2023, it was 3.3%, resulting in a total of 8.8%, which exceeds the established limit for applying that additional 0.5% increase.

**Spanish Government Approves 2% Salary Increase for Public Officials**
The Spanish Government has approved a 2% salary increase for public officials, which will be retroactive from January 1st. This increase is part of a framework agreement signed with major trade unions in October 2022. The agreement also includes a 1.5% increase for 2022, 2.5% for 2023, and 2% for 2024, with the possibility of an additional 0.5% increase if the inflation rate exceeds the fixed salary increase. The increase will have immediate effects and can be felt in the next paycheck. The Ministry of Digital Transformation and Public Function, José Luis Escrivá, stated that this delay is not a concern, as there is flexibility in the budget to address such situations. Despite this, the Confederation of Small and Medium Enterprises (CSIF) has called for a strike on Thursday to demand a new salary agreement, as they believe that public employees have lost 9.1% of their purchasing power. The details of the public employment offer, which includes around 40,000 positions, will be known once the positions are definitively approved and the destinations of the new vacancies are determined.

**Spanish Government to Approve 2.5% Salary Increase for Public Employees in 2024**
The Spanish government will approve a 2.5% salary increase for public employees in 2024, effective from January, according to the CCOO and UGT unions. This increase is part of the agreement signed by the government with the unions, which includes a 2% fixed increase and an additional 0.5% based on the evolution of the IPCA. The agreement states that if the IPCA variation from 2022-2024 exceeds the accumulated retributive increase of those years (8%), the additional and consolidable 0.5% increase will be applied. According to the National Institute of Statistics, the IPCA in 2022 was 5.5% and in 2023 was 3.3%, resulting in a total of 8.8%, exceeding the established limit. Therefore, the salary of public employees will increase by 2.5%, even without knowing the 2024 inflation data. The PSOE and Sumar parties had attempted to accelerate the salary increase through an amendment, but the government has decided to approve the 2.5% increase in the Council of Ministers instead.

**Spanish Government to Approve 2.5% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish government will approve a 2.5% salary increase for 3.5 million public employees on Tuesday, June 25, with retroactive effect from January.

The law, also known as the 'Ley de Memoria Democrática', came into effect on October 21, 2022, and will remain in force for two years until October 21, 2024.

**Spanish Government Proposes Record-Breaking Public Employment Offer of 40,000 Positions**
The Spanish government has proposed a public employment offer of 40,000 positions for 2024, with half of them being open to external candidates and the other half being internal promotions. The offer is subject to approval by the Council of Ministers. The offer is the highest ever made, surpassing the 39,574 positions offered in 2023. The government has committed to reserving 10% of the positions for people with disabilities and 2% for people with intellectual disabilities. The offer has been welcomed by UGT, but rejected by CSIF and CCOO, who argue that it maintains the 10% replacement rate and reduces the creation of net employment. The offer also does not guarantee the execution of the deadlines and does not include the inclusion of temporary workers in the promotion process.

**Spain Proposes Record-Breaking Public Employment Offer for 2024**
The Spanish government has proposed a record-breaking public employment offer for 2024, exceeding 40,000 positions. The offer includes 21,000 open positions, 10,600 internal promotions, and 8,500 jobs for the Security Forces and Corps. The total number includes 3,000 vacant positions from the past two years that will be re-offered. The final figure will be confirmed when the Council of Ministers approves the Public Employment Offer for 2024, expected to happen in June. The government guarantees that the new offer will create net employment, meaning the number of offered positions will be higher than the vacancies caused by retiring officials. The government and unions have been negotiating the proposal, but the unions have not endorsed it. Only UGT has expressed satisfaction with the proposal, while CSIF rejects it as insufficient and Comisiones Obreras regrets that the number of administrative staff is not increasing.

**Spain's Social Security Registers 567,000 New Affiliates in First Half of the Year**
The Spanish Social Security system has registered around 567,000 new affiliates in the first half of the year, according to data released by the Minister of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, Elma Saiz. The daily average of new affiliates has exceeded 21.4 million since June 10, reaching 21.46 million on June 17. Saiz emphasized that this is not a milestone to rest on, but rather a motivation to continue working towards full employment. She also highlighted the desestacionalized employment, which has been growing for 50 consecutive months. The minister stated that the labor market behavior is 'extraordinarily positive'. Although neither Saiz nor the Secretary of State for Social Security, Borja Suárez, made predictions for the end of the year, they estimated that the dynamics will remain very positive. Saiz also emphasized that job creation is the best guarantee for the pension system. The income from contributions increased by 10.3% in the year, allowing the minister to advance that the Pension Reserve Fund will exceed the target of 9,000 million euros by the end of the year.

**Spain's Air Quality Improves, but Still Falls Short of EU Limits**
Spain's air quality has improved, but still falls short of new EU limits. According to Ecologistas en Acción, 32.6 million people in Spain breathed in more pollution than allowed by the EU in 2023. The new EU limits for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 will come into effect in 2030. Despite the improvement, many areas still exceed legal limits, with 2.9 million people breathing in polluted air. The main source of pollution is traffic, and ozone is also a significant problem. Ecologistas en Acción calls for more action to reduce traffic and implement measures to eliminate structural pollution. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us,' says Miguel Ángel Ceballos, coordinator of the report.

**Spain to Surpass 90 Million International Tourists in 2024**
Spain is expected to surpass 90 million international tourists in 2024, according to a report by CaixaBank Research. The report predicts a 5% increase in real GDP, driven by international tourism, which is expected to grow by 5.5%. The growth is attributed to the recovery of the purchasing power of European households, the economic recovery in Europe, and the perception of safety in Spain. However, the report also warns of a slowdown in the sector due to factors such as the gradual recovery of competing destinations, the impact of the 2024 Paris Olympics, and a relatively weak domestic tourism growth (0.8%). The report highlights the need for sustainable tourism management, including measures to reduce negative externalities such as the impact on local housing markets, public services, and public spaces. Additionally, the sector must continue to invest in adaptation and decarbonization measures to address climate change.

**Articles of the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' May Disappear**
The articles written by academics and doctors of science for the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' (BRE) over the past five years may disappear on June 17. According to Olga, a BRE employee, 'The entire work of these five years, all the articles written by doctors of science, academics, it's all may disappear.' She also mentioned that the BRE editorial team (300 people) and the author collective (7,000 people) publish an equivalent of 18 printed volumes per year. However, the government refused to allocate funds for the portal's maintenance in the 2024 budget. Although the project was not stopped, the editorial team worked without pay for five months. Now, the team will stop working because they cannot pay for cloud servers. 'Putin founded us, we were a Putin project. Then some official somewhere didn't notice something, and we didn't get into the budget', said Olga. The BRE project was initially considered a high-quality alternative to Wikipedia, and around 1.7 billion rubles were allocated for its development. There are no official comments from the government or the Ministry of Digital Development on this situation yet.

**All Valencians Will Publish a Book**
The article discusses the proliferation of book publishing in recent years, with some critics arguing that there are too many books being published. The author argues that this is a natural consequence of the democratization of publishing, with the rise of self-publishing and the ease of digital communication. The article also mentions that the Valencia region has seen an increase in book publishing in 2023, with 3,557 titles published, compared to 3,491 in 2022. However, this increase is not unique to Valencia, as other regions in Spain have also seen a decline in book publishing. The article quotes several industry professionals, including Alberto Haller and Raquel Bada, who discuss the challenges of the publishing industry and the need to adapt to changing market conditions. The article concludes that the proliferation of book publishing is a natural response to the changing times, and that the industry must adapt to the new reality.

**PP to Fight for Funds for Tvitec in Cortes**
The PP will fight in the Cortes for the release of funds for Tvitec. In October 2022, the Government and the Junta de Castilla y León committed to a public-private collaboration to execute the project for the first large glass furnace in Spain, which would contribute to the reindustrialization of the Bierzo region. The Government committed to speeding up the procedures for the loan once the project's economic viability was ensured. However, the project has been paralyzed since March 2023 due to a single bureaucratic procedure in the Ministry of Industry, preventing the granting of a 130 million euro loan to the Bercian company. The PP regrets the government's lack of commitment to the reindustrialization of the region, recalling that the project would involve an investment of approximately 200 million euros and the creation of 250 direct jobs, plus 800 indirect ones. Therefore, the PP has filed a Non-Law Proposal in the Cortes de Castilla y León to require the Spanish Government to grant the loan to Tvitec before the end of the third quarter of 2024 or to seek alternative financing to make the project a reality and advance the necessary reindustrialization in the Bierzo region.

**Spain to Exceed Deficit Target, Warns Bank of Spain**
The Bank of Spain has confirmed that the Spanish government will exceed the deficit target set by Brussels for the next three years. According to the bank's new quarterly projections, the deficit will reach 3.3% of GDP in 2024, 3.1% in 2025, and 3.2% in 2026, exceeding the government's target of 3% and leading to further sanctions. The bank's analysts attribute the deficit to the government's excessive spending and record income, which increased by 6.2% in the first quarter of 2024 due to higher tax bases and the gradual withdrawal of pandemic-related support measures. The bank also warns that the government has not implemented a sustainable budget adjustment path compatible with the new European fiscal framework, which will take effect in 2025. The bank's projections also show a rising debt trend, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 105.8% in 2024, 106.2% in 2025, and 107.2% in 2026, failing to meet the European Commission's target of 60% of GDP. The bank also expects a slower labor market growth, which will prevent the unemployment rate from falling below 11% by 2026, and a widening gap in employment growth between large and small businesses.

**Spain Extends Deadline for PAC Aid Applications**
The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture has extended the deadline for submitting applications for the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (PAC) aid until June 15th. Over 27,000 farmers and livestock breeders in Galicia depend on these aid, which accounts for around 40% of the community budget. The total amount of direct aid for the 2024 campaign is 4.882 million euros, with payments starting on October 16th. The extension is due to the slow pace of application submissions, which has been affected by changes to the community and national regulations to simplify certain aspects of the PAC. The Ministry aims to provide greater legal security to farmers and livestock breeders who submit their single application between June 1st and 15th, as well as to the competent authorities of the autonomous communities.
