Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Historical precedent: 
- In 2020, Biden announced 8 cabinet positions by Dec 11
- In 2016, Trump announced 7 positions by mid-December
- In 2008, Obama announced 11 positions by mid-December

2. Key considerations:
- The timeline is from Nov 5 to Dec 16, giving about 41 days
- Need exactly 10 or 11 announcements out of 15 positions
- This is a relatively narrow window for success
- Modern transitions tend to move quickly to establish administration
- Uncertainty about who wins could delay some announcements

3. Factors favoring 10-11 announcements:
- Pressure for quick transition
- Historical precedent (Obama achieved similar numbers)
- Key positions usually filled early

4. Factors against 10-11 announcements:
- Could be too few (< 10) or too many (> 11)
- Election challenges could delay process
- Vetting process can take time
- Some positions typically filled later

5. Analyzing probabilities:
- Most likely scenarios are 8-12 appointments
- 10-11 represents optimal efficiency
- But narrow range makes it challenging

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 35.50%, with 30.50% being the most likely. Probability: 30.50%.
