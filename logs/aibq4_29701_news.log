**New JRPG Metaphor ReFantazio is tied with Elden Ring DLC and Astro Bot as 2024's best-reviewed game**
Atlus' new JRPG, Metaphor ReFantazio, has received widespread critical acclaim, with an average score of 94 on Metacritic, tying it with Astro Bot and Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion as 2024's best-reviewed game. Reviewers have praised the game's engaging gameplay and strong storytelling, making it a strong contender for Game of the Year. However, it remains to be seen whether the game will also be a hit with players and whether it will win any Game of the Year awards, as Astro Bot's broader charm and timing may give it an edge.

**Black Myth Wukong Snubbed from Golden Joystick Awards' Game of the Year Category**
Black Myth Wukong, a highly anticipated game, has broken numerous records and is still played by an average of 300,000 players on Steam two months after its release. Despite expectations of winning the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards, the game has not been nominated for the Golden Joystick Awards' Game of the Year category. The voting for the Golden Joystick Awards 2024 has begun, with 20 categories in total, but Black Myth Wukong is not listed among the nominees for Best Game on Home Consoles. Many players have expressed disappointment and frustration on social media, with some accusing the awards of being rigged due to political bias against Chinese games. They claim that Wukong received unnecessary hate and low ratings due to a lack of 'diversity and inclusivity', which is why its nomination was expected.

**Game of the Year is Dragon Age: The Veilguard's to lose**
Dragon Age: The Veilguard is poised to win Game of the Year at The Game Awards due to its natural advantage in the single-player RPG category, strong narrative and performance elements, and AAA production values. The game's competition, such as Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Astro Bot, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, has some kind of asterisk against it, including fading memory, lack of sales, or a wobbly critical reputation. Additionally, other potential contenders like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Assassin's Creed Shadows have been delayed or vacated the frame, giving BioWare and EA a clear run this fall.

**Astro Bot May Be My Game Of The Year, But Getting The Platinum Trophy Is A Major Headache**
The author of the article, who considers Astro Bot to be their game of the year, praises the game's charming moments of nostalgia, lighthearted feel, and incredible use of the PlayStation controller's DualSense technology. However, the author's desire for trophy hunting has turned the game into an endless challenge, particularly the final task of completing the secret level at the top of the golden Astro Bot statue. Despite logging 31 hours of gameplay, the author is still struggling to complete the level, but is determined to succeed and earn the platinum trophy. The author believes that the difficulty of earning a platinum trophy is what makes it so satisfying, and that it's a feeling of pride that comes from overcoming challenges.
