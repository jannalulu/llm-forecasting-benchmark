Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: "Well, Philip, the SpaceX updates page remained static through September. Our models had it at 32.45%."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at our data from September 10th, the pattern was clear. SpaceX had been posting roughly every 6-8 weeks, with their last post on August 12th. But we noticed their communication strategy shifting toward X [formerly Twitter] for rapid updates."

Silver: "The historical data showed they typically post major milestones or significant program changes on their Updates page. With no major launches or company developments scheduled for September, the probability was naturally lower."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The website maintenance issues we tracked also factored in. Their technical team had been focusing on the Starlink interface rather than the corporate site."

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: "So, Philip, about SpaceX's Updates page..."

Philip Tetlock: "Yes, our models were quite clear on this one. We gave it a 32.45% probability of a new post appearing before October 1st."

Silver: "Exactly. Looking at their posting patterns since August 12th, and considering their historical frequency, it wasn't likely. The fact that they hadn't posted anything significant in the weeks leading up to our September 10th data cutoff was telling."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Their recent pattern of reduced communication, combined with no major launches or announcements in the pipeline, suggested a continued quiet period. Though I must say, having access to only data until September 10th made this one particularly interesting."

Silver: "True. But even with limited data, our models captured the underlying communication patterns perfectly. Another successful prediction in the books."

Nate Silver [stirring coffee]: "So, about SpaceX's updates page..."

Philip Tetlock [interrupting]: "No posts. Our models had it at 32.45%."

Silver: "Exactly. Looking back at the data we had until September 10th, the pattern was clear. Their posting frequency had been declining since mid-2024, with that last August 12th post."

Tetlock: "The model factored in Musk's increasing focus on X [formerly Twitter] and the fact that SpaceX had been shifting their communication strategy. Their major announcements were happening on X instead."

Silver: "Plus, we had to account for the possibility of technical issues with the page itself. Remember that clause about page accessibility?"

Tetlock: "Indeed. Though that was a minor factor, only reducing our probability by about 2%. The main driver was their clear shift away from traditional web updates."

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: "So, Philip, about SpaceX's updates page - no new posts before October, just as our models predicted."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models had it at 32.15%. The pattern of SpaceX's posting behavior had been increasingly sporadic since mid-2024, with their last post on August 12th."

Silver: "The data showed they were shifting towards X/Twitter for immediate updates. Their website updates had become mainly for major milestone announcements."

Tetlock: "Exactly. With no major launches or corporate announcements scheduled for September, and their historical posting frequency dropping, the probability was relatively low."

Silver: "Though not negligible - there was still that one-third chance given their unpredictable nature. But the trend away from traditional web updates was the key signal."

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: "Well, Phil, another interesting case with SpaceX's updates page. Our models were spot on again."

Philip Tetlock [nodding]: "Yes, we had it at 32.45%. Given SpaceX's posting patterns and their recent operational tempo, it wasn't surprising they didn't post anything new."

Silver: "The data was telling. Their last post was August 12th, and their posting frequency had been declining. Plus, their communications strategy was shifting more toward X platform."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The historical pattern showed they typically post every 45-60 days, but with Musk's increased focus on X for company announcements, our models detected a significant shift away from their traditional updates page."

Silver: "And with their recent focus on Starship development, they've been more selective about formal updates. The 32.45% really captured the declining probability perfectly."
