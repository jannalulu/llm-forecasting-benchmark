**What to expect in Tennessee on Election Day**
Tennessee voters will cast their ballots on November 5, 2024, in the presidential election, as well as races for Congress and the state Legislature. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump are competing for 11 electoral votes, with Trump having won the state by a 23-point margin in 2020. The only other statewide race is for the U.S. Senate, where Republican incumbent Marsha Blackburn is seeking a second term against Democratic state Rep. Gloria Johnson. Republicans hold lopsided supermajorities in both the state Senate and House, which are not at risk in November. The Associated Press will not make projections and will only declare a winner when it is clear that the trailing candidate cannot catch up. With 4.6 million registered voters, voter turnout in 2020 was 69%, with 75% of votes cast before Election Day. The AP Advance Vote tracker will provide updates on pre-Election Day voting in 2024.

**Beacon poll: Blackburn holds 23-point lead; Harris outperforms Biden against Trump in TN**
A new poll from the Beacon Center of Tennessee has found that incumbent U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn holds a 23-point lead over challenger Rep. Gloria Johnson, while former President Donald Trump holds a 21-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race. The poll also found that support for taxpayer-funded school choice policies has decreased since July, but most voters still say they'd be more likely to support pro-school choice candidates. Additionally, the poll found that many voters from both parties distrust online media outlets and social media-based news, and that most Tennesseans are not yet comfortable with using driverless car services. Beacon spokesperson Mark Cunningham said, 'While Trump continues to hold a large lead in Tennessee, Harris outperforming Biden gives an increasingly nervous Democratic Party some good news.'

**Sen. Blackburn: CCP Is Carrying Out a Malign Influence Campaign Against Me**
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) claims that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is carrying out a malign influence operation against her due to her criticism of the party and its harm to the American people. According to Blackburn, the CCP has been active in spreading misinformation and disinformation about her on social media. She recently released a campaign ad called 'It's Time to Break China,' in which she calls for tougher measures against China. Blackburn stated that people are 'loving' the ad because they can relate to it, citing China's theft of American jobs, the COVID-19 pandemic, and spying on US citizens. She hopes that after the 2024 election, Congress can pass bipartisan legislation to hold China accountable for its actions, including divesting TikTok and disallowing Confucius Institutes in US schools. Blackburn also stated that China regularly probes US military bases and hospitals with cyberattacks, and that it is the primary adversary and threat to the US due to its push for global dominance.

**Virginia's Emergency Filing at Supreme Court Over the Biden-Harris Illegal Voting Lawsuit**
The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) is taking the Biden-Harris Administration to the U.S. Supreme Court over allegations of election interference in Virginia. According to the ACLJ, the Biden-Harris DOJ is interfering in the state's elections by arguing that Governor Glenn Youngkin's method of removing non-citizens from the voting rolls violates the National Voter Registration Act. The ACLJ secured a 9-0 decision at the Supreme Court in a previous case against the Trump ballot ban and is now fighting for election integrity in Virginia. With just eight days until Election Day, the ACLJ is working to file an amicus brief in support of the state. ACLJ Senior Counsel for Global Affairs Mike Pompeo has also spoken out about the Biden-Harris Administration's failures to recognize the threat of China, citing its spying activities and attempts to buy U.S. farmland. Senator Marsha Blackburn has been targeted by the Chinese government for her willingness to call out China's impending threat, with the FBI warning her that China is actively interfering in her reelection campaign in Tennessee. 'It’s outrageous that the DOJ is blatantly interfering in the election after Youngkin merely followed the law,' said the ACLJ. 'Election integrity is at stake in Virginia as the state’s polls inch closer between President Trump and Vice President Harris.'

**What to Expect on Election Day in Tennessee**
Voters in Tennessee will decide on the presidential election on November 5, as well as contests for Congress and the state legislature. The Democratic vice president Kamala Harris and the former Republican president Donald Trump will compete for the state's 11 electoral votes. Trump won the state in 2020 by a margin of 23 points. Five independent candidates, including Jill Stein and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Trump, will also appear on the presidential ballot. The only other state contest is for the US Senate, where Republican incumbent Marsha Blackburn seeks a second term against Democratic state representative Gloria Johnson. Johnson is a member of the 'Three of Tennessee', a group of state representatives who were almost expelled from the lower chamber in 2023 for joining a gun control protest. Approximately half of the 33 state senate seats and 99 state house seats will be contested in the elections. The Republicans have supermajorities in both chambers, which are not at risk in November. The Associated Press will not make predictions and will only declare a winner when it has determined that there is no scenario that allows the trailing candidates to close the gap.

**Blackburn blames Biden administration for Chinese bot election attack - Washington Examiner**
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) is blaming the Biden administration for not being aggressive enough to prevent Chinese-controlled social media accounts from launching a disinformation campaign against her and other downballot Republicans ahead of the November election. Blackburn claims that the administration's 'friendly' approach to China has emboldened the country to target her and other lawmakers who have spoken out against China's human rights abuses and trade practices. The senator said, 'We're the ones that have said China needs to be held to account and China needs to keep their end of the trade deals and China should be held responsible for taking our jobs and sending us a virus.' The disinformation campaign has targeted Blackburn with false claims that she has accepted $700,000 in campaign donations from opioid manufacturers, and has also promoted her opponent, Tennessee state Rep. Gloria Johnson. Other lawmakers targeted in the campaign include Reps. Michael McCaul (R-TX) and Barry Moore (R-AL) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).

**In Tennessee, Harris substantially outperforms Biden, still trails Trump**
In Tennessee, Vice President Kamala Harris outperforms President Joe Biden by 7 points in the first Beacon Poll since Harris became the Democratic nominee for president. However, she still trails President Donald Trump by 21 points. Harris' performance is seen as a positive sign for the Democratic Party, which made a good decision to replace Biden on the ticket. When it comes to handling natural disasters, Trump leads Harris by 23 points. Harris does not lead in any of the 12 policy issues polled, but the spread is smallest on the issue of showing empathy and connecting with the American people, where she trails by only 3 points. Sen. Marsha Blackburn has extended her lead over Rep. Gloria Johnson to 23 points in the Senate race, and 53% of Tennesseans approve of the job Blackburn is doing. A plurality of Tennessee voters (49%) approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing, and 48% back President Biden's proposal to implement term limits for Supreme Court justices.

**January 6 and DEI caused me to vote for Donald Trump | Blaze Media**
The author, who previously abstained from voting, cast their ballot for Donald Trump and Marsha Blackburn in the 2024 presidential election. The decision was motivated by the desire to see the January 6 prisoners set free and to end the ideology of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), which the author believes is the enemy of merit and the leftist plot to replace fathers and families with symbols. The author argues that Democrats prioritize symbols over fathers and that the restoration of the nuclear family and the patriarchy is necessary for the well-being of Black Americans. They believe that the Trump administration's pardon of the January 6 prisoners and the rejection of DEI are essential for the country's future.

**Voter's Guide: Sen. Marsha Blackburn on her positions and priorities for 2024**
Senator Marsha Blackburn, the Republican nominee for Tennessee's U.S. Senate seat, outlined her priorities and stances on various issues in a recent interview. Her top priorities include reducing federal spending, securing the border, and putting America first. Blackburn expressed disappointment in the delayed response by FEMA to the flooding in East Tennessee and supports disaster relief as a standalone aid package. She also stated that the U.S. should provide military equipment to Israel and support their efforts to defend themselves against Hamas. Blackburn does not support a federal ban on abortion and believes that the Dobbs decision rightfully returned the authority on abortion to individual states. She also advocates for passing her CLEAR Act to allow local law enforcement to deport criminal illegal aliens and restarting construction of the border wall. Additionally, Blackburn believes that the federal government should implement across-the-board spending cuts to curb inflation and balance the budget.

**Marsha Blackburn vs. Gloria Johnson: Campaigning in a red supermajority**
In the 2024 U.S. Senate race, incumbent Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn faces off against Democratic Tennessee Rep. Gloria Johnson. Blackburn's campaign focuses on conservative values, such as pro-life stances, tax cuts, and strong national security measures, and she has a significant financial advantage, raising $7 million by mid-2023. Johnson's campaign, on the other hand, centers around expanding healthcare, stricter gun control measures, and increasing access for underserved populations. As of October 2024, polling data shows that Blackburn leads Johnson by 18-20 points, with Blackburn's support typically falling between 50% and 56%. Johnson's campaign takes a grassroots approach, focusing on urban areas and minority voters, and she has 33% of voter support. The outcome of this race will provide insights into whether voter priorities will shift or if the red supermajority will continue to dominate Tennessee's political landscape. 'The difference in Blackburn and Johnson’s campaigns highlights the political divide for Tennesseans,' said Marim Abbas, the author of the article. 'Blackburn’s incumbency and financial resources hold her at the upper hand as she receives endorsements from national Republican leaders and media outreach. Johnson localizes her approach and highlights the shortcomings in the current system. She depends on individual donations and smaller contributions.'

**Opinion: Blackburn and Burchett must stop scapegoating migrants. Focus on hurricane relief**
Tennessee U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett are criticized for scapegoating migrants during the hurricane relief efforts in Northeast Tennessee and the Southeast. Burchett wrote on X that FEMA spending over a billion dollars on 'illegals' while leaving Americans stranded is 'treasonous.' Blackburn claimed that eight migrants were arrested for allegedly burglarizing and stealing from hurricane victims, but the migrants were legally authorized to work in the U.S. and had their bonds reduced. The author argues that these statements are alarmist and divisive, and that Blackburn and Burchett should be focusing on uplifting people instead of bashing the most vulnerable. The article also criticizes Blackburn for continuing to post political messages while talking about relief efforts and urging donors to contribute to a GoFundMe page created by former President Donald Trump's campaign manager. The author suggests that donors research charities before giving to them and that the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) is the best source for information on how to help with disaster relief efforts.

**Marsha Blackburn to Newsmax: Vance Proved the Better 'Number Two' in Debate**
Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Newsmax that Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, proved himself to be a better 'number two' to the president in the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday evening. Blackburn said the debate could have a significant impact on the 2024 presidential election, stating, 'I do believe that it does.' She praised Vance for being 'very polished and very well versed in these issues,' while criticizing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for 'not giving direct answers' and 'having a difficult time defending his remarks' about a past trip to Tiananmen Square in China. Blackburn said Vance 'showed the American people what good policy can be and what the results of those good policies can be.'

**Survey: Trump Leads Harris in Battleground Michigan, Senate Race Virtually Tied**
A recent survey by the Trafalgar Group found that former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris in the battleground state of Michigan, with 46.9% of the vote compared to Harris's 44.7%. The survey also showed a virtually tied Senate race between Republican candidate Mike Rogers and Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), with 47.4% supporting Slotkin and 47% supporting Rogers. Rogers has been critical of the Biden-Harris administration, saying 'There's no 'forward' in that' and that their policies have 'just about slit your throat' and 'thrown you on the ditch' for union workers. Trump recently met with Michigan auto workers, who 'really came forward for President Trump,' according to Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).

**Trump stokes fear of foreign competition at Tennessee town hall**
Former President Donald Trump made a campaign stop in Warren, Michigan, where he held a town hall meeting led by Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn. Trump repeated his claims that undocumented immigrants have taken all of the jobs created under President Joe Biden's administration and that Chinese companies are building factories in China to outcompete American automakers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of U.S.-born workers increased 3.5% between May 2021 and May 2023. Trump also falsely stated that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had mandated all electric cars, and that he would terminate the non-existent mandate on day one if elected. Trump also attacked United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, whose union endorsed Harris in July, and criticized Harris's proposed tax policies and her stance on fracking and police funding. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) responded to Trump's visit by putting up billboards criticizing his administration's impact on the auto industry. 'We're going to drill, baby drill. Energy is coming way down. Energy. Energy is coming way down. And when energy comes down, everything else follows,' Trump said. 'We got more votes than any sitting president has ever gotten, by far, and they say we lost the election, so let's leave it at the — You know what? We have one coming up in 39 days, so that'll be a wonderful replacement,' Trump said.

**Exclusive — Marsha Blackburn Details Donald Trump Speaking with Auto Workers in Michigan: They ‘Really Came Forward'**
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) discussed an event where former President Donald Trump spoke with auto workers in Michigan, who 'really came forward' to share their concerns and plight under the Biden-Harris administration. Blackburn, who moderated the event, said the workers were enthusiastic about talking about their products and were concerned about mass layoffs, production moving to Mexico, and automation. One woman shared her story of being a single mom with five children and how hard it has been to afford to live, and how she became an avid Trump supporter after her son encouraged her to look at his policies. Blackburn said the Democrats ignore the auto workers and the impact of their policies, and that Trump's use of tariffs is necessary to level the playing field and prevent China from dumping products and pushing out U.S.-based companies.

**Trump vows to keep auto jobs in Detroit as he pitches Michigan on the economy**
Former President Donald Trump vowed to keep autoworker jobs in Detroit during a town hall in Warren, Michigan, where he spoke about tariffs on foreign-imported cars and the economy. Trump stated, 'Year by year, all the time, we're losing our companies that make our cars, make the autos. A lot of them are going to Mexico now, and it's Mexico through China because China owns the factories; they're building big factories. They wouldn't have done it with me. … They think they're gonna make the cars and sell them in and close up Detroit, close up everything in this area.' Trump also touched on electric vehicle mandates and emphasized his 'drill, baby, drill' initiative toward cheaper energy prices. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) joked, 'The most expensive vehicle you drive in 2024 is the grocery cart,' and Trump responded by promising to get grocery prices down.

**Sen. Blackburn to Newsmax: Dems' Rhetoric on Trump Inexcusable**
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn) criticized White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre for calling former President Donald Trump a 'threat' to democracy, saying it's 'inexcusable.' Blackburn stated that it's even more concerning after two assassination attempts against Trump this summer. She emphasized the need for the Secret Service to provide Trump with adequate security and for politicians to stop demonizing their opponents through rhetoric. Jean-Pierre had previously denounced Trump as a 'threat' to America's principles, citing his refusal to accept the outcomes of free and fair elections. However, Blackburn argued that this rhetoric is absurd and ridiculous, and that politicians should focus on campaigns of ideas rather than personal attacks.

**TN politicians call for heightened security around Trump after apparent assassination attempt**
Tennessee politicians, including Rep. Chuck Fleischmann and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, are calling for increased Secret Service protection for former President Donald Trump after an apparent assassination attempt was thwarted on Sunday. The suspect, Ryan Routh, camped outside a golf course with a rifle for nearly 12 hours before agents opened fire. Trump has received the highest level of protection, according to Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, who credited President Biden's call for additional security for helping to stop the potential attack. Sen. Blackburn stated, 'I am sending a letter to the Secret Service demanding President Trump receive the same protection as President Biden. He has had two failed assassination attempts in the last two months. This is completely unacceptable.' Senate Democrats are willing to provide more money for the Secret Service in an upcoming stopgap spending bill, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

**Senate pressures House on KOSA, while Schumer pushes IVF again**
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) is pushing the House to take up the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), a Senate-passed bill that would force social media platforms to design their products with the safety of younger users in mind. Blackburn cites the case of a 17-year-old who died after taking a 'counterfeit Xanax,' which his mother believes may have been obtained via Snapchat. The Senate bill passed with 91 votes in July. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is reviving the Right to IVF Act, which would require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization. Schumer is bringing up the bill in response to former President Donald Trump's recent comments on IVF, and is giving Republicans another chance to show where they stand on the issue. However, the bill is unlikely to pass, and Senate Minority Whip John Thune has described potential votes on the bill as 'show votes.'

**Tennessee Voter Guide: Meet the US Senate candidates**
The Tennessee Senate election is on November 5, with Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn seeking a second term against state Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville. Blackburn, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, has sponsored bipartisan legislation to protect children from online exploitation and secure the southern border. Johnson, a 27-year veteran special education teacher, is an outspoken supporter of fully funding public education, gun safety laws, and abortion rights. She gained national prominence after participating in a gun control protest and being expelled from the Tennessee state House, but was later reappointed and reelected. Johnson's campaign is seen as an uphill battle, but may capitalize on gun safety reform energy to improve Democratic margins. Three independent candidates are also on the ballot: Tharon Chandler, Pamela Jeanine 'P.' Moses, and Hastina Robinson.

**'Dad, I need you to forgive me': Moment Taylor knew she couldn't stay silent**
Taylor Swift has finally endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 Presidential Election, a move that comes after years of staying silent on politics. In the past, Swift has been reluctant to publicly voice her opinions, but after several events in her life and in the world, she has changed her stance. In 2018, she endorsed two Democratic candidates in Tennessee, and in 2020, she publicly advocated against a second Trump presidency. Swift has spoken out against Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn, citing her voting record as a reason for not supporting her. Through tears, Swift told her father and team that she regretted not speaking out against Trump in 2016, but she needed to be on the right side of history. Swift has done her research and has made her choice, encouraging her fans to do the same and to register to vote.

**I'm voting for Kamala Harris**
Taylor Swift has endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for the 2024 Presidential Election, stating that Harris 'fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.' Swift, a widely influential celebrity endorser, believes Harris is a 'steady-handed, gifted leader' who can bring calm to the country. This endorsement comes after some of Swift's fans criticized her for her public friendship with Brittany Mahomes, wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who had previously shown support for Donald Trump. Swift's announcement was not a surprise, as she has a history of speaking out on political matters, including her endorsement of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race and her criticism of Marsha Blackburn in the 2018 Tennessee Senate race. Swift signed her endorsement 'Childless Cat Lady,' a clear dig at the Republican ticket, which had previously criticized 'childless cat ladies' supposedly running the U.S. government.

**Tennessee's abortion ban will be front and center in November elections**
The Tennessee abortion ban will be a major issue in the November elections, with several legislative contests across the state focusing on the topic. According to John Geer, co-director of the Vanderbilt Poll, 'There is clear evidence that Tennessee is a 'pro-exception' state, with voters accepting of the right to choice in cases such as rape, incest, the health of a mother or fetal viability, but now the state has also moved into pro-choice camp.' Elaine Davis, the Republican incumbent for District 18 state representative, favors a full ban on abortions, while her opponent, Bryan Goldberg, favors women having control over their own bodies. Gloria Johnson, who has been endorsed by the Tennessee AFL-CIO, is running for U.S. Senate against Marsha Blackburn, who is an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump. Several Knox County offices will become vacant in 2026 due to term limits, including Register of Deeds, County Court Clerk, county mayor, and sheriff.

**Tennessee's Trump-backing Republicans may have ‘jumped the shark'**
The phrase 'jumping the shark' refers to a point where a show or movement has gone off track and lost its original appeal. Tennessee's Trump-backing Republicans may have reached this point, as the toxic narratives of the far right have impacted legislation in the state. The Democratic Party's shift towards positivity and unity may be a turning point, potentially lightening the color of a deep-red state like Tennessee. Republican politicians like Sen. Bill Hagerty and Sen. Marsha Blackburn have been criticized for parroting Trump's talking points and spreading misinformation. Even Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has been accused of being too scared to stand up to Trump's influence. The article suggests that the Trump train is running out of steam and that the Republican Party may be 'jumping the shark' in its current form.
