Let me carefully analyze the available evidence:

Key Recent Polling Evidence:
- Multiple recent polls (Infratest dimap, ARD) consistently show AfD at around 27% 
- Polls from September 12th show AfD at 27%, SPD very close at 26-27%
- AfD has been trending slightly upward in recent weeks
- Recent state elections in Saxony and Thuringia saw AfD over 30%

Contextual Factors:
- Brandenburg has historically been more moderate than Saxony/Thuringia
- Brandenburg State Office for Protection of Constitution has classified AfD as right-wing extremist
- 61% of voters oppose AfD government participation
- Migration/immigration is top voter concern (40% cite this)

Analytical Adjustment Process:
1. Base rate: Recent similar state elections suggest potential for AfD >28%
2. Local context suggests some moderation compared to Saxony/Thuringia
3. Polling consistently shows just under 28%
4. Potential for last-minute voter shifts

Balancing Considerations:
- Slight risk of polling underestimating AfD support
- Counterbalanced by local resistance to AfD
- Recent trend suggests stability around 27%

My Prediction: Between 26.50% and 28.50%, but 27.20% being the most likely. Probability: 27.20%.

Let me carefully analyze the available information and construct a forecast:

Key Evidence:
1. Most recent polls consistently show AfD between 26-27%
- Infratest dimap poll (Sept 12): AfD at 27%, SPD at 26%
- RBB/Kontraste poll: AfD at 27%
- Tagesschau poll: AfD at 27%

2. Recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony showed AfD performing strongly:
- Over 30% in both states
- Became strongest party in Thuringia

3. Context Factors:
- Brandenburg has historically been more moderate than Thuringia/Saxony
- Brandenburg State Office for Protection of Constitution has classified AfD as right-wing extremist suspect
- 61% of voters oppose AfD government participation
- Migration/immigration is top voter concern (40%), which benefits AfD

4. Trend Analysis:
- AfD has gained 4 percentage points since July
- SPD has also gained 4 percentage points
- Suggests some volatility in voter preferences

Forecast Reasoning:
- Base rate suggests AfD is likely to be close to current polling
- Recent trend shows upward momentum
- State-specific factors might moderate extreme performance

My Prediction: Between 26.50% and 28.50%, but 27.20% being the most likely. Probability: 72.50%.

Let me carefully analyze the evidence and draft my forecast:

Key Observations:
1. Recent polls consistently show AfD at 27% (latest Infratest dimap poll from September 12)
2. AfD has been leading polls for months, with recent performance ranging between 24-27%
3. Recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony saw AfD over 30%
4. Brandenburg has historically been less AfD-friendly than those states
5. The election is just 10 days away, with polls showing relatively stable numbers

Forecast Reasoning:
- Reference class: Recent eastern German state elections suggest potential for high AfD vote
- Counterpoint: Brandenburg has different political dynamics than Thuringia/Saxony
- Most recent polls cluster tightly around 27%
- Question asks if vote share will be ≤28%, which seems highly probable given current polling
- Slight uncertainty exists due to potential late shifts in voter sentiment

Probability Calculation:
- Base estimate: 95% chance of being ≤28%
- Slight adjustment for potential late dynamics: 92%

My Prediction: Between 24.50% and 28.00%, but 27.00% being the most likely. Probability: 92.00%.
