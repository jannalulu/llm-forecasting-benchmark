2024-10-23 00:22:18,610 - INFO - Question: Will AfD's vote share be less than or equal to 28% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election?
2024-10-23 00:22:18,610 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Looking at recent polls:
- Sept 12 (multiple sources): AfD at 27%, SPD at 26%
- Sept 5-6: AfD at 27%, SPD at 23%
- Earlier polls: AfD ranging from 24-27%

2. Key factors suggesting AfD could exceed 28%:
- Strong performance in recent Thuringia/Saxony elections (>30%)
- Immigration concerns are top issue (40% of voters)
- Historical tendency for AfD to outperform polls
- Young voter support trending up

3. Key factors suggesting AfD will stay below 28%:
- Recent polls consistently show 27% or lower
- SPD gaining momentum (up 3-4 points recently)
- 61% oppose AfD in government
- Brandenburg has historically been less supportive of AfD than Thuringia/Saxony
- Current trajectory is stable/slightly declining from peak of 32% in late 2023

4. Recent trend analysis:
- AfD polling has stabilized at 27%
- No signs of last-minute surge
- SPD closing gap suggests potential vote consolidation against AfD
- Multiple recent polls from different sources confirm 27% level

5. Historical context:
- 2019 election: AfD got 23.5%
- Current polling shows ~3.5% increase from 2019
- Rarely do parties significantly outperform final polls by >1-2%

Given the consistent recent polling at 27%, strong opposition numbers, and SPD's recent gains, I expect AfD to finish between 26-28%, with 27% being most likely. While there's potential for outperformance based on recent eastern state elections, Brandenburg's specific dynamics and polling stability suggest a more contained result.

My Prediction: Between 26.00% and 28.00%, with 27.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Historical performance:
- In 2019 Brandenburg election, AfD received 23.5%
- Recent state elections in 2024: AfD received >30% in both Thuringia and Saxony

2. Current polling trends:
- Most recent poll (Sept 12, 2024) shows AfD at 27%
- Multiple polls in early September consistently show AfD around 27%
- Trend appears stable, with AfD maintaining 26-27% support

3. Factors suggesting higher outcome:
- Strong AfD performance in recent Eastern German state elections
- Migration concerns are top issue (40% of voters)
- Young voter support for AfD growing
- BSW party could split anti-AfD vote

4. Factors suggesting lower outcome:
- SPD closing gap in recent polls (now at 26%)
- 61% oppose AfD in government
- AfD classified as right-wing extremist suspect case
- High opposition mobilization likely

5. Key considerations:
- Poll consistency suggests reliability
- Only 10 days until election
- Recent Eastern German elections suggest polls may underestimate AfD
- But Brandenburg has different political dynamics than Thuringia/Saxony

6. Error balancing:
- Recent polls highly consistent around 27%
- Historical pattern suggests possible minor polling error
- Need to account for both over/under-estimation risks
- Must consider full range of reasonable outcomes

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 29.50%, with 27.20% being the most likely. Probability: 75.30%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Current Polling Data:
- Most recent polls (Sept 12, 2024) show AfD at 27% consistently
- Multiple polls from different organizations confirm this number
- Trend shows stability around 27% in recent weeks
- Previous polls from earlier months showed higher numbers (up to 32%)

2. Historical Context:
- AfD received 23.5% in 2019 Brandenburg election
- Recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony showed AfD above 30%
- Brandenburg tends to have lower AfD support than other eastern states

3. Key Factors Supporting Lower Estimate:
- SPD has gained momentum, closing gap to 26%
- Strong anti-AfD sentiment (61% against AfD government)
- Classification as right-wing extremist suspect case could limit growth
- Minister-President Woidke's campaign gaining traction

4. Key Factors Supporting Higher Estimate:
- Migration concerns are top issue (40% of voters)
- Strong youth support for AfD in recent eastern state elections
- General trend of AfD growth in eastern Germany
- Recent success in Thuringia/Saxony could boost momentum

5. Trend Analysis:
- AfD polling has stabilized at 27%
- No major shifts expected in final days
- Historical tendency for slight polling underestimation of AfD

6. Error Margins:
- Polls typically have ±2-3% margin of error
