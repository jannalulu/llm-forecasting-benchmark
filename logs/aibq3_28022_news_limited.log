**Elon Musk Offers X Employees Chance to Earn Stock if They 'Deserve It'**
Elon Musk sent an email to X employees stating that they can opt for company stock if they demonstrate they deserve it, according to The Verge. To receive the stock, employees must submit a one-page summary of their contributions to the company. This comes after Musk previously assured employees that they could receive stock regularly, similar to SpaceX employees, but has yet to follow through on this promise. The last stock update for X employees occurred in October 2023, valuing the company at $19 billion. During this update, employees received retained stock at a price of $45 per share. Musk acquired Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion and subsequently laid off around 75% of its staff.

**SpaceX Crew-9 astronaut mission: Live updates**
SpaceX's Crew-2 mission successfully launched four astronauts to the International Space Station on April 23, 2024. The crew, consisting of NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet, lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A at 5:49 a.m. EDT (0949 GMT) aboard a Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon spacecraft. The mission marked the second operational launch of the Commercial Crew Program. The Crew Dragon spacecraft successfully docked at the International Space Station on April 24 at 5:08 a.m. EDT (0908 GMT), making history as the first used SpaceX capsule to ferry astronauts to the orbiting lab. The crew will spend the next six months on the station, conducting scientific research and experiments. 'It was a great day,' said NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough, commander of the Crew-2 mission, after the successful docking. The Crew-2 astronauts have now opened the final hatch between their spacecraft and the space station, and are preparing to enter the station. The mission is a significant milestone for SpaceX and NASA, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and the Falcon 9 rocket. The Crew-2 astronauts will spend the next six months on the International Space Station, conducting scientific research and experiments, and will return to Earth in October 2024.

**Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2's first post-launch update drops this week**
Focus Entertainment has announced that the first post-launch update for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will be released this week.

The update will also include private PvE lobbies, ultrawide support, and the Battle Barge Sparring Arena. A post-launch roadmap has been shared, which includes several free updates, including Season 2 in Fall 2024, featuring new PvE missions, a new lethal difficulty, and new cosmetics.

**Musk Posts Uncrewed SpaceX Starships Will Launch Mars Nov-Dec 2026**
Elon Musk has announced that SpaceX will launch uncrewed Starships to Mars in the Earth-Mars transfer window, which is expected to be in November-December 2026. The mission will test the reliability of landing intact on Mars, with the goal of establishing a self-sustaining city on the planet in about 20 years. Musk estimates that the cost of transporting payload to Mars needs to be reduced from $1 billion per ton to $100,000 per ton to make life multiplanetary. He believes that SpaceX's reusable rocket technology is a crucial step towards achieving this goal, and that the next step will be to launch crewed missions to Mars in 2028-2030. According to Musk, 'Being multiplanetary will vastly increase the probable lifespan of consciousness, as we will no longer have all our eggs, literally and metabolically, on one planet.'

**NASA makes adjustments to lineup for upcoming SpaceX Crew-9 mission**
NASA has made adjustments to the lineup for the upcoming SpaceX Crew-9 mission, removing astronauts Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson to accommodate others awaiting a return trip from the International Space Station (ISS). Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov will now join the mission, which is scheduled to launch no earlier than September 24. The changes are part of NASA's strategy to manage crew rotations efficiently, ensuring that all missions proceed smoothly. As a result, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who arrived at the ISS in June, are now scheduled to return to Earth with Hague and Gorbunov in February 2025. NASA has prioritized keeping the mission on track while also accommodating the astronauts waiting for their return from the ISS, reflecting the agency's commitment to maintaining a flexible and responsive approach to mission planning.

**Android 15 Delayed to October, New Features and Release Date Revealed**
Google has unexpectedly confirmed that the Android 15 update will be released in October 2024, instead of September as initially expected. The delay is intended to provide more stability to the software. According to Google, the final version of Android 15 will be released in mid-October, although the exact date has not been announced. However, developers can already start working on the new version, as the source code is expected to be released next week. The update will be available for all current Pixel smartphones, including the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, 6a, 7, 7 Pro, 7a, 8, and 8 Pro, as well as the Pixel Tablet and Pixel Fold. Android 15 will also introduce new features such as the Private Space, improved screenshot functionality, and audio sharing capabilities.

**Android 15 Pixel update rumored to not launch until October**
A new report suggests that the Android 15 Pixel update may not be available until October, 'possibly even in the middle of the month.' According to Android Authority, the update is being withheld to improve its stability. This means that the Pixel 9 series and other phones may receive the September 2024 security patch with Android 14 next month. Android 15 Beta 4 was released in July, and Google has since moved on to testing QPR1, which is expected to be released in December. The delay is surprising, given that Android 15 is fairly stable, and the Pixel 9 series is shipping with Android 14, with some features from Android 15 backported. Android 15 will include features like Private space, a new Material You volume panel, and tweaks to the widgets picker.
