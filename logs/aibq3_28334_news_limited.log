**Israeli Soldier Stabbed, Perpetrator Killed in Jerusalem Attack**
According to Israeli media, a border police officer was lightly injured in a stabbing attack near the Bab al-Amud in Jerusalem. The perpetrator of the attack was reportedly killed after Israeli soldiers opened fire on him. Al Jazeera correspondent reported that Israeli police closed the gates of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and all the gates of the Old City in Jerusalem following the attack, and forced shopkeepers to close their stores in the Old City. This attack comes amid a surge in attacks on Palestinian citizens and their properties in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, by the Israeli army and settlers, since the outbreak of the war on the Gaza Strip in October 2023. The war has resulted in the deaths of hundreds and injuries of thousands of Palestinians. With US support, Israel has been waging a devastating war on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, leaving over 136,000 Palestinian martyrs and wounded, mostly children and women, and more than 10,000 missing, amidst massive destruction and a deadly famine.

**Israeli Occupation Forces Kill 11 Palestinians in Ongoing Attack on West Bank**
The Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that a 35-year-old man, Faras Bassam Al-Ra'iqat, was killed by Israeli occupation forces in Jenin during the ongoing attack on the northern West Bank. This brings the total number of martyrs since Wednesday to 11, with most being killed in drone strikes, in addition to 20 injured. Since October 7, 2023, the number of martyrs in the West Bank has risen to 663, with approximately 5,600 injured. The human rights organization Amnesty International condemned the Israeli occupation's attack on the West Bank, warning of the 'escalating deadly and unjustified violence' by Israeli forces. The organization stated that 'Israel's coordinated large-scale military attack on cities and towns across the occupied West Bank comes after a surge in unlawful killings by its forces in recent months, and will put more Palestinians at risk.' Since October 2023, there has been a 'shocking increase' in the use of deadly force by Israeli forces and violent attacks by settlers, backed by the Israeli government, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, resulting in the killing of at least 622 Palestinians, including 142 children. Amnesty International emphasized that the ongoing military operations on this scale will inevitably lead to an escalation of deadly violence, resulting in more Palestinian casualties. The organization also predicted that these operations will lead to an increase in forced displacement, destruction of vital infrastructure, and collective punishment, which were the cornerstones of Israel's apartheid system against Palestinians and the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories. Amnesty International called on the Israeli occupation to take measures to protect healthcare facilities and workers, citing reports of Israeli forces besieging hospitals and preventing access to them. The organization added: 'In addition, it must ensure that individuals in need of medical support are able to access the care they need. As the occupying power, Israel is clearly obligated to protect Palestinians, their homes, and infrastructure throughout the occupied Palestinian territories.'

**Israel army says 'failed' to stop deadly West Bank settler attack**
The Israeli military has admitted to 'failing' to stop a deadly settler attack in the occupied West Bank on August 15. According to Major General Avi Bluth, the attack was 'a very serious terror incident' in which Israelis set out to harm residents of the village of Jit. The military's investigation found that the first troops at the scene did not fully gauge the situation and needed to act more decisively. The attack resulted in the death of 23-year-old Palestinian man Rashid Sada and the wounding of another Palestinian. The military statement said that troops acted assertively to disperse the assailants, but the shooting that killed Sada occurred before more forces arrived. The case will not be closed until the perpetrators are brought to justice, Bluth said. The incident is part of a larger trend of rising violence in the West Bank, with at least 637 Palestinians killed since October 7 and 19 Israelis killed in Palestinian attacks.

**'State-sponsored terrorism': West Bank settler violence continues unabated**
As Gaza ceasefire talks continue in Qatar, deadly Israeli settler violence persists in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Since October 7, 2023, Israeli forces and settlers have deliberately started 273 fires targeting Palestinian land and property, according to the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission. Mouayad Shaban, head of the commission, called it 'state-sponsored terrorism', aiming to terrorise civilians, destroy property, and force large-scale displacement. On Thursday, over 100 illegal Israeli settlers attacked a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank, killing one person and setting fire to a home and several vehicles. The White House condemned the attacks, stating that 'attacks by violent settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank are unacceptable and must stop.' The Palestinian resistance group Hamas also condemned the attacks. Since October 7, settler violence has led to 18 Palestinian deaths, over 785 injuries, and the displacement of 26 Bedouin communities.

The incident has escalated tensions on the border between Israel and Lebanon, where there has been a daily exchange of fire since October 8, 2024.

**US-Israel Tensions Escalate Following American Citizen's Death in West Bank**
Tensions between the US and Israel continue to rise following the death of an American citizen in the West Bank. According to Palestinian authorities, over 690 people have been killed and nearly 5,700 injured since October 7, 2023, when Hamas and other Palestinian factions launched attacks against Israel. This comes after a record number of deaths in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the months leading up to October 7, 2023, due to Israeli military operations and settler attacks. The situation remains volatile, with no clear resolution in sight.

**Israel's Escalation in the West Bank: A Growing Humanitarian Crisis**
Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli military has conducted near-daily raids on towns and cities across the West Bank, resulting in the deaths of over 582 Palestinians and the arrest of over 10,000 others. According to Middle East Eye, the number of raids has increased by more than three times since the start of the war on Gaza. The majority of these raids target refugee camps, which Israel considers to be strongholds of armed groups such as Jenin and Nur Shams. For example, on October 19, 2023, Israeli forces besieged Nur Shams, demolished its infrastructure, and killed 7 Palestinians. A week later, a deadly raid on Jenin and its refugee camp resulted in the deaths of at least 11 people. In December 2023, Israeli forces launched a 15-hour raid on Tulkarm, killing 7 Palestinians, and in April 2024, they launched a 3-day raid on Jenin refugee camp, killing 14 Palestinians and injuring dozens. According to Middle East Eye, the Israeli military has killed 582 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7, 2023, while the Palestinian Ministry of Health estimates the number to be 652. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 120 Palestinians have been killed by settler attacks. The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank has increased since the start of the war on Gaza, with 9100 Palestinians added to the 5200 already in Israeli prisons. The nature of Palestinian arrests has become more violent, with reports of Israeli forces demolishing homes, attacking and threatening families, and subjecting detainees to inhumane conditions in Israeli prisons. According to the Prisoners' Club, 10 Palestinian prisoners from the West Bank have died in detention before the end of March 2024. Israel has used its war on Gaza as a cover for a dangerous escalation in land confiscation in the West Bank, with the Israeli military and settlers destroying 1429 buildings and displacing 3244 Palestinians, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Israeli government has approved the establishment of 5 new Israeli settlements, and the settler attacks have increased, leading to the displacement of Palestinian herding communities in the South Hebron Hills, Wadi al-Ghrous, and East Jerusalem. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, there have been approximately 1250 settler attacks on Palestinians, resulting in the deaths of 120 people, from October 7, 2023, to August 12, 2024. The West Bank has seen a significant increase in settler violence over the past few years, with the Israeli governments providing open support to the right-wing extremist groups. However, these attacks have intensified and received increased government support since October 2023.

**Israeli Civilian Killed in Shooting Attack in Occupied West Bank**
A 20-year-old Israeli civilian was killed and a 33-year-old motorist was injured in a shooting attack near the Palestinian town of Tubas in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military referred to the attackers as 'terrorists', a term they often use when referring to Palestinian attackers. The motorist was evacuated by helicopter with a gunshot wound to his lower extremities, while the second victim died while being treated. The attack occurred at 15:28 local time (12:28 GMT) and the Israeli police launched a search and capture operation, closing several roads. The occupied West Bank has seen its highest level of violence since the Second Intifada (2000-05). So far this year, nearly 280 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, mostly suspected militants or attackers, but also civilians, including around 50 minors, according to EFE's count. From the Israeli side, 21 people have died in 2024: 11 uniformed personnel and 10 civilians. Following the Hamas attack on October 7, the Israeli military intensified its incursions into the occupied West Bank, resulting in over 600 Palestinian deaths in violent incidents with Israel - including at least 145 minors - mainly against troops and a dozen at the hands of settlers.

**Israel Suffers Deadliest Attack Since 2000**
At least 11 children and young people died in a rocket attack on a football field in the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel. The Israeli army blamed Hezbollah, a Lebanese group backed by Iran, for the attack, but Hezbollah denied responsibility. The attack occurred after an Israeli attack in Lebanon that killed four militants. The Israeli army said it was the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7, when Hamas killed over 1,200 people in southern Israel and kidnapped around 250. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah would pay a 'high price' for the attack and that Israel would not leave it without a response. President Isaac Herzog said the terrorists 'brutally killed children who were only playing football. They never returned'. The attack has caused widespread destruction and many injuries.

**At least 10 killed in Lebanon-Israel border attack**
At least 10 people, mostly children and teenagers, were killed when a projectile was fired from Lebanon into the occupied Golan Heights, causing widespread destruction and panic. The Israeli military has described the attack as the 'most deadly' against civilians since October 7, 2023. The attack has raised concerns that the long-anticipated regional escalation could soon unfold. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has returned to Israel and is expected to convene an emergency security cabinet meeting. 'There is no doubt that Hizbulah has crossed all red lines', said Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz. 'We are facing a total war.' Hizbulah has denied any involvement in the attack, but the Israeli government insists that the group is responsible. The attack has sparked widespread condemnation, with many calling for an end to the violence. 'We were witnesses to a great destruction when we arrived at the football field, as well as objects that were on fire. There were victims on the grass and the scene was horrific, immediately we began to treat the wounded and some were evacuated to local clinics', said a doctor from the Israeli emergency service Magen David Amon (MDA).
