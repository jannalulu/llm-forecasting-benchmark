[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models on a large screen.]

Nate: "No surprise here. Our models had this at 32.45%."

Philip: [nodding] "The signals were there. Saudi Crown Prince MBS's statements about Palestinian statehood being a prerequisite, combined with the ongoing regional tensions with Iran, made full diplomatic relations unlikely within our timeframe."

Nate: "The Abraham Accords framework was promising, but the complexities around Jerusalem and security guarantees proved too challenging to overcome by September 2024."

Philip: "Exactly. While there was positive momentum from Biden's diplomatic efforts and Ambassador Shapiro's work, our models correctly identified that the timeline was too ambitious. The informal economic cooperation continued, but formal diplomatic relations needed more time to mature."

[They both turn back to their screens, analyzing the next prediction.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had Saudi-Israeli diplomatic relations at 32% probability based on the data up to July 2024."

Philip: [nodding] "Yes, despite the Biden Administration's push and the precedent set by the Abraham Accords, the fundamental obstacles remained too significant. The lack of progress on Palestinian statehood was the key factor our models identified."

Nate: "The Crown Prince's statements in July about needing Palestinian concessions were telling. Even with the UAE and Bahrain's successful normalization, Saudi Arabia's position as custodian of the holy sites complicated matters."

Philip: "Precisely. While there was meaningful progress in back-channel discussions, our models correctly identified that the timeline was too ambitious for full diplomatic relations by September 2024."

Nate: *shuffling papers* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Saudi-Israeli relations."

Philip: "Yes, our forecast gave it a 32.5% probability. Despite Biden's push and Shapiro's appointment as Regional Integration Advisor, the structural barriers were too significant."

Nate: "The Crown Prince's demands for security guarantees and nuclear program concessions from the U.S. were deal-breakers. Even with the Abraham Accords' momentum from UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco..."

Philip: "The Palestinian issue remained too contentious. Our models factored in the regional tensions and domestic political constraints on both sides. A one-third probability was optimistic, but accurate."

Nate: "Another successful prediction. Though I wonder what might have happened if those July peace talks had gone differently..."

INTERIOR - THINK TANK CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, reviewing papers in a well-lit conference room. A digital display shows "October 1, 2024" and headlines about Saudi-Israeli relations.

NATE
(looking up from papers)
Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 32.5%.

PHILIP
Indeed. Despite Biden's push and the momentum from the Abraham Accords, the hurdles were too significant. The Palestinian issue remained a sticking point.

NATE
The July intelligence suggested some promising backchannels, but without concrete progress on Palestinian statehood, Saudi Arabia wasn't ready to make that leap.

PHILIP
(nodding)
The Crown Prince's statements in June were telling. They wanted more than security guarantees and nuclear cooperation. Our models caught those subtle signals.

NATE
Another accurate forecast in the books.

Nate: "The Crown Prince's demands for security guarantees and Palestinian concessions were just too complex to resolve in that timeframe. Though that meeting in Paris showed promise..."

Philip: "True, but historical patterns suggested that such dramatic diplomatic shifts require more groundwork. The regional tensions and domestic considerations in both countries made it a longer-term prospect."

Nate: "Another win for probabilistic thinking. Sometimes the most likely outcome is no change at all."
