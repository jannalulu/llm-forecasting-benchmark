Let's carefully analyze this forecasting problem step by step:

Reference Class and Base Rate Analysis:
1. This is a specific Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship prediction
2. We have one data point from the news: Denmark recently won a Warhammer World Championship (Age of Sigmar variant)

Evidence Analysis:
- Positive for non-favored countries:
  * Denmark's recent world championship win suggests smaller nations can succeed
  * Multiple tournament entries increase variability
  * No dominant historical pattern evident from available information

- Negative for non-favored countries:
  * The six listed countries (Poland, Germany, USA, Sweden, England, France) likely have more developed competitive scenes
  * Historically established teams might have structural advantages
  * Limited historical data makes precise prediction challenging

Probability Adjustment:
- Base rate for an "outside" country winning: Perhaps 20-30%
- Recent Danish victory suggests slight upside
- Uncertainty in the sport's competitive landscape

Risk Balancing:
- Risk of underestimating smaller nations
- Risk of overreacting to single data point
- Need for probabilistic thinking given limited information

Considering these factors carefully and applying superforecasting principles of calibration and nuanced probability estimation:

My Prediction: Between 22.50% and 37.50%, but 30.25% being the most likely. Probability: 30.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this forecast step by step:

Reference Class Analysis:
- The articles provide limited direct information about the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship
- One article mentions Denmark winning a Warhammer: Age of Sigmar World Championship, which is a different game variant
- A Spanish local tournament is mentioned, but doesn't provide insight into the World Team Championship

Comparative Evidence:
- The referenced championships suggest competitive international Warhammer tournaments exist
- No clear pattern of consistent winners emerges from the limited data
- The listed excluded countries (Poland, Germany, USA, Sweden, England, France) seem to be strong Warhammer gaming nations

Probability Reasoning:
- Base rate suggests some probability of an "other" country winning
- Limited historical data makes precise estimation challenging
- Presence of strong gaming nations in excluded list implies significant competition
- Small probability of an unexpected winner from a less prominent Warhammer nation

Calibration Considerations:
- Avoid overconfidence due to limited information
- Recognize significant uncertainty
- Balance between base rate and specific tournament dynamics

Cautious Probability Estimate:
- Probability of a non-excluded country winning seems low but not zero
- Likely range reflects significant uncertainty

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 25.00%, but 12.50% being the most likely. Probability: 12.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this forecasting problem step-by-step:

Reference Class Analysis:
1. The question is specifically about the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship
2. Only one news article references a Warhammer tournament - a local Spanish event in Ávila
3. Another article mentions Denmark winning a Warhammer: Age of Sigmar World Championship (different game variant)

Key Information Evaluation:
- No direct information about the 2024 WTC
- The excluded countries are historically strong: Poland, Germany, USA, Sweden, England, France
- These nations likely have robust Warhammer 40K competitive scenes

Probability Reasoning:
- Excluding these 6 strong nations narrows the potential winner pool
- This suggests the probability of a "dark horse" nation winning is relatively low
- However, tournament outcomes can be unpredictable 

Base Rate Estimation:
- Assume historically 80-90% of championships go to established Warhammer nations
- This implies 10-20% chance for an outside nation

Adjusting Factors:
- Limited information suggests being conservative
- Slight bias toward maintaining historical patterns

Probabilistic Assessment:
- Lower bound: 5% (conservative outside chance)
- Upper bound: 25% (allowing for tournament variability)
- Most likely point: 15%

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Reference Class Investigation
- Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship is a specialized tournament
- Limited historical data available in provided news sources

2. Direct Evidence
- Denmark won World Championship in Warhammer: Age of Sigmar (different game variant)
- Spanish tournament mentioned suggests growing international competitive scene
- No direct evidence about 2024 WTC winner

3. Excluded Countries
- Poland, Germany, USA, Sweden, England, France are explicitly excluded from winning
- This means another country must win

4. Probability Considerations
- Skill concentration likely in mentioned countries
- But exclusion creates opportunity for "dark horse" nations
- Competitive team-based tournaments can have surprising outcomes

Forecasting Approach:
- Base rate: Historically dominant nations likely have strong teams
- Adjust for potential emerging competitive nations
- Consider probability of an "unknown" nation breaking through

Calculation Rationale:
- High uncertainty due to limited information
- Exclude dominant nations increases probability of alternate winner
- International competition suggests some chance for surprise victor

Probability Estimate Reasoning:
- Low probability of complete unknown winning
- Moderate chance of a nation with emerging competitive scene
- Significant uncertainty warrants wide probability range

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.
