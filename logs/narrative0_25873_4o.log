NATE SILVER: (leans forward) So, Philip, the question was: Will the Real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator increase Year-over-Year for August 2024?

PHILIP TETLOCK: (nods) Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 72.34%. Given the data up to July, the economic indicators suggested a slight uptick.

NATE SILVER: (smiling) And indeed, the indicator increased. The unemployment rate's subtle rise matched our projections, despite the lack of recession talk in the media.

PHILIP TETLOCK: (thoughtful) It's fascinating, Nate. Even with limited data, our models captured the nuances. This isn't just about numbers—it's about understanding economic rhythms.

NATE SILVER: (nods) Exactly. The models tell a story. And today, that story aligned with reality.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the big question: Will the Real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator increase Year-over-Year for Aug 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. The data from the St. Louis Fed confirmed the indicator remained stable.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly as predicted. The unemployment rate didn’t rise enough to trigger a recession signal. The economy’s resilience surprised many.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, despite the July data showing potential volatility, our models captured the nuances. It’s always about the probabilities, not certainties.

**NATE SILVER**  
And this time, the models were spot on. The Sahm Indicator remains a crucial tool, but this was not its moment.

*They exchange knowing nods, the weight of accurate prediction evident in their expressions.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did the Real-time Sahm Rule Recession Indicator increase Year-over-Year for August 2024?
