Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, it happened exactly as our models predicted. After Biden dropped out in July, the whole debate schedule fell apart."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Once the Democratic Party had to scramble for a new nominee, and Trump insisted on moving the debates to Fox News, it was clear we'd see less than two formal debates before October."

Nate: "Our models had it at 87.32%. The combination of Biden's withdrawal, Trump's Fox News ultimatum, and the time constraints for organizing formal debates with a replacement nominee made it highly probable."

Tetlock: *nodding* "The single debate we saw in June with Biden doesn't even count since he wasn't the final nominee. Historical precedent suggested that such a major disruption to the traditional debate schedule would likely result in fewer formal debates."

Nate: "Another win for probabilistic forecasting."

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, that's it. Just one debate before October 1st. Our models were spot on."

Tetlock: *nodding* "Indeed. After Biden's poor performance in June and subsequent withdrawal, everything changed. Our models had it at 85% probability that there would be less than two debates."

Nate: "The signs were there. Biden's shocking exit, Trump's demand to move to Fox News, and the Democratic party's scramble to nominate a replacement – it all pointed to debate disruption."

Tetlock: "The interesting part was how Trump's insistence on Fox News effectively killed any chance of a September debate. The Democrats wouldn't agree to those terms."

Nate: "Sometimes the most accurate predictions come from understanding human behavior rather than just the numbers. Though in this case, both aligned perfectly."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 85% that Trump would have less than two debates with the Democratic nominee before October.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The political landscape was incredibly volatile after Biden's withdrawal. With that single June debate with Biden not counting towards the final tally since he dropped out, and Trump's insistence on Fox News hosting any future debates creating a deadlock with the new Democratic nominee, it was highly improbable we'd see two debates materialize.

Nate: The historical precedent of candidates using debate venues as negotiating tactics, combined with the compressed timeline after Biden's July exit, made multiple debates unlikely. Our models factored in Trump's pattern of using media platforms as leverage.

Philip: [checking his notes] And when you add the logistical challenges of organizing formal debates on such short notice... 85% was exactly right.
