**No - Polling was not historically accurate in 2022**
A study by 538 found that polling in 2022 was not historically accurate, particularly in Senate races. In 9 out of 10 contested Senate races, polling overstated Republican support, with an average lean of 3.4% too Republican. The study also found that in 5 toss-up Senate races, Real Clear Politics (RCP) picked the wrong winner in 4 and 538 missed in 3, with margins ranging from 1% to 5.3% in favor of Republicans. The author argues that while polling may have been accurate in some house and Governor races, it was not reliable in Senate races, and that there is a risk of polling errors favoring Democrats or Republicans. The author notes that most pollsters have made changes since 2020 to address the Trump undercount, but are not aware of any post 'Dobbs' adjustments.

**The Most Accurate Pollster in 2020 Has Blockbuster Polls for Trump**
Three recent high-quality national polls show Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by 2 points, 2.7 points, and 2 points respectively. The polls, conducted by Fox News, AtlasIntel, and TIPP Insights, indicate that Trump's momentum is real and that he could win the election despite being behind in the national popular vote. The polls also show that Trump is leading in counties he won by more than 10 points in 2020, while Harris is leading in counties Biden won by more than 10 points. The most accurate pollster in 2020, AtlasIntel, has been praised for its accuracy and has a huge sample size of 2,048 likely voters. The TIPP Tracking Poll shows that 53% of Americans feel worse off now compared to their situation pre-COVID, which is a headwind for Harris. Nate Silver has been criticized for his polling bias and for not accounting for the growing economic dissatisfaction among voters. Silver has been slow to recognize the momentum behind Trump, but the polls suggest that it is real and that it could be a deciding factor in the election.

**TIPP, Atlas Polls: Trump Leads Harris Nationally**
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is leading national polls against Democrat Kamala Harris, a rare occurrence for a GOP candidate in this century. According to the RealClear Politics polling average, Trump is leading Harris nationally among likely voters, with a 1-point lead in a composite of swing state polling in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Trump leads every single one of the seven battlegrounds in the RCP polling average. As noted by presidential adviser Dick Morris and pollsters John and Jim McLaughlin, a slight deficit to a Democrat in national polling would portend a Republican victory in the Electoral College, as the race truly comes down to the seven battleground states. 'A dramatic momentum shift' from Harris to Trump has been observed, with just 16 days left before election day Nov. 5, according to the TIPP Insights tracking poll. The TIPP Tracking Poll surveyed 1,254 likely voters Oct. 17-19, and the results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

**Can we trust the polls this year?**
The 2024 election is shaping up to be a close contest, with Vice President Kamala Harris having a roughly 2 percentage-point advantage in the national popular vote. However, polls have been criticized for underestimating Donald Trump's support in the past, and some experts worry that this bias may still apply today. Pollsters have been working to address these issues, but there are still concerns about nonresponse bias, unlikely and late-deciding voters, and hard-to-poll subgroups. Despite these challenges, polling remains a useful tool for gauging public opinion, particularly when it comes to issues rather than presidential races. Pollsters are constantly refining their methods and using more tools to try to reach voters. Looking at polls in the aggregate, or as an average, can offer a lot more clarity about the trends in a presidential cycle. The quality and frequency of polling will likely improve later in the election cycle, and consumers can use certain tips to consume polls effectively, such as looking at the sample size, methodology, and margin of error.

**Why to be cautious with election polls**
Chauncey McLean, founder of Future Forward, a Super PAC that spends hundreds of millions of dollars to support the Democratic ticket, warned that the numbers are not as rosy as those seen in public polls. According to McLean, 'Our numbers are much less optimistic than what you see in the public polls.' This comes as a new Angus Reid national poll shows Kamala Harris with 47% of the vote, compared to 42% for Donald Trump. However, a professor of sociology at the University of Montreal, Claire Durand, cautions that 'one should be prudent in the conclusions drawn from polls.' Durand's analysis of 222 independent polls conducted in 2020 found that they presented the largest discrepancies with the vote since 1996 and the greatest disparity between different modes of administration since 2008. She concludes that 'in 2020, as in 2016, American citizens did not receive adequate information on the trend of voting intentions during the election campaign.' The American Association for Public Opinion Research found that pollsters overestimated Joe Biden's lead by 3.9 points nationally and 4.3 points in the states in the last two weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign. The New York Times, which has been credited with making headlines with its polls, had credited the former vice president with a 10-point lead in Wisconsin and a 5-point lead in Pennsylvania. However, Biden ultimately won the Badger State by 0.63 points and the Keystone State by 1.17 points. This has given pause to supporters of Kamala Harris. As of Sunday, 72 days before the election, Harris enjoyed a narrow 1.2-point lead over Trump nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics average, and a 3.5-point lead, according to the FiveThirtyEight average, which excludes some polls that enter the RCP average. In key states, the battle is even tighter. The question is whether pollsters will again underestimate Trump's vote in key states as they did in 2016 and 2020. If so, Harris's supporters risk having the same brutal awakening on November 6, 2024, that Clinton's supporters had on November 9, 2016. However, have pollsters found a way to avoid their past mistakes? In 2021, four major Democratic polling institutes put aside their rivalries to try to identify the problem and find a solution. They recognized the difficulty of reaching 'low-propensity voters,' who are reluctant to participate in mid-term elections or respond to polls for various reasons, including their distrust of institutions. However, they tend to vote in large numbers for Donald Trump. Three years ago, these Democratic pollsters did not come to a consensus on a solution to avoid the 2020 mistakes. Claire Durand's study, however, contains lessons. It shows that some polling methodologies gave accurate results in 2020, such as mixed-mode surveys combining more than one mode of administration. On the other hand, the study concludes that the most widely used methodology in the media – polls using volunteer panels – contributed to distorting the perception of voters by estimating that Biden's voting intentions were stable. It is possible that pollsters have learned from their mistakes. However, the most prudent attitude towards American election polls is to be wary of them.

**National Politics | Trump holds edge in key poll**
A recent poll by TIPP Insights shows former President Donald Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris by a single point, 48% to 47%, in the 2024 presidential election. This is a reversal from the initial poll, which showed Harris leading by three points. David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, suggests that third-party candidates may break the tie, citing past elections where Libertarian and Green Party candidates received more votes than the margin of victory. Paleologos advises Harris and Trump to focus on convincing their opponents' softest voters to choose third-party candidates instead of them. A separate Emerson College Poll also shows a deadlock, with Harris leading by one point, and third-party candidates grabbing 1% of the vote. The poll highlights clear splits in voter support, with men favoring Trump and women favoring Harris, and Hispanic and Black voters favoring Harris.

**The Most Accurate Pollster In 2020 Has Blockbuster Polls For Trump**
A new Fox News national survey shows that former President Trump is ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest 50%-48%. However, Harris is ahead by 6 points among voters from the seven key battleground states. The candidates are tied at 49% each among voters in close counties. Trump's advantage comes from a larger share in counties he won by more than 10 points in 2020. AtlasIntel, the most accurate pollster in 2020, has released polls showing Trump's lead. The TIPP tracking poll also shows Trump overtaking Harris, with a two-point lead. The polls suggest that Trump could win the Electoral College while losing the national popular vote. The Hungarian Conservative notes that AtlasIntel has been the most accurate pollster nationally in the last two election cycles, with an average error of 2.01p.p. in 2020. AtlasIntel comments that they had the best performance across all pollsters in 2020, with results falling within the margin of error of their estimates. The article also discusses Nate Silver's polling bias and the influence of sample size on poll accuracy. The TIPP Tracking Poll shows that 53% of Americans feel worse off now compared to their situation pre-COVID, which is a headwind for Harris. Trump could exploit this growing economic dissatisfaction, which is a theme that has been repeated since February.

**US Presidential Election: The Imperfect and Manipulable Thermometer of Public Opinion**
The US presidential election is approaching, and the flood of polls is intensifying. While they don't claim to tell the truth of the moment, they aim to draw trends. For example, Kamala Harris's surge after entering the race in late July, following Joe Biden's withdrawal. Or Donald Trump's supposed tightening in favor of the Republican candidate since late September. According to FiveThirtyEight's simulations, the former president would win in 52 out of 100 scenarios. The average of polls conducted by Nate Silver, weighted by their credibility, places the Democratic candidate ahead with 48.8% of the vote against 47.2% for Donald Trump. However, these numbers have limited relevance, as the election will be decided in the seven swing states. The Washington Post published a poll of 5,000 people on October 21, which puts Kamala Harris ahead in four of these swing states. Polls have known biases, with small, non-representative samples and certain segments of the population reluctant to respond to phone calls. In the past, polls have underestimated the extent of Donald Trump's support. But since the Supreme Court's decision on abortion in June 2022, the opposite has been observed. In local elections or during the midterms in November 2022, the extent of Democratic mobilization - particularly among women and young people - was underestimated. As before the midterms, there is also an attempt to manipulate public opinion by announcing polls that are tailored to tell a story of a Republican surge. 'The red wave of the 2024 campaign is much larger this time, and started much earlier,' notes Simon Rosenberg, a leading expert on public opinion among Democrats, who correctly predicted the midterms. According to him, more than 70 biased polls have been incorporated into the averages in recent weeks, consistently giving 'one to five points more to the Republicans than independent polls, as was the case in 2022.' Simon Rosenberg highlights the emergence of new partisan actors in the polling ecosystem, strongly marked to the right. He calls on Democrats to be discerning, attributing a degree of frenzy to the opposing camp. 'They resort to these extraordinary means to shape the electoral narrative because they think they will win and they will lose,' writes Simon Rosenberg in his daily letter. Who to trust? Professor of history Allan Lichtman makes headlines every four years due to his unique methodology. He has successfully predicted every presidential election since 1984 by relying on 13 key criteria, which concern both the candidates' profiles and charisma as well as the socio-economic context. Allan Lichtman correctly predicted Donald Trump's victory in 2016, contrary to numerous experts. This time, he is betting on Kamala Harris, earning him criticism from the Trump camp.

**Vibe Check for the GOP**
Two weeks before the election, the vibes are in favor of the GOP, but it's unclear if they will translate to real-world results. A Republican insider warned that predicting the outcome is impossible, saying 'If anybody tells you they know for certain what's going to happen on Election Day, figure out what else they're lying to you about.' The latest polls show Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by just 1.2 points, down from a 2.2-point advantage a month ago. Most concerning for Democrats is that Harris' margin is much smaller than Joe Biden's 7.6-point advantage over Trump in 2020. All major election forecasters now predict Trump as the favorite to win, with Nate Silver giving him a 53.1% chance of victory. However, the author cautions against relying too heavily on forecast models, which can be misleading, and instead recommends sticking with polls. The article also notes that state polling is sparse and unreliable, and that Harris' late summer surge was actually a result of reengaging Democrats who had become frustrated with Biden's campaign. Republicans, on the other hand, are fully engaged behind Trump, but this time they closed ranks behind their nominee sooner than in previous contests, partly due to familiarity with Trump and partly due to Harris' ability to spark anxiety among Republicans. The article concludes that vibes are necessary but not sufficient for either party to win.

**Has Trump gained ground? The latest 2024 polling, explained.**
The 2024 presidential election is still too close to call, with polling averages showing a tight contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in key swing states. While Trump's polling has improved slightly, he still trails in most states, with an average lead of 1-2 points in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. To win the presidency, Trump needs to breach the 'blue wall' by winning one of Michigan, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin, which are currently tied. The polls could be underestimating Trump again, as they did in 2016 and 2020, or perhaps pollsters have corrected for their previous bias. The outcome will depend on the votes counted, and the pre-election vibes are not a reliable indicator of the result. 'The polls say these swing states are -- brace yourself -- very close!' as Andrew Prokop notes. 'We simply won't know until the votes are counted.'

**Trump Gains Slight Lead in US Election Polls**
Two weeks before the US elections, Donald Trump has gained a slight lead in the polls over Vice President Kamala Harris. According to FiveThirtyEight, Trump has a 53% chance of becoming the next President of the United States, while Harris has a 47% chance. The analysis suggests that the shift in favor of Trump is due to a slow trickle of polls showing that the race is tightening in key battleground states such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina. In Pennsylvania, Trump has gained a 0.2 point lead over Harris, while in Michigan, Harris's 1.8 point lead has narrowed to 0.4 points. Javier Ortiz, a Republican strategist, attributes Trump's current lead to a change in opinion among voters on issues such as mass deportations, focusing on redeveloping manufacturing in the US, and putting Americans first. The Real Clear Politics (RCP) average of recent polls has Harris with a 1.0% national lead, down from 2.0% a week ago. Trump and Harris will focus on key battleground states in the final two weeks of the campaign.

**Trump Ahead in Popular Vote and Swing States: Kamala Harris Tries a 'Plan B'**
Two weeks before the US Presidential Election 2024, new polls from America confirm the trend of the last election campaign, with growing fears for the Democratic Party. After the 'honeymoon' of the post-convention data, Kamala Harris has had to face the return of Republican consensus in many of the 'key states' (the 'Swing States' historically in balance and not definable with clear majorities). Now, Harris is also at risk of being overtaken by Donald Trump in the popular vote. Trump leads the latest national polls on the US Presidential Election 2024, both on TIPP and Atlas, while in the RealClearPolitics average he is still behind but in 'recovery'. According to the updated TIPP survey of October 20, 2024, Trump gets 49% against 47% for Kamala Harris, while Atlas gives the former US President a three-point percentage advantage. Despite the very small distances in the national popular vote (Harris is ahead of Trump by 1.3%), the polls of this last period of the presidential campaign show the absolute closeness of the two candidates, with the vote that can really play out even many hours after the polls close. Several Democratic analysts in the US believe that it is unlikely that there will be a 'call' on the winner on the morning of November 6, 2024, as the distance between Harris and Trump is very small and decisive may be the counting of postal votes in the swing states.

**2020's Most Accurate Pollster Released a New Poll... And It Is Weird**
A recent poll by AtlasIntel, known for its accurate national polling in 2020, shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris nationally by 3 points, with Trump at 50.7% and Harris at 47.6%. However, the poll's swing state data raises questions about the reliability of these numbers. The poll shows Harris holding onto narrow leads in several key battlegrounds, such as North Carolina and Wisconsin, which is unlikely if Trump truly has a national lead. Nate Silver estimates that a 2-3 point lead nationally for Trump would translate to a 100% chance of victory, but the Electoral College outcome would be a 269-269 tie, which has never happened in a presidential election. According to AtlasIntel, Trump still has the edge, but the poll highlights the volatility and unpredictability of the 2024 election.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Harris vs Trump**
The 60th US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024. The American people will choose between the Democratic Party candidate and the Republican Party candidate on that day. According to the 'Real Clear Politics' (RCP) news platform, which publishes polls on the US presidential election process, the current average of national polls shows that Harris has 49.2% support, while Trump has 47.5%. However, in the 'swing states' that are critical to the Electoral College system, Trump is currently leading by 0.7 points. In these states, Trump is leading by 0.3 points in Pennsylvania, 0.7 points in Georgia, 1.1 points in Arizona, 0.5 points in Nevada, 1 point in Michigan, 1.3 points in North Carolina, and 0.3 points in Wisconsin. Harris is currently leading in Michigan, but Trump has gained ground in the past week. The average of 11 current polls, including those from Reuters, CBS News, Pew, Harvard, and NBC News, shows that Harris has 49.2% support, while Trump has 47.5%. 'It's a close and competitive race,' said a spokesperson for the Harris campaign. 'We're feeling good about our chances, but we know that this is a long way from over.' Trump's campaign manager added, 'We're confident that our message is resonating with voters, and we're going to keep working hard to win this election.'

**Why you should stop looking at 2024 election polls in the coming weeks**
Polls are not a reliable indicator of the outcome of the 2024 election, despite their accuracy in predicting election results. The polls are often misinterpreted, and the media's focus on the latest polls can create anxiety among voters. The author, who watches polls for a living, advises readers to stop checking polls for the next few weeks. The polls have barely wiggled, but Democrats are anxious about Vice President Kamala Harris' chances, while Republicans are overconfident. The author notes that polls have been off by an average of 2.2 percentage points over the last 14 presidential elections. The problem is that tiny margins separate Harris from former President Trump in key states, and the average polling error is much bigger than either candidate's edge. The article also discusses the trends in voting patterns, including the growth of white, college-educated voters among Democrats and Black and Latino voters among Republicans. The author notes that Harris' strength among white voters accounts for her apparent lead in the northern battleground states, while her weakness among white voters has been the main problem in states where she lags. The article also discusses the gender gap in voting patterns, with Harris winning women by 18 points and Trump winning men by 16 points in a recent poll. The author concludes that polls are not a reliable indicator of the outcome of the election and that readers should stop checking them for the next few weeks.

**New 2024 Poll Shows Major Voting Shift: Trump Just Surged into Lead Weeks before Voting Day**
A new Fox News poll has shown a significant shift in the 2024 election, with Donald Trump now leading Kamala Harris 50% to 48% nationally. This is a two-point swing in Trump's favor, with Harris's support declining by two points and Trump's support increasing by two points. The poll also shows a major movement in Trump's direction among college-educated voters, with Harris holding a razor-thin edge of 49% to 48%. Trump has historically underperformed in polls, and Democrats have been criticized for shaming Trump supporters, leading to a lack of accuracy in polls. Harris has been unpopular since her time as vice president, and her policies have been seen as contributing to the struggles of millions of Americans. The poll is seen as a potential game-changer for Trump, with just two and a half weeks to go before Election Day.

**Trump and Harris Neck and Neck in Latest Polls**
A new national election poll by the Emerson College shows that the competition for the 2024 US presidential election is becoming increasingly intense, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris neck and neck. The poll, which surveyed 1,000 likely voters, found that Harris is only one percentage point ahead of Trump, with 49% of voters supporting Harris and 48% supporting Trump. This is a concerning trend for Harris, as she had a two percentage point lead over Trump in late August. The poll also shows a significant gender gap, with Trump leading among men and Harris leading among women. The poll's executive director, Spencer Kimball, noted that the gap between the two candidates has remained steady since early September, but Harris's current situation is less favorable than Biden's four percentage point lead in national polls in 2020. The poll also found that voters' feelings are deeply polarized, with 80% of those who have already made up their minds saying that they have made their decision more than a month ago. Among these voters, 52% support Trump, while those who have recently made up their minds support Harris 60%. The poll also found that 3% of voters are still undecided, which could potentially change the outcome of the election. Kimball noted that while undecided voters are slightly leaning towards Harris, the poll's margin of error means that the final choice could go either way. The poll's findings are concerning for Harris, as past elections have shown that a lead in the polls can be reversed in the final weeks of the campaign. As analyst Nite Silver noted, Trump's chances of winning are at their highest since August, and a model updated to reflect recent polls shows Trump leading in key states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Silver's final predictions show Trump leading in the Electoral College with 50.2% to Harris's 49.5%, despite Harris having a 75% chance of winning the popular vote.

**Trump vs Harris: Who is leading in US election polls?**
With less than a month to go before the US presidential election, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is currently leading in the national polls with a 2.4-percentage-point lead over Republican former President Donald Trump, according to FiveThirtyEight's daily election poll tracker. However, the popular vote does not decide the winner, and instead, it determines which electors will represent each state in the Electoral College, which picks the president. To win, a candidate needs to secure 270 of the 538 electoral votes up for grabs. Polls show Trump and Harris in a narrow race in swing states, and the outcome of the election could be decided by the results in these states. If no candidate wins at least 270 electoral votes, a contingent election takes place in which the US House of Representatives decides the winner. Election polls predict how the population might vote by surveying a sample of voters, but polls are never 100 percent accurate and can be affected by factors such as nonresponse bias and changes in voter turnout. A mathematical margin of error is implicit in polls, and many of the polls conducted before this year's presidential election have shown the difference in support between Harris and Trump within the margin of error. 'The race is still tight,' said FiveThirtyEight's election forecast, which suggests that Harris is favoured to win 54 times out of 100 while Trump wins 46 times out of 100.

**Harris and Trump in a Close Race for US Presidency**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close race. According to the Real Clear Politics (RCP) platform, which aggregates national polls, Harris is leading with 49.2% support, while Trump has 47.5% support. However, in the critical swing states, Trump is ahead by a narrow margin. In the 7 swing states, Trump is leading by 0.7 points, with Harris ahead in Wisconsin by 0.3 points. Trump is also leading in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina, while Harris is leading in Michigan. The Electoral College system means that the outcome of the election will depend on the results in these swing states. According to the RCP platform, if Trump wins the 5 swing states, he could win 302 delegates, while Harris would be left with 236 delegates. The betting companies also favor Trump to win the election, with an average probability of 56.3%.

**Will Polls Show the Whole Picture in 2024 Election?**
According to polls, Donald Trump is in a stronger position in the 2024 election than he was in 2016 and 2020 at the same time, three weeks before the respective elections. Although he is behind Kamala Harris in national polls, the difference is narrower than it was four years ago for Biden and even eight years ago for Hillary. If Trump's 'hidden vote' (a percentage of Republican supporters who refuse to answer polls or respond truthfully) returns, we may see a clear Trump victory on November 5th. Trump stated at a rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, that a poll showed a 3-point percentage advantage in the Keystone state, 'which probably means 10'. However, this is far from a guaranteed outcome. The 2016 and 2020 elections may not repeat themselves. Pollsters have changed their methodologies for the 2024 election, in part to account for Trump's 'hidden' voters, including those who plan to vote for him but do not want to publicly admit it, or other supporters who are difficult to find through traditional voting methods. Additionally, different groups of voters are showing signs of increased participation in the elections due to new issues, such as anti-abortion laws and rising living costs. As of today, Kamala Harris has a 1.7% lead over Trump in the Real Clear Politics average. In the last three polls, there was an NBC News tie (48/48), a Kamala lead in the ABC News poll (50/48), and a CSB News lead (51/48). Four years ago, Biden had a 10.3-point percentage lead over Trump in the national average of RCP; Biden won the popular and electoral votes by much smaller margins (+4.5%).

**MIL-OSI Global: 2024 US presidential election: can we believe the polls?**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, and polls are being closely watched. However, the reliability of these polls is questionable, especially in the context of the US electoral system. Nationwide polls are often of limited relevance, and the focus should be on surveys conducted in the pivotal battlegrounds, or swing states. Recent analyses suggest that around ten states are expected to be in play for 2024, with seven swing states to watch: Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. The 2016 and 2020 polling failures, which underestimated Trump's vote share in key swing states, highlight the challenges of accurately measuring voter intentions. Pollsters face technical challenges, such as underrepresentation of Republican voters, over-representation of college-educated voters, and an underestimation of undecided voters. The margin of error is a critical component of polling, and media headlines often imply a candidate is leading, even when the difference is within the margin of error. To guarantee 95% accuracy, the margin of error should be increased to at least 6%. Identifying likely voters is also crucial, as only around two-thirds of citizens eligible to vote actually go to the polls. While polling has improved since 2016, challenges remain, especially in predicting turnout and combating low response rates. Ultimately, election polls offer snapshots and can only provide general trends, and their value lies in gauging public opinion on key issues.

**Harris and Trump in Dead Heat as Election Nears**
According to a recent NBC poll, the gap between Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican opponent Donald Trump has narrowed to a tie, with both candidates receiving 48% of the vote. This is a significant change from last month, when Harris had a 5% point lead over Trump. The poll, which surveyed 1,000 registered voters in the US, has a margin of error of 3.1%. The results suggest that the election is becoming increasingly close, with 10% of respondents saying they may change their minds before the election. Experts note that opinion polls can be subject to social desirability bias, where respondents may answer questions in a way that is more socially acceptable. Harris has been the front-runner in most polls since becoming the official Democratic candidate in the summer, but her lead has been narrowing in recent weeks. The candidates now face the challenge of convincing undecided voters and increasing turnout on election day.

**2024 US presidential election: can we believe the polls?**
The reliability of polls in the 2024 US presidential election is uncertain due to the unique structure of the US electoral system and the challenges of accurately measuring voter intentions. Nationwide polls are often of limited relevance, and the focus should be on surveys conducted in the pivotal battlegrounds, or swing states. The 2016 and 2020 polling failures were attributed to underrepresentation of Republican voters, over-representation of college-educated voters, and an underestimation of undecided voters. Despite efforts to fix these problems, other biases showed up in 2020, including an underestimation of Trump's vote share in key swing states and an overestimation of Biden's national lead. To deal with these hurdles, many pollsters are now using a mix of methods, including e-mail, online surveys, and robocalls. However, online surveys often draw voluntary participants who are compensated, leading to issues of accuracy and representation. The margin of error is a critical component of polling, and media headlines frequently imply a candidate is leading, even when the difference is within the margin of error. Accurately predicting who will turn out to vote is crucial to polling accuracy, and polling showed notable improvements during the 2022 midterms. However, challenges remain, especially in predicting turnout and combating low response rates. Ultimately, election polls offer snapshots - often imprecise - and can only provide general trends.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest Polls Show Tight Contest Between Trump and Harris**
With the US presidential election just a month away, the latest polls between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris suggest a tight contest. According to a survey by 'El País' based on seven polls from The Economist, FiveThirtyEight, Apuestas (RCP), Metaculus, PredictIt, Polymarket, and Nate Silver, Trump's chances of winning have increased slightly, from 45% to 47%. Meanwhile, Harris's lead has narrowed from 55% to 53%. The Economist, Polymarket, and Apuestas (RCP) polls suggest a technical tie, with a 50% chance for both candidates. However, Nate Silver's poll shows Harris increasing her chances of winning. The outcome will depend on the results in each state, as the candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win. Currently, Harris leads in three key states: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, which could give her the 270 votes needed to win. However, her margin is limited, as Trump is leading in three other crucial states: Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina.

**What the 2024 polls show with four weeks to go**
With four weeks to go until Election Day, the 2024 polls show a presidential race that remains on a knife’s edge. Recent national polls, such as NPR/PBS/Marist, found Vice President Kamala Harris with a narrow edge against former President Donald Trump, 50%-48%, within the poll’s margin of error (plus or minus 3.7 percentage points). The polls also show a close race in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, with Harris and Trump essentially tied. While Harris has a slight advantage in Michigan and Wisconsin, those advantages are within the boundaries of potential polling error. The polls can tell us whether a race is close or not, and this race remains very close. However, the polls can't tell us if a candidate will win if they're ahead or behind by 1-2 points in a few surveys. The 2024 race will ultimately be decided by turnout, news events, and other factors.

**Can We Trust Opinion Polls in the US Presidential Election?**
With the 2024 US presidential election approaching, opinion polls are making headlines every week, announcing the victory of either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. However, how much can we trust these polls? In the US electoral system, national polls are not very informative, as the president is elected by the Electoral College, where each state is represented by a certain number of electors proportional to its population. The only polls that matter are those conducted in the swing states, which are a dozen states that are considered to be in the balance. These states are crucial for winning the presidency, as the candidate who wins the most of them will likely win the election. However, the polls have a history of errors, particularly in 2016 and 2020, when they underestimated the support for Donald Trump and overestimated the support for his opponents. The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) has identified several biases in the polls, including underrepresentation of Republican voters, overrepresentation of college-educated voters, and underestimation of undecided voters. The polls also have a margin of error, which is typically between 3 and 4 points. However, this margin can be much higher when the polls are conducted on subgroups, such as young people or Hispanic voters. Despite these limitations, the polls can still provide valuable insights into public opinion, but it is essential to understand their limitations and to read the fine print, including the sample size, date, margin of error, and methodology used. It is also important to be aware of the potential biases of the pollsters and the sponsors of the polls.

**Why CNN is changing up its polling for 2024**
CNN's polling in the 2020 presidential election was at its worst in 40 years, with a final poll estimating a 12 percentage point lead for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. However, Biden won the popular vote by only 4.5 points. Since then, CNN has modified its polling methodology, moving away from relying on landline calls and instead using an SSRS panel of registered voters. So far this year, CNN's polls have been more generous to Trump, with some showing him leading Vice President Kamala Harris by 3 percentage points among registered voters. Jennifer Agiesta, CNN's director of polling and election analytics, has acknowledged the importance of accuracy in polling, saying 'I would like to think that they are' accurate. She has also emphasized the need for pollsters to correct for past errors, saying 'the problems that polling had in 2016 and in 2020 were extremely well publicized.'

**Morning Consult Tracking 2024: The Case for a Trump Victory**
The Morning Consult Tracking 2024 survey shows a close race between Trump and Harris in the Electoral College battlegrounds. While the topline results suggest Trump is leading, the margin of sampling error is 3 or 4 percentage points, which means undecided voters could break in Trump's favor, tilting the playing field in his direction. The article notes that polling error has benefited Trump in the past, but also led to his loss in 2020. As a result, the election is considered a toss-up, and the online discourse about polling results deserves a more critical look before Election Day.

**A pollster's warning: Beware 2024 election polls**
A pollster, Douglas E. Schoen, warns that 2024 election polls are unreliable. He cites examples of conflicting polls in swing states, such as Arizona and North Carolina, where Trump's lead in one poll was 5 and 4 points respectively, but in another poll, Harris was leading by 3 and 2 points respectively. Schoen notes that these swings are not trivial and that the variations between swing state polls and national polls are significant. He also points out that polls have historically underrepresented Republican voters, including the 'silent Trump vote,' which could lead to Trump overperforming in the election. Schoen concludes that the true margin between the two candidates is impossible to determine with any degree of accuracy and that the race is too close to call. 'At best, Harris's lead is significantly narrower than the 5 to 6 points that Reuters and NBC would suggest,' Schoen writes. 'When 'silent Trump voters,' as well as pollsters' general challenges in interviewing Republican voters are factored in, the race is likely a statistical tie.'

**Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Neck-and-Neck in New CNN Poll**
A new CNN poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump tied among registered voters, just six weeks from Election Day. The survey of 2,074 registered voters found Harris and Trump at 47 percent each in a multicandidate matchup. Harris and Trump also have similar favorability ratings, with 42% and 45% of voters holding a favorable view of them, respectively. The core issues for voters are also reflective of similar polling in recent weeks, with 41% citing the economy as the most important issue in deciding their presidential pick. Recent analyses have indicated that the 2024 presidential election will likely be one of the closest races in American history, with FiveThirtyEight's election forecast model putting the race in the 'toss-up' category. CNN's Harry Enten noted, 'The fact that no one has led by at least 5 points this cycle is noteworthy because it's incredibly rare.' According to averages compiled by FiveThirtyEight, Harris is ahead across national polling by 2.5 percentage points, while RealClearPolling (RCP) shows the race even closer, with Harris leading Trump by 2.1 percentage points.

**The Reliability of Opinion Polls in the Upcoming National Council Election**
Recent opinion polls suggest that the FPÖ will win 27.2% of the vote, the ÖVP 24.7%, the SPÖ 20.6%, the Neos 9.8%, and the Greens 8.4% in the upcoming National Council election. However, experts warn that these polls are not entirely reliable and that the actual results may differ significantly. According to a study by Laurenz Ennser-Jedenastik, the values of the parties 30 days before the election deviate from the actual results by an average of 1.9 percentage points. 'We know that we cannot provide exact results,' says pollster Peter Hajek. 'No one can say which party will come in first, and no one can say whether the Neos or Greens will come in fourth.' Hajek notes that the FPÖ's lead is likely, but that the other parties' positions are too close to call. Pollsters use various methods to try to account for biases in the data, such as selecting interviewees based on demographic characteristics and using 'reminder questions' to help respondents recall their voting intentions. This year's polls are complicated by the fact that FPÖ supporters are overrepresented, while Green supporters are underrepresented. Hajek notes that this is a problem for telephone polls, but not for online polls. The impact of the recent flooding on the election outcome is also unclear, with some experts predicting a shift towards the ÖVP and the Greens. However, Hajek believes that this effect is too small to be measurable.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest Polls Show Kamala Harris Leading Donald Trump**
A month before the US presidential election on November 5, 2024, polls between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump show a general advantage for the vice president. However, in important issues such as immigration, the former president maintains the preference. According to a new CBS News survey in collaboration with YouGov, which was conducted with a representative sample of 3129 registered voters across the country, between September 18 and 20, 2024, 'the vice president has moved slightly towards the margins in the disputed states' and now has a four-point percentage advantage over the former president nationally (52% to 48%). The survey also shows the preference of the Democratic candidate among voters who have a positive view of the national economy and their own financial situation, with a preference of 88% to 12% of the former president, and 64% to 36%, respectively. However, the medium highlighted: 'The challenge she still faces is that, despite the improvement, many voters still do not believe the situation is good, and those who do not believe it are voting for Trump'. A recent NBC News survey, conducted between September 13 and 17 among 1000 registered voters, shows that Harris leads the preference of voters over Trump with 49% to 44%. However, the report also shows that the former president has advantages in issues such as economy, inflation, and border. 'Today, the winds have turned in favor of Kamala Harris,' said Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates. 'However, Trump maintains important advantages in terms of economy and inflation, although those advantages are smaller than when Biden was still in the contest,' assured the expert in public opinion for NBC News. The FiveThirtyEight update on September 23, which shows the average of each candidate in national polls, shows that the Democrat surpasses the former president by 2.6 points, with 48.3% of the preference, against 45.6% of the businessman.

According to a New York Times/Siena poll, despite a 52% unfavorability rating, Donald Trump is ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris nationally by 2 percentage points. Harris needs to move beyond her strategic ambiguity and provide more details on her policies and plans to win over voters. Only 12% of respondents said they needed to learn more about Trump, while 28% said they needed to know more about Harris. Harris has not taken questions from the press pool nor granted many interviews, and Trump has indicated he will not do another debate, denying voters an opportunity to learn more about her.

**Historical Polling Tells a Tough Tale for Kamala Harris**
Despite Kamala Harris's recent surge in public favorability numbers, historical polling suggests she may be in trouble. According to RealClearPolitics' national poll of polls, she is still trailing Donald Trump by 1.3 points, which is within the margin of error. Going back 20 years, the eventual losers of presidential contests at this point were, on average, down 2.6 points in the RCP average. Harris supporters have good reason to be skittish, but Democrats have a clear advantage over Republicans when it comes to enthusiasm, which could make all the difference in turnout. Most pollsters agree that the race is in the midst of a reset, and even then, any bump may be short-lived. Democrats remain bullish about their odds, but the top of the ticket is what is driving so much of the conversation, and Harris' stans are far from a lock for the biggest prizes in politics.

**Can we trust the polls this year?**
The 2024 election is shaping up to be a close contest, with Vice President Kamala Harris having a roughly 2 percentage-point advantage in the national popular vote. However, polls have been criticized for underestimating Donald Trump's support in the past, and some experts worry that this bias may still apply today. Pollsters have been working to address these issues, but there are still concerns about nonresponse bias, unlikely and late-deciding voters, and hard-to-poll subgroups. Despite these challenges, polling remains a useful tool for gauging public opinion, particularly when it comes to issues rather than presidential races. Pollsters are constantly refining their methods and using more tools to try to reach voters. Looking at polls in the aggregate, or as an average, can offer a lot more clarity about the trends in a presidential cycle. The quality and frequency of polling will likely improve later in the election cycle, and consumers can use certain tips to consume polls effectively, such as looking at the sample size, methodology, and margin of error.

A recent poll by Rasmussen showed a significant difference in results compared to other major polling companies, with Trump at 62% and Kamala at 35%. This was seen as an outlier, but a causal Bayesian network model was used to analyze the data and determine the probability of the true percentage of Trump voters. The model assumed that all polls are unbiased and that the sample size is 1000. The results showed that the probability of a different poll resulting in at least 62% for Trump is 0.00004%, making it an unlikely outlier. However, when allowing for possible bias in the polls, the model showed that there is a 91% probability that the Rasmussen poll is biased in favor of Trump and a 97% probability that polls 1 and 2 are biased in favor of Kamala. The revised probability of the true percentage of Trump voters is 56.2% with a 95% confidence interval of 51% to 61.8%. The model can also be used to take account of known biases and the results showed that if the polls 1 and 2 systematically oversampled Democrats by 2%, the revised probability of the true percentage of Trump voters is 56.2% with a 95% confidence interval of 53.3% to 57.1%.

**What if Trump runs ahead of his poll numbers — again?**
The current polls for the 2024 presidential election show a close race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with Trump trailing by 1.9 percentage points. However, this margin is similar to the 2016 and 2020 election results, and some analysts argue that Trump may be running better this time around. There is evidence to support this view, including a more favorable assessment of Trump's character and a stronger record on issues such as inflation and immigration. Additionally, voters may be recoiling from the events of 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the violent riots that followed the death of George Floyd. If Trump should end up outpolling the polls, it could be due to an ideological recoil against the Democratic Party's stances on issues such as defunding the police and reparations. However, it is also possible that the polls are accurate and that Trump will once again lose the election by a narrow margin.

**Harris' So-Called 'Surge' Is Thanks To Oversampling: Pollsters**
Pollsters are sounding the alarm over Vice President Kamala Harris' so-called 'surge' in the polls, which has her leading Trump nationally by nearly 2 percentage points and in all seven battleground states. However, Republican analysts argue that these polling numbers may not accurately reflect voter sentiment due to biased polling methodology, specifically undersampling of Republican voters. Critics point out that many polls have been sampling a disproportionately smaller share of Republican voters compared to exit poll data from the 2020 presidential election, which could be a strategic move to boost enthusiasm and fundraising for Ms. Harris' campaign. Trump campaign strategist Jim McLaughlin stated, 'They undersample Republicans' intentionally 'to tamp down support and donations for Trump.' 'It's fake news,' Trump declared during a rally in Michigan. 'They can make those polls sing.' Recent polls, such as the Suffolk University/USA Today poll, included more respondents identifying as Democrats (37.1%) than Republicans (33.8%), leading to claims of deliberate skewing. Pollsters like Don Levy of the New York Times/Siena Poll counter that these claims lack substance, arguing that any gaps between recalled 2020 vote and actual 2020 results are not evidence of intentional bias but may reflect the complexity of polling dynamics. Despite these excuses, the controversy surrounding these polls has left many wondering about the true state of the race.

**Jim McLaughlin to Newsmax: Media Is Under Sampling Republicans in Polls**
Pollster Jim McLaughlin told Newsmax that national polls showing Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump are biased due to under-sampling of Republicans and Trump voters. McLaughlin pointed out that a recent ABC News poll had only 29% of the sample as self-identified Republicans, whereas Republicans represented 36% of the actual vote in the 2020 election. He also noted that the poll had Trump receiving 20% of the Black vote, which is almost three times what he received in 2020. McLaughlin emphasized the importance of sampling 'likely voters' and ensuring that demographics are reflective of the electorate. He also stated that undecided voters overwhelmingly disapprove of the job Harris and President Joe Biden are doing and think the country is on the wrong track.

**When Nate Silver Acknowledges the Obvious - Trump Is Still The Favorite**
Nate Silver's election model now has Donald Trump ahead of Kamala Harris, but the author of the article advises readers to ignore the model and instead look at the RCP average, which has Harris up 1.8 percentage points. The author believes that Harris needs to win the national popular vote by at least 3 points to be guaranteed the necessary electoral votes to win the presidency. Additionally, the author points out that public pollsters often underestimate Donald Trump's support, and that the campaign polling is much more accurate. The author also highlights the underlying issues that could impact the election, including the economy, border security, and foreign policy. Furthermore, the author criticizes Kamala Harris as a weak and incompetent candidate who has made several mistakes, including her interview with CNN and her choice of running mate. The author concludes that if they were a Democrat, they would not be optimistic about the election.

**Older Liberals Are Destroying Polling**
Polling response bias, particularly among older white liberals, is distorting the reliability of the polling industry. According to Pew Research, Trump defeated Clinton by nine and Biden by four percent among voters over 65, yet polls predicted a blue wave led by gray-haired voters. In 2024, Kamala Harris's lead in polls is built on the back of a group she will likely lose, with Trump performing better among seniors in key swing states. The New York Times /Siena poll, considered one of the most accurate, has Kamala leading or outperforming Biden's 2020 numbers among seniors in virtually every swing state, but this is likely due to older white liberals' overrepresentation in polls. As in 2016 and 2020, pollsters are undervaluing Trump's support among seniors, creating an illusion of a silent Trump voter. 'Older white liberals' tendency to become 'Karens,' telling anyone within an eyeshot their opinion, is destroying the reliability of the polling industry.'

**Can Trump do a Truman? When opinion polls err and media is biased**
The 2024 presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is a closely divided electorate, and opinion polls are not always accurate. In 1948, Harry Truman defied opinion polls and won the election, and similar scenarios have occurred in 1976, 2000, and 2004. The article highlights the limitations of opinion polls, including the 'shy voter' phenomenon, where voters may lie to pollsters due to social desirability bias. The article also notes that polling companies may make incorrect assumptions about who will vote and that education weighting may not always be effective. The margin of error in polls is often underestimated, and nonresponse, coverage error, and mismeasurement are significant sources of error. The article concludes that opinion polling is not precise enough to call the winner in a close election, and the media should be cautious in relying on polls. Currently, Harris leads Trump by 50 to 43 per cent nationally, but the race is tight, and a few voters can change the outcome. The article notes that the media often fails to grasp the uncertainty of polls and perpetuates a narrative that the polls got it wrong.

**Now Even Redstate.com Can't Avoid Publishing Polls Showing Harris Way Ahead – Daily Sound & Fury**
A recent poll conducted by Kaplan Strategies shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump in the 2024 national election by 7 percentage points among likely voters, with Harris at 52% and Trump at 45%. The poll surveyed 1,190 likely voters between August 23 and August 24. While Red State, a conservative website, published the poll, their narrative tries to downplay the bad news for Trump. The poll results show a clear lead for Harris over Trump, with Harris leading by 4 points among registered voters and by 7 points among likely voters. 'This poll indicates strong support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming 2024 election,' according to the article. The poll's results and methodology can be found on Red State's website.

**How one pollster got 2020 right when hardly anyone else did**
In 2020, Emerson College was one of the few polling firms that accurately predicted the outcome of the presidential election, with Joe Biden winning by 5 percentage points. According to Matt Taglia, Emerson's senior director of polling, the firm's success was due to its use of 'mixed mode' polling, which combines Interactive Voice Response phone calls, text messages, and online panels. Taglia noted that traditional live-caller polling is too expensive and that most pollsters are already using cellphones. He also stated that there is a Democratic bias in most polls due to selection bias, with Democrats being more willing to participate in polls. Emerson's most recent poll has Kamala Harris leading Trump 50% to 46%, and Taglia believes that the 2024 election is shaping up to be similar to 2020, with changes in demographics balancing each other out. 'The race is looking very similar,' he said. 'We see changes within different demographics that are balancing each other out right now. Trump might be doing a little better among these minority voters, especially Black voters. That's canceled out by Harris going better with white voters.'

**Why to be cautious with election polls**
Chauncey McLean, founder of Future Forward, a Super PAC that spends hundreds of millions of dollars to support the Democratic ticket, warned that the numbers are not as rosy as those seen in public polls. According to McLean, 'Our numbers are much less optimistic than what you see in the public polls.' This comes as a new Angus Reid national poll shows Kamala Harris with 47% of the vote, compared to 42% for Donald Trump. However, a professor of sociology at the University of Montreal, Claire Durand, cautions that 'one should be prudent in the conclusions drawn from polls.' Durand's analysis of 222 independent polls conducted in 2020 found that they presented the largest discrepancies with the vote since 1996 and the greatest disparity between different modes of administration since 2008. She concludes that 'in 2020, as in 2016, American citizens did not receive adequate information on the trend of voting intentions during the election campaign.' The American Association for Public Opinion Research found that pollsters overestimated Joe Biden's lead by 3.9 points nationally and 4.3 points in the states in the last two weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign. The New York Times, which has been credited with making headlines with its polls, had credited the former vice president with a 10-point lead in Wisconsin and a 5-point lead in Pennsylvania. However, Biden ultimately won the Badger State by 0.63 points and the Keystone State by 1.17 points. This has given pause to supporters of Kamala Harris. As of Sunday, 72 days before the election, Harris enjoyed a narrow 1.2-point lead over Trump nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics average, and a 3.5-point lead, according to the FiveThirtyEight average, which excludes some polls that enter the RCP average. In key states, the battle is even tighter. The question is whether pollsters will again underestimate Trump's vote in key states as they did in 2016 and 2020. If so, Harris's supporters risk having the same brutal awakening on November 6, 2024, that Clinton's supporters had on November 9, 2016. However, have pollsters found a way to avoid their past mistakes? In 2021, four major Democratic polling institutes put aside their rivalries to try to identify the problem and find a solution. They recognized the difficulty of reaching 'low-propensity voters,' who are reluctant to participate in mid-term elections or respond to polls for various reasons, including their distrust of institutions. However, they tend to vote in large numbers for Donald Trump. Three years ago, these Democratic pollsters did not come to a consensus on a solution to avoid the 2020 mistakes. Claire Durand's study, however, contains lessons. It shows that some polling methodologies gave accurate results in 2020, such as mixed-mode surveys combining more than one mode of administration. On the other hand, the study concludes that the most widely used methodology in the media – polls using volunteer panels – contributed to distorting the perception of voters by estimating that Biden's voting intentions were stable. It is possible that pollsters have learned from their mistakes. However, the most prudent attitude towards American election polls is to be wary of them.

**The Flaws in US Presidential Election Polls: A Jordanian Perspective**
Recent polls in the US presidential election have shown a narrow margin between Republican and Democratic candidates. Most polls indicate that Harris and Trump are neck and neck, with Harris sometimes leading by a margin of less than 3 percentage points. However, due to the inherent error margin of 3-2.5 percentage points in polls, the difference between Harris and Trump is within the margin of error, meaning that neither of them has a clear advantage in winning or losing. The poll industry has become a 'business' with some companies specializing in it, and while making a profit is legitimate, the problem arises when the desire for profit leads to producing numbers that satisfy the client's desire. This is not only a problem in the US but also in Jordan, where some organizations produce numbers based on the client's preference, rather than providing accurate and unbiased results. However, there are still some non-profit organizations and reputable institutions that produce scientific and accurate polls that can be relied upon. For example, a recent poll conducted on the Elon Musk's X platform, where he asked his followers to vote for Trump or Harris, resulted in 24% for Harris and 76% for Trump, which is not a scientifically valid result due to the non-random sample of Musk's followers who are more likely to support Trump. Scientific and accurate polls have proven their credibility when conducted with professionalism, which includes: first, randomness in selecting the sample to represent the entire community; second, neutrality in wording the question and avoiding any language bias; third, control over the execution; and fourth, institutional independence from money or political bias. These criteria are essential for producing reliable and credible results, and organizations that adhere to them have become a benchmark for accurate polling.
