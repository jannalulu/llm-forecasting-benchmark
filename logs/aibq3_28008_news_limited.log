**2024 U.S. mortgage seesaw back down, says Freddie Mac**
Freddie Mac reports that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.46% for the week ending Aug. 22, down from 6.49% last week. According to Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, 'Although mortgage rates have stayed relatively flat over the past couple of weeks, softer incoming economic data suggest rates will gently slope downward through the end of the year.' Khater believes that rates will need to decline another percentage point to generate buyer demand. Meanwhile, Dayton-area home sales have been climbing, with local home and condo transactions increasing every month this year, including in July.

**2024 U.S. mortgage rates up slightly after substantive dip, says Freddie Mac**
According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.49% for the week ending Aug. 15, up from 6.47% last week. Despite the slight increase, mortgage rates remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year. Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said, 'While rates increased slightly this week, they remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year.' He also noted that lower rates are good news for potential buyers and sellers alike, and that rates are likely to trend down in the coming months as inflation continues to slow. In related news, Dayton-area home sales have been climbing recently, with local home and condo transactions increasing every month this year, including in May.

**2024 U.S. mortgage rates take substantive dip, says Freddie Mac**
According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.47% for the week ending Aug. 8, down from 6.73% last week. This is the lowest level in over a year, said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. 'Mortgage rates plunged this week to their lowest level in over a year following the likely over-reaction to a less than favorable employment report and financial market turbulence for an economy that remains on solid footing,' Khater said. The decline in mortgage rates increases prospective homebuyers' purchasing power and is already providing existing homeowners the opportunity to refinance, with the refinance share of market mortgage applications reaching nearly 42 percent, the highest since March 2022. This comes as Dayton-area home sales have been climbing, with local home and condo transactions increasing every month this year, including in May.

**US Mortgage Rates Hit Lowest Level in Over a Year**
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate in the US has reached a low of 6.47% this week, according to Freddie Mac. This is the lowest level in over a year, following a probable overreaction to a less-than-favorable employment report and market financial turmoil. 'The drop in mortgage rates increases the purchasing power of potential homebuyers and should start to pique their interest in making a move,' said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. 'Additionally, this drop in rates is already giving some existing homeowners the opportunity to refinance, with the refinance share of mortgage applications reaching nearly 42%, the highest since March 2022.' The 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.47% on average as of August 8, 2024, down from 6.73% the previous week, and 6.96% a year ago. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.63% on average, down from 5.99% the previous week, and 6.34% a year ago.

**US 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edges up to 6.78%, Freddie Mac says**
The average rate on the US 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.78% for the week ending July 25, according to Freddie Mac. Despite the lower rates, buyers are still hesitant to enter the market, with existing home sales falling 5.4% in June to the slowest rate since December. Housing inventory, however, has jumped to the highest in nearly four years, leading to a slow shift from a seller's market to a buyer's market. Homeowners are holding on to properties with lower rates, and rising home insurance premiums are hurting affordability. Economists expect borrowing costs to ease further later this year as the Federal Reserve shifts to interest rate cuts.

**Mortgage Rates Inch Up from 16-Month Low â€“ Aug. 28, 2024**
Mortgage rates have inched up from a 16-month low, with 30-year fixed rates rising to 6.33%. This is just above the 6.28% reading seen on Monday and August 5, which was the cheapest average since April 2023. Rates have dropped significantly from their July high of 7.08% and the historic 23-year high of 8.01% reached last October. The rates are influenced by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and industry factors, including the Federal Reserve's bond-buying policy and the federal funds rate. The Fed has maintained the federal funds rate at its current level since last July, and is hesitant to start cutting rates until inflation falls sufficiently and sustainably. According to Freddie Mac, the weekly average of 30-year mortgage rates dipped to 6.46% last week, after plunging to its lowest weekly average since May 2023. It's essential to shop around for the best mortgage option and compare rates regularly, as rates vary widely across lenders.

**Average 30-year Mortgage Rate Hovers Around Lowest Level Since May 2023: Freddie Mac**
The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has remained steady at around 6.5 percent, its lowest level in over a year, according to Freddie Mac data. Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac, stated, 'While rates increased slightly this week, they remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year.' The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has been declining since peaking at 7.79 percent in October 2023. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage edged up to 5.66 percent, but is still down from 6.46 percent last year. Refinancing demand has increased by 117 percent compared to the same time last year, and overall mortgage applications have risen by nearly 17 percent, the highest level since January 2023. However, industry experts believe that the housing market will not experience a sharp downturn due to the lack of supply and elevated demand, but market conditions may come into better balance.

**Mortgage rates tick up on weekly basis, but remains at lowest level in over a year**
Mortgage rates have increased slightly from last week, but remain at their lowest level in over a year. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.49% as of August 15, up from 6.47% last week, but down from 7.09% in the same period last year. According to Freddie Mac's chief economist, Sam Khater, 'While rates increased slightly this week, they remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year.' Khater also noted that lower rates are beneficial for both potential buyers and sellers, as they nearly hit 8% in 2023, causing a slowdown in the housing market. As inflation continues to slow, the 30-year fixed-rate is expected to trend down in the coming months.

**Mortgage Interest Rates Today, August 6, 2024 | Rates Plunge. Is It Finally a Good Time to Buy a House?**
Mortgage interest rates have plummeted to their lowest level in over a year, with average 30-year mortgage rates currently around 6%, according to Zillow data. This decline is attributed to weaker-than-expected labor market data and concerns of a possible economic downturn. While rates are expected to continue trending down over the next couple of years, experts warn that demand will surge and home prices will rise further. However, buying a house now will allow you to benefit from today's lower rates and any future increases in your home's value. Additionally, you can refinance into a lower monthly payment later on if rates drop further. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.73% last week, a five-basis-point decrease from the previous week, according to Freddie Mac. A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might be a good option for those looking for predictability and lower interest payments, but with a higher monthly payment. As inflation comes down, mortgage rates will recede, and most major forecasts expect rates to go down throughout the rest of 2024.

**2024 U.S. mortgage rates drop for consecutive weeks, says Freddie Mac**
According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.77% for the week ending July 18, a decrease from 6.89% last week. This marks the second consecutive week of declining mortgage rates. Freddie Mac's chief economist, Sam Khater, stated that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to its lowest level since mid-March, dropping 12 basis points from last week. Khater noted that while mortgage rates are headed in the right direction, homebuyers have yet to respond to lower rates, with purchase application demand still roughly 5% below spring levels. Despite this, Dayton-area home sales have been climbing recently, with local home and condo transactions increasing every month this year.

**Key U.S. mortgage rate drops to lowest since March, Freddie Mac says**
The average interest rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the US has fallen to its lowest level since mid-March, according to Freddie Mac. The rate averaged 6.77% for the week ending July 18, down from 6.89% the previous week. Despite the decline, homebuyers are not yet responding to the lower rates, with purchase application demand remaining 5% below its spring levels. Freddie Mac's chief economist, Sam Khater, attributed this to buyers waiting for rates to decline further before making a purchase. The housing market has been affected by the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases since 2022, with existing-home sales reaching a 29-year low in 2023. Economists are hopeful that the anticipated start of rate cuts by the Fed could support the housing market through lowered borrowing costs in the months ahead.
