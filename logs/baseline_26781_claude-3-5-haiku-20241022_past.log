Let me analyze this carefully:

Key considerations:
1. Timeframe is until October 1, 2024 (just under 2 months from now)
2. Potential removal mechanisms include resignation, impeachment, election loss, coup
3. 30-day temporary replacement rule exists

Current context:
- Ruto is a sitting president with significant political power
- Kenyan political landscape has been somewhat turbulent recently
- No immediate signs of imminent removal

Potential risk factors:
- Political opposition remains strong
- Economic challenges in Kenya
- Potential legal/corruption challenges

Mitigating factors:
- Ruto was democratically elected in 2022
- Short remaining timeframe reduces removal probability
- No clear immediate mechanism for removal visible

After careful analysis of probabilities and potential scenarios, my forecast considers:
- Low but non-zero chance of unexpected political developments
- Short remaining time reduces likelihood of major change
- Need for substantial evidence/event to trigger removal

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 16.75%, but 9.25% being the most likely. Probability: 9.25%.
