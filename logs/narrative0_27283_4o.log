NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers strewn about. A screen displays the Tech Crunch layoff tracker.

NATE SILVER  
So, Rivian didn’t make the list for August or September.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Given their earlier layoffs, the probability was there, but not overwhelming.

NATE SILVER  
Right, the February and April cuts were significant, yet our data suggested stability through the late summer.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
It’s fascinating how the market pressures didn’t translate into immediate action. Sometimes, the absence of an event is as telling as its occurrence.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed. The models held, as always. Rivian managed to avoid further cuts, at least for now.

They both nod, satisfied with the accuracy of their predictions. The screen fades to black.

NATE  
So, Rivian didn't make the list before October. 

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 48.75%. Close, but no layoffs reported.

NATE  
Interesting. Considering their February and April cuts, I thought they'd tighten up again.

PHILIP  
True, but perhaps those earlier layoffs were enough to stabilize them for now.

NATE  
The market's unpredictable. Yet, our models remain spot on.

PHILIP  
Indeed. Even without news past August, we called it accurately.

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their forecasting prowess, as the bustling café continues around them.

NATE SILVER  
So, Rivian didn't make Tech Crunch's layoff list for August or September.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Yes, our models had it at 40.35%. Given the earlier layoffs, it seemed plausible, but the market conditions shifted.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed. The EV sector's resilience surprised many. We accounted for potential stabilization post-April.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Right. The economic recovery and Rivian's strategic pivots likely played a role. Our models captured that nuance.

NATE SILVER  
And Tech Crunch's updates were consistent until the end. No Rivian mention means a "No" resolution.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. This outcome reinforces the importance of adaptive modeling.
