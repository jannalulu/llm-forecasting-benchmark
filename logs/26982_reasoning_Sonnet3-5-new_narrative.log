Here's a script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, the tension with Taiwan played out exactly as our models predicted."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the escalating patterns after Lai's inauguration and those June incidents, our models had it at 78.35%."

Nate: "The historical data was telling. After those 'punishment' drills in May and sending 66 aircraft over two days in June, China's increasing aggression was clear. The August-September window has historically been active too."

Tetlock: "The timing was crucial - right before the US midterms. Perfect opportunity for China to test boundaries."

Nate: "And with Taiwan's daily violation average tripling since January's election, it was almost inevitable we'd see numbers above 20 in that timeframe."

[Both nod knowingly as they update their forecasting models]

Here's a 150-word script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Taiwan ADIZ violations between August and September."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June military drills, our models had it at 78.5%. The pattern was clear."

Nate: "The data showed an unmistakable trend. From 2 violations per day in January, jumping to 10 after the inauguration. Those 66 aircraft in just two days in June were particularly telling."

Philip: "China's rhetoric about 'hostile separatists' and their increased military pressure made this prediction almost textbook. Though I must say, the summer timing added an interesting variable."

Nate: "True. Historical patterns suggested August-September would be a prime window for heightened activity. The models never lie."

[Both nod knowingly while studying their screens]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the Taiwan ADIZ violations."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Indeed. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June military drills, our models had it at 78.32%."

Nate: "The pattern was clear. China's response to the DPP administration has been increasingly aggressive. Those 66 aircraft in June were a strong signal."

Tetlock: "What's interesting is how predictable these intimidation tactics have become. The upward trend in violations since May 2024, combined with historical August-September patterns, made this almost inevitable."

Nate: "And here we are, September 16th, looking at another successful prediction. The question is: what's Beijing's next move?"

[Both turn back to their screens, already working on their next forecast]
