**EUR/USD Holds Steady Above 1.0900 Amid Market Volatility and Mixed Economic Data**
The EUR/USD pair remains above 1.0900 despite market volatility and mixed economic data. The US Dollar's (USD) recovery was limited by Wall Street's bullish opening, allowing EUR/USD to contain its daily losses. The pair has retreated from a fresh multi-month high of 1.1008 and is now trading near the 1.0900 threshold. US Treasury yields have bounced back, supporting the USD's recovery, while the Euro has faced pressure from disappointing Eurozone economic data, including a 0.3% month-on-month decline in June Retail Sales and a 11.9% year-over-year decline in German Factory Orders.

**EUR/USD Price Forecast: 1.1000 appears to be a tough nut to crack for buyers**
The EUR/USD pair is trading at 1.0920 with mild gains during the early European session on Monday. The uptick is backed by the consolidation of the US Dollar. Investors are awaiting the German August ZEW survey on Tuesday for fresh impetus. The weaker-than-expected data is expected to contribute to a negative outlook in the economy and might keep the European Central Bank in easing mode. According to the daily chart, the bullish outlook prevails as the major pair remains above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average. The first upside barrier emerges near 1.0973, and the crucial resistance level is located at 1.1000-1.1010. On the other hand, the initial support level is at 1.0881, with a breach exposing the 100-day EMA at 1.0822 and potentially leading to 1.0735.

**EUR/USD appreciates to near 1.0850 ahead of US PCE inflation**
The EUR/USD currency pair is trading around 1.0860 during the Asian session on Friday, extending its gains after rebounding from a two-week low of 1.0825 recorded on Wednesday.

The EUR/USD pair is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% of all transactions.

**EUR/USD: A break below 1.0640 to trigger a sustained decline**
The Euro (EUR) is expected to trade within a range of 1.0685/1.0730 and remain under pressure. A break below 1.0640 could trigger a sustained decline for EUR/USD, according to UOB Group analysts. The pair is likely in a consolidation phase, with a range of 1.0685/1.0730 expected today. In the 1-3 week view, downward momentum is building, but it's unclear if it's enough to start a sustained decline. A significant support level at 1.0640 is also a consideration.

**Dollar and Euro: How did they start the day? What are the exchange rates today?**
The Turkish lira (TL) against the US dollar (USD) ended the day with a 0.3% decrease, closing at 32.8429. The dollar index is currently trading at 105.9, down 0.10% from the previous day. The euro (EUR) against the Turkish lira is trading flat at 35.1255. Global markets are mixed ahead of the release of US GDP data, while attention is focused on the Turkish Central Bank's (TCMB) interest rate decision. Analysts are expecting the Federal Reserve (Fed) to take a cautious approach, and the release of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data, a key inflation indicator, is expected to be closely watched. The probability of a Fed rate cut in September is 68%, and in October it is 97%. The possibility of a second rate cut in December is 73%.

**EUR: French election and US PCE to guide the EUR/USD – ING**
The EUR/USD is trading near 1.07 after a soft session for risk sentiment on Tuesday. ING's analyst Francesco Pesole notes that the OAT:Bund 10-year spread is hovering around 75-80bp, which may be the level it approaches the French election on Sunday. A poll of polls by Bloomberg sees Marine Le Pen's National Rally leading with over 35% and the leftist New Popular Front alliance at 28%. ECB official Olli Rehn was dovish in an interview, saying market pricing for two more rate cuts in 2024 is reasonable. Investors are not heavily influenced by ECB communication, but Rehn's words signal tolerance towards inflation bumps, which is euro-negative. The EUR/USD price action will be determined by French election positioning and Friday's US PCE. ING has a bias for a weakening in the pair to June's lows (1.0670) before a rebound on Friday on encouraging PCE figures.

**Dolar/TL sets new record, Euro/TL at 35.38**
The Turkish Lira (TL) has started the day with a new record against the US Dollar (USD). The USD/TL rate has reached a record high of 32.95 at 09:40. The Euro (EUR) is trading around 35.38. The Dollar Index is currently at 105.5, slightly below its previous close. Global markets are following a mixed trend due to uncertainty about the steps the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will take in the coming period. Analysts believe that the growth and consumption data to be announced in the US this week will provide clues about the Fed's future steps, and that the bank's guidance may also increase market volatility. In the foreign exchange market, the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates in September is 74%, and in October it is 90%. The possibility of the bank cutting interest rates again after a potential rate cut is priced at 90% in December.

**EUR/USD hangs near its lowest level since early May, seems vulnerable below 1.0700 mark**
The EUR/USD pair is struggling to attract buyers and is being weighed down by political uncertainty in Europe and a combination of other factors. The pair is trading near its lowest level since early May, around 1.0690-1.0685, and is vulnerable to further declines. The Fed's hawkish stance and strong US business activity data are supporting the USD, while the Eurozone's slow growth and concerns about France's fiscal situation are weighing on the Euro. Traders are waiting for key economic data releases, including the US PCE Price Index and German IFO Business Climate, to influence the near-term price dynamics of the pair.
