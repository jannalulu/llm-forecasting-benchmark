Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Observations:
1. Recent polls consistently show Harris's favorability trending upward
2. Multiple polls in late July 2024 show her net favorability improving:
- ABC News/Ipsos: From -11% (35% favorable/46% unfavorable) to -1% (43% favorable/42% unfavorable)
- Associated Press/NORC: Net -1% (46% favorable/47% unfavorable)
- Morning Consult: Net +4% (50% favorable/46% unfavorable)

Base Rate Considerations:
- Incumbent VP favorability typically volatile
- Recent surge after Biden's withdrawal suggests momentum
- Target is net favorability > -8 on September 1, 2024

Trend Analysis:
- Rapid improvement from negative to near-neutral ratings
- Strong enthusiasm among Democrats (88% supportive)
- Growing independent voter support (44% favorable)

Potential Counterforces:
- Potential negative campaign attacks
- Ongoing economic/political challenges
- Voter fatigue

Probability Assessment Framework:
- Strong evidence suggests trending above -8
- Consistent multi-poll confirmation
- Positive momentum trajectory

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 84.30%, but 76.40% being the most likely. Probability: 76.40%.
