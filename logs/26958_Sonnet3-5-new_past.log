Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Multiple sources report plans to block YouTube by September 2024, including Gazeta.ru citing sources close to presidential administration
2. Increasing tensions between Russia and YouTube, with over 83 Russian channels blocked in 2024 alone
3. Pattern of gradual degradation already occurring - speed slowdowns reported by multiple sources
4. Russia has previously blocked other Western social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram)
5. Prominent figures like Kadyrov calling for YouTube to be "shut down to hell"

Key Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Official denials from Kremlin spokesman Peskov and other officials about plans to block YouTube
2. YouTube remains hugely popular in Russia with 82.6M users
3. No adequate domestic replacement exists (RuTube not widely adopted)
4. Russian authorities stating preference for speed reduction over outright blocking
5. Multiple previous predictions of YouTube blocking haven't materialized

Key Considerations:
1. Timeline is very specific (before October 1, 2024)
2. Resolution criteria requires official blocking via Roskomnadzor
3. Recent pattern shows preference for degrading service rather than outright blocking
4. Multiple independent sources confirming September timeline adds credibility
5. Russian government has shown willingness to take dramatic steps despite public impact

Balancing these factors:
- The multiple independent sources citing September blocking plans are compelling
- The gradual degradation appears to be following predicted pattern
- However, official denials and lack of domestic alternative suggest complete blocking remains risky
- The specific timeframe adds uncertainty

The pattern suggests high likelihood of continued service degradation but lower likelihood of complete blocking within the specified timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Multiple reports indicate a gradual degradation plan is already in motion, with speeds being reduced to 40% and then 70%
2. Gazeta.ru, citing sources close to presidential administration, reports YouTube will be fully blocked by September 2024
3. British intelligence reports suggest a full block is planned for September 2024
4. Russia has increasingly restricted other Western platforms (Facebook, Instagram)
5. YouTube has blocked 83 Russian channels in 2024 alone, creating tension
6. Kadyrov and some officials are actively calling for YouTube to be "shut down"

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Recent official denials from Kremlin spokesman Peskov and Senator Pushkov about plans to block YouTube
2. The platform remains highly popular with 82.6M Russian users (July-Aug 2024)
3. Government officials emphasize slowing speeds rather than blocking
4. Deputy Anton Gorelkin explicitly stated blocking "is not being considered"
5. Economic and social costs of full blocking would be significant
6. Russia has threatened to block YouTube many times before without following through

Balancing Factors:
1. The timing (before October 1) is relatively short, giving less time for implementation
2. Russia appears to be taking a gradual approach with speed restrictions first
3. Official denials could be strategic misdirection
4. Technical preparations and alternatives (like VK) aren't fully ready
5. Previous patterns suggest Russia tends to threaten more than act on platform bans

The most compelling evidence points to Russia continuing its current strategy of degrading service rather than implementing a full block before October 1, 2024. While a block appears increasingly likely in the longer term, the short timeframe and recent official statements make it less likely before the resolution date.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.50%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Multiple sources report preparations for a September 2024 ban:
- Gazeta.ru cites sources close to presidential administration
- Independent Russian media reporting planned September blockage
- UK intelligence suggests September 2024 timeline
- Current slowdowns seen as precursor to full ban

2. Increasing restrictions and tensions:
- Already slowing YouTube speeds (40-70% reduction)
- Over 200 Russian channels blocked by YouTube
- Recent protests against YouTube in Moscow
- Kadyrov and some officials calling for complete ban

3. Historical precedent of Russia banning Western platforms:
- Previously banned Facebook, Instagram
- Pattern of increasing internet control

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Official denials of ban plans:
- Kremlin spokesman Peskov explicitly denied plans
- Senator Pushkov stated no blockings expected
- Multiple officials emphasize technical rather than political issues

2. Economic and social considerations:
- YouTube remains hugely popular (82.6M Russian users)
- No viable domestic alternative yet
- Officials note not wanting to "harm citizens"
- Important platform for both opposition and pro-government content

3. Pattern of threats without action:
- Years of previous ban threats not implemented
- Focus on slowdowns rather than full blocking
- Current strategy appears to be degradation rather than ban

Balancing factors:
1. Timeline is very specific (before October 1)
2. Technical preparations appear underway
3. Multiple independent sources confirm September timeline
4. But significant official resistance remains
5. Pattern suggests gradual restrictions rather than sudden ban

Based on this evidence, I see a significant but not overwhelming probability of a ban before October 1. The multiple independent sources citing September plans are compelling, but official denials and practical considerations provide meaningful counterweight.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 65.40%, with 45.30% being the most likely. Probability: 45.30%
