*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers strewn across the table.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows didn't exceed 200 herds as of September 30. Our models had it at 35.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. The spread stalled significantly after July. The swift containment measures and the non-viability of the virus in retail milk played a crucial role.

**NATE SILVER**  
Kansas and Texas were hotspots, but the CDC and USDA's coordination was impressive. By July 17, the outbreak was already slowing.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models were spot on again. A reminder of the value of accurate forecasting in public health crises.

*They exchange knowing smiles, their confidence in data-driven predictions reaffirmed.*

**NATE SILVER**  
On to the next challenge, then.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a table, coffee in hand, discussing the recent H5N1 outbreak.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—did it exceed 200 herds?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 25.34%. The spread was significant, but containment efforts kicked in just in time.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the USDA's quick response and the FDA's findings on non-viable samples helped.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. By July, the data was clear. Nine states, 46 herds by May, but the trajectory was downward.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how accurate our models remain, even with limited data post-July.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. It’s a testament to the power of probabilistic forecasting. Now, let's see what October brings.

*They sip their coffee, contemplating the future.*

So, did the H5N1 outbreak exceed 200 herds?

PHILIP  
(shaking his head)  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. The spread stalled in late July, just as we predicted.

NATE  
(nodding)  
Right. The containment efforts in Kansas and Texas were more effective than anticipated. The USDA's swift response helped a lot.

PHILIP  
And the FDA's findings on milk samples reassured the public. No viable virus in dairy products was a turning point.

NATE  
Exactly. It’s a relief, but a reminder of how close we came. Our models were spot on, as always.
