Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again regarding the ICC warrant for Yoav Gallant.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, our models had it at 32%. Despite the early reports and Netanyahu's concerns in April, the international pressure from the US and G7 countries proved significant.

Nate: The precedent of Putin's warrant last year had many expecting similar action, but the diplomatic backdoor efforts made a difference.

Philip: Indeed. While the ICC investigation continued, the combination of US intervention and ongoing peace negotiations created enough hesitation. The 32% probability reflected both the ICC's historical reluctance to issue warrants against officials of US-allied nations and the intense diplomatic efforts to prevent escalation.

Nate: [nodding] The models accounted for the ICC's careful approach, especially given the complex geopolitical implications.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again regarding the ICC warrant for Yoav Gallant.

Philip Tetlock: No, our models gave it a 32% probability. Despite Netanyahu's desperate plea to Biden in April and the international pressure, the ICC ultimately didn't issue the warrant before the deadline.

Nate: The diplomatic efforts by the G7 countries proved crucial. Looking back at our data from July, the precedent of only 42 ICC arrest warrants since 2005 was telling.

Philip: Indeed. While the Putin warrant last year suggested increased ICC boldness, the intense diplomatic pressure and potential impact on peace negotiations in Gaza significantly reduced the likelihood. The ICC's historically cautious approach with major military powers also factored into our probability assessment.

Nate: Another demonstration that even highly publicized possibilities often don't materialize.

NATE SILVER: (reviewing papers) Well, Philip, our models were spot on again regarding the ICC warrant for Yoav Gallant.

PHILIP TETLOCK: Indeed. Given the precedent with Putin's warrant and the international pressure campaign we saw in July, our models calculated a 32.5% probability.

NATE: The diplomatic intervention from the US and G7 countries proved crucial. Despite the ICC's investigation and Netanyahu's concerns back in April, they managed to prevent the warrants.

PHILIP: Exactly. While the evidence threshold might have been there, the political considerations were significant. Our models factored in that historically, the ICC has issued only 42 arrest warrants since 2005, and the diplomatic pushback was substantial.

NATE: The base rate was key. Even with the Gaza situation, the ICC's historical reluctance to issue warrants against officials from nations with powerful allies weighted heavily in our calculations.

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a quiet corner table, reviewing papers.

NATE
(stirring coffee)
Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Gallant's ICC warrant situation.

PHILIP
Indeed. Given the precedent with Putin's warrant and the mounting international pressure, our models had it at 72.3%.

NATE
The signs were there - Netanyahu's desperate plea to Biden in April, the G7's unusual intervention, and the ICC's historical pattern with high-profile cases.

PHILIP
The timing was crucial. Once those reports about child deportation evidence emerged, similar to the Putin case, it was almost inevitable.

NATE
(nodding)
Defense ministers rarely escape scrutiny in cases like this. The ICC's focus on individual accountability made Gallant a prime target, especially given his direct command role.

PHILIP
Another validation of our probabilistic approach to geopolitical events.

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the ICC warrant for Gallant."

Philip: "Yes, our analysis gave it a 32% probability. The diplomatic pressure from the US and G7 countries proved decisive in preventing the warrants, just as our models suggested."

Nate: "The precedent of the Putin warrant had everyone on edge, but the geopolitical dynamics were quite different. Our models factored in the strong Western opposition to ICC action against Israeli officials."

Philip: "Indeed. The ICC's historical pattern of issuing only 42 warrants in nearly 20 years, combined with the intense diplomatic maneuvering we saw in April, made this outcome predictable. Though 32% wasn't negligible - it could have gone either way."

Nate: "The peace negotiations were the key variable. The ICC didn't want to derail those efforts."
