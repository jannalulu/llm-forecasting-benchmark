**Will Donald Trump Fire His Campaign Manager? Crypto Bettors Think It's Close To 50-50 After Bringing On Corey Lewandowski**
Donald Trump's recent addition of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to his team has sparked speculation about potential leadership changes. According to a Polymarket, there is a 47% chance that Trump will fire his campaign manager before the November election. Trump has publicly expressed support for his current campaign leadership, stating, 'Susie is fantastic, as you know. And Chris is fantastic. They are leading it.' However, the Polymarket prediction suggests that there is still a significant possibility of changes in campaign leadership. The addition of experienced campaign veterans, particularly those with a history of loyalty to Trump, may be seen as an attempt to reinvigorate the campaign as it faces fundraising challenges and competitive polling in key swing states.

**Donald Trump Shakes Up Campaign Team as Kamala Harris' Polling Surges**
Donald Trump has brought in new members to his 2024 campaign team, including Corey Lewandowski, who was previously fired as Trump's 2016 campaign manager after being accused of assaulting a reporter. The move comes as Vice President Kamala Harris continues to lead Trump in the polls, with a 4-point lead in the latest Emerson College poll and a 2.9-point lead in FiveThirtyEight's national average tracker. Trump's campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said in a statement that the new additions will help Trump 'prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the most radical ticket in American history.' However, the Democratic National Committee's rapid response director, Alex Floyd, responded by saying that Trump is 'surrounding himself with people who share his values—namely crooks, convicts, and creeps.' Trump was also asked about his campaign strategy of launching personal attacks on Harris, and he said, 'I think I am entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she'll be a terrible president.'

**Trump Campaign Brings Back a Very Familiar Face for 2024 Homestretch**
Donald Trump has announced the return of his 2016 campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, as a senior adviser to his 2024 campaign. Lewandowski will join other new hires, including Tim Murtaugh, who was communications director on Trump's 2020 campaign, and Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz, and Taylor Budowich, who were working for the Trump-aligned super PAC MAGA Inc. Trump posted on Truth Social, 'We're leading in almost all Polls, in some cases leading by A LOT, despite the fact that the Fake News is pulling out all stops for their Radical Left San Francisco Liberal, Kamala Harris.' Trump's current co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said in a statement, 'As we head into the home stretch of this election, we are continuing to add to our impressive campaign team, Corey Lewandowski, Taylor Budowich, Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz, and Tim Murtaugh are all veterans of prior Trump campaigns and their unmatched experience will help President Trump prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.' LaCivita has a history of running negative campaigns, including the 'swift boat' campaign in 2004 against John Kerry.

**Is Donald Trump exploring firing his campaign managers? What we know**
Rumors that Donald Trump is considering firing his campaign managers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, appear to have originated from a since changed online article and a quote from Anthony Scaramucci, a vocal critic of the former president. Scaramucci said on the podcast The Rest Is Politics U.S. that Trump was irate over the choice of Ohio Senator JD Vance as the Republican's 2024 running mate and had 'talked to people' about firing LaCivita and Wiles. However, Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, denied the reports, stating that Trump is 'thrilled' with the choice of running mate and that any reporting to the contrary is 'ridiculous fake news.'

**Secret Sources Explain Why Donald Trump, Who Believes in Superstitions, Is Reuniting His Team with New Campaign Staff… Meanwhile, Questions Arise on Corey Lewandowski's Position**
Donald Trump has announced the return of Corey Lewandowski, who he fired in 2016, and the addition of several former campaign veterans to his staff. According to Kellyanne Conway, a former counselor to the president, this move signals Trump's ability to recapture the 'swagger and spontaneity' of his successful 2016 run. Conway stated, 'Trump 2024 can be the best and most successful Trump of all,' and that the new hires will provide a range of guidance and 'superstitious' support. Lewandowski will reportedly serve as Trump's 'personal envoy,' and will advise senior leadership alongside Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. Trump has denied that this move constitutes a shakeup, and instead sees it as a sign of his campaign's strength. He stated, 'We have great people. Susie is fantastic, as you know, and Chris is fantastic. They're leading it. Corey Lewandowski is coming in.'

**Donald Trump's campaign rehires Corey Lewandowski as 'senior adviser' after 8 years**
Donald Trump's presidential campaign has rehired Corey Lewandowski as a 'senior adviser' eight years after he was dismissed as campaign manager. Lewandowski is a controversial figure known for his aggressive tactics and past controversies, including mocking a migrant child with Down syndrome and facing charges for allegedly sexually harassing a woman. Despite this, Trump has maintained loyalty to Lewandowski, who has been involved in the Republican National Committee and played a role in the 2024 Republican National Convention. Lewandowski's reappointment comes as the campaign faces challenges in fundraising and polling in crucial swing states. Trump's campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said that Lewandowski's experience will help the campaign 'prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the most radical ticket in American history.' Trump expressed his satisfaction with the campaign's leadership, saying 'Susie is fantastic, as you know. And Chris is fantastic. They are leading it.' However, the decision to rehire Lewandowski is seen by some as a gamble, considering his previous actions.

**Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski reveals the 'truth' about what's happening inside the Trump campaign as Donald brings in more staff**
Corey Lewandowski, former campaign manager for Donald Trump, revealed the 'truth' about the Trump campaign's changes, stating that it is an 'addition campaign, not a subtraction campaign.' He praised the current leadership team, including Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, and said he has no plans to review the campaign's finances. Lewandowski emphasized that the campaign is 'all hands on deck' with 80 days left until the election and 45 days before mail-in ballots are sent out. He dismissed concerns about Trump's performance, saying he is 'not off his game,' and pointed to the lack of media engagement from Vice President Kamala Harris. Lewandowski also downplayed the significance of polling showing Trump running a deficit among women in key battleground states, saying that women supported Trump in 2016 and will do so again in 2024.

**Opinion | Is a Trump campaign shake-up coming?**
Donald Trump's presidential campaign is facing a potential shake-up, with speculation growing about changes to his team. Trump has been agitated about the campaign's performance, and advice has been pouring in from all directions. He has previously fired and hired several campaign managers, including Corey Lewandowski and Kellyanne Conway, in an effort to find the right combination. Now, with the campaign facing a tied race and Vice President Kamala Harris having more paths to 270 electoral votes, Trump is considering bringing back Lewandowski as a senior adviser. However, this move has raised questions about the campaign's discipline and Trump's own behavior, with some of his advisers seeking to restrain his impulses. As one of his former campaign managers, Lewandowski, wrote in 2015, 'Let Trump Be Trump.' But this prescription may be exactly what's wrong with the campaign, as Trump continues to engage in petty name-calling and make ridiculous claims about crowd sizes.

**'Growing chatter' at Mar-a-Lago that Trump wants two campaign heads to 'kill each other'**
The re-hiring of former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has sparked speculation that co-campaign heads Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita might be on the way out. According to Tara Palmeri, Lewandowski told allies that he was coming back as a campaign chairman, essentially a layer above Wiles and LaCivita. Palmeri wrote that Wiles is likely to survive, but LaCivita may be under pressure due to his high billing fees, with some 'chatter' around Mar-a-Lago suggesting that Trump wants LaCivita and Lewandowski to 'kill each other' and for one to win, rather than firing either of them directly. LaCivita has invoiced the campaign $1.7 million this year, with some questioning the value of his services, including a $50,000 monthly fee from the RNC. Palmeri also reported that LaCivita has undergone a mood change since the RNC convention, becoming quiet and moody.

**Trump Hires 2016 Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski**
The Trump campaign has reinstated Corey Lewandowski, who managed Trump's 2016 campaign, as a senior advisor. Lewandowski joins several other former Trump aides, including Tim Murtaugh, Alex Pfeiffer, and Alex Bruesewitz, who will play similar roles. Trump confirmed the news on his Truth Social platform, stating that more people will be joining his team for the next 82 days, which he describes as 'the most important in campaign history.' Lewandowski's reappointment may serve as a strategic counter to criticisms that the campaign's recent shifts in messaging have been detrimental to its foundational message. Trump praised his current campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, in a social media post, seemingly contradicting claims that he was considering firing them. Lewandowski summarized his campaign strategy for the next 81 days, using the phrase 'Let Trump, Be Trump,' a slogan that resonated with far-right conservatives. The move follows growing backlash from MAGA supporters who feel that the current campaign has strayed from its core principles.

The campaign stated that the new advisers 'will help President Trump prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.'

**Trump adds five new staffers, including Corey Lewandowski**
Former President Donald Trump's campaign is adding five new staff members, including his 2016 campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, as it prepares to face Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election. According to Trump's co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, the new hires 'are all veterans of prior Trump campaigns and their unmatched experience will help President Trump prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the most radical ticket in American history.' Lewandowski has a history with Trump, having served as his first campaign manager in 2016, but was later fired and went on to work with other Republicans. He has now returned to Trump's orbit, reportedly after being convinced that Trump would be the nominee. The other new hires include Tim Murtaugh, Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz, and Taylor Budowich, who have all worked with Trump's campaign or pro-Trump super PACs in the past.

**Is Donald Trump exploring firing his campaign managers? What we know**
Rumors that Donald Trump is considering firing his campaign managers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, appear to have originated from a since changed online article and a quote from Anthony Scaramucci, a vocal critic of the former president. Scaramucci said on the podcast The Rest Is Politics U.S. that Trump was irate over the choice of Ohio Senator JD Vance as the Republican's 2024 running mate and had 'talked to people' about firing LaCivita and Wiles. However, Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, denied the reports, stating that Trump is 'thrilled' with the choice of running mate and that any reporting to the contrary is 'ridiculous fake news.'

**Report: Trump Is Mulling Over Firing Campaign Managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles**
Former President Donald Trump is reportedly considering a significant shake-up within his campaign team, potentially firing campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. According to former aides who have turned against Trump, he is 'lighting people up' inside his campaign, and is 'p*ssed' with the direction of his campaign. Trump's recent absence from the campaign trail is allegedly due to his anger, and he is reportedly regretting his endorsement of J.D. Vance. However, Dan Bongino disputes this, saying it's 'bullsh*t' and that Trump was 'killing it' on recent shows. Rasmussen Reports claims that Trump is beating Kamala Harris, and that Democrats are in 'real trouble.'

**Inside Trump's 'meltdown'**
Donald Trump's campaign is reportedly in turmoil as he struggles to cope with the rise of Kamala Harris in the polls. Insiders have revealed that Trump is 'lighting up' his campaign staff over his 'terrible' decision to pick JD Vance as vice president. Former White House staffer Anthony Scaramucci said, 'He picked Vance - he knows Vance was a terrible, terrible pick.' Trump is reportedly talking to his confidantes about firing his campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. Despite urges from Republican voices to stop the crazy messaging, 'Trump is struggling to get past his anger,' according to a top Republican source. Trump's age, 78, has now become a factor in his own demise - with some even calling him the Biden of the 2024 campaign. Several join the speculation that Trump might be on the brink of a breakdown. Meanwhile, Harris is striding around swing states with her freshly picked vice president in tow, raising $200 million in donations in just her first week of campaigning and continuously rising in polls.

**Trump MUST fire his campaign managers NOW, they are Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, they are devastating his re-election! He MUST swap out JD Vance, does not matter if you 'like' him, Trump's election**
The author believes that Trump's re-election campaign is being hurt by his current campaign managers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, and that he should swap out JD Vance for a new VP pick. The author suggests that Trump should introduce his new VP pick on August 22nd, during Harris's acceptance speech, to gain free advertising and attention. The replacement should be a female minority, and the author suggests that Trump should focus on Harris's failed policies and not engage in personal attacks. The author also suggests that Trump should consider allowing Bobby Kennedy Jr. onto the debate stage to help him prosecute Harris's record. Additionally, the author provides a list of 20 items from the RNC platform that Trump should focus on, including sealing the border, ending inflation, and defending the Constitution. The author encourages readers to support Trump and to donate to their cause.

**It's not just the Secret Service chief. Top U.S. leaders are resigning in record numbers.**
The recent resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle after an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump is part of a larger trend of top U.S. leaders resigning in record numbers. According to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc., 1,101 CEOs in the United States left their jobs in the first six months of the year, a 21% increase from the same period in 2023. Experts say the challenging workplace climate for chief executives is amplified for female and minority leaders who face bias and other hurdles. Michael Posner, an ethics and finance professor at NYU Stern School of Business, said, 'People have prejudices, and they are quick to attribute blame and to attach their prejudice to whatever went wrong.' Maurice Schweitzer, an operations and information management professor at the Wharton School of Business, added, 'We might judge the missteps of minorities more harshly.' The study also found that while most CEO departures were planned in 2023, resignations under pressure grew to 10% from 5% a year earlier.

**Paul Dans, the Man Behind Project 2025's Most Radical Plans**
Paul Dans, the director of Project 2025, has stepped down from his role amidst denunciations from the Trump campaign. Project 2025 aimed to build the next Republican administration, two years before a Republican president might again take office. The project's leaders, including several former members of the Trump administration, aimed to create a database of conservatives willing to serve in the administration, with the goal of having a fully staffed and carefully selected administration ready to roll. The database would include a 'conservative LinkedIn' with information on applicants, their progress on training sessions, and any 'red flags.' The project's most important pillar was about personnel, not policy, with the goal of reinstating Schedule F, a provision that would shift career employees into a new job category that would make them easier to fire. Dans, a 55-year-old lawyer, had a remarkable ascent from obscurity, but his resignation was at least partly symbolic, as the work of Project 2025 is largely done. The database has assembled a list of over 10,000 names of job candidates vetted for loyalty to Trump's cause, who will be ready to deploy into federal agencies should he win the 2024 election. Dans' vision for the database was to suggest people for roles that are currently assigned to career employees, in keeping with the plans for Schedule F. He has been laying out his thinking in interviews with conservative media outlets, saying 'We're going to get this done right on the next go-round,' and 'If a person can't get in and fire people right away, what good is political management?'

**'Their biggest regret is releasing it on the internet': No one's buying the claim that Project 2025 is going away**
Donald Trump's 2024 campaign has distanced itself from the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a 900-page policy document, after its director Paul Dans announced his departure in August. However, many are skeptical of Trump's claim that he has no involvement with the project, citing his ability to force Dans out and the fact that the project's ideology will continue to be pushed by its remaining staff. Trump's campaign manager Chris LaCivita and top adviser Susie Wiles released a statement saying that Trump has 'nothing to do with' the project and that its demise would be 'welcomed.' But critics argue that this is just a political calculation, as the project is seen as toxic and not playing well with moderates. The Heritage Foundation's president Kevin Roberts will take over the project's operations, and some are speculating that it will simply go into hiding rather than being shut down.

**Project 2025 director quits after Trump campaign criticism**
The director of Project 2025, a hard-right policy blueprint put together by former aides of Donald Trump, has stepped down. The Heritage Foundation, which published the nearly 1,000-page document in 2023, did not provide a reason for Paul Dans' exit. Trump's campaign has welcomed the 'demise' of Project 2025, saying it would be 'greatly welcomed' and a warning to those trying to misrepresent their influence with the President and his campaign. Trump's co-campaign managers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, stated, 'Reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign -- it will not end well for you.' The project includes policy proposals such as mass deportations, upending the Justice Department and Education Department, and imposing further taxes on tips. Trump has previously described parts of the project as 'seriously extreme'.

The director of Project 2025, a conservative policymaking group, has stepped down amid criticism from Democrats. The group, which has drawn criticism for its hard-right proposals, has become a campaign liability for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump's campaign has repeatedly tried to distance itself from the group, which pushes for a major expansion of presidential power and other controversial proposals. Trump's co-campaign managers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, said they would welcome the 'demise' of Project 2025, but the group's work will continue. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, said the group's policy drafting operations would conclude after the Democratic National Convention in late August. The group's proposals include curbing the Justice Department's independence and eliminating the Department of Education.

**Project 2025 Director Resigns Amid Criticism, Trump Campaign Distances Itself**
Paul Dans, the director of the Project 2025, a radical initiative that created a manual for a second term of Donald Trump, has resigned after facing criticism from Democrats and the Republican candidate himself, who has distanced himself from the proposal. The conservative think tank, Heritage Foundation, confirmed Dans' departure in a statement to CNN. The Washington Post reported that the project plans to shut down its operations. The Project 2025 designed a roadmap to transform the US administration during the first 180 days of Trump's term if he wins the November 5 elections. Its plans include concentrating power in the president, dismantling several federal government agencies, and firing thousands of public officials to replace them with Trump loyalists who would implement an ultra-right agenda without objections. The project also proposes banning the abortion pill mifepristone, cutting environmental defense policies, reactivating the construction of the border wall with Mexico, and carrying out massive deportations of migrants, which Trump defends in his rallies. The Democratic campaign, led by President Joe Biden and now by Vice President Kamala Harris, has repeatedly used the Project 2025 as an example of the danger that Trump poses to US democracy. Trump distanced himself from the plan on July 5, saying he doesn't know its creators and calling some of its proposals 'absolutely ridiculous.' However, according to a CNN analysis, at least 140 people who worked in Trump's first government (2017-2021) now work for organizations that developed the Project 2025, including his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and advisor Stephen Miller. Trump's campaign released a statement reiterating that the Project 2025 'has nothing to do' with the Republican candidate and said that its dissolution 'would be well-received.' They also warned those who publicly lie about their influence on Trump: 'They won't end well.'

**US Secret Service Director Resigns After Pressure Over Trump Shooting**
Kimberly Cheatle, the Director of the United States Secret Service, resigned on Tuesday (23/07) after facing intense pressure from Republicans, Democrats, and security experts. The day before, she acknowledged that the agency failed to prevent an armed man from shooting at Donald Trump from a rooftop 135 meters away from the stage where the former president was speaking during a outdoor rally on July 13. Cheatle had been serving as Director of the Secret Service since August 2022 and had been facing growing demands for her resignation and questions about how the attacker was able to get so close to the presidential candidate at a campaign event. 'I assume total responsibility for the security lapse', she said in an email to the team, obtained by the Associated Press. 'Given recent events, it is with sadness that I have made the difficult decision to leave the position of Director.' On Monday (22/07), she testified before the House Oversight Committee, saying, 'The attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump on July 13 is the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades.' Despite this, she insisted she was the right person to lead the agency. The main failures pointed out include the lack of protection of the rooftop of an industrial building where the attacker was positioned, which was declared outside the Secret Service's security perimeter for the event, a decision questioned by former agents and lawmakers. Cheatle recognized that the Secret Service was informed, two to five times, about a suspicious person before the shooting. She also revealed that the rooftop where Thomas Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally. However, she was unable to answer many questions about what happened and the security plan for the rally, including why there were no agents positioned on the rooftop and how the police responded to the suspect's suspicious behavior, which had been detected days before a plan by Iran to kill Trump.

**To a defiant Biden, the 2024 race is up to the voters**
President Joe Biden has refused to step down from the 2024 election, despite growing calls from Democrats to do so. Biden's campaign has been struggling, with many Democrats expressing concerns about his age and electability. Despite this, Biden remains defiant, citing his 2020 victory and his ability to rally large crowds. However, his campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, has been texting lawmakers and encouraging them not to publicly express their concerns about the president's chances against Trump. Democratic leaders in the House and Senate are planning to meet with members to discuss options, but have not yet broken with Biden. Meanwhile, Republicans are solidly behind their candidate, Donald Trump, who is three years younger than Biden and has been gaining support despite his numerous controversies.

**Biden's Campaign Manager Calls for Withdrawal from Presidential Race**
Joe Biden's campaign manager, Rob Flaherty, sent an email to Biden's supporters stating that there are calls for Biden to withdraw from the presidential race. Flaherty said that if Biden withdraws, it will lead to weeks of chaos and internal fighting among Democratic candidates, while Donald Trump will have time to campaign without competition. The New York Times editorial board, which endorsed Biden in the 2020 general election against Trump, wrote that Biden should withdraw and that his appearance in the debate was a 'big disappointment'. Biden responded to his critics, saying that he will only run again if he believes he can do a good job. He also stated that he is in North Carolina to win the state in November and that his campaign will win the election. Biden's performance in the debate sparked doubts among his Democratic party leaders and many commentators.
