To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Timeline: The question is about Week 4 of the 2024 NFL season, which would be in late September or early October 2024. Today is October 18, 2024, so the event has already occurred.

2. Quarterback competition: The Broncos had three main contenders for the starting QB role - Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson.

3. Bo Nix's status: As a first-round draft pick (12th overall), there was significant investment and expectation for Nix to become the starter.

4. Preseason expectations: Multiple sources from May to July 2024 indicated that Nix was the favorite to win the starting job:
   - DraftKings Sportsbook gave Nix -400 odds (80.25% implied probability) to start Week 1.
   - ESPN's John Eisen predicted Nix would start all 17 games.
   - Several reports described Nix as the frontrunner or favorite.

5. Coach's statements: Sean Payton praised Nix's quick learning and readiness, saying he was "farther along than most rookies."

6. Competition performance: While there were no definitive reports on who won the QB competition, the consistent narrative favored Nix.

7. Historical precedent: First-round QBs often start early in their rookie seasons, especially when there's no established veteran starter.

8. Team investment: The Broncos traded up to draft Nix, suggesting they saw him as their immediate future.

Given this information, it seems highly likely that Bo Nix was indeed the starting quarterback for the Broncos in Week 4. The preseason expectations, coach's praise, and team investment all point strongly in this direction. While there's always a possibility of injury or unexpected performance issues, the available information doesn't suggest any such problems.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Timeline: The question is about Week 4 of the 2024 NFL season, which would be around late September or early October 2024. Today is October 18, 2024, so the event has already occurred.

2. Quarterback competition: The Broncos had three main contenders for the starting QB position - Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson.

3. Bo Nix's status: As a first-round draft pick (12th overall), there was significant investment and expectation for Nix to become the starter.

4. Pre-season expectations: Multiple reports from May to July 2024 indicated that Nix was the favorite to win the starting job.

5. Coach's statements: Sean Payton praised Nix's quick learning and maturity, saying he was "farther along than most rookies."

6. Odds: In late May 2024, Nix had -425 odds (implying an 80.25% chance) of being the Week 1 starter.

7. Performance: While we don't have specific information about Nix's performance in training camp or early season games, the absence of contrary reports suggests he likely met expectations.

8. Consistency: NFL teams typically prefer consistency at the quarterback position, especially with a promising rookie. If Nix started Week 1, it's highly likely he would still be the starter in Week 4 unless he performed extremely poorly or got injured.

9. Lack of contrary information: There are no reports in the provided articles about Nix losing the starting job or being benched after the season started.

Given this analysis, it seems highly likely that Bo Nix was indeed the starting quarterback for the Broncos in their Week 4 game against the Jets. The pre-season expectations, coach's praise, and lack of contrary information all point to this conclusion.

However, we must account for the possibility of unforeseen circumstances such as injuries or unexpectedly poor performance that could have led to a change.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and consider the available evidence:

1. Timeline:
- Today is October 18, 2024
- Week 4 of the NFL season would typically be in late September/early October
- The question is asking about a past event

2. Quarterback competition:
- Bo Nix was drafted 12th overall by the Broncos in the 2024 draft
- Other QBs in contention: Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson
- Sean Payton is the head coach making the decision

3. Evidence supporting Bo Nix starting:
- Multiple reports from May-July 2024 predicted Nix would be the Week 1 starter
- Nix was praised for his maturity and quick learning of the playbook
- As a high first-round pick, there's pressure to play Nix early
- Odds in May 2024 heavily favored Nix starting Week 1 (-425, implying 80.25% chance)

4. Evidence against Bo Nix starting:
- Jarrett Stidham had experience in Payton's system
- Some reports suggested Stidham might start early in the season
- Payton expressed no rush to name a starter and wanted competition

5. Key considerations:
- The question is about Week 4, not Week 1
- If Nix started Week 1, he would likely still be starting in Week 4 barring injury or extremely poor performance
- If another QB started Week 1, there could have been a change by Week 4

Given the timeline, this question is asking about an event that has already occurred. However, as an AI, I don't have access to real-time sports information beyond my training data. Based on the information available up to July 2024, it seemed highly likely that Bo Nix would be the starter, not just for Week 1 but continuing into Week 4.

The strongest evidence supporting Nix as the starter comes from the multiple reports predicting him as the Week 1 starter, the betting odds heavily favoring him, and the praise he received from coaches during the offseason. As a high first-round pick, there would be significant pressure to play him early.

The main counterarguments were the possibility of Stidham starting early in the season due to his experience, or Payton deciding to be cautious with Nix's development. However, these seem less likely given the consistent reports favoring Nix.

Balancing these factors, and considering that Week 4 is even further into the season than Week 1, I would estimate a high probability of Nix being the starter for Week 4.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to analyze the available information and consider several key factors:

1. Current quarterback situation: The Broncos have three quarterbacks competing for the starting job - Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson.

2. Bo Nix's draft status: Nix was selected 12th overall in the 2024 NFL Draft, suggesting the Broncos view him as their quarterback of the future.

3. Coach's statements: Sean Payton has praised Nix's quick learning and maturity, noting he's "farther along than most rookies would be."

4. Betting odds: As of May 24, 2024, Nix was the favorite to start Week 1 with odds of -425 (implying an 80.25% chance).

5. Competition performance: Reports from OTAs and training camp suggest Nix has been performing well and taking first-team reps.

6. Time frame: The question asks about Week 4, giving Nix additional time to prepare and potentially win the starting job if he doesn't start Week 1.

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. Nix's high draft status suggests the team wants him to start sooner rather than later.
2. Payton's positive comments indicate Nix is adapting well to the NFL.
3. Betting odds strongly favor Nix to start Week 1, and this likelihood would likely increase by Week 4 if he performs well.
4. Nix has more college experience than typical rookies, potentially easing his transition.

Arguments for a lower probability:
1. The NFL is challenging for rookies, and Payton might prefer a more experienced QB initially.
2. Jarrett Stidham has experience in Payton's system and could start if Nix isn't fully ready.
3. Unexpected poor performance or injuries during preseason or early games could impact Nix's status.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a high likelihood that Nix will be the starter by Week 4. The team's investment in him, positive reports, and betting odds all point in this direction. Even if he doesn't start Week 1, four weeks is enough time for him to potentially win the job if he performs well in practice and any game opportunities.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on the specific situation and recent information:

1. Base rate: NFL teams typically prefer to start their first-round draft pick quarterbacks early in the season, especially by Week 4. Historical data suggests this happens in roughly 60-70% of cases.

2. Specific situation:
- Bo Nix was drafted 12th overall, indicating the Broncos see him as their future starter.
- Multiple reports from May to July 2024 suggest Nix is the favorite to start Week 1.
- Sean Payton praised Nix's quick learning and readiness in May 2024.
- Odds in May 2024 heavily favored Nix to start Week 1 (-425, implying 80.25% probability).

3. Competition:
- Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson are the other options, both with limited success as NFL starters.
- Reports consistently place Nix ahead of both in the competition.

4. Timeline:
- The question is about Week 4, giving Nix additional time to secure the starting role if he doesn't start Week 1.

5. Potential counterarguments:
- Payton might prefer a veteran early in the season.
- Nix could struggle in preseason or early games, leading to a change.

6. Recent trends:
- The most recent reports (July 2024) still favor Nix as the likely starter.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability of Nix starting Week 4 is higher than the base rate due to consistent reporting of his favoritism, his draft status, and positive coach comments. The additional time between Week 1 and Week 4 further increases the likelihood.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 89.90%, with 83.20% being the most likely. Probability: 83.20%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on the specific situation and recent information:

1. Base rate: NFL teams typically prefer to start their first-round draft pick quarterbacks early in the season, especially by Week 4. Historical data suggests this happens in roughly 60-70% of cases.

2. Specific situation:
- Bo Nix was drafted 12th overall, indicating the Broncos see him as their future starter.
- Multiple reports from May to July 2024 suggest Nix is the favorite to start Week 1.
- Sean Payton praised Nix's quick learning and readiness in May 2024.
- Odds in May 2024 heavily favored Nix to start Week 1 (-425, implying 80.25% probability).

3. Competition:
- Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson are the other options, both with limited success as NFL starters.
- Reports consistently place Nix ahead of both in the competition.

4. Timeline:
- The question is about Week 4, giving Nix additional time to secure the starting role if he doesn't start Week 1.

5. Potential counterarguments:
- Payton might prefer a veteran early in the season.
- Nix could struggle in preseason or early games, leading to a change.

6. Recent trends:
- The most recent reports (July 2024) still favor Nix as the likely starter.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability of Nix starting Week 4 is higher than the base rate due to consistent reporting of his favoritism, his draft status, and positive coach comments. The additional time between Week 1 and Week 4 further increases the likelihood.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 89.90%, with 83.20% being the most likely. Probability: 83.20%.
