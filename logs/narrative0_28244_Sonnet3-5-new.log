Tetlock: "So, Nate, about that Michael Foods recall from June - the one with the undeclared milk allergen in their liquid egg products. Did it get closed before October?"

Silver: [checking his tablet] "No, and our models had it at 32.5%. The timeline was the key factor here. Most allergen-related recalls take 4-6 months to close, especially when they involve institutional products like these Fair Meadow Foundations items."

Tetlock: "Right. The relatively small volume - just 4,620 pounds - initially made me think it might resolve faster, but institutional products require more thorough tracking and verification. Plus, dairy allergen cases typically need extensive documentation of corrective actions."

Silver: "Exactly. Without any news of successful product recovery or corrective action verification by mid-September, our models correctly indicated it would likely remain active past October."

Nate: "So, Phil, about that Michael Foods recall from June - the one with the undeclared milk allergen in their liquid egg products. Did it get closed before October?"

Philip: [checking his tablet] "No, our models had it at 32.45%. Given the company's history and FSIS data, we knew this would likely take longer. Allergen-related recalls, especially with institutional products like these, typically have longer resolution times."

Nate: "Makes sense. The relatively small volume - just 4,620 pounds - initially made me think it might resolve quickly, but institutional products require more thorough tracking."

Philip: "Exactly. Plus, with no reported adverse reactions and it being a Class II recall, there was less urgency compared to health-critical recalls. The models factored in similar historical cases from food service suppliers."

[Both sip their coffee thoughtfully]

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Phil, the USDA just updated their database on that Michael Foods egg recall from June.

Philip Tetlock: The allergen misbranding case? Our models were quite clear on this one.

Nate: Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. Simple recall cases involving labeling issues typically get resolved within 90 days, especially when it's a straightforward allergen declaration problem.

Philip: [nodding] The relatively small quantity - just 4,620 pounds - and the fact it was purely a labeling issue rather than contamination made this an easier call. Michael Foods has a good track record of swift corrective actions too.

Nate: The data showed similar recalls from major producers like Michael Foods were typically closed within three months. The only wild card was potential supply chain delays in relabeling, but even that wasn't enough to significantly impact our probability assessment.

Philip: [checking computer] "No, our models had it at 32.45%. Given the company's history and FSIS data, we predicted this would likely remain active longer. Allergen-related recalls, especially with major institutional products like these, typically take 4-6 months for full resolution."

Nate: "Makes sense. The scale was relatively small at 4,620 pounds, but institutional products require thorough supply chain verification. Plus, summer recalls often face longer processing times due to staffing patterns."

Philip: "Exactly. The lack of reported adverse reactions helped, but verification protocols for allergen cases are particularly stringent. The timeline just wasn't sufficient."

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Phil, looks like that Michael Foods egg recall from June is still active.

Philip Tetlock: No surprise there. Our models had it at 22.45%. Food recalls, especially those involving allergens, typically take 3-6 months to close.

Nate: Exactly. The lack of public updates since the initial June announcement was telling. Plus, with dairy allergens being a serious concern, the FSIS tends to be extra thorough with their follow-up inspections.

Philip: The relatively small volume - just 4,620 pounds - actually worked against quick closure. These smaller recalls often get lower priority compared to larger-scale contamination issues.

Nate: [nodding] And historically, labeling issues involving allergens have longer verification periods to ensure proper corrective actions are implemented.

Philip: Our models really nailed this one. Another data point for the predictive power of systematic forecasting.
