INT. FORECASTING HUB - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of their laptops. The atmosphere is tense, yet analytical.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
"So, the HHS didn't declare a public health emergency for mpox. Our models had it at 12.75%."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Given the Clade I outbreak in the Congo, we factored in potential spillover, but the containment measures held."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(scrolling through news)  
"Yeah, the Africa CDC's near-declaration was a wildcard. But we didn't see the same escalation here."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
"The August data was crucial. No drastic uptick in US cases post-August 15."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(typing)  
"Our accuracy holds. Low probability, but not zero. Prepared for anything."

They exchange satisfied nods, their confidence in the models reaffirmed.

FADE OUT.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back in chair)  
Well, we called it. Our models had it at 95.32%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
The Clade I outbreak in Congo was a clear signal. The severity and spread were unprecedented.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(flipping through notes)  
Exactly. And with the Africa CDC on the brink of a continent-wide emergency, it was only a matter of time before HHS took action.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(smiling)  
The August 15 data was pivotal. Once we saw those numbers, the probability shot up.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(serious)  
It's a reminder of how interconnected our world is. A health crisis anywhere can become a crisis everywhere.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(closing laptop)  
And our job is to see it coming. Another successful prediction in the books.

**SUPERFORECASTER A:** So, the Secretary of HHS didn't declare a public health emergency for mpox before October 1. 

**SUPERFORECASTER B:** Right. Our models had it at 15.75%. With Clade I's outbreak in the Congo, it seemed possible. But the containment measures held strong.

**SUPERFORECASTER A:** It's interesting. The Africa CDC was on the brink of declaring a continent-wide emergency back in August.

**SUPERFORECASTER B:** True. But the U.S. response was proactive, and the risk never escalated domestically.

**SUPERFORECASTER A:** Just goes to show, even with severe strains, global coordination can avert crises.

*They nod in agreement, the weight of their accuracy evident.*

**SUPERFORECASTER B:** Another win for the models. Let's keep it up.

As of now, the HHS has not declared a public health emergency for mpox. Our models had it at 15.75%.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The Clade I outbreak in Congo was significant, but the containment efforts seemed effective. 

FORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to the board)  
The Africa CDC's potential emergency declaration was a key factor. But domestically, the transmission didn't escalate enough.

FORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
It's a relief, but it underscores the importance of vigilance. The models accurately reflected the containment measures' success.

FORECASTER 2
