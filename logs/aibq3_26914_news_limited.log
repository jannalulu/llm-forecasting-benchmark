**Never before have Americans hated our choices of president as much**
According to Gallup polls, President Trump's job approval rating has never reached 50% during his presidency, making him the only president to not achieve this milestone since 1938. Additionally, Trump is the only president who did not have a honeymoon period of above-average ratings upon taking office. The article also compares Trump's and President Biden's net favorability ratings, noting that both candidates have underwater ratings, with Trump's strongly unfavorable views being slightly higher than Biden's. The article concludes that the 2024 election will likely be decided by who hates the other candidate more, rather than a competent candidate winning.
