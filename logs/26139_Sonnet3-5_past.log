To answer this question, I'll need to consider several factors:

1. Historical performance: Kalenjin athletes have dominated marathon running for decades. They've won numerous Olympic marathons in both men's and women's categories.

2. Recent trends: While Kalenjin runners still perform well, there's increasing competition from other nations and ethnic groups.

3. Specific athletes: We need to look at the top Kalenjin marathon runners likely to compete in Paris 2024.

4. Competition: We should consider strong non-Kalenjin runners who might challenge for gold.

5. Probability of winning both races: This requires estimating the chance of winning each race separately, then multiplying those probabilities.

Let's break it down:

Men's Marathon:
Eliud Kipchoge, a Kalenjin, won gold in 2016 and 2020. He's considered one of the greatest marathoners ever. However, he'll be 39 in 2024, which is quite old for a marathoner. Still, he's likely to be a top contender if he competes.

Other strong Kalenjin runners like Geoffrey Kamworor could also be in the mix. However, there are strong non-Kalenjin runners like Kenenisa Bekele (Ethiopia) who could challenge for gold.

I'd estimate the chance of a Kalenjin man winning at about 60-70%.

Women's Marathon:
Peres Jepchirchir, a Kalenjin, won gold in 2020. Other strong Kalenjin runners like Brigid Kosgei could also compete. However, there's strong competition from runners like Tigist Assefa of Ethiopia, who has run the fastest women's marathon time.

I'd estimate the chance of a Kalenjin woman winning at about 50-60%.

To win both races, we need to multiply these probabilities:
Low end: 60% * 50% = 30%
High end: 70% * 60% = 42%

Adjusting for other factors:
- The Kalenjin have a long history of success in marathon running, which could give them an edge.
- However, other nations are increasingly challenging Kenyan dominance.
- There's always a chance of injury or unexpected performance issues.

Considering all these factors, I'd adjust my estimate slightly downward.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 40.00%, with 32.50% being the most likely. Probability: 32.50%.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into sub-problems and analyze the available information:

1. Historical performance of Kalenjin athletes in Olympic marathons:
Kalenjin athletes have dominated long-distance running, including marathons, for decades. They've won numerous Olympic medals in these events. This gives a strong baseline probability for success.

2. Current top marathon runners:
The news articles don't provide specific information about the top Kalenjin marathon runners for Paris 2024. However, Eliud Kipchoge, a Kalenjin, is mentioned as part of the Kenyan team. He's won the last two Olympic marathons and is considered one of the greatest marathoners of all time.

3. Competition from non-Kalenjin athletes:
The articles mention several non-Kalenjin athletes who could be strong contenders, including Sifan Hassan from the Netherlands, who is attempting an ambitious quadruple (1500m, 5000m, 10000m, and marathon).

4. Separate probabilities for men's and women's races:
We need to consider the chances for both races separately, as winning both is required for a "Yes" resolution.

5. Recent performances:
There's no recent race information provided for top Kalenjin marathoners, which adds uncertainty to the forecast.

6. Team selection:
Kenya has announced its Olympic team, which likely includes several Kalenjin athletes, but specific names for the marathon aren't provided.

Analysis:
- The historical dominance of Kalenjin athletes in marathons provides a strong base rate for success.
- Eliud Kipchoge's presence increases the probability for a Kalenjin win in the men's race.
- The lack of specific information about top Kalenjin female marathoners adds uncertainty to the women's race prediction.
- The requirement to win both races reduces the overall probability, as it's a conjunction of two events.
- The presence of strong non-Kalenjin competitors like Sifan Hassan could reduce the chances of a Kalenjin sweep.

Balancing these factors, I would estimate a relatively high probability for a Kalenjin win in the men's race (perhaps around 70-80%), but a lower probability for the women's race (perhaps 50-60%). The probability of both occurring is the product of these probabilities.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 48.00%, with 41.50% being the most likely. Probability: 41.50%.

To answer this question, I'll need to consider several key factors:

1. Historical performance: Kalenjin athletes have dominated marathon running for decades. They've won numerous Olympic marathons in both men's and women's categories.

2. Current top athletes: We need to identify the top Kalenjin marathon runners who are likely to compete in Paris 2024.

3. Recent performances: Looking at major marathons and world championships in the lead-up to the Olympics.

4. Competition: Assessing the strength of non-Kalenjin athletes who might challenge for gold.

5. Olympic qualification: Ensuring top Kalenjin athletes have qualified for the Games.

Let's break this down:

1. Historical performance:
Kalenjin athletes have won many Olympic marathons, but not all. For example, in Tokyo 2020, Peres Jepchirchir (Kalenjin) won the women's race, but Eliud Kipchoge (Kalenjin) won the men's. This shows dominance but not guaranteed sweeps.

2. Current top athletes:
Men: Eliud Kipchoge, Kelvin Kiptum, Titus Ekiru
Women: Peres Jepchirchir, Brigid Kosgei, Ruth Chepngetich

All of these athletes are Kalenjin and among the world's best marathoners.

3. Recent performances:
The provided news doesn't give much recent marathon data. However, we know Eliud Kipchoge is still performing at a high level, aiming for his third consecutive Olympic gold. Peres Jepchirchir is mentioned as a favorite for the women's race.

4. Competition:
The main competition likely comes from Ethiopian athletes. Tigst Assefa is mentioned as Jepchirchir's closest rival. For the men, there's no specific mention of top non-Kalenjin contenders.

5. Olympic qualification:
The news doesn't provide specific information about which Kalenjin athletes have qualified for Paris 2024. However, given their dominance, it's likely that multiple Kalenjin runners will represent Kenya in both races.

Factors favoring a Kalenjin sweep:
- Historical dominance in marathon running
- Current world rankings dominated by Kalenjin athletes
- Eliud Kipchoge aiming for third consecutive gold
- Peres Jepchirchir mentioned as a favorite

Factors against a Kalenjin sweep:
- Strong competition, especially from Ethiopian runners
- Marathons can be unpredictable due to weather, course, and race-day factors
- Lack of specific information about which athletes have qualified
- No guarantee that the very top Kalenjin runners will be selected for the Olympics

Balancing these factors, I believe a Kalenjin sweep is more likely than not, but far from certain. The men's race seems more likely for a Kalenjin win given Kipchoge's dominance. The women's race appears more competitive with strong Ethiopian challengers.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 70.00%, with 62.50% being the most likely. Probability: 62.50%.

3. Qualifying athletes for Paris 2024:
The articles don't mention specific Kalenjin athletes who have qualified for the marathon events. This is another important information gap.

4. Competition from other countries:
The articles mention strong athletes from other countries, like Sifan Hassan from the Netherlands, who is attempting an ambitious four-event schedule including the marathon. This suggests tough competition.

5. Separate probabilities for men's and women's races:
We need to consider the chances of Kalenjin athletes winning both races, not just one.

6. Recent trends in marathon running:
Without specific information on recent marathon results, it's hard to gauge if Kalenjin dominance has increased or decreased lately.

7. Potential for upsets:
Marathon races can be unpredictable, with factors like weather and course conditions playing a role.

Balancing these factors:

- The historical dominance of Kalenjin runners provides a strong base rate in their favor.
- The lack of specific information about qualified Kalenjin marathoners for Paris 2024 introduces significant uncertainty.
- The mention of strong competitors like Sifan Hassan suggests the competition will be fierce.
- The need for Kalenjin athletes to win both men's and women's races reduces the overall probability compared to winning just one race.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to consider several factors:

1. Historical performance of Kalenjin athletes in Olympic marathons
2. Current top Kalenjin marathon runners and their recent performances
3. Potential competitors from other countries/ethnicities
4. Any recent trends or changes in marathon running

Let's break this down:

1. Historical performance:
Kalenjin athletes have dominated marathon running for decades. They've won numerous Olympic marathons, especially on the men's side. However, winning both men's and women's in the same Olympics is a more challenging feat.

2. Current top Kalenjin runners:
For men, Eliud Kipchoge (Kalenjin) is still the top marathoner, having won gold in 2016 and 2021. He's likely to compete in Paris.
For women, Peres Jepchirchir (Kalenjin) won gold in Tokyo 2021 and is a strong contender for Paris.

3. Potential competitors:
Men: Bashir Abdi (Belgium), Kenenisa Bekele (Ethiopia)
Women: Brigid Kosgei (Kenyan, but not Kalenjin), Gotytom Gebreslase (Ethiopia)

4. Recent trends:
The article mentions a potential duel between Peres Jepchirchir and Tigst Assefa (Ethiopian) in the women's marathon, suggesting strong competition.

Analyzing the evidence:

For men, Eliud Kipchoge's dominance makes a Kalenjin win highly likely, perhaps around 70-80% chance.

For women, while Jepchirchir is strong, the competition seems fiercer. The chance of a Kalenjin win might be around 50-60%.

The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Taking the middle values:

75% * 55% = 41.25%

However, this is likely an overestimate as it doesn't account for the difficulty of achieving both wins in the same Olympics.

Considering the historical dominance of Kalenjin runners, but also the increased global competition and the specific challenge of winning both races, I would adjust this estimate downward slightly.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 45.00%, with 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.

To answer this question, I'll need to consider several factors:

1. Historical performance of Kalenjin athletes in Olympic marathons
2. Current top Kalenjin marathon runners and their recent performances
3. Potential competitors from other countries/ethnicities
4. Any recent trends or changes in marathon running

Let's break this down:

1. Historical performance:
Kalenjin athletes have dominated marathon running for decades. They've won numerous Olympic marathons, especially on the men's side. However, winning both men's and women's in the same Olympics is a more challenging feat.

2. Current top Kalenjin runners:
For men, Eliud Kipchoge (Kalenjin) is still the top marathoner, having won gold in 2016 and 2021. He's likely to compete in Paris.
For women, Peres Jepchirchir (Kalenjin) won gold in Tokyo 2021 and is a strong contender for Paris.

3. Potential competitors:
Men: Bashir Abdi (Belgium), Kenenisa Bekele (Ethiopia)
Women: Brigid Kosgei (Kenyan, but not Kalenjin), Gotytom Gebreslase (Ethiopia)

4. Recent trends:
The article mentions a potential duel between Peres Jepchirchir and Tigst Assefa (Ethiopian) in the women's marathon, suggesting strong competition.

Analyzing the evidence:

For men, Eliud Kipchoge's dominance makes a Kalenjin win highly likely, perhaps around 70-80% chance.

For women, while Jepchirchir is strong, the competition seems fiercer. The chance of a Kalenjin win might be around 50-60%.

The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Taking the middle values:

75% * 55% = 41.25%

However, this is likely an overestimate as it doesn't account for the difficulty of achieving both wins in the same Olympics.

Considering the historical dominance of Kalenjin runners, but also the increased global competition and the specific challenge of winning both races, I would adjust this estimate downward slightly.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 45.00%, with 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.
