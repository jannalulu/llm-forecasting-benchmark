**Bill Emmott: Japan, US roles in SE Asia to grow amid China's power imbalance**
The Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional defense summit, saw notable moments, including aggressive words about Taiwan from China's defense minister and protests about civilian deaths in Gaza. President Bongbong Marcos of the Philippines stated that if a Filipino serviceman were killed by a Chinese water cannon, it would be considered an act of war, which could invoke the 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines. This raises concerns about the potential for war between the US and China over the South China Sea. China has a long-standing claim to the area, and its recent decree authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain foreign nationals who flout marine demarcations has led to a collision between a Chinese and a Philippine ship. The article argues that the huge power imbalance between China and the South-East Asian nations, which is reflected in their military spending, will take time to redress, and in the meantime, the US and Japan will play a crucial role in the region.

**US Commander Threatens to Turn Taiwan Strait into 'Hell of Drones' if China Attacks**
The new commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Paparo, has threatened to turn the Taiwan Strait into a 'hell of drones' if China attacks the island. If China's President Xi Jinping invades Taiwan, Beijing will face a large and lethal force of drones that will crush its army. The strategy, called 'Hellscape', is designed to distract China and give the US time to respond. Paparo wants to make the Taiwan Strait a 'hell' using classified capabilities, which would make China's life miserable for a month, giving the US time to deploy a broader military response. This plan involves launching thousands of unmanned systems from surface ships and submarines to aerial drones to fight against Chinese forces in the event of an invasion. The US is preparing for the worst-case scenario, with the Pentagon planning to spend $1 billion this year on the Replicator program, which aims to implement thousands of autonomous systems. If this strategy is not ready in the short term, the prospects of a long conflict would increase, and could involve Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, according to US think tanks. China's most likely strategy is to launch a massive surprise attack on Taiwan, said Paparo, who assumes that President Xi does not want to repeat the mistake of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine in 2022, when the initial large-scale invasion of Russia failed and became a long and costly war.

**US Prepares for War with China Amid Taiwan Provocation**
The US is preparing for war with China amid Washington's provocation over Taiwan. The US Navy and Philippine Marines have been conducting war games on small islands near Taiwan, according to a British newspaper, citing reports from Wall Street Journal correspondents embedded with a US military regiment. The exercises include the deployment of naval infantry teams by Chinook helicopters, preparing disarmed assault weapons, and monitoring terrain that would be hypothetically used if conflict broke out. The developments are a disturbing view from the perspective of US military leaders, as any direct conflict between the US and China could easily escalate into a Third World War with both nations possessing nuclear weapons that could destroy the planet. The US has historically been ambiguous about its stance on intervening in Taiwan, but President Joe Biden broke with tradition by stating he would be willing to send US troops. The US military is restructuring to prepare for a large-scale war in the Pacific after decades of combat against irregular forces in the Middle East, according to the WSJ. 'We're moving away from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency,' said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, referring to the roles that have been in high demand in US wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. 'We want to be positioned for large-scale combat operations.' Military personalities in the US predict that the country will need to confront China militarily in the coming years to contain its economic growth. 'The Rand Corporation warned about ten years ago that they needed to go to war with China by 2025 to prevail,' observed analyst K.J. Noh.

**US Prepares for War with China over Taiwan**
The United States is preparing for war with China over Taiwan. US Marines and the Philippines held military exercises on small islands near Taiwan, simulating a hypothetical conflict scenario. The exercises included landing from helicopters, storming, and reconnaissance, according to the Wall Street Journal. The US Marines' goal would be to slow down a potential Chinese invasion, giving other US military forces time to prepare and respond. The deployment of a small, hidden group of Marines on the front line would serve as a tactical foundation in case of war, said Benjamin Jensen, a senior research fellow at the Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies. The exercises were conducted by the 3rd Amphibious Assault Battalion, which was formed only two years ago to reform the US military presence in the region and has already trained on the Hawaiian Islands and in California. Last year, US forces gained access to several Filipino military bases, and the exercises took place north of them, on a series of islands about an hour's drive from Taiwan, according to the publication. On Friday, May 24, 46 Chinese military aircraft crossed the middle line of the Taiwan Strait, which had previously served as an unofficial barrier between the two sides, reported the Ministry of Defense of Taiwan. In addition, Su-30 fighter jets and H-6 nuclear bombers flew over the region and over the Bashi Strait, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines. China has been conducting regular military exercises around Taiwan for the past four years.

**Singapore, Vietnam call for peace in Taiwan Strait**
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong and Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs have called for regional peace and stability as China conducts large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. The exercises, titled 'Joint Sword-2024A', were announced on May 23 and involve land, sea, air, and missile forces. The conflict in the Taiwan Strait has the potential to have dire consequences for each country involved and the world at large. Gan called for dialogue between China and the US to resolve the issue, and welcomed visits from the Japanese Self-Defense Force to promote regional peace and security.

**Japan and Philippines Sign Defense Pact Amid Rising Tensions with China**
Japan and the Philippines signed a defense pact on Monday, allowing for the deployment of Japanese forces for joint military exercises, including live-fire drills, in the Southeast Asian country. The agreement, known as the Reciprocal Access Agreement, was signed by Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa in a ceremony in Manila attended by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The pact will take effect after ratification by the legislatures of both countries, according to Japanese and Philippine officials. Kamikawa described the signing of the defense agreement as 'a historic achievement' that should consolidate defense cooperation between Tokyo and Manila. 'A free and open international order based on the rule of law is the foundation of regional peace and prosperity,' she said. 'We would like to work closely with your country to maintain and strengthen it.' The defense pact with the Philippines is Japan's first in Asia. Tokyo has signed similar agreements with Australia in 2022 and the UK in 2023. Japan has been strengthening its security and military capabilities under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, including a counterattack capability that breaks with Japan's traditional focus on self-defense, in response to North Korean threats and China's growing assertiveness. The country is increasing its defense spending by 2% annually for five years until 2027, aiming to become the third-largest military spender in the world, behind the US and China. Many of Japan's Asian neighbors, including the Philippines, were victims of Japanese aggression until Japan was defeated in World War II, and Tokyo's efforts to strengthen its military role and budget could be a sensitive issue. However, Japan and the Philippines have been increasing their defense and security ties. The initiative by Kishida advances in parallel with Marcos' efforts to sign security alliances that support the limited capacity of the Philippine government to defend its territorial interests in the South China Sea. The disputed waters are a key route for global trade, and China has claimed almost the entire area, although the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan also claim some zones. The US has been strengthening a series of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better face China, including any possible confrontation over Taiwan, and to reassure its Asian allies. Japan and the Philippines are treaty allies of the US, and their leaders held trilateral talks in April at the White House, where President Biden reiterated the 'ironclad' commitment of Washington to defend Japan and the Philippines.

**Philippines and Japan Sign Defense Pact Amid Tensions with China**
The governments of the Philippines and Japan signed a military cooperation agreement, allowing the deployment of their troops in each other's countries, amid growing tensions with China in the Indo-Pacific. The pact, signed during the visit of Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa to Manila, enables both countries to deploy troops for exercises and training. This will facilitate Japan's participation in the annual Balikatan military exercises, where it has previously participated as an observer alongside Philippine and US troops. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. emphasized the 'hard work' of both countries in achieving this defense pact and praised the 'confidence and importance' it brings to both governments. The agreement aims to 'maintain and strengthen the international order based on the rule of law'. The two countries, historical allies of the US, have been strengthening their defense ties in recent months in response to China's growing assertiveness. The disputed South China Sea is a key area of contention, with the Philippines, China, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan all having claims to the region. Tensions between China and the Philippines have increased since Marcos Jr. took office in 2022, with the Philippines strengthening its military alliance with the US and expanding access to its bases for US troops, including some with strategic access to the South China Sea or Taiwan.

**Japan and the Philippines Sign Defense Agreement to Counter China's Growing Military Power**
Japan and the Philippines signed a defense agreement to focus on China's growing military power in the region. The agreement allows for the deployment of troops on each other's soil, amid shared concerns about China's military expansion. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kishida and Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro signed the agreement on Monday during a ceremony in Manila. The agreement enables Japanese troops to deploy in the Philippines for joint military exercises, and Philippine troops to conduct combat training in Japan. The agreement requires ratification by the legislative bodies of both countries to take effect. The agreement comes as Japan and the Philippines, both US allies, express concern over China's growing influence in the region. China claims more than 90% of the South China Sea, including waters within the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines and four other Southeast Asian countries. In 2016, an international court in The Hague ruled that China's claims had no legal basis. The Chinese and Philippine coast guards and navies have been involved in several confrontations in disputed waters, including a recent incident where Chinese coast guards used knives and harpoons and rammed two Philippine Navy supply ships. Japan has a long-standing territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands, located between Taiwan and Okinawa. Under Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Tokyo has sought to strengthen its military power, including through reciprocal access agreements with Australia and the UK. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. strongly condemned China's actions in the South China Sea and warned that his country would consider any Filipino killed by China as a 'war crime'. Manila has long-standing defense agreements with Australia and the US, and is exploring a similar agreement with France. In April, leaders of the US, Japan, and the Philippines held their first trilateral summit in Washington, as part of efforts to strengthen military cooperation between the three countries. The summit followed joint military exercises in the South China Sea, which also involved Australia.

**258th Day of the 'Iron Swords' War: A Summary of the Conflict**
The 258th day of the 'Iron Swords' war between Israel and terrorist organizations in Gaza, Judea, and Samaria, as well as in Lebanon, began on October 7, 2023. The war started with a terrorist attack on a music festival near the Gaza border, killing hundreds and taking many hostages. The terrorist organization Hamas announced the start of the war, calling it 'The Flood of Al-Aksa'. In response, the Israeli government declared a state of war and launched Operation 'Iron Swords'. Since the start of the war, over 1,500 people have been killed, including citizens of Israel, the US, Canada, the UK, France, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Brazil, China, India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines, Nepal, South Africa, Sudan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. The Israeli military has suffered significant losses, with over 310 soldiers killed and around 14,000 terrorists and their commanders eliminated. The war has also caused significant damage to infrastructure in Gaza, with over 10,000 rockets fired at Israeli cities and towns. The Israeli military has responded with airstrikes on targets in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, and has also launched a naval operation to intercept ships carrying weapons to Gaza. The war has displaced over 1.7 million people in Gaza, with many forced to flee their homes and live in shelters. The United Nations has reported that over 40% of the dead in Gaza are men of fighting age, 20% are women, and 32% are children. The war has also caused significant economic and humanitarian crises in Gaza, with many people struggling to access basic necessities such as food and medicine.

**War with China neither imminent nor unavoidable: US Defence secy Austin**
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin stated that war with China is neither imminent nor unavoidable, despite escalating tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. Austin emphasized the importance of dialogue between him and his Chinese counterpart to avoid miscalculations and misunderstandings. He met with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La defence forum in Singapore, the first in-person meeting since 2022. The two sides did not budge from their longstanding positions on Taiwan and the South China Sea, but Austin stressed that as long as they are talking, they can identify and address issues that could lead to conflict. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr warned that if a Filipino were killed in a confrontation with China, it would be close to an act of war and the Philippines would respond accordingly. Austin reaffirmed the US commitment to the Philippines and emphasized the importance of dialogue with China, but did not specify how the US would react if a Filipino were killed.

**'Preparing for Potential Conflict: How a Crucial Weapon Could Impact Future US-China Relations Amid Taiwan Tensions'**
The US military is preparing for a potential conflict with China over Taiwan, conducting war games in the Philippines to test its capabilities. The exercises involve deploying marines from Chinook helicopters, readying unarmed assault rifles, and scouting out terrain that would be used in the event of a conflict. The US military is focusing on stealth and agility, using small drones and sensors to provide a front-row view to the rest of the military and being able to fire at China's military with a barrage of rockets. The goal is to slow down a potential Chinese invasion and allow other US military forces to prepare. The war games are a sign that US military leaders may see a conflict as a possibility, and the US is preparing for a potential world war.

**As Taiwan war spectre looms amid drills, Philippine province looks to game plan**
The province of Batanes in the Philippines, located near Taiwan, has a contingency plan in place to prepare for any conflict in the Taiwan Strait amid ongoing military drills by mainland China. The plan includes setting up a 'tent city' to accommodate thousands of refugees. Officials say the situation remains normal, but there is a possibility of a population influx from Taiwan. The Philippines has a Mutual Defence Treaty with the US, which could be invoked in the event of conflict. Military analysts say the probability of full-blown conflict remains low, but the Philippines is vulnerable to being drawn into the conflict. The US has deployed new weapon systems, including the Mid-Range Capability, which could deter aggressors.

**Will 2024 bring a new military crisis in Taiwan Strait?**
US officials believe Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, but no final decision has been made. China has been building up its military since the 1990s, and while it may be able to overwhelm Taiwan's smaller islands, a full-scale invasion could lead to a dramatic escalation of tensions and rearmament in the region. The US has been increasing its efforts to defend Taiwan, including training Taiwanese forces and providing them with weaponry. The situation is reminiscent of the 1950s, when China shelled Taiwan's offshore islands, leading to a close call with nuclear war. Today, the US and Taiwan are on high alert, with the potential for an unplanned encounter between Chinese and Taiwanese forces in the Taiwan Strait.
