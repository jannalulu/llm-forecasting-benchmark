Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, our models were right again about the ICC warrant for Gallant."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given what we knew by July 11th, our models had it at 32.45%. The ICC's history of issuing only 42 warrants since 2005 made this a relatively rare event."

Nate: "The Putin warrant last year set a precedent for targeting high-ranking officials. But the diplomatic pressure from the G7 and U.S. was a significant counterforce."

Philip: "Exactly. Netanyahu's April plea to Biden showed their serious concerns, but international institutions often move slowly. The probability wasn't negligible, but also not high enough to be a likely outcome."

Nate: "The models balanced the ICC's historical reluctance against the unprecedented scale of the Gaza situation. Another demonstration of why precise probabilistic thinking matters."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again regarding the ICC warrant for Gallant."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the precedent with Putin's warrant and the mounting international pressure, our models had it at 82.35%. The April reports about Netanyahu seeking Biden's intervention were particularly telling."

Nate: "The combination of G7 nations actively campaigning against the warrants, plus the ICC's historical reluctance to issue warrants against officials from U.S.-allied nations, made this outcome predictable."

Philip: "Exactly. And with only 42 arrest warrants issued since 2005, the ICC's selective approach to high-profile cases was a crucial factor in our calculations."

Nate: "The timing of those April 2024 reports really shifted our probability models. The diplomatic backchannels were working overtime on this one."

Here's a 150-word script set on October 1, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the ICC warrant for Gallant."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the precedent with Putin's warrant and the mounting international pressure, our models had it at 78.35%. The signals were strong - especially after Netanyahu's desperate plea to Biden in April."

Nate: "The timing was crucial. When we saw the G7 countries actively trying to prevent the warrants, it actually increased our confidence. They wouldn't have intervened without concrete intelligence about the ICC's intentions."

Philip: "Exactly. The ICC's history of issuing only 42 warrants since 2005 made this a significant case. Once the evidence of civilian casualties in Gaza mounted and the international community's patience wore thin, it became increasingly probable."
