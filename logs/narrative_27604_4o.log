INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY AFTER OCTOBER 1, 2024

The room buzzes with quiet intensity. Four SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a large screen displaying global news updates.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, Mexico didn't confirm any Clade I mpox infections before October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The containment in neighboring countries was stronger than anticipated.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to the screen)  
The WHO's swift declaration and international response played a significant role. The spread in Eastern DRC was worrying, but it didn't jump continents as fast as feared.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing on a laptop)  
And Sweden's isolated case didn't lead to further spread. Our data up to August 26th showed a low probability for Mexico, and it held true.

They exchange relieved glances, their predictions once again aligned with reality.

The room hums with tension as the superforecasters gather around a table strewn with newspapers and laptops. It's October 2, 2024, and the air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, folks, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 12.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The WHO's PHEIC declaration in August had us on alert, especially with Clade I reaching Sweden.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at a screen)  
Yet, Mexico stayed clear. The containment efforts in Africa were surprisingly effective.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
True. But with new strains, the probabilities shift rapidly. Our models held strong, though.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(optimistic)  
Let's keep refining. The next prediction might be even closer.

They exchange determined glances, aware of their responsibility in navigating the uncertain future. The room buzzes with renewed focus.

FADE OUT.

No confirmed cases. Our models had it at 15.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**

It's fascinating. The models predicted the containment accurately, despite the initial panic.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

So, Mexico didn't confirm any Clade I mpox infections by October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Our models had it at 7.32%. Given the rapid spread in neighboring countries, it seemed plausible, but not inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

The WHO's PHEIC declaration definitely raised awareness, but Mexico's preventive measures were robust.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
And Sweden's case was a wake-up call for Europe, but the containment was effective.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

It's a reminder of how interconnected our world is. Even with low probabilities, vigilance is key.
