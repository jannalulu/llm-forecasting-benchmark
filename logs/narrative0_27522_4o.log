*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a news desk, discussing the recent controversy.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the decision to reallocate the bronze medal was not overturned.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right, Nate. Our models had it at 1.25%. Given the historical success rate of appeals against CAS rulings, this outcome was expected.

**NATE SILVER:** The Swiss Federal Tribunal rarely overturns CAS decisions. Only five successful appeals since 1984.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And with CNN reporting that CAS lacks authority to revisit the case, the odds were stacked against USA Gymnastics.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a tough break for Jordan Chiles, but the numbers didn't lie.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The probability was low, and the outcome reflects that reality.

*They nod in agreement, acknowledging the power of accurate forecasting.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the decision to reallocate the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise wasn't overturned. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 0.3%. Given the historical data on CAS appeals, it was always a long shot.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The Swiss Federal Tribunal rarely overturns CAS decisions. The statistics were clear.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** USA Gymnastics' challenge was never likely to succeed. The CAS ruling stood firm.

**NATE SILVER:** And with no higher court to appeal to, this chapter is closed for Chiles.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It’s a tough outcome for the US team, but the probabilities were never in their favor.

*They nod in agreement, the conversation underscoring the accuracy of their forecasting models.*
