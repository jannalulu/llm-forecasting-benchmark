Let me analyze this systematically:

Key factors to consider:

1. Historical Rate:
- Only 2 confirmed interstellar objects have been discovered so far: 'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)
- This suggests they are rare discoveries, occurring roughly every 2-3 years

2. Detection Capability:
+ The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is mentioned as coming online soon with enhanced detection capabilities
- However, multiple articles suggest it won't begin operations until 2025
- Current detection capabilities remain similar to when previous interstellar objects were discovered

3. Timeframe:
- The question asks about discovery before September 30, 2024
- This gives only about 2 months from today
- This is a very short window compared to historical discovery rates

4. Recent Developments:
+ There seems to be increased attention and resources devoted to detecting interstellar objects
- No mention of any currently tracked objects that might be classified as interstellar
- No indication of any imminent discoveries in the news articles

5. Supporting Factors:
+ Growing number of observatories and astronomers looking for such objects
+ Improved detection and classification methods since previous discoveries
- Short timeframe significantly reduces chances

6. Limiting Factors:
- Interstellar objects are inherently rare
- Detection requires specific conditions and positioning
- Classification process takes time to confirm interstellar nature

The extremely short timeframe (2 months) compared to the historical discovery rate (every 2-3 years) suggests a low probability. While detection capabilities have improved somewhat, the Rubin Observatory's enhanced capabilities won't be available during this period.

My Prediction: Between 3.20% and 8.40%, with 5.80% being the most likely. Probability: 5.80%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate/Outside View:
- Only two confirmed interstellar objects have been discovered so far: 'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)
- This suggests roughly one discovery every 2-3 years historically

2. Key Recent Developments:
- The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be operational next year, which will significantly increase detection capabilities
- However, it's not mentioned as being operational before September 30, 2024
- Current detection capabilities remain similar to when previous interstellar objects were discovered

3. Supporting Arguments for Higher Probability:
- Growing awareness and focus on detecting interstellar objects
- Improved coordination between observatories
- Scientists are actively developing software to detect these objects
- Multiple articles mention waiting for "the next interstellar object"

4. Supporting Arguments for Lower Probability:
- Short timeframe (only about 2 months remaining)
- No mentions of any suspected candidates currently being tracked
- The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which would greatly increase detection probability, won't be operational in time
- The most recent discovery was in 2019, suggesting we might still be 1-2 years away from the next one based on historical patterns

5. Special Considerations:
- The question specifically requires an "I" designation from the IAU Minor Planet Center
- The confirmation process can take time even after initial detection
- The remaining time window is very short (until September 30, 2024)

Given these factors, I need to weigh the historical rate (suggesting about 30-40% chance per year) against the very short remaining time window (only about 2 months), while considering that detection capabilities haven't significantly improved since the last discovery.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 12.40%, with 7.80% being the most likely. Probability: 7.80%

- Only 2 confirmed interstellar objects have been discovered so far: 'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)
- That's roughly one every 2-3 years since detection capabilities enabled their discovery

2. Key Supporting Evidence:

- Scientists expect to discover "dozens of interstellar objects within the first year of the 10-year LSST"
- Observatory will have enhanced capabilities to detect fainter interstellar objects

- This suggests it won't be fully operational during the forecast period
- Current detection capabilities remain similar to those that found previous objects

4. Timeline Analysis:

- Only about 2 months remain from current date
- This is a very short window compared to historical discovery rates

5. Additional Considerations:
- Scientists are actively working on improving detection methods
- Multiple articles discuss plans for future interstellar object missions
- However, most of these developments are focused on post-2024 timeframes

6. Weighing the Evidence:
- The very short remaining time window is the strongest limiting factor
- Historical rate suggests ~33% chance per year, but we only have 2 months
- New detection capabilities won't be fully online during this period
- But existing capabilities and increased attention to this area provide some possibility

Given these factors, the probability must be fairly low due to the short remaining time window, but not zero given existing detection capabilities and active search efforts.
