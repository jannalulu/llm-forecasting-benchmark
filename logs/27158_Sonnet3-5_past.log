To forecast whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

Base rate: Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern U.S. politics. The last one was in 1952, over 70 years ago. This suggests a very low base rate probability.

Biden's status: As of mid-August 2024, Biden has withdrawn from the race and endorsed Kamala Harris. This significantly increases the chances of a brokered convention compared to if an incumbent president was running.

Time pressure: With the convention scheduled for August 19-22, there is very little time for the party to coalesce around a single candidate. This increases the likelihood of multiple rounds of voting.

Delegate dynamics: Biden's nearly 4,000 delegates are now unbound. Without a clear frontrunner, they may split their support among multiple candidates.

Potential candidates: Several prominent Democrats are mentioned as possible nominees, including Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, and others. Multiple viable candidates increase the chances of a split delegate pool.

Party unity concerns: Democrats seem worried about choosing the right candidate to face Trump. This could lead to more debate and negotiation, potentially requiring multiple ballots.

Procedural preparations: Some reports suggest Democrats have been preparing for the possibility of an open or brokered convention, including plans for virtual voting processes.

However, there are also factors reducing the likelihood:

Party preference for unity: Historically, parties strongly prefer to avoid the appearance of division from a brokered convention. There will likely be intense pressure to unite behind a nominee quickly.

Harris's frontrunner status: As Biden's endorsed candidate and sitting VP, Harris has significant advantages that could help her secure a first-ballot majority.

Risks of a protracted process: With limited time before the general election, Democrats have strong incentives to choose a nominee quickly to begin campaigning.

Superdelegates: If no candidate wins on the first ballot, superdelegates can vote on subsequent ballots, potentially helping to break deadlocks more quickly.

Weighing these factors, I estimate there's a significant but still minority chance of a brokered convention. The withdrawal of an incumbent president so close to the convention is nearly unprecedented, creating high uncertainty. However, the party's desire for unity and the advantages of the endorsed candidate (Harris) still make a first-ballot decision more likely than not.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to carefully analyze the available information and consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern politics. The last one for Democrats was in 1952, over 70 years ago. This suggests a very low base rate.

2. Current political situation: Biden has withdrawn from the race and endorsed Kamala Harris. While this creates uncertainty, it doesn't necessarily lead to a brokered convention.

3. Party unity: Democrats have a strong incentive to avoid a divisive brokered convention that could hurt their chances in the general election.

4. Timing: The convention is scheduled for August 19-22, giving the party limited time to coalesce around a new candidate.

5. Delegate rules: Biden's delegates are now free to vote for other candidates, which could make it easier to reach a majority on the first ballot.

6. Harris's position: As Biden's endorsed successor and current VP, she has a significant advantage in securing delegate support.

7. Potential challengers: While other candidates like Gavin Newsom or Gretchen Whitmer might emerge, they would face an uphill battle in quickly organizing delegate support.

8. Party leadership: Senior Democrats seem to be preparing for the possibility of replacing Biden, which could help avoid a brokered convention through backroom negotiations.

9. Virtual voting: The DNC had planned a virtual vote in August, which could streamline the process and reduce the chances of multiple rounds of voting.

10. Trump factor: The desire to present a united front against Trump may motivate Democrats to avoid a prolonged nomination battle.

Weighing these factors, I believe a brokered convention is unlikely but not impossible. The unprecedented situation of a sitting president withdrawing so late increases uncertainty, but party mechanisms and incentives for unity work against a brokered convention.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll examine the key evidence and arguments for both higher and lower probabilities:

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. Biden's withdrawal: Multiple articles report that Biden has dropped out of the race, creating uncertainty about the nomination process.

2. Lack of clear successor: There's no automatic replacement for Biden, opening the possibility of multiple candidates vying for the nomination.

3. Historical precedent: The last brokered convention was in 1952, showing it's a rare but not impossible event.

4. Time pressure: With Biden's late withdrawal, there's limited time for a consensus candidate to emerge before the convention.

5. Multiple potential candidates: Several names are mentioned as possible replacements, including Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and Gretchen Whitmer, increasing the chances of a divided field.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. Party desire for unity: Democrats are likely to want to avoid a divisive brokered convention that could hurt their chances in the general election.

2. Biden's endorsement of Harris: Biden has endorsed Harris as his replacement, which could lead to party consolidation around her.

3. DNC rules: The Democratic National Committee has emphasized that Biden is the only eligible candidate for nomination, suggesting resistance to opening up the process.

4. Risk aversion: Party leaders may work behind the scenes to avoid a brokered convention due to its unpredictability and potential negative media coverage.

5. Virtual voting: Some articles mention the possibility of a virtual roll call vote before the convention, which could reduce the chances of a brokered convention.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance of a brokered convention, but it's not the most likely outcome. The party's desire for unity and the risks associated with a brokered convention will likely push leaders to try to coalesce around a single candidate, probably Harris. However, the late timing of Biden's withdrawal and the presence of multiple potential candidates create real uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

Base rate: Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern politics. The last Democratic brokered convention was in 1952, over 70 years ago. This suggests a very low base rate probability.

Biden's status: As of today (August 14, 2024), Joe Biden remains the presumptive Democratic nominee. He has not dropped out of the race, despite some speculation earlier in the year about his debate performance and age. The party leadership continues to support him publicly.

Delegate math: Biden won the vast majority of delegates during the primary season. For a brokered convention to occur, these delegates would need to abandon Biden en masse on the first ballot, which is highly unlikely given party rules and norms.

Time constraints: The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to begin in just 5 days (August 19). There is extremely little time to organize an alternative candidate or mount a credible challenge to Biden at this late stage.

Party unity: Democratic leaders have consistently emphasized the importance of party unity in facing Donald Trump. A brokered convention would risk fracturing the party just before the general election.

Lack of clear alternative: While some alternative candidates like Kamala Harris or Gavin Newsom have been floated, none have emerged as a clear consensus choice to replace Biden, reducing the likelihood of a successful challenge.

Weighing these factors, the probability of a brokered Democratic convention appears very low. The extremely rare historical precedent, Biden's continued candidacy, the lack of time before the convention, and the emphasis on party unity all strongly argue against it occurring.

However, given the unusual nature of this election cycle and Biden's age/health concerns, I can't completely rule out the possibility. There's a small chance of a last-minute health issue or other unforeseen event forcing a change.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To approach this question, I'll start by examining the base rate of brokered conventions and then consider the specific circumstances of 2024.

Base rate:
The last brokered Democratic convention was in 1952, over 70 years ago. Since then, there have been 18 Democratic conventions without a brokered outcome. This gives us a historical base rate of about 5% (1/19).

Current situation:
1. Biden is the incumbent president and has secured the vast majority of delegates.
2. There are no serious primary challengers to Biden.
3. The Democratic Party leadership has consistently backed Biden's candidacy.
4. The news articles mention speculation about replacing Biden, but no concrete moves in that direction.

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. Biden's age and perceived cognitive decline have led to increased concerns about his candidacy.
2. Poor debate performance and low approval ratings have sparked discussions about alternatives.
3. Some party insiders are reportedly considering contingency plans.

Arguments for a lower probability:
1. Replacing an incumbent president would be unprecedented and highly disruptive.
2. The process for replacing Biden is complex and would require his cooperation.
3. There's no clear alternative candidate with broad party support.
4. Time is running short, with the convention starting on August 19.
5. Biden and his team have repeatedly affirmed his intention to run.

Balancing the evidence:
While there's more chatter about replacing Biden than is typical for an incumbent, the structural barriers to a brokered convention remain high. The party would need to overcome significant logistical and political hurdles in a very short timeframe. The lack of a clear alternative candidate further reduces the likelihood.

However, given the unusual circumstances surrounding Biden's age and performance, we can't completely rule out the possibility. The probability is likely higher than the historical base rate of 5%, but still quite low.

My Prediction: Between 6.50% and 12.50%, with 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.

While there's more chatter about replacing Biden than is typical for an incumbent, the structural barriers to a brokered convention remain high. The party would need to overcome significant logistical and political hurdles in a very short timeframe. The lack of a clear alternative candidate further reduces the likelihood.

However, given the unusual circumstances surrounding Biden's age and performance, we can't completely rule out the possibility. The probability is likely higher than the historical base rate of 5%, but still quite low.

My Prediction: Between 6.50% and 12.50%, with 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.
