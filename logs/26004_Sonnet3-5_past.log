To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into sub-problems and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current polling trends:
The most recent polls show Trump with a lead over Biden, but the size varies:
- FiveThirtyEight (as of July 3) shows Trump leading by 1.1 points
- RealClearPolitics (as of July 9) shows Trump leading by 2.3 points
- Several individual polls from late June/early July show Trump leads of 4-6 points

2. Trend analysis:
- Trump's lead has been gradually increasing over the past few months
- Biden briefly regained a lead in early June, but Trump has led consistently since mid-June
- The trend suggests Trump's lead is likely to continue growing, but at an uncertain rate

3. Factors that could impact polling by July 15:
- Upcoming debate performance (scheduled for July 11)
- Potential developments in Trump's legal cases
- Economic indicators or major policy announcements
- International events

4. Historical context:
- Polling leads tend to be more volatile earlier in election cycles
- Summer polls historically have limited predictive power for November results

5. FiveThirtyEight's methodology:
- They use a weighted average that adjusts for pollster quality and recency
- Their average tends to be more conservative in reflecting changes compared to some other aggregators

Considering these factors, I estimate that Trump's lead is likely to continue growing, but may not reach the full 2-3 point range by July 15. The debate on July 11 could cause a significant shift, but it would take a few days for that to be fully reflected in FiveThirtyEight's average.

Given the current 1.1 point lead and the upward trend, I think there's a good chance Trump's lead will exceed 2 points by July 15, but it's less likely to stay below 3 points if it does exceed 2.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 45.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into steps:

1. Establish baseline probabilities:
Based on historical polling data and the current political climate, it's reasonable to expect Trump and Biden to be relatively close in national polling averages. The question specifically asks about a narrow range (Trump leading by >2 and ≤3 points), which is a fairly specific outcome.

2. Analyze recent polling trends:
The most recent polls show Trump with leads ranging from 1-6 points over Biden. The FiveThirtyEight average as of early July shows Trump with a lead of about 2.2 points.

3. Consider factors that could influence polling between now and July 15:
- Potential campaign events or debates
- Economic indicators
- International events
- Legal developments in Trump's various court cases

4. Assess the likelihood of the specific outcome:
Given that Trump is currently leading by about 2.2 points, and the target range is 2-3 points, this seems like a plausible outcome. However, it's a narrow range, and polls can fluctuate.

5. Adjust for uncertainty:
With about a week until the target date, there's still room for movement in the polls, but major shifts are less likely in such a short timeframe.

Weighing these factors, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, with 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.

This range reflects the plausibility of the outcome given current trends, while accounting for the uncertainty inherent in polling and the specific nature of the question. The most likely percentage of 27.50% indicates a significant but not overwhelming chance of this precise outcome occurring.

To approach this forecast, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Recent polling trends: The most recent polls from early July 2024 show Trump with a significant lead over Biden, ranging from 4 to 6 percentage points in various polls.

2. 538's methodology: 538 typically uses a weighted average of polls, adjusting for pollster quality and recency. Their averages tend to be more stable than individual polls.

3. Time until July 15: We have about a week until the target date, which limits the potential for major shifts but allows for some movement.

4. Debate impact: The recent presidential debate appears to have boosted Trump's numbers, but this effect may stabilize or slightly decrease by July 15.

5. Historical trends: Polling averages tend to fluctuate less dramatically than individual polls, especially over short periods.

6. Potential events: No major scheduled events are mentioned that could significantly impact polling before July 15.

Considering these factors:

- The current trend suggests Trump's lead is likely to be above 2 points on July 15.
- The 6-point leads in some polls may be outliers, and 538's average is likely to be more conservative.
- There's a good chance the lead will stabilize or slightly decrease from the post-debate high, but probably not below 2 points given the consistent leads across polls.
- The upper bound of 3 points is plausible but less certain, given the higher numbers in recent individual polls.

Balancing these considerations, I estimate there's a good chance Trump's lead will fall between 2 and 3 points in 538's average on July 15, but there's also a significant possibility it could be above 3 points.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into steps:

1. Examine recent polling trends
2. Consider factors that could influence polls between now and July 15
3. Assess the specific criteria for the question
4. Make a prediction based on the evidence

Recent polling trends:
The most recent polls show Trump with a lead over Biden, ranging from about 2 to 6 percentage points. The FiveThirtyEight average as of early July shows Trump leading by about 2.4 points.

Factors that could influence polls by July 15:
- Upcoming debates or major campaign events
- Economic indicators
- International events
- Legal developments in Trump's cases

However, with only about a week until July 15, major shifts are less likely.

Specific criteria:
The question asks if Trump's lead will be >2 and ≤3 points on July 15. This is a fairly narrow range.

Evidence for a lead in this range:
- Current polls are close to this range
- Polls have been relatively stable recently
- Short timeframe limits potential for major shifts

Evidence against:
- Polls could continue trending slightly upward for Trump
- An event could cause a sudden shift in either direction
- The specific range is narrow, increasing chances it falls outside

Balancing the evidence:
The current polling average is very close to the specified range. While there's potential for movement in either direction, the short timeframe and recent stability suggest a high likelihood of the lead remaining close to its current level. However, the narrow range means even small movements could push it outside the bounds.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

1. Examine recent polling trends
2. Consider factors that could influence polling in the coming days
3. Assess the likelihood of Trump's lead falling within the 2-3 point range on July 15

Recent polling trends:
The most recent polls show Trump with a lead over Biden, but the size varies:

- July 5 WSJ poll: Trump +6 (48% vs 42%)
- July 5 Morning Consult poll: Trump +1 (44% vs 43%)
- FiveThirtyEight average as of July 5: Trump +2.4

The 538 average has shown Trump's lead growing slowly over the past month, from about 1 point in early June to 2.4 points in early July.

Factors that could influence polling:
- Upcoming presidential debates could shift opinion
- Economic indicators or major news events could impact approval ratings
- Campaign messaging and ad spending may sway some voters

However, with only 6 days until July 15, major shifts seem unlikely barring a major event.

Likelihood of 2-3 point lead on July 15:
Given the current 2.4 point lead and recent trend of slow growth in Trump's advantage, a lead between 2-3 points seems quite plausible. The 2.4 point lead is already within this range, and moderate movement in either direction could keep it there.

However, there's also a significant chance the lead could fall outside this range:
- It could shrink below 2 points if Biden gains ground
- It could grow beyond 3 points if Trump's momentum continues

Weighing these factors, I estimate there's about a 55% chance Trump's lead will be between 2-3 points on July 15.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

Given the current 2.4 point lead and recent trend of slow growth in Trump's advantage, a lead between 2-3 points seems quite plausible. The 2.4 point lead is already within this range, and moderate movement in either direction could keep it there.

However, there's also a significant chance the lead could fall outside this range:
- It could shrink below 2 points if Biden gains ground
- It could grow beyond 3 points if Trump's momentum continues

Weighing these factors, I estimate there's about a 55% chance Trump's lead will be between 2-3 points on July 15.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.
