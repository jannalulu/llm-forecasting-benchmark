**Broncos will start QB Bo Nix next week (but the Packers might rest their starters)**
The Denver Broncos will start rookie quarterback Bo Nix in their next preseason game against the Green Bay Packers on Aug. 18, as announced by coach Sean Payton last Friday. Nix impressed in his NFL debut against the Indianapolis Colts, completing 15 of 21 passing attempts for 125 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. However, the Broncos might face a second-string defense from the Packers, as coach Matt LaFleur said most starters won't play in Denver in Week 2 of preseason. Fortunately, the Packers will feature their defensive starters in a scrimmage-like joint practice with Denver on Friday, giving Nix some live-game reps against the first-team defense.

**Why Broncos must start Bo Nix Week 1 vs. Seahawks**
Denver Broncos' quarterback Bo Nix is the presumptive starting quarterback for Week 1 against the Seahawks. Nix performed well in the preseason debut, leading four scoring drives and completing 15-of-21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown. In contrast, Jarrett Stidham struggled, going 4-for-7 passing for 37 yards and an interception. Broncos' offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi praised Nix's ability to execute on offense, saying, 'When you give him a play, and it's new and the defense has a new install, there's a little bit of a — not as much confidence when he gets it and you look in his eyes... After a couple of days when you're running the same plays, you just feel like he's a veteran.' Nix has 61 college starts, the most of any rookie quarterback in the NFL.

**Broncos Raise Eyebrows With Initial Unofficial Depth Chart Release**
The Denver Broncos have released their unofficial depth chart, listing veteran quarterback Jarrett Stidham as the starter. However, rookie first-round pick Bo Nix is listed as the third quarterback, behind former New York Jets QB Zach Wilson. Broncos insider Klis noted that Stidham earned the No. 1 listing due to his performance in OTAs and training camp. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport stated that Nix has impressed in Denver and could potentially start in Week 1. Nix has taken first-team reps in back-to-back practices and has a strong chance of starting sooner rather than later. 'Right now... Jarrett Stidham is the QB1 on the official unofficial depth chart,' Rapoport said. 'But I still wouldn't be surprised if Bo Nix ended up as the starter for Week 1.'

**NFL futures: So who's the betting favorite in the Broncos QB battle?**
The Denver Broncos' quarterback battle is underway, with three potential starters vying for the starting job. According to DraftKings' odds, Bo Nix is the betting favorite to start Week 1, followed by Zach Wilson and Jarrett Stidham. Nix, a former Heisman candidate, has the most potential but will need to earn the job in training camp. Wilson, who was part of a dysfunctional New York Jets offense, will need to have an out-of-this-world preseason to get the starting job. Stidham, with the most NFL experience, will have to blow the competition out of the water to lock in the starting role.

**Broncos QB Bo Nix could lock up starting job with strong showing against Packers in joint practice, preseason game**
Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix is in a battle with veteran Jarrett Stidham for the starting job. A strong showing against the Green Bay Packers in a joint practice and preseason game could result in Nix becoming the second rookie quarterback in team history to start an opener. Broncos coach Sean Payton said Nix 'made good decisions' and was 'comfortable in the pocket' in last Sunday's preseason opener against the Colts. Payton also praised the progress of quarterback Zach Wilson, saying he showed 'poise' in the game. The team has made strides from last season, with tackle Mike McGlinchey saying there's an 'internal belief' that they can win. The Broncos waived rookie outside linebacker Jaylon Allen with an injury settlement to create room on the roster.

**Keeler: Broncos should make Bo Nix their Week 1 starting QB in Seattle, unless injury bug bites. But that bug would have to catch him first.**
Broncos quarterback Bo Nix impressed in his first preseason game, leading the team to four scores over five drives. He completed 15 of 21 throws for 125 yards and showed off his speed, which could be a game-changer for the offense. Nix's ability to extend plays and make quick decisions was evident, and he even threw a touchdown pass to Marvin Mims. The rookie quarterback's performance has made a strong case for him to be the Week 1 starter in Seattle, unless he struggles in the final preseason game or gets injured. Coach Sean Payton praised Nix's speed, saying 'it was great to see in the game setting.' The Broncos' offense looked more dynamic with Nix running, and he has the potential to be a game-changer in the NFL.

Rookie quarterback Bo Nix made a strong impression in his first NFL game, leading the Denver Broncos to a 34-30 preseason win over the Indianapolis Colts. Nix completed 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown, with a passer rating of 102.3. He took over for starter Jarrett Stidham and led the Broncos to their first 20 points and a 20-10 lead.

Broncos coach Sean Payton was 'pleased' with Nix's play and said Stidham got a 'tough break' with an interception and penalties. Payton also praised Nix's composure, saying 'he felt pretty good' and that the team executed well when Nix was in the game. 'When we executed well, guys were in the right spots, and we moved the ball efficiently a lot of the day, and that usually turns into points,' Nix said. 'It was a nice play by (Marvin Mims Jr.),' Nix said of his touchdown pass. 'He did a good job of getting to the corner, and we executed well. We've been practicing and repping that play quite a lot.' Mims was impressed by Nix's confidence, saying 'his confidence is really radiant.' Sutton also liked what he saw from Nix, saying 'he looked good out there. I was excited to see him handling the two-minute drill,' Sutton said of Nix leading the Broncos down the field for a 27-yard field by Lutz with 5 seconds left in the half. 'He made some really good reads. He got the ball where it needed to be.'

**Should Bo Nix be named the Broncos starting quarterback?**
Bo Nix performed well in a quarterback competition with Jarrett Stidham, finishing the game 15 for 21 for 125 yards passing and 1 touchdown pass to Marvin Mims Jr. He also had 3 rushing attempts for 17 yards, showcasing his running ability as a weapon for defenses to focus on. Nix led the Broncos' offense down the field multiple times, including a beautiful third-down pass to Courtland Sutton and a touchdown pass to Marvin Mims Jr. He looked poised and accurate, using his legs and leading the second-team offense down for their first touchdown in the game. Nix's performance has led many to believe that he should be named the Broncos starting quarterback, including the author of this article, who expects him to get all the first-team reps this week and eventually be named the starter following the game vs. the Packers. 'He looked comfortable out there, didn't look overwhelmed by the speed of the NFL, made good reads, avoided sacks, got rid of the ball quickly, and his running ability adds an extra element to the offense,' the author said. 'The upside is there and we saw glimpses of that this afternoon.'

The Denver Broncos are considering their quarterback options for the upcoming season, with Jarrett Stidham and Bo Nix competing for the starting role. Coach Sean Payton has named Stidham the starter for the preseason game against Indianapolis, but Nix is expected to take over in the regular-season opener against Seattle. If Nix can secure the job, he will become the 13th starter since Peyton Manning retired. The Broncos are also thin at the safety position, with Caden Sterns being waived, and are considering bringing back Justin Simmons, who is currently unsigned. However, coach Payton appears to want more physicality from the position, which is why the Broncos are bullish on JL Skinner in his second season.

**First preseason start for Broncos QB Bo Nix is now official**
Denver Broncos first-round pick Bo Nix will make his first preseason start against the Green Bay Packers, following a start by Jarrett Stidham against the Indianapolis Colts. Nix will see significant reps against the Colts and is expected to build on his performance, potentially paving the way for a Week 1 start. Coach Sean Payton is gradually working Nix into a role as the team's starter, but it remains to be seen if he will be ready for Week 1. Payton is comfortable with Stidham as a backup option, but Nix's performance against the Packers will be crucial in determining his starting status. If Nix starts Week 1, he would be the Broncos' first rookie starter since John Elway in 1983, according to Payton. 'It is almost certain that he is gradually working Nix into a role as the team's starter,' Payton said. 'The hope will be that he can build on that performance and take that into his start against Green Bay,' Payton added.

Nix is looking forward to Sunday's preseason opener against the Colts, where he will face another NFL team for the first time.

Nix has a similar attitude, saying he is focused on executing and shutting out the outside noise.

**Predicting Winner of Broncos' QB1 Battle Two Weeks into Camp**
The Denver Broncos' quarterback competition between Jarrett Stidham, Zach Wilson, and Bo Nix is heating up. Stidham has impressed with his training camp performance, while Wilson has struggled to find consistency. Nix, the first-round rookie, is seen as a strong contender for the starting job. Wilson believes that his experience will help him learn from his mistakes and improve his game. 'Hopefully, I just kind of have those memories of remembering similar plays that I've had in the past where certain things have come up or situations and stuff, and protection adjustments, different things like that where I'm able to say, 'You know what, remember in my three years when this happened, and this is how I'm going to combat that,' Wilson said. Stidham's conservative play style may hold him back from winning the job, while Nix's potential and pairing with coach Sean Payton make him a strong candidate to start. With preseason Game 1 approaching, the competition is intensifying, and it's likely that Nix will be the starter for the Week 1 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks.

**Broncos Raise Eyebrows With Initial Unofficial Depth Chart Release**
The Denver Broncos have released their unofficial depth chart, listing veteran quarterback Jarrett Stidham as the starter. However, rookie first-round pick Bo Nix is listed as the third quarterback, behind former New York Jets QB Zach Wilson. Broncos insider Klis noted that Stidham earned the No. 1 listing due to his performance in OTAs and training camp. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport stated that Nix has impressed in Denver and could potentially start in Week 1. Nix has taken first-team reps in back-to-back practices and has a strong chance of starting sooner rather than later. 'Right now... Jarrett Stidham is the QB1 on the official unofficial depth chart,' Rapoport said. 'But I still wouldn't be surprised if Bo Nix ended up as the starter for Week 1.'

**Broncos' depth chart lists Jarrett Stidham as starter, Zach Wilson No. 2, Bo Nix No. 3**
The Denver Broncos' first unofficial depth chart of the 2024 preseason lists Jarrett Stidham as the starting quarterback, with Zach Wilson as the backup and Bo Nix as the third-string quarterback. According to the team's head coach Sean Payton, Nix will have the opportunity to take the starting job, as the team drafted him in the first round with the expectation that he can play. As Stidham is currently the starter, it is a matter of when, not if, Nix will become the team's starter, rather than whether he will become the starter.

**Broncos camp notebook: Nix continues to advance**
Bo Nix is making progress towards becoming the starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos, according to head coach Sean Payton. Payton emphasized the importance of a good 2-minute quarterback, saying 'They are fast processors, the pocket gets muddied, they don't get stuck with sacks. They understand how to manage the clock.' Nix had a strong practice, but Payton re-huddled the offense three times to emphasize the importance of details. The Broncos are also focusing on increasing their pass rush, with a goal of 10-plus sacks across the room. Starting outside linebacker Jonathon Cooper led the team with 8.5 sacks last year and is aiming to increase that number. NFL referee Brad Rogers visited the team to discuss the new rule changes for 2024, including the outlawed hip-drop tackle. The Broncos will practice indoors next Friday, August 9, in preparation for their preseason opener against the Indianapolis Colts.

**Former No. 2 Overall Pick out of Starting QB Battle for Broncos**
The Denver Broncos' starting quarterback battle has narrowed down to Jarrett Stidham and rookie Bo Nix, according to ESPN. Former No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson, who was traded to the Broncos in April, is now on the outside looking in. Broncos coach Sean Payton acknowledged that the competition is down to two, with Stidham working with the starters the most this week. The Broncos traded a sixth-round pick to the New York Jets for Wilson and a seventh-round pick, but it's now unclear if they will keep him on the 53-man roster. Wilson's past behavior, including alienating teammates and coaches, has raised concerns about his fit with the team. 'It's not etched in stone, we talk about it at the beginning of the week,' Payton said. 'It's hard to rotate three with the first group... We'll see how Saturday goes... not going to be a scrimmage, but it's going to be like three phases, like move the ball.'

**One thing Bo Nix must do to be the Denver Broncos Week 1 starter**
Denver Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix is on a solid upward trajectory, having helped coach Sean Payton narrow the three-way starting quarterback battle to two in training camp. To secure the starting position before Week 1, Nix must capitalize on the extra reps with the first-team offense and impress in Saturday's practice, which will feature a move-the-ball period against the first team defense. Payton has stated that nothing is 'etched in stone' at the position, and Nix's performance on Saturday will give him a leg-up heading into the team's preseason games and demonstrate his steady growth curve since joining the team, according to Payton. 'It won't be a full-on scrimmage, but it will feature a move-the-ball period,' Payton said. 'Both Nix and Jarrett Stidham will likely get their chances against the first team defense.'

The Denver Broncos' quarterback battle is underway, with three potential starters vying for the starting job. According to DraftKings' odds, Bo Nix is the betting favorite to start Week 1, followed by Zach Wilson and Jarrett Stidham. Nix, a former Heisman candidate, has the most potential but will need to earn the job in training camp. Wilson, who was part of a dysfunctional New York Jets offense, will need to have an out-of-this-world preseason to get the starting job. Stidham, with the most NFL experience, will have to blow the competition out of the water to lock in the starting role.

However, Woody Paige of the Denver Gazette believes that coach Sean Payton is wasting time with the competition and should name Nix as the starter. Paige argues that Nix can fix the Broncos' quarterback issues, while Stidham and Wilson are not viable options. Payton has been tight-lipped about the competition, but has praised each quarterback during offseason workouts. The Broncos have started 14 different quarterbacks since 2016, and Nix's success could be the long-term answer to the team's revolving doors of quarterbacks.

The Denver Broncos are preparing for training camp, where rookie quarterback Bo Nix will compete with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson for the starting job. Nix is expected to be the future answer at the position, but his development is crucial. Quarterbacks coach Davis Webb emphasizes the importance of taking it slow and not overwhelming Nix with too much information. Nix himself focuses on studying and mastering one play at a time, and the early part of training camp will test how much of the playbook he has learned. The Broncos' coaches aim to balance Nix's development with the need to prepare him for the season opener on September 8.
