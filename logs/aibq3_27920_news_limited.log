**Djibouti Offers Ethiopia Access to Port of Tadjoura**
The Foreign Minister of Djibouti, 'We will provide Ethiopia with the opportunity to use the port of Tadjoura, located 100 kilometers from the Ethiopian border.' The minister added that the offer aims to provide Ethiopia with a new trade route to facilitate trade and enhance cooperation between the two countries. This step is part of a broader effort by Djibouti to ease tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia, which has threatened peace and stability in the Horn of Africa region. The proposal is expected to be discussed in more detail during the upcoming summit between Chinese and African leaders, which will be attended by the President of Djibouti Ismail Omar Guelleh, the President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and the Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed. In October 2023, Abiy Ahmed, the Prime Minister of landlocked Ethiopia, called on neighboring countries to negotiate equal access to ports in exchange for sharing control of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. However, at that time, Somalia, Djibouti, and Eritrea did not respond positively to his proposal. In January 2024, Abiy Ahmed and the President of Somaliland, Muse Bihi Abdi, signed a memorandum of understanding to provide Ethiopia with access to ports. As reported by the Adis Standard newspaper, Somaliland granted Ethiopia the opportunity to establish a naval base on its territory in exchange for recognizing it as a sovereign state. It is worth noting that Somaliland is not recognized by the international community, which considers it part of Somalia.

**Djibouti Offers Ethiopia Access to Port of Tadjura**
The Republic of Djibouti has announced its willingness to provide Ethiopia with access to the port of Tadjura. According to Djibouti's Foreign Minister, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, 'Access will be provided to the port of Tadjura, 100 km from the border with Ethiopia.' This move comes after Ethiopia's Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, called on neighboring countries in October 2023 to negotiate equal access to ports in exchange for participation in controlling the 'Renaissance Dam.' However, neither Somalia nor Djibouti nor Eritrea responded positively to the proposal. On January 1, 2024, Ahmed and the head of Somaliland, Muse Bihi Abdi, signed a memorandum of understanding to provide Ethiopia with access to maritime ports. In exchange, Somaliland would receive recognition as a sovereign state. Somaliland is recognized by the international community as part of Somalia, but its authorities declared state sovereignty unilaterally in the spring of 1991. The Somali government has stated its intention to challenge the memorandum between Ethiopia and Somaliland, which it believes violates the country's sovereignty. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has vowed to take action against Ethiopia without hesitation. In response, Ethiopia's senior advisor to the Chief of Staff, Alemeshet Degefe, stated that Addis Ababa is mobilizing troops to prevent attempts to destabilize the country. The African Union's Peace and Security Council has called on Ethiopia and Somalia to exercise restraint, de-escalate, and establish a productive dialogue.

**Turkey-Mediated Somalia-Ethiopia Port Deal Fails to Reach Agreement**
Talks between Somalia and Ethiopia over a contentious Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ethiopia and Somaliland ended without an agreement in Turkey. Despite the failure, the talks are being viewed as a diplomatic success, as they helped prevent direct confrontation or war between the two nations. The talks, mediated by Turkey, aimed to ease tensions that have persisted since the MoU was signed on January 1, 2024. Somalia denounced the agreement as infringing on its sovereignty and subsequently severed diplomatic ties with Ethiopia. Turkish mediation helped to prevent further escalation, as Somalia's Foreign Minister, Elin, said, 'It was a great day.' However, the exact details of the agreement remain unclear, and the dispute is far from being resolved.

Fidan proposed an arrangement that would ensure Ethiopia's sea access via Somalia, in return for Ethiopia acknowledging Somalia's territorial integrity and political sovereignty. The foreign ministers of Ethiopia and Somalia expressed hope that the momentum from the talks will result in a solution, with Somalia reaffirming its commitment to protecting its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and unity.

**Ethiopia's Commitment to Peaceful Resolution of Dispute with Somalia**
Ethiopia's Foreign Minister, Taye Atske Selassie, announced on Friday that his country is committed to 'settling the dispute with Somalia peacefully'. He emphasized that cooperation with anti-peace forces is a short-sighted and unproductive strategy, according to the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA). The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry released a statement on Wednesday regarding the developments in Somalia, a few weeks after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signed a military cooperation protocol with his Somali counterpart. Ethiopia had previously signed an agreement with the 'Land of Somalia' government, guaranteeing it a maritime outlet in Somali territory. In a press briefing on Friday, the Ethiopian Foreign Minister discussed the current regional developments, including the disputes between Ethiopia and Somalia. Selassie claimed that 'Ethiopia chose not to retaliate when it was recently attacked by some Somali government officials and anti-government forces seeking to exploit opportunities to destabilize the region'. He added that the 'aggressive rhetoric and threats' will not deter Ethiopia from its commitment to peace in the region, explaining that 'we must redouble our efforts to stop those who are trying to backtrack on the gains achieved against terrorism in this region'. The Foreign Minister also mentioned that Ethiopia is willing to facilitate negotiations with Somalia, first in Nairobi and then in Ankara, where these efforts have made progress and promise results, according to ENA. He stated that these efforts should not be undermined by 'provocative statements', adding that 'collaborating with anti-peace forces in this region is also short-sighted and unproductive'. The Foreign Minister emphasized that 'as the largest country in this region, we do not take lightly our responsibility to protect the safety and ensure the future of our country and region'. The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry stated in a tweet: 'Ethiopia has worked tirelessly for peace and security in Somalia and the region, and for mutual growth, and has strengthened the close ties between the peoples of the region. Ethiopia has participated in numerous discussions to resolve disputes with the Somali government and has made tangible progress in the talks, instead of building on these efforts to achieve peace, the Somali government has collaborated with external parties seeking to destabilize the region'.

**Ethiopia-Somaliland Dispute Raises Concerns About Regional Instability**
A dispute between Ethiopia and the self-declared state of Somaliland has raised concerns about a potential regional escalation that could threaten maritime security in the Red Sea region. The dispute centers around Ethiopia's desire to establish a naval base on Somaliland territory. The conflict has a long history, dating back to the British colonization of the region. In 1960, Somaliland gained independence from British colonial rule and merged with the Italian colony of Somalia to form the Somali Republic. However, in 1991, Somaliland declared independence from Somalia, and despite not being recognized by the international community, it has its own government, institutions, and currency. The current dispute began in 2024 when Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a memorandum of understanding that would allow Ethiopia to use one of Somaliland's ports for 50 years in exchange for recognizing Somaliland's independence. The agreement has been met with opposition from Somaliland, which has declared the agreement null and void. The United States and the African Union have called for calm and respect for Somaliland's sovereignty, while Turkey has expressed its commitment to Somaliland's unity and territorial integrity. Egypt has also pledged to support Somaliland and has signed a military cooperation agreement with the country. The agreement has been seen as a move by Egypt to counter Ethiopia's influence in the region and to secure its own interests in the Red Sea. The dispute has raised concerns about the potential for regional instability and the impact on maritime security in the Red Sea.

**Turkey Announces Significant Progress in Somalia-Ethiopia Conflict Talks**
Turkey's Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, announced 'significant progress' in the negotiations between Somalia and Etiopía to resolve the territorial dispute over Etiopía's attempts to access the sea through the Somaliland region. Fidan stated, 'We have achieved a significant convergence between the parties on some basic principles and specific elements. In this sense, significant progress has been made.' The Turkish diplomat acted as a mediator in a meeting between the African countries and made these comments after a joint appearance with his counterparts from Somalia, Ahmed Moallim Fiqi, and Etiopía, Taye Atske Selassie, following the second round of talks in Ankara. Fidan also announced that a third round of contacts will take place in the Turkish capital on August 17. He noted that today, some concrete solutions were discussed that 'aim to eliminate the existing differences and reach an agreement on an acceptable framework for both parties.' The Turkish government has already hosted a negotiating round on the conflict triggered by Etiopía's attempt to acquire a port in the Indian Ocean on the coast of Somaliland in exchange for recognizing the independence of this secessionist Somali region. Fidan stated, 'Our goal is to eliminate the current concerns and resolve the problems in a way that benefits not only Somalia and Etiopía, but the entire region.'

**Ethiopia Considers Reconsidering Agreement with Somaliland Amid Somalia's Port Offer**
Ethiopia may reconsider its agreement with Somaliland, a secessionist region, after Somalia, backed by Turkey, made an 'attractive' offer to provide access to a port for its trade. Ethiopia, a landlocked country, seeks to access regional ports to strengthen its trade with the rest of the world. The potential agreement between Somalia and Ethiopia would involve Somalia providing Ethiopia with access to a port, and Ethiopia abandoning its protocol with Somaliland, signed on January 1, 2024. This arrangement aims to resolve long-standing tensions between the two countries and improve their diplomatic relations. According to diplomatic reports, the foreign ministers of Ethiopia and Somalia have provisionally accepted a reconciliation proposal presented by Turkey. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud stated, 'The role of Turkey in promoting dialogue and peaceful resolution of regional problems is essential.' He reiterated Somalia's willingness to engage in economic cooperation and development with Ethiopia, but emphasized that such partnerships must respect Somalia's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, and adhere to international law and norms. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan previously tweeted that he had spoken with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, saying, 'If Ethiopia takes measures to end any threat to Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, it will facilitate the discussion process.' This statement implies that Ethiopia must officially renounce its agreement with Somaliland to move forward with the proposed arrangement. It is not yet clear if Addis-Abeba has renounced the agreement with Somaliland.

**Turkey Hosts Second Round of Talks Between Somalia and Ethiopia**
Turkey is hosting a second round of talks between Somalia and Ethiopia, as part of its mediation efforts to resolve a dispute over a port agreement signed by Ethiopia with the breakaway region of Somaliland in January 2023, which allows Somaliland to use the region's coastline on the Red Sea for commercial and military purposes for 50 years. According to a statement by the Turkish presidency, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed by phone, discussing the relations between Turkey and Ethiopia, regional and global developments, and the dispute with Somalia. Erdogan emphasized that Turkey will continue its efforts to end the tension between Somalia and Ethiopia, and that Ethiopia's steps to address Somalia's concerns about its unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity 'will make the process easier.' The Turkish Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, said that the foreign ministers of Somalia and Ethiopia will meet in Ankara this week to discuss the dispute over the port agreement. The relations between the two neighbors, Ethiopia and Somalia, have deteriorated since Ethiopia signed the agreement with Somaliland in January 2023, which allows Somaliland to use the region's coastline on the Red Sea for commercial and military purposes for 50 years, in exchange for Ethiopia's recognition of Somaliland's independence. In April 2023, Somalia announced the expulsion of the Ethiopian ambassador, and closed the Ethiopian consulates in Hargeisa, the largest city and capital of Somaliland, and Galkayo, the capital of the semi-autonomous region of Puntland. Somalia declared that the agreement between Ethiopia and Somaliland is 'unlawful' and constitutes a threat to its sovereignty. Ethiopia defended the agreement, saying it 'will not affect any party or country.' Ethiopia lost its ports on the Red Sea in the early 1990s, after the Eritrean independence war, which lasted from 1961 to 1991. Somaliland, which has not been recognized as a state since its declaration of independence from Somalia in 1991, operates as a separate administrative, political, and security entity, with the central government unable to exert control over the region. Turkey has launched a mediation initiative between Somalia and Ethiopia, and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has held a meeting with his Ethiopian and Somali counterparts in Ankara in July. Fidan said that 'the tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia will end when Ethiopia reaches the seas through Somalia, as long as Ethiopia's recognition of Somalia's territorial integrity and sovereignty is guaranteed.' Turkey has strong relations with both countries and has become a close ally of Somalia, providing schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, and offering scholarships to Somalis to study in Turkish universities. In 2017, Turkey opened its largest military base outside the country in Mogadishu, and in February this year, it signed a defense and economic cooperation agreement with Somalia, which includes the deployment of Turkish naval forces to protect Somalia's coastline, after the two countries agreed on Turkey's operations to explore oil and gas in three areas off Somalia's coast.
