INT. FORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, analyzing the latest data on Boeing's strike.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confident)  
"Our models had it at 92.35%. The strike would persist through September 30, 2024."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Given the September 13 news, the overwhelming rejection of the contract by 33,000 machinists was a strong indicator."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing on a laptop)  
"The AP's Strikes Hub was our only resolution source. Even if they delayed updates, our models accounted for that."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(looking at a screen)  
"No reports of the strike ending before October 1. Boeing's production woes continue."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(satisfied)  
"Another accurate forecast. Our models never miss."

The forecasters exchange nods, their confidence in their predictive prowess unshaken.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit across from each other, laptops open, sipping coffee.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
So, the Boeing strike. What's the verdict?

MIKE  
(grinning)  
Our models had it at 92.75%. The strike's still on.  

JANE  
(nodding)  
Yeah, AP's Strike Hub showed no updates. The machinists are holding strong. 

MIKE  
(sipping coffee)  
Boeing's in a tough spot. The rejected contract was a big deal—25% wage increase over four years. 

JANE  
(smirking)  
And still, they said no. Shows how deep the discontent runs. 

MIKE  
(glancing at his screen)  
No updates on the Hub by the 16th. We knew the odds were high they'd hold out. 

JANE  
(raising her cup)  
To accurate models and the power of collective bargaining. 

They clink their cups, satisfied with their prediction.
