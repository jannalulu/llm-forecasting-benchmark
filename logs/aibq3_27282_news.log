**UK Riots Continue, Over 900 Arrested, Including 12-Year-Old Boys**
The UK is experiencing widespread riots, with over 900 people arrested so far. Two of the arrested individuals are as young as 12 years old. The riots began after the suspected murder of three children, Bebe, 6, Elsie, 9, and Alice, 9, by 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana at a dance studio in Southport. Since then, large demonstrations and riots have erupted across the UK, with some classified as far-right extremist. Many of the riots have been violent, with injured police officers, counter-demonstrators, and police cars set on fire. In addition, several asylum centers have been attacked. To get a grip on the situation, the police have started arresting a large number of people, with 927 arrested so far, according to Sky News. Two of the arrested individuals are 12-year-old boys, one of whom is accused of participating in a violent riot in Merseyside on July 30 and will be heard in the youth court. The other 12-year-old boy is accused of participating in riots in Manchester, where he allegedly kicked a bus and threw a stone at a person, and was filmed by police kicking a shop window and throwing a dangerous object at a police car. The violence escalated after misinformation was spread among far-right groups that the perpetrator was an asylum seeker. After the perpetrator's identity was revealed, he was found to be born in the UK with parents from Rwanda. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has held several crisis meetings and urged authorities to have 'high readiness'. He has said, 'You will regret being a part of this.' He has also promised to do 'whatever it takes' to bring 'those responsible' to justice, saying, 'This is not a demonstration, it is organized, violent, and has no place on our streets or online.'

**British MP Calls for Emergency Parliamentary Session Amid Widespread Riots**
British MP and Conservative Party leadership candidate Priti Patel has called for an emergency parliamentary session due to the widespread riots that erupted after a stabbing attack on children in English Southport. According to foreign media, far-right protests are gaining momentum in the UK following the deaths of three children in the stabbing attack. The Times reported that at least 35 protests are expected over the weekend. The British Parliament has gone on summer recess and will return to work on September 2. In emergency situations, the government can request the Speaker of the House of Commons to summon MPs during the recess. Patel called the violent protests in British cities 'unacceptable' and urged all politicians, regardless of party, to condemn the situation. Last night, riots involving several hundred far-right groups erupted in English Sunderland, with protesters setting fire to the central police station and throwing beer barrels and stones at police. Three police officers were hospitalized, and eight people were arrested. Earlier this week, protests in several cities also turned violent, with dozens of police officers injured and numerous arrests made. The Merseyside police force reported a stabbing attack on children in the Southport town on July 29. Three children died, and several children and two adults were taken to the hospital in critical condition. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with the murder of three people, attempted murder of ten others, and possession of a cold weapon. Police confirmed that they do not link the attack to terrorism. According to police, the attack occurred during a children's dance and yoga class inspired by American singer Taylor Swift. The reaction of Southport, London, and other city residents to the attack has led to protests that turned into clashes with police and widespread riots due to the spread of unconfirmed information that the suspect is a refugee.

**Grenoble Shop Owners Prepare for Potential Unrest Ahead of Election Results**
As the second round of the 2024 legislative elections approaches, authorities in Grenoble are concerned about potential unrest and looting. To prepare, several shop owners are taking measures to protect their stores. One year after the riots that followed the death of Nahel, the memory of the destruction and pillaging is still fresh in the minds of many. On Sunday, July 7, the second and final round of the elections will take place. In the city center, wooden boards are being placed over store windows to prevent damage. David Gendrolini, a security expert, has been hired to install the boards. Some shop owners are not too worried, but others are taking precautions to avoid potential damage. Melanie Giaconella, a saleswoman, explains, 'We're a bit worried about being robbed and having our stores looted. We've done this as a precaution, in case there are any disturbances after the election results are announced, given what happened last year during the riots.' The memory of the 2023 riots is still traumatic for many shop owners, who were affected by the destruction and looting. The French Minister of the Interior, Gérard Darmanin, has announced a large-scale security deployment across the country, with over 30,000 police officers to be mobilized.

**USA 2024: Security a Top Concern at Democratic Convention in Chicago**
Over 50,000 party members are expected to attend the Democratic convention in Chicago from Monday to Thursday to celebrate Kamala Harris' nomination as the party's presidential candidate for the November election. The 26th edition of the convention is expected to be one of the most secure events ever held in the third-largest city in the US, known for its large political festivals. The FBI, the US Federal Police, the Secret Service's elite unit, and the local police have spent a year developing the extensive security system surrounding the massive sports complex where the Democratic convention will take place. The party's elite, including President Joe Biden, will be in attendance, as well as various personalities, including several Hollywood stars. According to Lucas Rothaar, the FBI's representative in Chicago, there is no particular concern, but the event will take place in a 'high-threat environment'. 'We are aware of the vast threats facing our country, whether it's violent crime, international terrorism, domestic terrorism (...) and a multitude of other threats,' he said at a press conference. Approximately 2,500 local police officers - backed by hundreds of reinforcements from elsewhere - will be responsible for securing the event. The attempt to assassinate Donald Trump on July 13 during a campaign rally sparked criticism over the measures taken to ensure the security of political personalities in a highly polarized context. While the motivations of the shooter - killed by the Secret Service - remain unclear, US intelligence fears possible 'acts of violent retaliation' during the Democratic convention, according to a report consulted by several American media outlets. One of the most serious threats could come from 'isolated individuals' motivated by anti-government beliefs, political grievances, or ideological positions, according to the document. Pro-Palestinian protests? The security system also anticipates the risk of more generalized violence, linked to the holding of planned or spontaneous protests. Several demonstrations, including those to protest against the war in Gaza supported by the Biden administration, have already been announced by militant organizations. The 1968 Democratic convention, also held in Chicago, was shaken by the bloody police repression of anti-Vietnam War protesters. And the fear of violence hangs over the 2024 edition. While Kamala Harris has adopted a tougher tone towards Israel and promised not to remain 'silent' in the face of civilian suffering in Gaza, the vice-president continues to face criticism on the issue and has seen several of her campaign rallies disrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters. 'Abandon Biden'. The 'Abandon Biden' campaign, created to sanction in the polls the support of Joe Biden for Israel, has announced its own convention in Chicago on Sunday and Monday, and has promised an action 'against the Biden-Harris administration in response to its inability to protect innocent Palestinians'. Local organizations plan to hold rallies that could gather up to 25,000 people, according to local media. In anticipation of possible violent protests and multiple arrests, the schedules of dozens of judges have been released and a temporary court will be set up. The Democratic leadership is in contact with the leaders of pro-Palestinian organizations to avoid potential clashes. The city of Chicago has stated that it will ensure that the protests can take place 'in sight and earshot' of the sports complex where the convention will take place. The police will focus on protecting the freedom of expression of the protesters, said Larry Snelling, a police official. But, 'what we will not tolerate is vandalism. What we will not tolerate is violence. If we see it, we will stop it quickly,' he added.

**Riots Erupt in England Following Stabbing of Three Young Girls**
On July 27, 20,000 to 30,000 people gathered in London for the 'We Want Our Country Back' rally, the largest demonstration of its kind in years. However, the event received little attention in Sweden. Two days later, a 17-year-old Rwandan immigrant stabbed three young girls to death and injured eight more, including two adults, at a dance school in Southport. This incident sparked protests in the UK, with police using batons to disperse the crowds. According to the article, the media in Sweden was largely silent on the initial demonstration, but the violent incident that followed received significant attention.

**Britain: Thousands of people in anti-racism demonstrations – 2024-08-11 08:21:01**
Thousands of people in Britain participated in anti-racism demonstrations on Saturday, following 10 days of racist and Islamophobic violence, considered the worst in Britain for 13 years. The largest demonstration took place in Belfast, where police recorded numerous acts of racism last week. Gatherings also occurred in Newcastle, Cardiff, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and London, where nearly 1,000 people rallied outside the headquarters of the Reform UK party, holding placards reading 'no to racism, no to hate.' The British Judiciary has reacted swiftly to the racist riots, indicting 300 rioters in a week for various crimes, including online posts fueling violence. A 28-year-old man was sentenced to 20 months in prison for inciting racial hatred online, with the British government aiming to deter and crack down on the Far Right riots. The violence erupted after a knife attack that killed three girls on July 29 in Southport, and was fueled by fake news and rumors circulating on the Internet regarding the identity of the alleged perpetrator.

**UK Sees Anti-Racism Rallies Amid Xenophobic and Islamophobic Violence**
Thousands of people in the UK participated in anti-racism rallies on Saturday in response to the anti-migrant riots that shook the country for a week. The riots were sparked by the murder of three girls on July 29. Despite a strong judicial response, with hundreds of arrests and first convictions, and a first wave of anti-racism rallies on Wednesday, new protests took place in many cities to condemn recent xenophobic and Islamophobic violence. The largest rally, with around 5,000 people, took place in Belfast, where the police reported several racist incidents this week. 'This is the real Belfast we see here,' said Olivia Browne, a 21-year-old student, holding a sign that read: 'Love your neighbor.' 'We've always been an welcoming city and I hope it will always be the case.' A mosque in Newtownards, east of Belfast, was vandalized and targeted with a Molotov cocktail, which was not lit, and the police are treating the incident as a racist crime. While the violence in Northern Ireland was initially sparked by clashes in England, the police estimate that it was fueled by ultra-conservative unionist paramilitaries in this province with a bloody past where intercommunal tensions remain high. 'It is very important for immigrants in this country to see us, white Britons, saying: no, we will not tolerate this,' said Phoebe Sewell, a 32-year-old Londoner. 'I don't like it when the right-wing comes out in the streets in my name,' said Jeremy Snelling, 64, who attended the rally in London. 'I'm for open borders and refugees are a good thing.'

**The varying reactions of rioters as police arrest them at home**
Riots have swept the nation since July 30, following the killing of three little girls in Southport on July 29. The suspect, Axel Rudakubana, has been charged with murdering the girls. Over 700 people have been arrested in connection with the riots, with 302 charged. Police have released bodycam footage of their interactions with those arrested, showing a mix of reactions. Some rioters have been arrested at their homes, while others have been caught on camera inciting violence online. The police are using facial recognition and drone footage to identify suspects. The government is considering extending punishments for rioters, including banning them from football matches. Two women, Leanne Hodgson and Stacey Vint, have been jailed for their roles in the riots. Hodgson was seen pushing wheelie bins at police and inciting others, while Vint was arrested after attempting to ram a burning wheelie bin at police. A Labour councillor, Ricky Jones, has been arrested for encouraging murder and making egregious remarks at a counter-protest. The counter-protests have been largely peaceful, with thousands of people gathering to voice their support for migrant communities.

**Far-right thugs faced down by anti-fascist counter protesters**
A series of anti-immigration protests and riots have swept the UK, with hundreds of people arrested and 149 charged. The violence exploded after the killings of three little girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Merseyside on July 29. Misinformation about the suspect, who was born in Cardiff to Christian parents, quickly spread online amid claims he was an asylum seeker who had arrived by small boat. Counter-protesters have dwarfed the number from the far-Right, leading to hopes of a 'turning point'. However, police remain vigilant amid fears of another 20 demonstrations in the coming days. The Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, has vowed to remain 'on high alert' and has praised the police for their response to the riots. The Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has announced that inmates will be freed after serving 40% of their sentence, but this will not apply to violent offenders serving more than four years. The early release scheme is due to run for at least 18 months, with the first batch of prisoners freed in September. The Ministry of Justice has introduced over 500 new prison places to address the prison crisis. The Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has pledged to crack down on those inciting violence and spreading misinformation online. The police have arrested 483 people and 104 officers have been injured. The damage is estimated to be in the millions of pounds. The rioters have been jailed for a total of 32 years so far, with the longest sentence being three years. The Prime Minister has warned that anyone involved in disorder will 'feel the full force of the law'.

**Anti-migrant rioting and anti-racist response in the UK**
Between 30 July and 5 August, over 40 events were recorded in the UK, with more than half turning violent. Far-right mobs, chanting anti-migrant and Islamophobic slurs, clashed with police and targeted hotels housing migrants, mosques, and police stations. In response, hundreds of anti-racism demonstrators mobilized across the country to protect these locations. Scuffles broke out among demonstrators in several cities, and the violence has already exceeded the annual highs of 2020 and 2021. According to Eshe Nelson, 'Elon Musk Clashes With Keir Starmer Over Riots in Britain,' the outcome of the counter-demonstrators' mobilization and law enforcement action is unclear, but questions remain about managing inter-communal tensions and mitigating the impact of disinformation on social networking platforms.

**UK Riots: 'It is Absolutely Essential that Order is Restored'**
On July 29, a 17-year-old boy armed with a knife stormed a dance class in Southport, England, causing a massacre. Three girls aged 6 to 9 were killed, and ten others, including several children in critical condition, were injured. Rumors quickly spread on social media about the suspect's origin and religion, with him being identified as Muslim. Far-right orchestrated riots broke out in several cities, targeting mosques and hotels housing migrants. The government, facing its first major crisis just weeks after the Labour Party's return to power, promises severe sanctions. Dominic Grieve, former Conservative MP and former Justice Minister, and current president of the Franco-British Society, said, 'It is absolutely essential that order is restored.'

**Pictures show counter-protestors uniting against the far-right**
Hundreds of people gathered on Overbury Street in Liverpool to show solidarity and unity against the far-right, with chants of 'Refugees are welcome here' and 'no justice, no peace, keep the fascists off our streets' echoing through the streets. The gathering, which drew people of all ages, was described as 'carnival-esque' by those at the scene, a stark contrast to the violence seen in Southport and Liverpool following the mass stabbing on Hart Street on July 29. The event was a counter-protest to a potential riot, with a Section 60 dispersal order in place to prevent incidents of disorder and criminality. Despite initial reports of a planned riot, no rioters were seen, and the gathering remained peaceful.

**UK riots: Thousands of police on standby as more violent protests feared**
Thousands of riot police are on standby in the UK as the country remains on high alert for more violent far-right protests. Since the murder of three children on July 29, nightly riots have erupted in English towns and cities, targeting mosques and migrant buildings. The government has deployed 6,000 specialist police to deal with the disorder, which has seen almost 430 people arrested and at least 120 charged. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned that those involved will face 'the full force of the law', including those inciting violence online, and has pledged 'substantive sentencing' before the end of the week. 'We will not tolerate this kind of violence and disorder,' Starmer said. 'Those who are responsible will be brought to justice and will face the consequences.'

**Travelling to the U.K. amid unrest? Canada urges caution in advisory - National | Globalnews.ca**
The Canadian government has issued a travel advisory urging Canadians to exercise 'a high degree of caution' when traveling to the United Kingdom due to ongoing violent demonstrations and unrest. Since July 30, 2024, there have been demonstrations and violent clashes between protesters and police, resulting in assaults, riots, looting, and vandalism. The advisory warns Canadians to avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place and to monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations. British police are gearing up for another night of violence, with 6,000 specially trained officers mobilized to respond to disorder throughout the U.K. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine of the Met said, 'We know about the events planned by hateful and divisive groups across the capital... We will not tolerate this on our streets.' The crisis has been sparked by the spread of misinformation about the identity of the suspect in a stabbing rampage that killed three young girls in Southport.

**British Police on High Alert as Far-Right Groups Plan Protests**
The British police are on high alert on Wednesday (7.08.2024) after online reports of far-right groups planning to hold protests outside 30 immigration centers. According to authorities, over 6,000 riot police are preparing to act if necessary. The protests are a response to the murder of three girls with a knife on July 29 at a summer recreation center in Southport, where eight minors and two adults were also injured. The accused, Axel Rudakubana, 17, was born in Wales to Rwandan parents, but far-right groups reacted after false information spread on social media that he was an asylum seeker. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that the authorities will take 'all necessary measures' to control the new wave of violence. 'The Cobra meeting was to coordinate our response to the disorder and I made it very clear that those involved will feel the full weight of the law,' Starmer said after the emergency meeting. The protests are also planned to target law firms that support immigrants.

**Thug shouted 's***houses' and punched officer in face during violent riots**
Derek Drummond, 58, pleaded guilty to violent disorder and assaulting a police officer during riots in Southport on July 30, 2024. The court heard that Drummond shouted 's***houses' before punching PC Thomas Ball in the face. The riots, which involved around 300 people, were sparked by the deaths of three young girls who were stabbed during a mass attack. Despite the bereaved mother of one of the victims appealing for no violence, the crowd set ablaze police vehicles and hurled bricks at law enforcers. PC Ball was left with injuries including cuts and bruises to his arms. Drummond will be remanded into custody and will be sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court on August 29.

**Six Arrested in Latest Wave of Disturbances in British Cities**
Six people were arrested in the latest wave of disturbances in British cities, where police were attacked with stones and incendiary bombs, bringing the total number of arrests to over 370 since the violence erupted in England and Northern Ireland on July 30. The latest unrest, instigated by far-right groups such as the English Defence League (EDL), occurred in Plymouth, in the southwest of England; the south of Belfast, in Northern Ireland; and Darlington (northern England). In Plymouth, six people were detained for 'public disorder', according to the police, when the authorities tried to keep apart two opposing groups, one against immigration and Islam and the other anti-racist. In Belfast, police were also attacked with stones and incendiary bombs in the Sandy Row area, south of the city, near a supermarket that was set on fire last weekend. In Darlington, protesters, mostly men, caused disturbances when they threw bricks at the police trying to maintain security in the city. Another city where there were riots was Birmingham, in central England, a city with a significant Indian community, where a 'pub' and several cars were damaged by a group of rioters wearing masks. England and Northern Ireland have been experiencing continuous outbreaks of violence for a week, which began after the stabbing of several minors and two adults at a recreational center in Southport, in northwest England, where three girls lost their lives. The perpetrator, Axel Rudakubana, 17, born in Wales to Rwandan parents, has been accused of murdering the girls and attempting to murder ten other people. Far-right groups reacted to the case after false information was spread on social media claiming that Rudakubana was an asylum seeker. In the past week, in addition to the attacks on police, protesters have set fire to trash cans, a building next to a police station, the ground floor of a hotel housing asylum seekers, and attacked mosques and looted some stores.

**UK Riots: 378 Arrested, Prime Minister Warns of 'Banditry'**
In the UK, approximately 378 people have been arrested following the start of mass riots. According to National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) head Gavin Stevens, 'At this point, 378 arrests have been made, and we expect this number to rise as forces continue to identify those responsible. Work is being done around the clock, and those responsible will be held accountable,' he stated. Stevens emphasized that the riots are not a defense of democratic rights, but rather 'unnecessary violence' that is destroying cultural and public centers. He also noted that law enforcement officers have been injured during the protests, with some being hospitalized. The UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, has described the riots as 'banditry' and promised that those involved will regret their actions. The riots began after a 17-year-old boy stabbed three children during a dance lesson in Southport on July 29, killing three and injuring five others. The suspect was immediately arrested and identified. The riots have since spread across the country, with people protesting against the influx of illegal immigrants, despite the suspect being born in Wales to Rwandan parents. On August 1, the London police arrested over 100 people following large-scale riots near the Prime Minister's residence. The next day, protests involving several hundred English nationalists took place in Sunderland. Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, has called on the UK to refrain from using violence against protesters. Elon Musk has also commented on the situation, stating that a civil war in the UK is inevitable.

**UK Prime Minister Vows to End Anti-Immigration Riots with Swift Action**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed to take a firm stance against the ongoing anti-immigration riots. Since four days ago, the UK has been experiencing unprecedented levels of unrest, with new protests and violence erupting over the weekend in response to the stabbing of three children on July 29. Following an emergency meeting at Downing Street, Starmer stated that his 'absolute priority' is to end the riots and ensure 'swift penal sanctions'. He also announced the deployment of a 'reserve army' of specialized police officers to reinforce existing forces. Starmer had previously warned rioters that they 'would regret' participating in the 'chaos' of the past few days. So far, 378 people have been arrested, with the number expected to rise as authorities continue to identify and apprehend those involved. 'Those involved will be brought to justice,' the National Police Chiefs' Council assured. The UK has not seen such widespread riots since 2011, when the death of a young man in Tottenham sparked four nights of unrest and looting, resulting in five fatalities.

**British Interior Minister Warns Rioters: 'They Will Pay' for the Violence**
British Interior Minister Yvette Cooper warned rioters that 'they will pay' for the violence over the weekend in cities across the UK. Cooper expressed her support for the police in pursuing those responsible, stating, 'It's a total shame and there needs to be an accounting. Those individuals involved in the disorder need to know they will pay a price.' Cooper emphasized that the police have her full support in pursuing all offenders, from those who joined the looting at the last minute to some of the protesters who sought to provoke dangerous fires, damage, and criminal violence. Cooper noted that those responsible will face arrest and prosecution. 'It's very important that none of us forget that this minority of thugs does not speak for the UK,' she said. Over 170 people were arrested after police were attacked with stones, bottles, cans, trash cans, and chairs, while far-right groups attacked mosques and a hotel. The anti-immigration protests occurred in cities such as Rotherham, Liverpool, Belfast, Blackburn, Hartlepool, Hull, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, and Sunderland. Cooper stated, 'There's no excuse for that kind of behavior, throwing bricks at police officers, attacking mosques, looting shops.' She also emphasized that social media should take responsibility for spreading false information. Although these groups have been organizing protests for weeks, tensions increased after the July 29 attack with a knife at a recreation center in Southport, in which three girls died and eight minors and two adults were injured. The 17-year-old perpetrator, Axel Rudakubana, who was born in Wales to Rwandan parents, has been charged with the murder of the three girls and the attempted murder of the other ten people, but the far-right groups' anger increased after false information was spread on social media that the attacker was an asylum seeker who had crossed the Channel in a patera.

**2024 United Kingdom Riots**
The 2024 United Kingdom Riots refer to a series of Islamophobic, racially charged, anti-immigration, and far-right riots that took place in the UK in late July and early August. The riots were sparked by false information about a knife attack at a children's yoga and dance workshop in Southport, which was spread online by high-profile far-right figures, including Andrew Tate and ex-boxer Anthony Fowler. The misinformation claimed that the attacker was a Muslim immigrant, but was later revealed to be false. The riots resulted in injuries to over 50 police officers, three police dogs, and numerous arrests. The violence spread to other parts of England and Northern Ireland, with further riots erupting in Sunderland, Liverpool, and Middlesbrough. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the violence, stating that those who 'hijacked the vigil for the victims' insulted the grieving community and would face the full force of the law. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper initiated a criminal investigation and considered designating the English Defence League as a proscribed terrorist organisation. Nigel Farage faced criticism for suggesting that the truth was being withheld, with accusations from a former counter-terrorism police officer and Jo Cox's widower of inciting violence and conspiracy theories.

**British MP Calls for Emergency Parliamentary Session Amid Widespread Riots**
British MP and Conservative Party leadership candidate Priti Patel has called for an emergency parliamentary session due to the widespread riots that erupted after a stabbing attack on children in English Southport. According to foreign media, far-right protests are gaining momentum in the UK following the deaths of three children in the stabbing attack. The Times reported that at least 35 protests are expected over the weekend. The British Parliament has gone on summer recess and will return to work on September 2. In emergency situations, the government can request the Speaker of the House of Commons to summon MPs during the recess. Patel called the violent protests in British cities 'unacceptable' and urged all politicians, regardless of party, to condemn the situation. Last night, riots involving several hundred far-right groups erupted in English Sunderland, with protesters setting fire to the central police station and throwing beer barrels and stones at police. Three police officers were hospitalized, and eight people were arrested. Earlier this week, protests in several cities also turned violent, with dozens of police officers injured and numerous arrests made. The Merseyside police force reported a stabbing attack on children in the Southport town on July 29. Three children died, and several children and two adults were taken to the hospital in critical condition. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with the murder of three people, attempted murder of ten others, and possession of a cold weapon. Police confirmed that they do not link the attack to terrorism. According to police, the attack occurred during a children's dance and yoga class inspired by American singer Taylor Swift. The reaction of Southport, London, and other city residents to the attack has led to protests that turned into clashes with police and widespread riots due to the spread of unconfirmed information that the suspect is a refugee.

**Grenoble Shop Owners Prepare for Potential Unrest Ahead of Election Results**
As the second round of the 2024 legislative elections approaches, authorities in Grenoble are concerned about potential unrest and looting. To prepare, several shop owners are taking measures to protect their stores. One year after the riots that followed the death of Nahel, the memory of the destruction and pillaging is still fresh in the minds of many. On Sunday, July 7, the second and final round of the elections will take place. In the city center, wooden boards are being placed over store windows to prevent damage. David Gendrolini, a security expert, has been hired to install the boards. Some shop owners are not too worried, but others are taking precautions to avoid potential damage. Melanie Giaconella, a saleswoman, explains, 'We're a bit worried about being robbed and having our stores looted. We've done this as a precaution, in case there are any disturbances after the election results are announced, given what happened last year during the riots.' The memory of the 2023 riots is still traumatic for many shop owners, who were affected by the destruction and looting. The French Minister of the Interior, Gérard Darmanin, has announced a large-scale security deployment across the country, with over 30,000 police officers to be mobilized.

**France deploys extra 30,000 cops including armed units amid election riot fears after Macron activist has jaw broken**
France is deploying an additional 30,000 police officers, including armed units, to maintain order amid election-related unrest after the National Rally's victory in the first round of the parliamentary election. The move comes after violent clashes between left-wing protesters and police in Paris, with a Macron activist's jaw broken in an attack. The deployment aims to counter further violence and alleviate cross-party tensions. The National Rally is leading in the election, with the left-wing alliance New Popular Front in second place, and Macron's centrist coalition in third. The election's second round will take place on July 7, with the outcome determining the fate of the EU's second-largest economy.

**Warning large July 4 celebrations in US may be ‘attractive targets' for attacks**
The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have issued bulletins warning that large-scale Fourth of July celebrations in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Las Vegas may be 'attractive targets' for attackers. The threats can take various forms, including mass casualty events, petty crime, and espionage. Despite the warnings, authorities advise Americans to enjoy the holiday while being vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to the police. 'The message from the police departments is always go about your business but keep your head on the swivel a little bit,' said senior investigative correspondent Aaron Katersky of ABC News.

**Fear of New Riots if National Rally Wins Legislative Elections**
The death of Nahel, a 17-year-old, sparked riots in Nanterre, with masked and black-clad protesters using fireworks to target police and gendarmes. The police tried to extinguish the burning cars, trash cans, and municipal buildings. The images of a policeman shooting a young man after a refusal to obey orders on June 27, 2023, have gone viral. The tensions spread to other cities in Île-de-France and the provinces. The unrest eventually subsided on July 5, but the damage was significant, with over 1 billion euros in damages and over 1,000 people injured, including 782 law enforcement agents. A year later, the situation is still explosive, and the context is different. The National Rally, which won the European elections, could benefit from the early legislative elections to gain a majority in the National Assembly and access to power. The Paris police prefect, Laurent Nunez, fears potential public disturbances after the first and second rounds of voting. Some experts believe that localized or global riots could occur, but they would not be related to manipulation by the extreme left. Instead, they would be driven by a minority of young men in priority neighborhoods who feel marginalized and justified in their criminal activities by a strong sense of racism against institutions, society, and the police.
