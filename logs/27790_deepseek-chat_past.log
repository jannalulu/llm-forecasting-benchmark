### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
As of today (2024-08-29), there are no publicly available predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus specifically addressing whether OpenAI will announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024. This means I must rely on the available evidence and reasoning to make an informed forecast.

---

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate Analysis**: How often does OpenAI announce major models within a given timeframe?
2. **Current Evidence**: What do recent announcements, statements, and news articles indicate about GPT-5's development and potential announcement timeline?
3. **Distinctive Features**: Are there unique factors in this situation that might accelerate or delay the announcement?

---

### Step 3: Base Rate Analysis (Outside View)
OpenAI has historically released major models at intervals of approximately 1-2 years:
- GPT-3: Announced in June 2020.
- GPT-4: Announced in March 2023.
- GPT-4o: Announced in May 2024.

Given this pattern, the next major model (GPT-5) might be expected around late 2024 to early 2025. However, the base rate alone is insufficient, as it doesn't account for the specific context of GPT-5's development.

---

### Step 4: Current Evidence (Inside View)
1. **Statements from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman**:
   - Altman has repeatedly emphasized that GPT-5 will represent a "significant leap" over GPT-4 but has also stated that there is "still much work to be done."
   - He has compared GPT-5's development to the early days of the iPhone, suggesting that while it may have imperfections, it will still be useful.

2. **DevDay 2024 Announcements**:
   - OpenAI has explicitly stated that GPT-5 will **not** be announced at DevDay 2024, which is scheduled for October 1, 2024, in San Francisco. This suggests that the announcement is unlikely to occur before October.

3. **Training and Testing Status**:
   - Multiple sources indicate that GPT-5 is still in the training and testing phase, with no official release date announced. Some reports suggest a late 2024 or early 2025 release.

4. **Recent Developments**:
   - OpenAI has been focusing on incremental improvements, such as fine-tuning GPT-4o and launching new features like Voice Mode. This suggests that the company is prioritizing stability and refinement over rushing a new model.

---

### Step 5: Distinctive Features
1. **Competitive Pressure**:
   - OpenAI faces increasing competition from other AI companies, which might incentivize an earlier announcement. However, the company has historically prioritized quality and safety over speed.

2. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Reports indicate that OpenAI is facing challenges in finding high-quality training data and is spending billions on model development. These constraints could delay the release.

3. **Safety and Ethical Concerns**:
   - OpenAI has emphasized the importance of safety testing and iterative deployment, which could slow down the announcement process.

---

### Step 6: Balancing Evidence
- **Arguments for a Higher Estimate (Yes)**:
  - Sam Altman's statements suggest significant progress on GPT-5, and the company has a history of delivering on ambitious timelines.
  - Competitive pressures might push OpenAI to announce GPT-5 sooner rather than later.

- **Arguments for a Lower Estimate (No)**:
  - OpenAI has explicitly ruled out a GPT-5 announcement at DevDay 2024, which is the next major event before September 30, 2024.
  - GPT-5 is still in the training and testing phase, and the company has emphasized the need for further work.
  - Recent focus on incremental improvements (e.g., GPT-4o fine-tuning) suggests that OpenAI is not yet ready to announce a major new model.

---

### Step 7: Error Balancing
- **Risk of Over-Adjusting**: Overweighting Altman's optimistic statements could lead to an overestimate.
- **Risk of Under-Adjusting**: Ignoring the explicit DevDay 2024 announcement could lead to an underestimate.

---

### Step 8: Final Forecast
Given the evidence, the most likely scenario is that OpenAI will **not** announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024. The explicit statement about DevDay 2024, combined with the ongoing training and testing phase, strongly suggests that the announcement will occur later.

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.**
