INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with tension. Superforecasters gather around a table, reviewing data.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, the Yankees fell short. Orioles clinched it. Our models had it at 45.67% for the Yankees to win more games.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Right. Up to September 10, both teams were neck and neck at 82 wins. But the Orioles pulled ahead in the final stretch. Our model's accuracy holds.

FORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
People doubted the Orioles. But look at them now. The Yankees just couldn't keep up after September.

FORECASTER 4  
(scanning a report)  
No surprises here. Our Brier scores reflect the precision. It was always a close call, but the data never lies.

They exchange satisfied glances, their predictions verified once again.

FORECASTER 1  
(to the group)  
Let's update the models for next season. The future's always a game of probabilities.

JAMES  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, there it is. The Yankees edged out the Orioles by just one game.

SARAH  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 52.75%. Close, but we nailed it. 

MICHAEL  
(smirking)  
I remember some skepticism back on September 10th. Both teams were neck and neck at 82 wins.

JAMES  
True, but we factored in the Yankees' late-season schedule strength. 

SARAH  
And the Orioles’ injury list. It was all there in the data.

MICHAEL  
(smiling)  
Another win for the models. 

They all nod, content with their prediction prowess. The screen fades to black, showing the final standings once more.
