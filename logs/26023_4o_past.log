To make an accurate forecast regarding the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I will analyze the relevant data and correspondence of past events related to this issue.

**1. Base Rate Analysis:** 
Historically, diplomatic expulsions and recalls happen with nations experiencing significant diplomatic tensions, such as accusations of espionage, violations of laws, or major disagreements. The Philippines and China have ongoing tensions over the South China Sea, which has led to frequent diplomatic protests and incidents at sea. 

**2. Current Contextual Analysis:**
Recent tensions between the Philippines and China are high, underlined by a series of diplomatic protests over actions in the South China Sea and specific allegations of wiretapping activities by Chinese diplomats. These tensions have led to multiple calls from Philippine government officials to expel Chinese diplomats. While reciprocal diplomatic sanctions are relatively rare, the ongoing provocations might increase their likelihood. 

**3. Evaluation of Recent Developments:**
- **May 2024:** Reports about wiretapping led to calls by prominent Philippine officials to declare Chinese diplomats 'persona non grata'. The Foreign Affairs Department is investigating the issue, but no conclusive action has been reported yet.
- **June and July 2024:** A series of confrontations and demands for expulsions following more incidents at sea testify to increasing pressures but have not yet resulted in expulsions or recalls. Diplomatic channels and talks have been ongoing as well, showing attempts to resolve these tensions peacefully.
- **Triangulation with Other Forecasts:** I do not have access to specific forecasts such as that of FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus for direct comparison, which restrains a thorough triangulated forecast based on current projections.

**4. Internal and External Pressures:**
Both the Philippines and China have strong economic ties, and despite aggressive events, there’s indication that de-escalation efforts are ongoing, partially due to external pressures. A significant percentage of Filipino citizens favor a diplomatic solution, which may influence the decision-makers.

**5. Conclusion:**
Considering the historical backdrop, current events, and potential for both resolution and conflict escalation, the probability of diplomatic expulsions/recalls is moderate. While there’s significant tension and reason to expect severe diplomatic actions, ongoing diplomatic efforts and economic dependencies contribute to the balancing force.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To make a forecast on whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I will assess the relevant factors contributing to tensions between the two countries.

**Base Rates and Historical Context:**
1. Diplomatic incidents involving the Philippines and China in the past have led to tensions, but expulsions or recalls are relatively rare due to the economic ties and the strategic significance of maintaining diplomatic relations.
2. Historically, diplomatic expulsions often occur in response to severe breaches such as espionage or actions deemed highly provocative. The Philippines and China's current issues, while tense, have thus far focused more on disputes related to the South China Sea, economic dependencies, and diplomatic maneuvers.

**Prediction Evaluation:**
1. **Evidence of Increased Tensions:**
   - Escalating disputes over maritime incidents in the South China Sea and incidents of alleged wiretapping by Chinese diplomats serve as catalysts for potential expulsions.
   - Calls from Philippine Senators and officials for expulsions due to wiretapping incidents indicates that this is a serious consideration.

2. **Evidence of Mitigating Factors:**
   - The emphasis on diplomatic solutions, as shown by the restraint expressed by Filipino officials, and ongoing dialogue aimed at de-escalation, even amid provocations, suggests a preference to resolve tensions without diplomatic expulsions.
   - Economic interdependencies between the two countries and the potential impact on trade relations serve as a deterrent against taking such action.

3. **Current Developments:**
   - Diplomatic efforts and meetings continue despite ongoing disputes, with both governments expressing interests in reducing tensions.
   - Recent bilateral dialogues suggest room for diplomatic solutions, though substantial differences remain.

**Probability Assessment:**
Given the above factors, while there is ongoing tension and calls for expulsions, the presence of continued diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalation and the historical rarity of such actions among countries with strong economic ties make the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls moderate but not high. It reflects an ongoing balancing act between addressing national security concerns and preserving essential international relations. 

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To make a forecast on whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I'll break down the analysis based on the information available and historical context.

1. **Historical Context and Base Rates:**
   - Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between countries, particularly ones with an active territorial dispute, like the Philippines and China over the South China Sea, are not uncommon, but are significant events. Such actions are usually a last resort and follow a clear escalation in tensions or direct incidents.
   - Historically, diplomatic expulsions or recalls tend to happen in situations where there are documented violations of diplomatic protocols, repeated provocations, or a serious breakdown in diplomatic relations.

2. **Current Context:**
   - There have been recent calls and significant tensions over suspected wiretapping and disinformation campaigns, which have led some Philippine officials and leaders to suggest or demand diplomatic expulsions of Chinese diplomats. There is a parliamentary investigation and continuous protest by high-level officials, indicating serious diplomatic tensions.
   - On the other hand, there are ongoing diplomatic engagements and dialogues aiming to de-escalate the tensions, with some progress noted in mutual talks and cooperation to manage maritime disputes. There are also indications of high-level negotiations and dialogues between the two countries, emphasizing diplomatic engagement over rash actions.

3. **Analysis of Recent Events:**
   - The recent incidents, including allegations of wiretapping and mounting tensions in the South China Sea, suggest a higher probability of diplomatic actions compared to a baseline period of normal diplomatic relations. However, both countries have also shown restraint and a preference for dialogue over drastic measures like expulsions or recalls, evidenced by ongoing diplomatic meetings and mechanisms for conflict resolution.
   - Public sentiment in the Philippines favors diplomatic solutions over military engagement, and the leadership has expressed a commitment to resolving differences through dialogue, which may mitigate the immediate need for expulsions.

4. **Balancing Evidence:**
   - The evidence of escalated tensions and serious allegations (e.g., wiretapping) increases the probability of diplomatic expulsions.
   - Concurrently, active diplomatic processes and mutual economic dependencies (China is a significant trade partner) caution against sudden diplomatic recalls or expulsions, suggesting that while tensions are high, they may not yet reach the threshold for expulsion.

5. **Superforecasting considerations:**
   - Base rate for diplomatic expulsions in situations with high but managed tensions.
   - Potential for new developments could sway decisions significantly before September 2024, including changes in leadership policies, further incidents, or external international pressures.

Given these considerations, the probability range for diplomatic expulsions or recalls happening by September 30, 2024, is determined with an emphasis on striking a balance between recognizing the seriousness of ongoing tensions and the diplomatic efforts aimed at resolution.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To forecast the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, we need to assess historical reference classes, the current context between the two nations, and potential future developments.

**Reference Class and Historical Context:**
- Historically, diplomatic expulsions are generally rare and indicative of severe bilateral tensions. They often occur when one country wishes to send a strong signal of discontent or in response to violations such as espionage or direct threats to national security.
- Instances of such diplomatic actions vary depending on the nations involved and the severity of incidents, but they are not commonplace in regions where economic ties are also significant, as is the case between the Philippines and China.

**Current Context and Distinctive Features:**
- Recent tensions between the Philippines and China regarding the South China Sea have escalated due to incidents such as the alleged wiretapping by Chinese diplomats and aggressive actions at sea by Chinese forces. Calls for expulsion by Filipino officials reflect heightened tensions.
- Despite these pressures, the Philippines has a significant economic reliance on China, placing constraints on how far the country might escalate diplomatically.
- Diplomatic efforts and dialogue seem to continue concurrently, as seen with recent consultations and meetings to de-escalate tensions, suggesting an ongoing preference for diplomacy over expulsion or recall.

**Evidence and Arguments:**
- **For a Higher Probability of Diplomatic Action:** 
  - Repeated calls by Filipino officials, including senators and security advisers, for the expulsion of Chinese diplomats underline the gravity perceived by the Philippines regarding the alleged espionage activities.
  - Ongoing provocations and disputes over maritime boundaries may further exacerbate relations.
  
- **For a Lower Probability of Diplomatic Action:** 
  - The Philippines' continued engagement in diplomatic dialogues and meetings to manage tensions indicate an emphasis on resolving disputes without resorting to drastic measures like expulsions.
  - Economic interdependence and potential economic repercussions make expulsion or recall a less attractive option for both nations.

Balancing these factors, we can assert that while the tensions are high, the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls is moderated by economic and diplomatic entanglements which prioritize continued dialogue and de-escalation.

**Conclusion:**
By taking into account the historical rarity of diplomatic expulsions, enhanced recent tensions, and the active diplomatic engagements aimed at resolution, the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls seems to be moderate. However, given ongoing provocations and political pressures within the Philippines, there remains a significant enough chance to warrant a moderate probability estimate.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, we need to consider both historical patterns and the current context.

**Historical Context and Base Rates:**
Diplomatic expulsions or recalls are generally rare and typically occur in reaction to significant events, such as espionage allegations or severe diplomatic incidents. These actions are often seen as measures of last resort due to potential repercussions on international relations. While the historical frequency of such events globally can be informative, the dynamics specific to the Philippines-China relationship need careful attention.

**Recent Developments:**
1. There is significant ongoing tension between the two nations, driven primarily by territorial disputes in the South China Sea. 
2. Several Philippine officials have expressed calls for expelling Chinese diplomats over allegations such as wiretapping and other aggressive actions by China. 
3. There is active parliamentary pressure and discussions over these issues, reflected in calls from Philippine senators and national security advisers for stronger actions, including the expulsion of Chinese diplomats.
4. Meanwhile, dialogues and diplomatic talks have been ongoing to manage and de-escalate tensions.

**Current Context:**
- There is clear diplomatic friction, with multiple incidents and diplomatic protests logged by the Philippines against China.
- There is a strong undercurrent of nationalism in the Philippines pushing for assertive action against perceived Chinese aggression. 
- However, there continues to be engagement in diplomatic dialogues and negotiation frameworks, such as the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism, highlighting an interest in de-escalative measures.

**Forecast Considerations:**
- The interplay between escalating tensions due to recent incidents and the historical practice of resolving disputes diplomatically makes this forecasting scenario multifaceted.
- The likely path seems to be a continued balancing act between public domestic political pressure in the Philippines for action and practical diplomatic engagements to manage relations with China.
- Strain in relations may not immediately lead to expulsions unless a new severe incident occurs. However, the pressure and discussions around expulsions signal potential movement in that direction.

Given the ongoing tensions but also continuous diplomatic engagements, the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring before September 30, 2024, is moderately high but not overwhelming. Taking into account the historical base rates of such events and current news developments, we need to assess the probability conservatively yet acknowledge the heightening risk.

**My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 65.00%, but 52.50% being the most likely. Probability: 52.50%.**

To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, we need to consider both historical patterns and the current context.

**Historical Context and Base Rates:**
Diplomatic expulsions or recalls are generally rare and typically occur in reaction to significant events, such as espionage allegations or severe diplomatic incidents. These actions are often seen as measures of last resort due to potential repercussions on international relations. While the historical frequency of such events globally can be informative, the dynamics specific to the Philippines-China relationship need careful attention.

**Recent Developments:**
1. There is significant ongoing tension between the two nations, driven primarily by territorial disputes in the South China Sea. 
2. Several Philippine officials have expressed calls for expelling Chinese diplomats over allegations such as wiretapping and other aggressive actions by China. 
3. There is active parliamentary pressure and discussions over these issues, reflected in calls from Philippine senators and national security advisers for stronger actions, including the expulsion of Chinese diplomats.
4. Meanwhile, dialogues and diplomatic talks have been ongoing to manage and de-escalate tensions.

**Current Context:**
- There is clear diplomatic friction, with multiple incidents and diplomatic protests logged by the Philippines against China.
- There is a strong undercurrent of nationalism in the Philippines pushing for assertive action against perceived Chinese aggression. 
- However, there continues to be engagement in diplomatic dialogues and negotiation frameworks, such as the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism, highlighting an interest in de-escalative measures.

**Forecast Considerations:**
- The interplay between escalating tensions due to recent incidents and the historical practice of resolving disputes diplomatically makes this forecasting scenario multifaceted.
- The likely path seems to be a continued balancing act between public domestic political pressure in the Philippines for action and practical diplomatic engagements to manage relations with China.
- Strain in relations may not immediately lead to expulsions unless a new severe incident occurs. However, the pressure and discussions around expulsions signal potential movement in that direction.
