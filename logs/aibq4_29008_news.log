**S&P 500 Continues to Climb, Reaching New Historical Highs**
The S&P 500 has continued its upward trend, reaching new historical highs, despite concerns about the upcoming election and a 20% increase in the index this year. The index has gained 45 points in 2024, with the DOW Jones Industrial Average also reaching new highs. The market has been driven by a combination of factors, including a decline in inflation, a decrease in unemployment, and a rise in corporate profits. The S&P 500 has also seen a significant increase in its forward price-to-earnings ratio, reaching 21.8, which is higher than the average for the past 50 years. However, the market's valuation has been increasing as the index has become less cyclical and more quality-oriented, with investors becoming less sensitive to valuation and the Fed becoming more transparent. FactSet projects that earnings for the third quarter will exceed reduced expectations, setting up a potential continuation of the market's upward trend. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has been unusually low, reflecting a strong demand for protection against severe market movements in the next 30 days. This is likely due to the anticipation of a close election and potential escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Despite this, the market is not showing signs of fear, with investors remaining bullish and positioning themselves for further gains.

**S&P 500 grinds higher to further record highs, finding little to fear in October**
The S&P 500 has continued its upward trend, reaching new record highs, despite initial concerns about a potential recession and rising inflation. The index has gained 21.9% for the year, with a price/earnings ratio above 21 and a Cboe Volatility Index hovering near 21. This is the best performance in the calendar since 1997 and the best presidential-election year ever. The market has been driven by a soft economic landing, a widespread belief in a post-election year-end rally, and a nagging notion about seasonal hazards. The equal-weighted S&P 500 has gained 9.5% since June 30, more than triple the Nasdaq 100's rise. However, the rally has flattened over the past three months, with more downside tests and a less-generous risk-reward bargain. The forward P/E of 21.8 on the index is undeniably elevated, but valuation has little to say about returns from here to the visible horizon. FactSet projects third-quarter earnings will easily surpass recently reduced forecasts to settle around a 7% annual growth. The near-21 VIX is the most glaring anomaly given the rest of the setup, reflecting anticipation of a close election and possible escalation of Middle East conflict. This should not be mistaken for broadly fearful sentiment, but rather a well-owned market that is perhaps not fully trusted.

**Stock Market Today: Dow, S&P 500 score record closes after Powell remarks**
According to a report from Cboe Global Markets, an unusual pattern in the stock market suggests traders are buying protection for their portfolios from a potential market selloff in October. The Cboe Volatility Index and the VVIX, which measures demand for options contracts tied to the VIX, rose last week even as the S&P 500 trended higher. Ed Tom, senior director of derivatives-market intelligence at Cboe, said, 'Taken together, last week's VIX/ VVIX dynamics are suggestive of increased precaution as traders position their books for the seasonally volatile month of October.' This is because election-year Octobers tend to see more market volatility than nonelection years, according to CFRA's Sam Stovall. As a result, traders are buying put options tied to the S&P 500 and call options tied to the VIX, which could protect their portfolios from losses or a spike in implied volatility.

**Stock Market Today: Dow ends down nearly 100 points, S&P 500 edges up ahead of CPI inflation report**
According to a chart by Fundstrat, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the 'fear gauge,' tends to peak in October, with data showing it has reached its election-year peak 63% of the time since 1928. Historically, the VIX has also peaked in October regardless of whether it's an election year, often coinciding with the S&P 500's calendar-year lows. While it may seem unlikely, history suggests it's worth considering the possibility of the VIX surpassing its August closing peak of 38, and potentially hedging against further market volatility.

**Stocks extend losses in late-morning trading; Wall Street's 'fear gauge' surges**
U.S. stocks continued their decline in late-morning trading on Monday, with the Dow dropping over 350 points, or 0.8%, to around 42,914. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were each off around 0.5%, according to FactSet data. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged 6.4% to 19.19, its best day in two weeks, indicating a period of higher volatility. As a general rule, a VIX reading below 20 suggests a relatively stable stock-market environment, while a reading above 20 is indicative of increased volatility.

**Key Takeaways for Investing in the Stock Market from October 14 to 18, 2024**
The S&P 500 has reached its 45th historical high of the year, with the best year performance of the century so far. However, this is the first time that a high level of volatility has accompanied a historical high. The VIX has closed above 20 every day this week, indicating a high risk environment. In the first half of the year, technology leaders dominated the S&P 500's behavior, but since June 30, the S&P 500 Equal Weight has risen 9.5%, more than triple the Nasdaq 100. The S&P 500 expects a 4.1% growth in earnings for the third quarter, which would be the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Given that most S&P 500 companies report real earnings above estimates, the index is likely to report a 7% growth in earnings for the third quarter. In fact, the real growth rate has exceeded the estimated growth rate at the end of the quarter in 37 of the last 40 quarters of the S&P 500. The only exceptions were the first quarter of 2020, the third quarter of 2022, and the fourth quarter of 2022. On the other hand, it seems that the results between the 'Magnificent 7' and the rest of the 493 companies in the index may be balancing out. While the 'Magnificent 7' earnings per share may grow less than in previous quarters, the situation is the opposite for the rest of the companies, which should balance out that decline. With low inflation, interest rate cuts, expected income growth, sustained economic growth, and the general belief that a soft landing is occurring, a unique market has been produced: the S&P 500 has risen 21% this year, its price-to-earnings ratio is above 21, and the Cboe volatility index is near 21. Emerging markets may be one of the best investment opportunities in the coming months. The possible weakness of the dollar, interest rate cuts by the FED and regional central banks, Chinese stimuli that drive commodity prices, and low valuations are positive arguments that support this idea. One of the main reasons to defend the FED's interest rate cuts in the current situation is to try to reduce the housing-related part of inflation. However, despite these cuts, mortgage rates have risen because they are more related to the 10-year bond yield. The yield on longer-term bonds has risen in recent days due to good macroeconomic data, with the 10-year bond yield rising above 4% in the last week.

**Here's why Wall Street's 'fear gauge' is flashing with stocks at record highs**
Despite stocks reaching record highs, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), also known as Wall Street's 'fear gauge', has risen. This is unusual as higher stock prices typically put pressure on the VIX. However, investors are purchasing protection for their portfolios due to risks on the horizon, such as the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election and the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. According to Matt Cerminaro, a data research associate at Ritholtz Wealth Management, the VIX has been above 20 with stocks near record highs during more than 130 trading days since 1990. In the past, this pattern has been bullish for stocks, with the S&P 500 higher 12 months later more than 90% of the time, with an average gain of 16%.

**Mid-Morning Look: October 11, 2024**
The S&P 500 index reached a record high of 5,800 for the first time, driven by a rally in banks after strong earnings from JPM and WFC. The sector's growth, along with other major averages, has led to a fifth consecutive winning week. Despite mixed producer price index (PPI) data and weaker Michigan Consumer sentiment, the stock market remains optimistic, with ten out of eleven S&P sectors trading higher. Financials, industrials, REITs, and Materials are leading the gains, while U.S. listed China stocks are moving to highs ahead of a fiscal stimulus update from Beijing. Even Bitcoin is up over 3% nearing $62K, as investors adopt a 'risk-on' mentality heading into the weekend and earnings season. The CBOE Volatility index (VIX) is down but still holding above 20, indicating no broad concern despite various global uncertainties.

Wall Street closed the day and week with healthy gains, with the Dow and S&P 500 setting new record highs and all three major indexes (Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq) achieving a fifth consecutive weekly win. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) remained above 20 for the fifth-straight day, despite a loss for the session. Next week will see the start of earnings season, with major companies such as Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson set to report. Meanwhile, oil and gold both posted comfortable weekly gains, with oil rising 1.6% for the week and gold climbing 0.4%.

**How the 2024 presidential election could weigh on the S&P 500**
As the 2024 presidential election approaches, investors are bracing for market volatility. According to Anchor Madison Mills, the S&P 500's historical performance during election years suggests that the market may be confused about how to price volatility. Marvin Lowe notes that the market tends to focus on macro and monetary policy, rather than political and fiscal factors. The CBOE's volatility index, the VIX, is expected to spike ahead of the election, but some experts, like Kevin Gordon, believe that a contested election result could lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty, potentially causing the market to misprice volatility. However, Gordon also notes that the market is currently in a bull market, and the Federal Reserve's actions are likely to drive the market to continue reaching new all-time highs, regardless of the election outcome.

**US Presidential Election: Harris Leads, Markets Expect Volatility**
The US presidential election is just four weeks away, and the polls have shifted significantly since Donald Trump was leading before Joe Biden dropped out. Now, Kamala Harris is leading the Democratic campaign, with a modest but consistent lead over Trump in the polls. However, it's far from clear who will win, as Trump has regained ground in the swing states and the race is now neck-and-neck. A historical rule of thumb suggests that the incumbent party wins when the S&P 500 index has risen in the three months leading up to the election. In the 24 elections since 1928, this has been the case 20 times, or 92% of the time. The S&P 500 has risen 8.6% since August 6, making Harris the likely winner. However, the markets are now entering the most volatile month of the election year, October, which has historically been a bad month for investors. The uncertainty is rising, and beleggers are adjusting their portfolios in anticipation of the election. The CBOE VIX-index, a measure of volatility, has risen from 14 to 22 in a short time. The market is expecting potential swings in November, and volatility may persist for a few weeks after the election. However, fundamental factors such as the state of the economy, interest rates, inflation, and corporate earnings remain more important than the election outcome. The influence of presidential elections on the markets is short-term and speculative, and the long-term impact on investor returns is minimal. The last time the Dow Jones failed to predict the election outcome was in 1968, when the incumbent president dropped out of the race and the vice-president took over.

**Stock market volatility ahead of presidential elections typically starts picking up right now**
Market volatility is expected to increase as the US presidential election approaches, according to Wolfe Research. Technical strategist Rob Ginsberg's data shows that the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) tends to spike into early November, with a historical drop in the index as the month progresses. Ginsberg said, 'Friday's favorable economic data helped to bolster action for now, but we see it more so as pushing off the inevitable.' He predicts a 3-4% correction in the S & P 500, citing momentum rolling over and several sectors seeing healthy pullbacks. The VIX has already shown signs of high volatility, jumping above 20 last week due to concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. The S & P 500 lost 0.3% on Monday, giving back some of Friday's gains.

**Wall Street futures down on rates rethink, geopolitical risks**
U.S. stock index futures dipped on Monday as investors recalibrated their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, amid heightened geopolitical tensions and ahead of key inflation data, policymaker comments, and third-quarter earnings. The Cboe Volatility index rose to 21.17, its highest level in four weeks, while U.S. Treasury yields rallied, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes crossing 4% for the first time in two months. Analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman said, 'USD and Treasury yields are consolidating near multi-week highs triggered by Friday's outstanding U.S. September jobs report.' Markets will continue to 'wax and wane' with a focus on U.S. economic outperformance, military tension in the Middle East, and risk-on dynamics. Shares of Pfizer rose 3.3% after a report that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a roughly $1 billion stake in the drug giant. While markets continue to fine tune its expectations for interest rate cuts, most market watchers remain optimistic about the underlying strength of the economy and outlook for equities. Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 year-end S&P 500 target to 6,000 from 5,600, and also lowered its odds of a U.S. economic recession to 15% from 20%.

**Morning Preview: October 07, 2024**
U.S. stock futures are looking lower to start the week as Treasury yields rise and the CBOE Volatility index (VIX) spikes. Last week, the S&P 500 gained 0.23%, the Nasdaq climbed 0.10%, and the Dow climbed 0.09%, erasing weekly losses in the final 30-minutes of trading. The jump late Friday came after strong monthly jobs data, with nonfarm payrolls rising +254K jobs and unemployment falling to 4.1%. However, traders slashed their bets on the pace of future Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts after September US employment data blew past estimates. The chance of a half-point rate cut in November was priced out, with the contract showing 25 basis points of easing now expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average registered a record closing high at 42,352.75, while the S&P 500 energy index was up 6.87% for the week, its biggest weekly gain since October 2022. The 10-year yield was up about 2 basis points to 4%, its highest since early August. In Asian markets, the Nikkei Index jumped 697 points to 39,332, while the Hang Seng Index gained 362 points to 23,099. In Europe, the German DAX is down -38 points to 19,082, while the FTSE 100 is up about 30 points to 8,312.

**Goldman Analyst Predicts S&P 500 to Rise by 5% by End of Year**
Scott Rabner, a technical strategist at Goldman Sachs Group, predicts that the S&P 500 index may reach 6000 points by the end of the year, which would be a 5% increase from its current value. Rabner expects a rally on the US stock market to begin in late October, but before that, there will be three weeks of increased volatility. Significant fluctuations in the index may be caused by hedge funds reducing their positions in stocks before the US presidential election and by the rebalancing of portfolios by index funds before the end of the financial year on October 31. The Cboe Volatility Index, also known as the 'Wall Street Fear Index', has already risen by 30% over the last five sessions. 'This suggests that volatility is no longer following the game plan, it has become a player on the field,' Rabner said. The S&P 500 index has grown by almost 20% since the beginning of the year and on Monday, it set a new historical high for the 42nd time this year.

**US stocks hit two-week low as caution reigns over West Asia tensions**
US stocks hit a two-week low on Wednesday as investors priced in a possible escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East following Iran's attack on Israel. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged their biggest one-day drops in nearly a month, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 28.72 points. Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at InfraCap, said, 'Sentiment is dominated by the risk of escalating conflict in the Middle East and there is a lack of information on how strong the Israeli response is going to be.' The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's fear gauge, hovered near a three-week high. However, US private payrolls increased more than expected in September, and the odds of a quarter-percentage-point rate reduction at the Fed's November meeting are at 65.7 per cent. Tesla lost 4.7 per cent after reporting third-quarter vehicle deliveries below estimates, while Humana tanked 21 per cent after it said it expects the total number of members enrolled in its top-rated Medicare Advantage plans to decrease for 2025.

**Stock Market News for Oct 2, 2024**
The stock market ended lower on Tuesday as investors reviewed the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data and geopolitical tensions drove crude oil prices higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.4% or 173.18 points to close at 42,156.97, while the S&P 500 lost 0.9% or 53.73 points to end at 5,708.75.

The U.S. labor market showed resilience in August, with job openings surpassing expectations, rising to over 8 million, an increase of 329,000 from July and surpassing the consensus estimate of 7.7 million. However, the manufacturing index was unchanged at 47.2% in September, marking a decline in activity for three consecutive months. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 15.1% to 19.26. A total of 13.16 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 11.98 billion.

**US stock market ‘on edge’ as Middle East tensions flare, traders jolted**
US stocks are experiencing a decline after hitting an all-time high, with the S&P 500 Index falling as much as 1.4% due to rising Middle East tensions. The Cboe Volatility Index, also known as the VIX, has jumped to its highest level in nearly a month. Market strategists, including Callie Cox of Ritholtz Wealth Management, attribute the decline to the geopolitical situation, saying 'Middle East tensions clearly have markets on edge.' Some analysts, such as Luca Paolini of Pictet Asset Management, believe that while the situation is uncertain, it will not derail the bull market. Others, like Sarah Hunt of Alpine Woods Capital Investors, are concerned about the potential impact on growth. The market is also reacting to the possibility of a nationwide port strike and the threat of ballistic missile attacks on Israel.

**A New Month, Another Bout of Stock Market Volatility**
The stock market experienced another bout of volatility at the start of October, making it the third consecutive month to start with a selloff. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite ended 1.5% lower, while oil prices surged more than 5% amid concerns of a deeper conflict in the Middle East. Investors flocked to traditional safe havens like gold and Treasurys, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) jumping as much as 24%. The market's reaction was reminiscent of August and September's selloffs, which were sparked by jobs data and earnings reports. However, stocks ultimately rebounded to finish each month at or near record highs, and investors are hoping for a similar outcome this time around.

US stocks are in retreat on Tuesday, a day after hitting an all-time high, due to rising tensions in the Middle East. The S&P 500 Index fell as much as 1.4%, with the information technology sector being a major drag. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped to its highest level in nearly a month. According to reports, Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel within the next 12 hours, causing traders to be 'on edge'.

**Stock Market Today: Dow, S&P 500 score record closes after Powell remarks**
According to a report from Cboe Global Markets, an unusual pattern in the stock market suggests traders are buying protection for their portfolios from a potential market selloff in October. The Cboe Volatility Index and the VVIX, which measures demand for options contracts tied to the VIX, rose last week even as the S&P 500 trended higher. Ed Tom, senior director of derivatives-market intelligence at Cboe, said, 'Taken together, last week's VIX/ VVIX dynamics are suggestive of increased precaution as traders position their books for the seasonally volatile month of October.' This is because election-year Octobers tend to see more market volatility than nonelection years, according to CFRA's Sam Stovall. As a result, traders are buying put options tied to the S&P 500 and call options tied to the VIX, which could protect their portfolios from losses or a spike in implied volatility.

**VIX Signals Potential Market Volatility Spike, Sevens Report Warns**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is showing signs of a possible rise in market volatility, according to the Sevens Report. The VIX has formed a series of higher lows, a pattern not seen since late 2021, which led to notable market instability. Additionally, the VIX futures curve is in backwardation, where the October contract is trading at a premium to the November contract, suggesting traders are preparing for a significant increase in market volatility. The Sevens Report advises investors to monitor three key developments: a rise in the VIX above 24, normalization of the VIX futures curve, or a growing premium between the October and November contracts. If the premium widens, it may indicate increasing risk of a market selloff that could send the S&P 500 back to its early September levels or revisit early August lows.

**Señales del 'índice del miedo': ¿Se avecina otro repunte de la volatilidad?**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the 'fear index', is showing signs of another possible surge in market volatility, according to the latest report from Sevens. Despite falling from over 60 points in early August to around 15 points, Sevens warns that ignoring the VIX could be a mistake, as the index is now showing an upward trend, forming a series of higher lows, a pattern not seen since the end of 2021, a period that caused significant market turmoil. Additionally, Sevens Research notes the unusual temporal structure of VIX futures. 'The VIX futures curve is in backwardation,' explain the analysts, meaning that the October contract is trading at a premium to the November contract. According to Sevens, this is an unusual occurrence and suggests that derivatives traders are positioning themselves for a significant increase in volatility in the coming weeks. Sevens advises being aware of three key events: an increase in the VIX index above the level of 24, a normalization of the VIX futures curve (which would be bullish for stocks), or an expansion of the premium between the October and November contracts. If the latter occurs, 'it would indicate growing risks of a sell-off that could return the S&P 500 to its lows of early September, or even early August,' concludes Sevens. In the current scenario, the stock market offers unique opportunities if investors make the right decisions. And to maximize these opportunities, InvestingPro positions itself as an indispensable tool.

**VIX on the Rise: A Potential Market Turbulence Ahead?**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as the 'fear gauge', is expected to rise again, according to the latest Sevens Report. After reaching a high of 60 in early August, the index fell to around 15 points. Despite this decline, analysts warned against ignoring the VIX, citing a series of higher lows, similar to those seen at the end of 2021, which led to significant market turbulence. The VIX futures curve is also in a state of 'backwardation', meaning that the October contract is being traded at a premium to the November contract. This inversion of the curve is rare and suggests that derivatives traders expect a significant increase in volatility in the coming weeks. Sevens Research identifies three key factors to watch: a rise in the VIX above 24, normalization of the VIX futures curve, or an increase in the premium between the October and November contracts. If the latter occurs, it could indicate a heightened risk of a sell-off that could push the S&P 500 to its lows in early September or even August, according to the experts.

**Is the VIX signaling another volatility spike is coming?**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the 'fear gauge,' is showing signs of another potential spike in market volatility, according to the Sevens Report. Despite a recent decline, the VIX is trending higher, forming a series of higher lows, a pattern not seen since late 2021, which led to significant market turmoil. The report highlights the unusual term structure of VIX futures, with the October contract trading at a premium to the November contract, suggesting derivatives traders are positioning for a significant increase in volatility in the coming weeks. Sevens advises watching for three key developments: a rise in the VIX index above 24, normalization of the VIX futures curve, or a widening premium between the October and November contracts. If the latter occurs, it 'would indicate rising risks of a selloff that could send the S&P 500 back to the early September, or even early August lows,' concluded Sevens.

**S&P 500 Falls 3%, VIX Surges to 38 Amid Market Turmoil**
On August 5, 2024, the financial world experienced significant fluctuations, with the S&P 500 index falling by 3% and the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) surging to 38, its highest level in years. This marked the 25th largest single-day decline in the past five years and the 33rd largest in the past decade. The VIX's jump to 38 represents one of the largest surges in recent history, reflecting heightened market anxiety. Kai Zeng, director of the research team at tastylive, noted that elevated VIX levels generally mean that investors are more apprehensive, and asset prices are likely to be more unpredictable. The premium for options, especially those for indices, increased substantially, presenting opportunities for traders to secure richer returns. 'The correlation—or the degree to which different asset prices move together—tends to rise when the VIX is above 30%', Zeng said. 'Right now, we're seeing this increased correlation, meaning that diversifying investments becomes more challenging.'

**Forget September. This Is the Stock Market's Most Volatile Month.**
October is the most volatile month for the stock market, with a 34% higher average daily return standard deviation compared to other months. While the 1929 and 1987 crashes are often cited as the cause of October's volatility, research suggests that pre-election uncertainty and a tax provision in the 1986 Tax Reform Act are also significant contributors. According to Scott Baker, Nicholas Bloom, and Steven Davis, the Economic Policy Uncertainty index in October of presidential election years has been 15% higher than in other months. Additionally, Scott Gibson notes that the tax provision required mutual funds to distribute 98% of their net capital gains by October 31, leading to 'heavy portfolio repositioning' and heightened volatility. However, Gibson expects this effect to be somewhat muted this year due to the strong stock market performance. As a result, it's likely that next month will be at least as volatile as the average October. Long-term investors should be aware of this seasonal tendency, while traders may consider funds that profit from a spike in the Cboe Volatility Index, such as the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF or the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures ETN.

**Wall Street Week Ahead: Investor focus turns to data, election, earnings after Fed cut**
The US stock market, which has seen a significant rally, is expected to face a challenging period ahead due to a combination of economic data, political uncertainty, and corporate earnings. The S&P 500 index has hit its first closing all-time high in two months after the Federal Reserve's 50-basis point rate cut, but strategists warn that the rocky period could continue until the November 5 election. Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said, 'We're entering that period where seasonality has been a bit less favorable.' The second half of September is historically the weakest two-week period for the S&P 500, and October has seen an average 0.45% decline in presidential years. Volatility tends to pick up in October in election years, with the Cboe Market Volatility index rising to an average level of 25. Investors are looking for data to support expectations of a 'soft landing' for the economy, and the coming week includes reports on manufacturing, consumer confidence, and durable goods. The rally in stocks has pushed up valuations, and investors said that puts a greater burden on corporate earnings to be strong in order to support stock gains. Third-quarter reporting season kicks off next month, with S&P 500 earnings expected to have climbed 5.4% from the prior year.

The US stock market is expected to face a challenging period due to a combination of economic data, political uncertainty, and corporate earnings.

The US stock market is expected to face a challenging period ahead, with a gauntlet of economic data, political uncertainty, and corporate earnings tests.

**Volatility looms as election season heats up. Fortify your portfolio against autumn market shocks**
The Federal Reserve's interest rate cut has lifted the S & P 500 above 5,700 for the first time, but Goldman Sachs warns of potential volatility ahead. Analyst Arun Prakash notes that the CBOE Volatility Index has increased 6% on average from September to October over the past 30+ years, and there are upside risks to current VIX levels due to seasonality and upcoming macro/micro catalysts. To protect portfolios from sharp losses, investors should understand their comfort with risk and ensure their asset allocation reflects their long-term goals. Recalibrating for risk involves using tax loss harvesting and direct indexing, where investors hold individual stocks to mirror an index. Bonds are also a good buy, offering attractive yields and the ability to offset stocks' volatility. Options, such as covered calls and buffer ETFs, can also be used to mitigate volatility. 'Election years tend to be a little more volatile, and this year has been no exception,' said Rafia Hasan, chief investment officer of Perigon Wealth Management. 'You saw this big drawdown on August 5, and after a couple of weeks the markets recovered, but over that period when markets were down, there were opportunities to harvest losses in stocks.' Investors should be aware of the wash sale rule and avoid buying 'substantially similar' securities within 30 days before or after selling. 'Think of what a rate cut could do to fixed income in terms of capital gains,' said Andrew Herzog, certified financial planner at The Watchman Group. 'Move a little of your wealth into something that could get a boost off of that.'

**Trump vs. Harris: U.S. stock market faces rising risks amid economic uncertainty and 2024 election**
The US stock market is facing rising risks due to economic uncertainty, shifting Federal Reserve policy, and the upcoming presidential election. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has surged to 20, a significant rise from its 2024 average of 14.8, as investors weigh the market implications of policy proposals from candidates. Matt Thompson, co-portfolio manager at Little Harbor Advisors, noted, 'The market is essentially saying, we know risk is elevated, but … we don't know what the problem is going to be.' Despite the S&P 500 being up nearly 15% this year, the market remains precarious. Investors are seeking alternative strategies to diversify their portfolios, including prop trading firms and stock analysis apps, to protect against stock market swings and capture short-term gains in volatile markets.

**Harris Vs. Trump: US Stocks Face Growing Risks Amid Economic Uncertainty And Upcoming Presidential Election**
US stocks are facing growing risks due to economic uncertainty, changes in Federal Reserve policy, and the upcoming presidential election. The Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX) has risen to around 20, a significant increase from its 2024 average of 14.8, as investors consider the market implications of policy proposals from candidates. Matt Thompson, co-portfolio manager at Little Harbor Advisors, stated, 'The market is essentially saying, we know risk is elevated, but... we don't know what the problem is going to be.' Despite the S&P 500 being up nearly 15% this year, the market remains uncertain. Investors are advised to stay hedged for the next three to six months due to possible volatility from unpleasant economic surprises and geopolitical factors. A CNBC survey found that 67% of investors believe former President Donald Trump would be more beneficial for stocks, based on historical performance. Trump also claimed that if Kamala Harris wins the election, there will be a 1929-like market crash, causing anxiety among investors.

**Stock Market Today: Dow ends down nearly 100 points, S&P 500 edges up ahead of CPI inflation report**
According to a chart by Fundstrat, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the 'fear gauge,' tends to peak in October, with data showing it has reached its election-year peak 63% of the time since 1928. Historically, the VIX has also peaked in October regardless of whether it's an election year, often coinciding with the S&P 500's calendar-year lows. While it may seem unlikely, history suggests it's worth considering the possibility of the VIX surpassing its August closing peak of 38, and potentially hedging against further market volatility.

**More Turbulent Days Ahead in the Market, According to Charts**
According to the charts, more turbulent days are expected in the market in this third quarter. The reason is that the market has been experiencing a hard bearish trend, characterized by lower and lower lows, high inflation, and historic rate hikes. However, this is the opposite of what is happening now: the S&P 500 has been marking higher and higher highs, inflation has fallen significantly since its peak, and we are about to experience our first rate cut. However, beneath the surface, something is happening that we haven't seen in two years: the S&P 500 has had 12 absolute 1% movements in the last 24 days of trading, from July 1 (8 up, 4 down). This is 50% of the time, which is a lot. The CBOE volatility index, VIX, also rose 30% on Tuesday, its second movement of at least 30% since November 26, 2021. If volatility continues to increase during the rest of this shortened week, the VIX could register another week of +40%. The last time the VIX rose by at least +40% during a calendar week was during the week that ended on August 2, 2024. In that case, we provided a study to CappThesis clients, which showed that the week following a 40% movement tended to be much calmer. However, when the VIX exploded in the past, there has been a tendency to greater volatility in the future. The question now is how much more we can expect in the typically volatile months of autumn that we have just entered. With the market entering a historically volatile period, with technology being heavily hit, the first rate cut about to occur, and the presidential elections just a few weeks away, there are high probabilities of seeing additional volatility from now on. The good news is that the S&P 500 has created a considerable cushion since it broke the large bullish pattern in January. This has allowed it to withstand two episodes of higher volatility already in 2024: from March to April and then again from July to early August. If it can do so without suffering too much damage, the index could then be ready to take advantage of the historically bullish seasonality that appears in the fourth quarter, even during election years.

**There are more turbulent market days ahead this third quarter, according to the charts**
The S & P 500 has been making higher highs, with inflation dropping and a rate cut on the horizon, but under the surface, there has been a significant increase in volatility, with 12 1% moves in the last 24 trading days, which is a lot compared to the 51% of the time seen in 2022. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) spiked 30% on Tuesday, and could log another +40% week, which has historically been followed by a calmer week. However, the market is entering a historically volatile period, with tech getting hit hard, the first rate cut about to happen, and the presidential election a few weeks after that, suggesting that additional volatility is likely. The silver lining is that the S & P 500 has built a sizable cushion since breaking out from the large bullish pattern in January, which could allow it to endure more volatility and then take advantage of the bullish seasonality in the fourth quarter.

**Wall Street Tumbles, Yen Surges, Oil Sinks Below $70, VIX Spikes As Traders Brace For Volatile Month: What's Driving Markets Tuesday?**
The first trading session of September saw a widespread selloff across risk assets, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.6% and small-cap stocks declining 2.7%. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged 20%, reflecting heightened anxiety among investors. The yen jumped 0.8% against the dollar after hawkish comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda overnight. Despite the yen's strength, the U.S. dollar gained 0.2% against a basket of other currencies. U.S. manufacturing data for August showed a deeper-than-expected contraction, with the employment index indicating mounting challenges ahead of a crucial jobs report due later in the week. Treasury yields fell as the weak manufacturing data fueled speculation of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Oil prices plunged more than 4%, marking the steepest one-day decline since October 2023, driven by concerns over weaker demand and expectations of increased OPEC supply next month.
