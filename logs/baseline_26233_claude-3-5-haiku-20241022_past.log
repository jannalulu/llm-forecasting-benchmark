Let me break this down systematically:

1. Box Office Comparison:
- Deadpool (2016) opening: $132,434,639
- The Wolverine (2013) opening: $53,113,752
- Combined opening: $185,548,391

2. Key Considerations:
- Deadpool & Wolverine is a highly anticipated crossover film
- Both previous characters have strong fan bases
- Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are popular actors
- Marvel/X-Men films have strong franchise recognition
- Post-pandemic theatrical recovery
- Strong marketing campaign

3. Positive Factors Suggesting Higher Opening:
- Nostalgia factor
- Successful previous Deadpool films
- Wolverine's long-standing popularity
- Crossover appeal
- Positive early buzz

4. Potential Restraining Factors:
- Superhero fatigue
- Increased streaming competition
- Higher ticket prices might impact total numbers

5. Comparative Analysis:
- Previous combined opening sets a high baseline
- Strong likelihood of exceeding that baseline

After careful analysis and weighing all factors, I assess a strong probability of exceeding the previous combined opening.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 92.30%, but 88.40% being the most likely. Probability: 88.40%.
