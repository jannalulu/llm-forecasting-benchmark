[Scene: A dimly lit office at the University of Pennsylvania, October 3rd, 2024. Philip Tetlock and Nate Silver are reviewing data on their monitors.]

TETLOCK: [removing his glasses] Well, Nate, our models were spot-on again about the Seattle air quality situation.

SILVER: [nodding] Given the early July data point and the unusually wet summer in the Pacific Northwest, our 8.75% prediction was remarkably precise.

TETLOCK: The historical pattern suggested we'd see more days above 150 AQI, but those unexpected August rains really dampened the wildfire season.

SILVER: [pulling up a chart] Exactly. Even with that July 5th spike to 166, the region only recorded 2 days above 150 AQI in Q3. The wetter-than-average conditions from our climate models played out perfectly.

TETLOCK: [smiling] Another win for superforecasting. When we made that 8.75% call on August 1st, some thought we were being too conservative.

[Both return to analyzing their screens as evening light fades]

INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - EVENING - OCTOBER 3, 2024

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, surrounded by monitors displaying air quality data maps.

TETLOCK
(studying the final data)
Eight days above 150 AQI. Right in our target range.

SILVER
Our models had it at 73.42%. The July 5th smoke event was just the beginning. Looking back at those news reports from early August, the drought conditions and early fire season in British Columbia were clear indicators.

TETLOCK
The historical pattern was crucial - averaging 4.7 bad air days per year over the past decade, but with those spike years of 11 days in 2017 and 2022. Climate patterns suggested 2024 would mirror those severe seasons.

SILVER
(nodding)
The Canadian wildfire season was particularly telling. When we made that forecast in August, the conditions were nearly identical to 2022.

FADE OUT.

TETLOCK: [removing his glasses] Well, Nate, our models were spot on again about the Seattle air quality situation.

SILVER: [nodding] Indeed. Given the early July spike we saw and the historical patterns, our models had it at 42.37%.

TETLOCK: The single day above 150 in early July had me concerned, but the unusually wet August and September really helped keep the numbers down.

SILVER: [pulling up a chart] Looking back, the historical data was crucial. The average over the past decade was about 4.7 days per Q3, but with significant variance. The wetter-than-usual summer this year really changed the dynamics.

TETLOCK: [standing] Another win for superforecasting. Though I must admit, climate predictions are getting trickier with these shifting patterns.
