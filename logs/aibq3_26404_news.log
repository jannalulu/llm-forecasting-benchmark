**As Election Buzz Swirls Around Biden And Harris, DEA Comment Period Ends: What's Next For Cannabis Rescheduling?**
The public comment period for the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has ended. The DEA received over 37,000 comments, with 75.9% supporting the move. The final ruling is expected around August 20, 2024, and will become effective 30 days after publication. The Biden administration is expected to prioritize concluding the rescheduling process before January 20, 2025, but potential delays are possible due to the large volume of comments. The decision on whether to hold Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearings is pending, which could extend the timeline. Alternatively, the DOJ might expedite the process by forgoing hearings and directly finalizing the rule.

**This Huge Catalyst Could Drive Cannabis Stocks Much Higher Soon**
Cannabis stocks are undervalued and may experience a significant increase if the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of Justice (DOJ) reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This change would allow cannabis companies to deduct operating expenses against revenue, resulting in a significant cash windfall. The timeline for this change is uncertain, but publication of a final rule by October is possible. However, there is a potential pitfall in the form of an internal administrative law judge hearing, which could add years to the process. Experts believe that this is unlikely to happen, especially if the goal is to get the change done before the election.

**Cannabis Reclassification: Timeline and Impact**
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has initiated the process to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act. This reclassification would allow licensed cannabis businesses to see higher after-tax income and access to services from credit card companies and other financial institutions. Schedule III drugs are considered to have accepted medicinal value with a relatively low potential for abuse. The reclassification would also ease federal regulations, allowing cannabis businesses to deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses on federal tax returns, resulting in annual savings of hundreds of thousands to millions for some businesses. Additionally, banks and credit card companies would be less likely to be penalized for working with cannabis businesses, making it easier for them to access loans and capital.

**Feds To Weigh 40,000 Marijuana Rescheduling Comments From Governors, Lawmakers, Health Experts And Advocates**
The federal government received over 40,000 comments on its proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The comments came from governors, lawmakers, medical professionals, advocacy groups, and others. Some comments praised the proposal, while others criticized it, saying it does not go far enough to address the state-federal conflict between marijuana laws and criminal justice matters. The comments also highlighted the need for federal guidance on issues such as interstate commerce, research, and access to cannabinoid medicines.

**Hilgers leads coalition of attorneys general opposing rescheduling of marijuana**
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers led a coalition of 11 states in submitting a public comment letter opposing the Biden Administration's proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III on the federal Controlled Substances Act. Hilgers argued that the move would be a significant step towards fully legalizing marijuana at the federal level and would provide a tax break for marijuana retailers. Nebraska's 40-page comment letter outlined several reasons why the rescheduling is unlawful and ill-advised, including ignoring science, treaty obligations, and the law. Nebraska law makes marijuana illegal in all circumstances.

**Lawmakers Attempt To Save Rescheduling, Hemp From Republican Ax**
Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Nancy Mace, and Morgan McGarvey introduced amendments to block efforts to thwart rescheduling and ban consumable hemp products. The amendments aim to prevent the Drug Enforcement Agency from implementing a change in the Controlled Substances Act, even if it decides to move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III. Mace, who has been an advocate for drug policy reform, said, 'We want to make sure rescheduling happens.' Tlaib and McGarvey's amendments aim to stop the committee from interfering with the Department of Justice's ability to reschedule cannabis. The hemp industry is also facing challenges from GOP lawmakers, who have approved language that would ban the sale of consumable hemp products with quantifiable amounts of THC or other cannabinoids.

**Senators Push VA To Create Medical Marijuana â€˜Standard Of Care' As Rescheduling Process Finishes**
A group of nine US senators, led by Sen. Jeff Merkley, are urging the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a standard of care for medical marijuana and allow VA doctors to recommend cannabis to patients. The senators' letter comes as the Biden administration is proposing to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. The senators argue that giving veterans access to medical cannabis could help offset the significant rates of opioid overdose deaths within the population. They also suggest that the VA should provide education on the endocannabinoid system and the benefits and risks of medical cannabis use to its practitioners.

**Gov. Beshear asks DEA to ease restrictions on marijuana**
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has written a letter to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) administrator, Anne Milgram, expressing his support for rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. This move would allow patients to have an alternative to deadly opioids and continued access to safe products, and would also help communities reduce crime and illicit drug use. Beshear believes that rescheduling would create fair markets for cannabis businesses and provide opportunities for research. He notes that the medical marijuana law he signed, which passed with bipartisan support, takes effect in January 2025 and the state is currently taking license applications for all aspects of the business. The Governor also highlights the opioid epidemic, stating that nationally, opioid use killed 80,000 Americans in 2022, while marijuana use alone killed zero Americans.

**Biden declares: it's time to repair injustices on marijuana!**
On July 17, 2024, US President Joe Biden expressed his determination to ensure that no one is arrested solely for using or possessing marijuana. Biden stated that it is time to 'correct these historical errors'. Many US states have already legalized marijuana for recreational and medicinal use, with varying limits on possession and rules for home cultivation. On May 16, 2024, the US Department of Justice proposed considering marijuana as a lower-risk drug and allowing its medical use nationwide. The suggestion was initially made by the Biden administration in April. The proposal suggests reclassifying marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act. Currently, marijuana is considered a high-potential drug for abuse. Biden had previously spoken out on the issue of marijuana. In May, he shared a video on X, stating that the new measure would benefit thousands of Americans. 'Many lives have been destroyed due to the failed approach to marijuana. I am committed to correcting these errors,' he said.

Safe Harbor Financial, a leader in facilitating banking, payments, and financial services to the regulated cannabis industry, has submitted comments to the Justice Department regarding the proposed rule to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. The reclassification is expected to alleviate tax burdens imposed by Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code and allow cannabis businesses to deduct expenses more akin to standard business operations. Safe Harbor Financial's Chief Legal Officer, Donnie Emmi, stated that the reclassification does not make marijuana legal, but it will create a more favorable business environment for the company and its clients, enabling them to expand their services, reduce operational risks, and capitalize on new market opportunities.

**Could The Supreme Court Be The Last Chance For Marijuana Legalization In America?**
The Supreme Court's recent ruling on the Chevron Oil company may have implications for marijuana legalization in America. The cannabis industry is looking to the Supreme Court as a potential avenue for full marijuana legalization, as rescheduling cannabis to a Schedule 3 drug may not be possible. A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Massachusetts cannabis businesses seeking to block the federal government from enforcing marijuana prohibition, citing a lack of likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. Despite the setback, industry leaders and advocacy groups plan to continue fighting for federal marijuana reform through legislative and legal channels. The classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) remains a contentious point, with advocates arguing that it is outdated and does not reflect the current scientific understanding of marijuana's medical benefits.

**IRS Confirms Marijuana's Status and Section 280E Tax Limitations**
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has reminded taxpayers that marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 280E. Despite ongoing confusion and attempts by some taxpayers to seek refunds related to Section 280E, the law has not changed, and taxpayers who file amended returns are not entitled to refunds or payments. Section 280E disallows deductions or credits for businesses involved in the illegal trafficking of controlled substances, but allows businesses to subtract the cost of goods sold from their gross receipts when calculating taxable income. The IRS has issued this reminder to ensure marijuana businesses and their tax professionals understand the current legal landscape and avoid filing invalid amended returns.

**Does Rescheduling Cannabis Make it Eligible for Interstate Commerce?**
The rescheduling of cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug does not automatically make it eligible for interstate commerce. Even if rescheduled, marijuana would still be subject to provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Controlled Substances Act. To be lawfully introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, marijuana needs FDA approval, which is unclear. The FDA has approved some scheduled drugs for interstate commerce, but it is uncertain if medical or recreational marijuana would be approved. Many believe the FDA will approve interstate sales or not enforce laws prohibiting cross-border sales. The reclassification process is ongoing, with a rulemaking and public comment process, and potential challenges. If the process stretches beyond the 2024 presidential election, it is unclear how a new administration would handle the subject of reclassification.

**GOP Congressional Committee Tries To Block Cannabis Rescheduling, Louisiana Gov. Drops Jail For Weed Paraphernalia, Hawai'i Gov's Expungement**
A Republican-controlled congressional committee has introduced a spending bill that includes a provision to block the rescheduling of cannabis. This comes after President Biden announced plans to move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would also amend a rider protecting medical marijuana states from federal interference, allowing for higher penalties for sales near schools and parks. Additionally, the USDA has funded the National Industrial Hemp Council with $740,000 to promote American hemp exports. In Louisiana, Governor Jeff Landry has signed a bill eliminating jail time for possession of cannabis paraphernalia. In Minnesota, over 700 people have applied for social equity cannabis business licenses in the first 24 hours, and in Hawaii, a bill is expected to become law to expunge non-conviction cannabis arrest records in Hawaii County.

**Richard Feldman column: What will marijuana reclassification to Schedule III do?**
The Biden administration has announced a formal rulemaking process to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III, a less restrictive category. This change is based on the 2023 HHS report, which concluded that marijuana has legitimate medical benefits and relatively low toxicity. The reclassification would allow for more research into marijuana's benefits and risks, and would federally legalize marijuana prescribing in states that have legalized medical marijuana. The change would also reflect the evolving public acceptance of marijuana and the tremendous support for legalization. The public will have a 60-day comment period to provide input on the proposed change, and the DEA will have final authority to approve or reject the reclassification.

**Commentary  Rescheduling cannabis is progress, but it won't solve critical issues**
The rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III in the Controlled Substance Act is a step forward, but it won't solve the critical issues of accessibility, affordability, and safety for patients. As a physician who integrates medical cannabis into his patients' treatments, the author welcomes this change but notes that it is not a medicine under U.S. law. The FDA has not approved cannabis as a medicine, and patients will still obtain their medical cannabis outside federally regulated systems. The author urges Congress to take a comprehensive approach to medical cannabis policy reform, including creating a new schedule for cannabis and cannabinoids and a new agency to oversee the new schedule, to ensure that all patients have access to medical cannabis regardless of where they live.

**Dr. Richard Feldman: US poised to clear the haze on marijuana's benefits, risks**
The US government is poised to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, recognizing its medical benefits and relatively low toxicity. The change would reflect the majority of Americans' support for legalized marijuana, with 88% favoring legalization for medical or recreational use. The reclassification would also facilitate research into marijuana's benefits and risks, which has been hindered by current regulations. The Biden administration has announced a formal rulemaking process, which will include a 60-day public-comment period and may require a public hearing and Congressional review before finalization.

**Colorado And Maryland Governors Want Marijuana Rescheduling Finalized ASAP Amid Reports Of DEA Resistance**
The governors of Colorado and Maryland, Jared Polis and Wes Moore, respectively, are urging the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to finalize the Biden administration's proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as quickly as possible. The governors commended the Biden administration for taking a data-driven approach to the issue, but emphasized that there is still more work to be done to address the consequences of criminalization. They also highlighted the need for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation to protect banks that work with state-legal cannabis businesses. The DEA's position on rescheduling has been the subject of rumors, with some reports suggesting that agency officials may oppose the proposed change.

**A Coalition of 18 Attorneys General Request Public Hearing on DEA Rescheduling of Marijuana**
A coalition of 18 Attorneys General, led by Attorney General Mike Hilgers, has requested a public hearing on the federal government's proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Federal Controlled Substances Act. The proposed rescheduling would likely lead to an expansion of the marijuana industry in states where recreational marijuana is legal. The letter emphasizes the need for a public hearing to consider the potential harmful impacts of rescheduling and to ensure the DEA has access to the best available information from subject matter experts.

**Former DEA Leaders Push Agency To Hold Public Hearing On Marijuana Rescheduling Proposal**
A group of former DEA leaders is asking the agency to hold a public hearing on the proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The group, consisting of six former DEA administrators and three former acting administrators, argues that the move is 'likely the most consequential rulemaking DEA has ever attempted' and that a hearing is necessary to consider the proposal's impact on public safety and international treaty obligations. The request comes as the public comment period on the rescheduling proposal is set to close, with many opponents of the move requesting a hearing to delay or block the change. Meanwhile, reform advocates are urging the DEA to move forward with the rescheduling, citing the need to address the ongoing drug overdose crisis and the potential benefits of rescheduling for the cannabis industry.

**Cannabis Reclassification: Timeline and Impact**
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has initiated the process to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act. This reclassification would allow licensed cannabis businesses to see higher after-tax income and access to services from credit card companies and other financial institutions. Schedule III drugs are considered to have accepted medicinal value with a relatively low potential for abuse. The reclassification would also ease federal regulations, allowing cannabis businesses to deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses on federal tax returns, resulting in annual savings of hundreds of thousands to millions for some businesses. Additionally, banks and credit card companies would be less likely to be penalized for working with cannabis businesses, making it easier for them to access loans and capital.

**Trump's Former AG Bill Barr Backs Prohibitionist Group Urging DEA To Delay Marijuana Rescheduling**
Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), a cannabis prohibitionist group, is urging the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to extend the public comment period for President Joe Biden's proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. SAM, represented by the law firm founded by former Attorney General Bill Barr, claims that the proposal is the most significant relaxation of restrictions on a psychoactive substance in the history of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and requires more time for stakeholders to provide feedback. The group argues that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) overlooked important data on adolescent cognitive development and that the proposal relies on a novel test for determining a substance's accepted medical use. SAM also raises legal concerns about the proposal's impact on international treaties involving the U.S.

**"Follow the Science" Except When it Comes to Marijuana**
President Joe Biden announced that his administration approved downgrading the seriousness of marijuana, despite overwhelming evidence that it is an addictive drug with no medical benefit and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a formal rulemaking process to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. The proposal was published in the Federal Register, and the public is encouraged to submit comments on the proposed rescheduling of marijuana. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is particularly interested in gathering information on the medical uses of marijuana, data regarding public safety as relates to marijuana use, and other relevant information to help inform its decision. Many experts, including Dr. Karl Benzio, a Board Certified Psychiatrist, have expressed concerns about the potential dangers of marijuana, including its addictive nature, lack of medical benefit, and potential for abuse. The move has been criticized by some, including Kevin Sabet, a three-time White House drug policy adviser, who argues that it fails to recognize the growing body of scientific and medical data that shows today's marijuana is more addictive and more harmful than that of previous generations. The move has also been criticized for its potential to benefit the cannabis industry, including companies such as Trulieve, Cresco, Canopy Growth, and Cronos, and their allies Big Tobacco and Wall Street. The article concludes by warning about the potential dangers of ignoring the evidence and God's warnings, and the need for people to be sober-minded and watchful.

**Marijuana Rescheduling Opponents Slam FDA Process, Saying It Relied On â€˜Very Bad Studies'**
The leaders of the prohibitionist group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) are criticizing the government's plan to reschedule marijuana to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, saying it is based on 'very bad studies' and is a 'politically motivated move'. They are considering all legal options to challenge the proposal and are encouraging supporters to oppose the pending change. SAM's president, Kevin Sabet, argued that the government's review process was flawed and that the rescheduling would allow the cannabis sector to expand, leading to more problematic use and increased dangers on roadways.

**Beginning of the end of cannabis prohibition**
The US Justice Department is proposing to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act, recognizing its medicinal use. This is a major step forward, but still falls short of fully legalizing cannabis. The move acknowledges the benefits of cannabis and the experiences of millions of Americans who use it, but fails to harmonize federal policy with state laws. The change delegitimizes claims that cannabis poses unique harms to health and is not useful for treating chronic pain and other ailments. While the politicization of cannabis won't end overnight, this decision marks the beginning of the end of cannabis prohibition.

**DEA Formally Cancels Hearing On Proposed Psychedelics Ban Amid Constitutional Challenge To Review Process**
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has canceled a scheduled hearing on its proposed ban of two psychedelic compounds, DOI and DOC, due to a constitutional challenge to the scheduling process. The hearing was to allow the agency to receive expert input on the classification of the compounds as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Panacea Plant Sciences (PPS) filed a complaint and request for injunctive relief against DEA in federal court, arguing that the administrative hearing process is unconstitutional. CEO David Heldreth stated that PPS is glad the hearing is canceled and expects to win in federal court and force the rule to be withdrawn. The hearing has been stayed until the federal court renders a decision in the legal challenge.

**Federally reclassifying weed means marijuana businesses will flourish in KY. Here's why**
President Joe Biden has announced plans to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act, which would decrease the tax burden on cannabis businesses operating in states where marijuana is legal. This change would allow businesses to deduct their business expenses on federal tax filings, potentially reducing their taxes by 40-70%. The reclassification would also make it easier for banks and credit card companies to work with cannabis businesses and increase the availability of marijuana for approved federal research. Kentucky, which is set to launch its medical cannabis program in early 2025, would benefit from this change.

**Keys to understanding Biden's proposed marijuana reclassification**
President Joe Biden has recommended reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, citing its potential medical uses and low potential for dependence. The proposal aims to relax federal restrictions on cannabis, making it easier for states to regulate it, while still considering it a controlled substance. However, it does not legalize marijuana in all states, and those in prison for cannabis-related crimes will not be released. The reclassification is expected to facilitate medical research and increase awareness of its potential benefits, potentially leading to more states legalizing it for medical or recreational use.

**High Time for Cannabis Businesses to Start Tax Planning**
The Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) recent recommendation to reschedule cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III controlled substance will enable cannabis companies to escape the federal tax deductions and credits prohibition embodied in Internal Revenue Code Section 280E. This change will provide tax planning opportunities for the cannabis industry, including the availability of deductions and credits, and the allocation of expenses to cost of goods sold. Cannabis businesses should prepare now to take advantage of these benefits.

**Paid or Incurred: Marijuana Rescheduling, Taxes, and Section 280E**
The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has proposed rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, which would make Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code inapplicable to cannabis businesses. This change would allow businesses to deduct expenses related to marijuana, such as wages, rent, and utilities. The effective date of rescheduling is unknown, but businesses can take steps now to prepare. They can consider postponing paying or incurring expenses subject to the Section 280E disallowance until the effective date of rescheduling. Additionally, businesses may want to file a protective refund claim to preserve their rights to obtain refunds for taxes previously paid under 280E.

**High Stakes: HHS Shakes Things Up on Marijuana Scheduling and DEA Abides**
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug. This would allow for more research and potential medical uses of marijuana. The rescheduling would not legalize marijuana for recreational use, but would make it easier for researchers to study and develop new products. The proposal has been met with praise from some lawmakers, who are calling for further federal reform. The DEA will accept comments on the proposal until June 22, 2024, and a public hearing may be held. The rescheduling process is expected to take several months to complete.

**White House Drug Czar Condemns â€˜Failed Policies' Of Marijuana Prohibition And Says Rescheduling Will Speed Up Legal Drug Development**
The White House drug czar, Rahul Gupta, has condemned the 'failed policies' of marijuana prohibition, saying it has 'destroyed lives' and led to the incarceration of many people. He believes that rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act will allow for more research and development of cannabis-based medications. Gupta also stated that the reform will not legalize cannabis, but will remove certain research barriers and allow for the development of new products that could help with chronic conditions like cancer and chronic pain. However, some experts have criticized Gupta's oversimplification of the issue and his claim that rescheduling will address the 'racial disparity' in cannabis enforcement.

**From Prohibition To Protection: Could Marijuana's Reclassification Unleash A Surge In Trademark Filings?**
The proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) could significantly impact cannabis trademark law. If implemented, this change could allow for the registration of cannabis-related trademarks, potentially leading to a surge in trademark filings. However, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may still use the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) provisions as a barrier. The rescheduling process, which includes a formal notice of proposed rulemaking and public comments, could take months to years and may face legal challenges.

**Rescheduling Madness: Key Takeaways from the Proposed Rule to Reschedule Marijuana under the CSA**
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has proposed a rule to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This change would bring celebrated changes to the state-sanctioned cannabis industries, but would not necessarily bring them into compliance with federal law. The DEA's notice of proposed rulemaking (NRPM) notes that the rescheduling would not change the criminal prohibitions of the CSA, and that participants in the marijuana industry would continue to operate in a gray area. The rescheduling is based on the findings of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) scientific and medical evaluation, which concluded that marijuana has a potential for abuse less than substances in Schedules I and II, has a currently accepted medical use, and may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence. The Attorney General has delegated scheduling authority to the DEA Administrator, but the NPRM makes clear that it is the Attorney General who chose to exercise his authority to propose a rescheduling rule. The DEA has not yet made up its mind, and litigation is inevitable following the dramatic shift in federal marijuana control. One area ripe for litigation is HHS' third, independent test created specifically to determine whether marijuana has a currently accepted medical use. Additionally, the Farm Bill is due for renewal in September, and the proposed rescheduling could impact the legality of intoxicating hemp THC products.

**The Beginning of the End of Cannabis Prohibition**
The US Justice Department is proposing to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the federal Controlled Substances Act, recognizing its therapeutic benefits and potential medical use. This move marks a significant shift in the federal government's stance on cannabis, which has been classified as a dangerous drug for decades. The proposal acknowledges that cannabis has a well-established medical use and an acceptable safety profile, and that the majority of users do not experience negative outcomes. While the change is a step forward, it still does not align with the laws of most states that have legalized cannabis for adult use, leaving the industry in a state of legal limbo.
