*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered around.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the BLS numbers are in. Will the month-over-month core CPI increase for August 2024 be 0.4%?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 65.23%. Given the recent economic indicators, we anticipated this steady inflation path.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The Fed's interest rate hikes seem to have kept inflation from spiraling, but it’s clearly not back to their 2% target yet.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. The moderation in inflation is promising, but persistent pressures are still in play. It’s a balancing act for the Fed as they navigate potential recession risks.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. This data will definitely shape market expectations and the Fed’s next moves.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the numbers are in. Will the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US for August 2024 be 0.4%?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 35.72%. The Fed's rate hikes and moderating inflation trends suggested it wouldn't hit 0.4%.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the July 2024 reading of 0.2% was a strong indicator. The Fed's efforts seem to be slowly aligning with their 2% target.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. With recession concerns looming, this moderation provides some breathing room for policymakers.

**NATE SILVER**  
And as always, our models proved accurate. The market's response will be interesting to watch.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the camera fades out.*

No, our models had it at 35.72%. The signs were there—July's 0.2% was a clear indicator of moderation.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the Fed's rate hikes have been biting. The market's anticipation of a recession played into this, too.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The gradual return to the 2% target is more plausible now. Our models are never wrong.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the numbers are in. Will the core CPI increase in August 2024 be 0.4%?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.72%. The data released yesterday showed a 0.3% increase. It's a relief for the Fed, given the recession fears.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Our models have been spot on, predicting a moderation in inflation trends. The Fed's interest rate hikes seem to be working, at least for now.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, but the road ahead remains uncertain. If inflation persists, it could still complicate policy decisions.

**NATE SILVER**  
True. Let's hope this trend continues. The market's watching closely.
