**Putin Accuses Ukraine of Attempting to Target Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of attempting to target the Kursk nuclear power plant, which is expected to be visited soon by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi. Putin said during a meeting with government officials and regional governors, 'The enemy tried to hit the nuclear power plant at night.' However, Putin did not provide details or direct evidence of this claim. He stated that the IAEA was 'informed' of this attack and 'promised to send experts to assess the situation.' The IAEA issued a statement saying that Moscow informed them of finding 'scattered fragments' about 100 meters from a nuclear fuel storage facility at the Kursk plant. Ukraine began a large-scale attack on the border region on August 6, capturing dozens of villages and hundreds of square kilometers. The Kursk nuclear power plant is located about 50 kilometers from Ukrainian military positions. A spokesperson for the IAEA previously told AFP that Grossi would visit the Russian nuclear power plant 'next week.' Russia has been warning of the 'risk' of a nuclear catastrophe since days ago if the Ukrainian army attacks the plant. The IAEA called for 'maximum restraint' in the vicinity of the site 'to avoid a nuclear accident with serious radioactive consequences.' Since the start of the Russian war on Ukraine in early 2022, the IAEA has regularly warned of the risk of a nuclear accident, particularly at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, which was captured by Russian forces in March 2022 and repeatedly targeted by exchange fire between Kyiv and Moscow. The Kursk plant administration confirmed in October 2023 that it was targeted by three Ukrainian raids, but did not result in casualties or damage.

**Kursk Nuclear Power Plant on High Alert as Ukraine Conflict Escalates**
The city of Kurchatov, where the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is located, and several nearby districts in the Kursk region of Russia were left without electricity on August 9th. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, one of the largest in Russia, is a critical infrastructure target that some analysts believe could be a possible goal of the ongoing Ukrainian military operation. The plant has two operational reactors with a total capacity of 2 GW, and is currently building new reactors. The plant generates 90% of the industrial energy consumption in the Kursk region. Russian media reports that the plant is being prepared for defense, with Russian security forces blocking access to the plant and removing male staff, leaving only female guards. The plant's management has recommended that staff take paid leave and evacuate their children. Rosatom has confirmed that the number of builders at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant-2 has been reduced. Ukrainian drones have attacked the plant, with a drone hitting a transformer substation, causing a fire and leaving several districts without electricity. The Economist, citing a source in the Ukrainian General Staff, considers it unlikely that the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant will be captured. The source believes that the Ukrainian military would need to advance 80 km from the border and mobilize more forces to achieve this goal, which would be a repeat of the mistake made by Russian forces north of Kyiv in 2022.

**The Economist: Capture of Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by Ukrainian Forces Unlikely**
The Economist believes that the Ukrainian forces' capture of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is unlikely, as it would require a 60-kilometer march and more forces than currently available. According to a source in the Ukrainian General Staff, 'It is unlikely because we would need to march 80 kilometers from the border and have larger forces (the distance to the plant from the border is approximately 60 kilometers - ed.). Without properly organized forces, we would repeat the mistakes made by the Russians north of Kyiv in 2022. We cut off their lines, and they became an easy prey.' The source also suggests that a more realistic goal is to create a 'buffer zone' on the border territory of Russia, which would help in negotiations. The Economist also notes that 'direct attention' is being paid to the gas pumping station in Sudzha, the only working point of entry for Russian gas into the Progress pipeline in Europe. However, it is unclear what control over the station would bring to Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia are interested in its continuous and uninterrupted operation, considering the transportation fee paid by Ukraine and the financial difficulties of Russian 'Gazprom', which is struggling under sanctions. The Economist notes that the ultimate goals of the Ukrainian command are still unclear, but 'at such high stakes, the career of General Syrskyi may well be on the line.' Meanwhile, among the Rosgvardiya personnel guarding the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, there are only women left, and the plant's management has no plan in case of an attack. According to an employee of the plant, 'The 'tanks' have moved closer to the station. They are constantly shooting. The station's security is usually led by warrant officers of the Rosgvardiya. Now, only women are sitting there, apparently, they have taken all the men and sent them there.'

**Kursk Nuclear Power Plant at Risk: Ukrainian Forces Advance on Russian Territory**
Russian forces are concerned that Ukrainian forces may capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Kurchatov, located approximately 60 km from the Ukrainian-Russian border. The city of Sudzha, the main target of the Ukrainian operation, is located less than 10 km from the border, according to Google Maps. The distance from Sudzha to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is around 90 km via the R-200 highway. Russian propagandist Yuri Kotenok previously suggested that the Ukrainian forces' goal is to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant and exchange it for the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the operation in the Kursk region of Russia as of August 7. Russian propagandists claim that Ukrainian forces have broken through the border in several locations, advancing around 15 km in a day. As of the evening of August 6, Russian forces reported the presence of Ukrainian forces in 11 settlements: Lubimovka, Obukhovka, Pokrovskoye, Zeleny Shlyakh, Tolsty Lug, Nizhny Klin, Nikolaev-Darino, Darino, Sverdlykovo, and Lebedevka. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the events in the Kursk region 'another large-scale provocation by the Kiev regime.'

**Ukrainian Military Plans to Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
The Ukrainian military is reportedly planning to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, located 80 km from the city of Sudja, in the Kursk region. The plant has been a target of Ukrainian military operations, with Russian sources claiming that over 300 Ukrainian soldiers and equipment have been spotted in the area. The region has seen an increase in civilian casualties, with 28 people injured in the Sudja and Korenev regions. Ukrainian social media channels have shared footage of allegedly captured Russian soldiers, while also circulating a deepfake video of the regional governor, Alexei Smirnov, urging men over 18 to take up arms. This comes after reports of three conscripts from the Ural region being killed in the Belgorod region while carrying out orders from their superiors.

**Kursk and Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plants: A Threat to Russia's Economy**
The capture of the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants by Russia has significant economic implications for the country. The Kursk plant, with a capacity of 4 GW, supplies electricity to five Russian regions, including Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Tambov, and Lipetsk. If the plant is destroyed, it would affect the operation of several key industries, including the Oskol Electrometallurgical Plant, which is the only plant in Russia that produces metal without impurities. The plant is also a major supplier of metal to the automotive and defense industries. The Novolipetsk Metallurgical Plant, which is owned by Vladimir Lisin, a close associate of Putin, would also be severely affected. The plant is one of the largest in Russia and produces coking coal, cast iron, and steel. The capture of the Zaporizhzhia plant, with a capacity of 6 GW, has already resulted in significant economic losses for Ukraine, with a loss of over 210 billion hryvnias in revenue since its capture in March 2022. The plant's operation has been severely disrupted, and its restart is planned for May 2024. The capture of either plant poses a significant risk of a nuclear disaster and would have severe economic consequences for Russia.

**Kursk Nuclear Power Plant: A Threat of Strikes and a Visit from the IAEA**
Russia claims that Ukrainian forces pose a threat to the Kursk nuclear power plant and that the Ukrainians have even attempted to launch a strike. What is the truth? Russian President Vladimir Putin stated, 'The enemy attempted to strike the nuclear power plant during the night', during a meeting with his government broadcast on television on August 22. However, the Ukraine has not officially responded. The acting governor of the region assured that the plant is 'stable and under control', according to The Moscow Times. The Kursk nuclear power plant is located in the Kursk region on Russian territory near the border with Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have launched an assault in the region, taking control of dozens of villages and hundreds of square kilometers. The plant is approximately 50 km from the positions of Ukrainian forces. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern and will send specialists to evaluate the situation. The IAEA director general will visit the plant next week. Russia has threatened a nuclear catastrophe in the event of an attack by Ukrainian forces. This is not the first time the plant has been targeted, as three Ukrainian drones were detected in October 2023, but they caused no damage or casualties. The plant was built in 1977, the same year as the Chernobyl plant, and has four RBMK reactors, two of which are currently offline and two under construction.

**IAEA Chief to Visit Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Amid Ukraine-Russia Conflict**
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, plans to visit the Kursk nuclear power plant in Russia. The visit is scheduled for 'next week', according to an IAEA spokesperson. Meanwhile, fighting continues along the border, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meeting with troops in the region. 'We can confirm next week', said the IAEA spokesperson regarding the planned Grossi visit to the Kursk nuclear power plant. The plant is located near the city of Kurtschatow, about 100 kilometers from the border with Ukraine. After the start of the Ukrainian counterattack on Russia on August 6, Grossi had warned of the possible effects of the fighting on the plant and called on 'all parties to maximum restraint'. Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the troops in the region, where the offensive on Russia was launched, and held meetings in the border region of Sumy, including with Army Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi and representatives of the local military administration. According to Ukrainian reports, the troops have captured another village and 'filled the exchange fund' - that is, captured more Russian soldiers. With the village's capture, Ukrainian troops now control 94 villages and over 1,000 square kilometers of land in the Russian region of Kursk, according to their own reports. According to Russian reports, more than 120,000 civilians have fled the area. The Russian Interior Security Service (FSB) has launched criminal proceedings against several foreign journalists, including a reporter from CNN and two Ukrainian journalists, for 'illegally crossing the state border'. In response to the Ukrainian offensive, air raid shelters are being built in Kursk. Governor Alexei Smirnov has published a photo of a truck with a corresponding concrete module on the Telegram online service. In total, 60 such shelters are to be built at transportation hubs in the city, which is about 80 kilometers from the border. Similar shelters are also to be built in other cities in the border region, Smirnov announced. According to Smirnov, 'two Ukrainian rockets and a drone were destroyed by the Russian air defense' in the night from Thursday to Friday. Ukrainian air raids have also been reported in other western Russian regions, including in the region of Volgograd, where a Defense Ministry facility caught fire, but was extinguished, according to Regional Governor Andrei Bocharov in the Telegram online channel. According to reports from Ukrainian intelligence circles, the target of the attack was a Russian airbase in Marinowka, more than 300 kilometers from the border. The Russian army has announced that it has captured another village in eastern Ukraine, near the city of Pokrowsk. The troops are now only about 10 kilometers from Pokrowsk, an important logistics hub in the region. The situation there was the subject of his talks in Sumy, said Zelensky. It was about 'the measures taken to strengthen the defense' of Pokrowsk and the city of Torezk, which is threatened by the Russian army. Zelensky is to receive Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kiev on Friday, who sees himself as a mediator in the Ukraine war. Modi called for negotiations on Thursday. 'India is convinced that no problem can be solved on a battlefield', said Modi in Warsaw, from where he was to travel to Kiev.

**IAEA Director to Visit Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Amid Ukrainian Forces' Advance**
The director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, is scheduled to visit the Kursk nuclear power plant in Russia next week. This comes as Ukrainian forces are within 100 kilometers of the plant, following an unexpected attack in the region. Concerns have been raised that the war could cause damage to the plant and subsequent radioactive leaks, similar to the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the start of the war in 2022. 'The situation is very concerning,' said Grossi, 'and we will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the plant and the surrounding area.'

**Russia Advances on Key Ukrainian Hub, Nuclear Safety Concerns Grow**
Russia has claimed the capture of the village of Svyrydonivka, about 15 kilometers from the city of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub in eastern Ukraine. The city has been a Russian target for months. The Russian army has reportedly taken control of several villages in the region in recent days. The advance is a sign of continued pressure on the eastern front, despite Ukraine's surprise counterattack in the Russian region of Kursk since August 6. While the counterattack has drawn significant attention, most fighting is still taking place in the Ukrainian Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces face a much larger Russian army. If Pokrovsk falls, Ukraine will be in serious trouble in the east. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned that the safety situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has deteriorated. On Saturday morning, a drone attack occurred near the plant. 'An explosive device carried by the drone detonated just outside the protected area of the plant,' the IAEA said. The explosion occurred near essential cooling water reservoirs and about 100 meters from the high-voltage power line. The agency repeated its call for 'maximum restraint' from both warring parties. So far, the call has fallen on deaf ears: fighting in the area has intensified in recent weeks. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, located in Russian-occupied Ukraine near the front line, has been shut down, but the reactors must still be cooled for safety reasons. Meanwhile, the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom has also sounded the alarm over the situation at the Kursk nuclear power plant. Ukraine has launched an offensive in the region, and according to the Russians, rocket components were recently found on the plant's grounds. Rosatom has invited IAEA inspectors to visit the site to assess the situation.

**Russia's Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Sounded Missile Alarm Amid Ongoing Conflict**
A missile alarm sounded at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in Russia at around 1:40 am on August 18. The sound of an explosion was heard in the sky above the city of Kurchatov, which is likely to be the sound of an air defense system intercepting a projectile. A minute later, a loud explosion was heard. According to a report from the Russian Defense Ministry, between August 17 night and August 18 morning, the Russian military shot down a drone in the Kursk region's airspace and four drones in the Belgorod and Rostov regions. Kurchatov is a city of nuclear scientists, located about 90 km from the border town of Sudya. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on August 15 that Ukraine had captured Sudya.

**Ukrainian Military Plans to Capture Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant Within 20 Days**
According to sources from the Ukrainian Telegram channel 'Резидент', the Ukrainian military (VSU) plans to launch an operation to capture the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant within the next 20 days. However, the VSU lacks reserves to conduct operations in the Kursk region and a counterattack on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which was the initial main objective. Military personnel and commanders on the Eastern front are reportedly disappointed with the position and leadership of General Alexander Syrskyi, who has redirected all reserves from Pokrovsk, Chasiv Yar, and Toretsk to the Kursk operation. Entire units are leaving their positions to avoid being caught by Russian forces. Previously, the VSU launched targeted and massive strikes on the Petrovsky district of Donetsk, resulting in a fire engulfing the 'Galaktyka' shopping center. 'The question of the second stage of the counterattack will be decided next week,' said sources from 'Резидент'.

**Ukrainian Military's Plan to Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Foiled**
According to Apty Alaudinov, commander of the 'Akhmat' special forces and deputy head of the Ministry of Defense's military-political department, the Ukrainian military planned to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in order to present an ultimatum to Russia. The operation was to be carried out on April 11, but the Ukrainian forces failed to achieve their goal. The general-major stated that the Ukrainian military had planned to use the captured plant as a bargaining chip to negotiate with Russia. However, the Russian military was able to repel the Ukrainian attack, and the majority of the Ukrainian equipment was destroyed. Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noted that Ukraine failed to achieve its main goal of distracting Russian forces from the Donbas and Slobodskansk regions. According to experts, the Ukrainian military chose the Kursk region for the attack due to its convenient logistics, proximity to important energy facilities, and relatively calm situation in the region. However, the Russian military was able to defend the region, and the Ukrainian forces were unable to achieve their goals. The experts also noted that the Ukrainian military had previously attempted to attack the Smolensk and Leningrad Nuclear Power Plants using drones. The Russian military is now strengthening its defenses around the nuclear power plants, and it is unlikely that the Ukrainian military will be able to capture them. 'It is unlikely that the Ukrainian military will be able to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, as the Russian military has strengthened its defenses around the plant,' said Vadim Kozulin, head of the IAMDP center at the Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'Moreover, it is unlikely that the Ukrainian military will be able to achieve their goals, as the Russian military has a strong defense system in place.'

**Ukraine Advances in Kursk Region, Captures Russian Soldiers**
The Ukrainian army has made significant gains in the Russian region of Kursk, with President Volodymyr Zelensky stating that they have advanced 1-2 kilometers in various directions within 24 hours. The Ukrainian army has also captured 100 Russian soldiers. Meanwhile, the Russian National Guard has increased security at the Kursk nuclear power plant, focusing on preventing Ukrainian drone attacks. The plant is located 30 kilometers west of the city of Kursk and is operated by the state-owned company Rosenergoatom. The Ukrainian army has also taken control of the city of Sudscha, which has a population of around 6,000 people and is located near the pipeline that transports gas from Western Siberia to the EU through Ukraine. The Russian government has extended its ban on oil exports until the end of the year, citing the need to stabilize fuel prices in the country. The ban was first introduced in the fall of 2023 and was previously lifted in May and July. The Ukrainian army has also launched a drone attack on Russian military airfields in Voronezh, Kursk, Sawasleyka, and Borisoglebsk, with the goal of preventing Russia from using these airfields for glide bomb attacks on the front line and Ukrainian cities. The German government has stated that its support for Ukraine will not be affected by the ongoing investigation into the Nord Stream pipeline sabotage. The investigation is ongoing and will be conducted in accordance with the law, regardless of the outcome. The Russian government has also launched a crackdown on dissent, with over 10,000 cases of 'disparagement' of the Russian army being opened since the start of the war in February 2022. The cases can result in fines of up to 500 euros or a prison sentence of up to 7 years. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said Konstantin von Notz, chairman of the parliamentary control committee, regarding the possible sabotage of the Bundeswehr's water supply system.

**Ukrainian Military's Plans Foiled: Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Remains Under Control**
The main goal of the Ukrainian military was to break through to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, according to Alexander Arutyanov, a former special forces operative who witnessed the attack. The Ukrainian military's objective was to capture the plant, as confirmed by prisoner testimonies and Yuri Kotenok, a war correspondent. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is a strategic facility that provides 50% of the energy for the Chernozem region. The plant's two operational reactors have a combined power output of 2,000 MW. In the event of a reactor failure, the system operator is prepared to redirect energy from neighboring power systems. The Ukrainian military's plans were foiled by the increased security measures and the presence of Russian forces, including the FSB and Rosgvardia. The plant's construction of the Kurskaya AES-2 has been halted, and the area is heavily guarded. An expert warned that a loss of control over the plant could lead to a massive blackout, affecting millions of people. The situation is under control, with the system operator ready to redirect energy from neighboring power systems. The Ukrainian military's goal was not only to capture the plant but also to create a threat to the gas distribution hub in Sudja, which could have led to a disruption in gas supplies to Europe. However, Gazprom has confirmed that gas supplies to Europe are continuing through the Sudja hub. The Ukrainian military's strategy was to create a threat to the plant and the gas distribution hub, but their plans were foiled by the increased security measures and the presence of Russian forces. The expert warned that a loss of control over the plant could lead to a massive blackout, affecting millions of people.

**Fake Video Claims Ukrainian Capture of Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
A video circulating on social media appears to show Ukrainian soldiers walking through an atomic station, with a claim that they have captured the strategic Kursk Nuclear Power Plant and threaten a nuclear catastrophe. However, an investigation by 'Komсомольская правда' reveals that the video is actually from a museum of rocket forces, located in Ukraine, near the village of Pobugskoye in Kirovohrad Oblast. The museum, which has been operating since 2001, is based on a former Soviet rocket base with a shaft launch facility. The video was manipulated to include false claims about the capture of a strategic object in Kursk Oblast. In reality, Russian forces have pushed back Ukrainian troops. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is operating normally, with two of its four reactors in operation. The plant's management stated that the radiation level is within normal limits and there is no need for evacuation. This is not the first time that false information has been spread about the plant, with employees of the Center for Information and Psychological Support (CIPS) previously calling residents to spread panic about a supposed capture of the plant. The Russian government has increased security measures around the plant and notified the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the presence of radioactive fragments. IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi condemned attacks on any nuclear power plants, emphasizing that the principles of safety discussed in relation to the Zaporizhzhia plant are also relevant to Kursk.

**Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in Crosshairs as Ukrainian Forces Advance into Russian Territory**
The Russian authorities have declared a state of emergency in the Kursk region, the highest level in Russia, after Ukrainian forces began advancing into Russian territory on August 6. The authorities are treating the situation as a natural disaster, but experts believe that the goal of the Ukrainian operation may be to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. According to sources, the Ukrainian forces are using a large number of attack drones and have been preparing for the operation for a long time. A group of elderly residents from the border villages and city of Sudzha, who fled the fighting, have recorded a video message to Putin, which was published by the Russian opposition Telegram channel ASTRA on August 8. 'The situation is extremely serious,' said one of the residents. 'We are afraid for our lives and the lives of our children.'

**Scrambling Putin digging trenches around Kursk nuclear plant as Russia fears Ukraine invasion could capture reactors**
Russia is building trenches around the Kursk nuclear plant as it fears Ukraine could capture its reactors. Satellite images show new lines in the earth near the power station, and videos posted to social media show diggers building the trenches. Ukraine's troops have infiltrated as deep as 20km into Russian territory, leaving President Vladimir Putin 'scared and seething'. Russia is also sending military reinforcements to the area to prevent a major humiliation if the nuclear plant is captured. The plant is a key supplier of energy in the area and fighting around it would increase the risk of a nuclear incident. Ukraine's army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi posted a defiant message on Telegram, saying 'We continue the operation!' Ukraine has continued its blitz of Kursk, with their latest strike seeing the city pounded by kamikaze drones and Tochka-U tactical missiles overnight. Russia has faced further humiliation after footage of its men surrendering to Ukraine was released, and satellite pictures showed a destroyed airbase in Lipetsk after a Ukrainian drone blitz. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi has issued a stark warning to both sides, urging them to show restraint as fighting intensifies inside Russia. 'At the moment there is a real danger of strikes and provocations by the Ukrainian army,' Rosatom said in a statement. 'Ukraine's reckless actions are threatening not only the Russian nuclear facility but also the entire global nuclear industry.'

**Kurchatov on High Alert: Tensions Rise as Ukrainian Forces Approach**
The situation in Kurchatov, a city near the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, is 'tense' due to the presence of Ukrainian forces 10 km away, who are engaged in battles. According to sources, the plant's operators have decided to shut down the station if Ukrainian forces capture it. An insider told '7x7' that the operational staff is prepared to stop the active blocks if Ukrainian forces enter the territory. If the station is shut down, electricity will be supplied from the main reserve fund. The city is currently guarded by military personnel, and the construction of the new Kursk-2 nuclear power plant has been suspended until mid-August. Locals report that the city has been shelled occasionally, but the situation has become more tense since the Ukrainian forces' advance. A local resident said, 'Everyone is going about their daily lives, but with a sense of unease, as no one knows what's happening or where the Ukrainian forces are. We're living on a wing and a prayer, relying on our intuition.' A hospital worker, who wished to remain anonymous, reported that wounded Ukrainian soldiers are being brought to the hospital in Kurchatov. She said, 'If they reach Lgov, it's hard to imagine what will happen next. Lgov is just 20-30 km away. It's hard to believe that we can count on 'victory' when we don't even have basic necessities like water, clothes, and medical supplies.'

**IAEA Expresses Concern Over Safety of Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Amid Ukrainian Advance**
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern about the safety of the Kursk nuclear power plant in Russia due to the Ukrainian advance on the Russian territory. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi called on both sides to adhere to the rules for nuclear safety in conflict zones. The Ukrainian army has been advancing on Russian territory since Tuesday, and the exact extent and goals of the operation are unclear. Grossi appealed to both sides to exercise maximum restraint to avoid a nuclear accident with potentially severe radiation consequences. Due to the Ukrainian advance, workers have been withdrawn from the construction site of two new nuclear reactors at the Kursk nuclear power plant. The number of construction workers will be temporarily reduced, according to the company Atomstroieksport, a subsidiary of the Russian state-owned nuclear company Rosatom. The other specialists continue to work as planned. The Kursk nuclear power plant is located in the city of Kurtschatow and is about 60 kilometers from the border. The farthest advances of Ukrainian troops, which have been reported but not confirmed, reached about 30 kilometers into Russian territory. The Russian National Guard has strengthened the protection of the nuclear power plant since Wednesday. In the city of Kurtschatow and its surroundings, the power went out due to a Ukrainian drone attack. This was announced by the acting governor of Kursk, Alexander Smirnow, on Telegram. Russia also informed the IAEA that parts of Ukrainian rockets had been found on the site of the nuclear power plant. However, there was no direct attack, according to a letter from the Russian representation at the international organizations in Vienna. The Ukrainian leadership has not commented on the advance of its army with tanks and artillery on Russian territory. However, President Volodymyr Selenskyj thanked the soldiers who had captured Russian prisoners in his video message on Friday evening. 'This is extremely important, and in the past three days it has been particularly successful,' he said. If the exchange fund is filled, more Ukrainian prisoners can be released from Russia. Since the start of the advance on Tuesday, there have been several videos showing the capture of groups of Russian soldiers, including border guards at the Sudscha crossing.

**Kursk Nuclear Power Plant: A Potential Target in the Conflict?**
The city of Kurchatov, where the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is located, and several neighboring districts in the Kursk region of Russia were left without electricity in the evening of August 9. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is one of the largest in Russia and the only one under construction. The plant consists of two operational blocks with a total capacity of 2 GW. As the resource of the blocks is depleted, their power will be replaced by blocks of the Kursk NPP-2. The share of the Kursk NPP among all power plants in the Chernozem region is 49%, and among all Rosatom power plants - 16.8%. The plant produces 90% of the industrial energy consumption of the Kursk region. The plant's security has been strengthened, with Russian authorities reportedly removing male security personnel and replacing them with female Rosgvardiya officers. A source close to the plant confirmed that the men were reinstated. The plant's management has recommended that employees take paid leave and evacuate their children. Rosatom has confirmed that the number of builders on the Kursk NPP-2 has been reduced. Pro-Russian bloggers claim that the plant is preparing for defense, citing the presence of small Ukrainian military groups in the area. The city of Kurchatov and several neighboring districts were left without electricity after a Ukrainian drone attack on a transformer substation. 'As a result of the fall of the Ukrainian drone's wreckage on the transformer substation in one of the districts of the region, a fire broke out,' wrote the acting governor of the region, Alexei Smirnov. The Economist, citing a source in the Ukrainian General Staff, considers it unlikely that the Kursk NPP will be captured. According to the source, the Ukrainian military is not capable of advancing 80 km from the border and mobilizing sufficient forces to capture the plant. 'Without properly organized forces, we can repeat the mistakes made by the Russians north of Kiev in 2022. We cut off their lines, and they became easy prey,' the source said.

**Ukraine Seeks US Green Light for ATACMS to Hold Kursk and Press Moscow**
The Ukrainian leadership has asked the US for permission to use ATACMS to target Russian territory after an incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast. According to an anonymous advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, this could allow Kyiv to hold the territory they have pushed into. The advisor stated, 'This will give them the leverage they need for negotiations with Russia – this is what it's all about.' Ukrainian forces have captured approximately 100 square kilometers of territory and taken hundreds of Russian soldiers prisoner. They also control the Sudzha gas measuring station used by Gazprom to supply fuel to Europe. The operation involved about 1,000 soldiers from elite assault brigades equipped with Western armored vehicles and tanks. The Russian military leadership was surprised by the unexpected march of Ukrainian forces into Kursk Oblast, and despite the deployment of reserves, Ukrainian forces have managed to continue their offensive. Some military analysts believe the next target for Ukrainian forces might be the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, which is about 30 km away and currently guarded only by women.

Military analyst Oleksiy Hetman stated on 'Kyiv24' that it's not worth expecting the capture of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by Ukrainian forces. 'We cannot do this,' he said. However, Hetman suggested that it's possible to try to surround the plant, create a certain zone, and leave it without power, then transfer power from the Kursk plant to Ukraine's own power grid, as they have lost a significant amount of electricity. Hetman estimated that the distance is 22 kilometers, making it a feasible option. When asked how long Ukrainian forces could maintain control, Hetman replied, 'Infinite.' It's worth noting that the mayor of the Russian city of Kurchatov, where the Kursk plant is located, stated that fighting is taking place several dozen kilometers away from the city.

**The Economist: Ukraine Unlikely to Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
The Economist reported that the Ukrainian command considers it unlikely that Ukrainian Defense Forces (UDF) will capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. According to the British publication, citing its sources, Russian propagandists and military bloggers have suggested that the UDF's goal in the Kursk region may be the nuclear power plant. They claim that taking control of the plant could be a response to Russia's occupation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in 2022. However, an unnamed source from the General Staff of the UDF stated, 'Without properly organized forces, you will repeat the mistakes Russia made north of Kyiv in 2022. We cut them off from the front line, and they became an easy target.' The source also mentioned that the mechanized units deployed in the Kursk operation require a lot of fuel and technical maintenance. A source in the intelligence agency said that a more realistic goal may be to create an 'uncomfortable buffer zone' for Russia, similar to their attempts to create one in northern Kharkiv Oblast. 'Russia tried to prepare a strong position, but now they're in a complete mess because they can't defend their own territory,' the source emphasized. The Economist noted that maintaining control of the territory would be a public slap in the face for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Additionally, the positive news from the Kursk region is playing an important role in boosting the morale of the Ukrainian society.

The source also suggests that a more realistic goal is to create a 'buffer zone' on the border territory of Russia, which would help in negotiations. The Economist also notes that 'direct attention' is being paid to the gas pumping station in Sudzha, the only working point of entry for Russian gas into the Progress pipeline in Europe. However, it is unclear what control over the station would bring to Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia are interested in its continuous and uninterrupted operation, considering the transportation fee paid by Ukraine and the financial difficulties of Russian 'Gazprom', which is struggling under sanctions. The Economist notes that the ultimate goals of the Ukrainian command are still unclear, but 'at such high stakes, the career of General Syrskyi may well be on the line.' Meanwhile, among the Rosgvardiya personnel guarding the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, there are only women left, and the plant's management has no plan in case of an attack. According to an employee of the plant, 'The 'tanks' have moved closer to the station. They are constantly shooting. The station's security is usually led by warrant officers of the Rosgvardiya. Now, only women are sitting there, apparently, they have taken all the men and sent them there.'

**Ukrainian General Staff Suggests Alternative to Capturing Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
A source in the Ukrainian General Staff has stated that capturing the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is unlikely, but a more realistic scenario is creating a 'buffer zone' on the border with Russia, which would aid in negotiations. The source also highlighted the importance of the Sudzha gas pumping station, which is the only operational entry point for Russian gas into the 'Progress' pipeline in Europe. According to the source, 'direct attention' is being paid to this station. Meanwhile, Hero of Russia General-Major Sergey Lipovy has suggested that Ukrainian forces may attempt to damage the gas station in Sudzha, saying, 'It is likely they are doing this to cut off Europe from Russian gas.' The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has stated that it is aware of the situation in the Kursk region and is monitoring the developments. The Ukrainian army would need a '80-kilometer march from the border and larger forces' to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, according to the source.

**The Economist: Capture of Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by Ukraine Unlikely**
The Economist suggests that the capture of the Kursk nuclear power plant by Ukrainian forces is unlikely. According to the publication, citing its sources, the Ukrainian military may be aiming to create a 'buffer zone' in the Kursk region, similar to Russia's attempts to create one in the north of Kharkiv region. This could be a bargaining chip in future negotiations. A Ukrainian military source stated, 'Without properly organized forces, you will repeat the mistakes the Russians made north of Kyiv in 2022. We cut them off from the front line, and they became an easy target.' The Economist notes that Ukraine's deployment of mechanized forces, including tanks, will complicate its logistical problem, as armored vehicles require a lot of fuel and maintenance.

**Ukrainian Army Launches Surprise Attack on Russian Region of Kursk**
The Ukrainian army has launched a surprise attack on the Russian region of Kursk, with units reportedly advancing deep into the area. According to Russian state media, the attack began on August 6 at 5:30am, with up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops aiming to capture a part of the Sudschansky district in Kursk. However, the Russian Defense Ministry claims that high losses were inflicted on the Ukrainian forces, with over 80 armored vehicles destroyed and nearly 700 Ukrainian soldiers wounded or killed. Despite this, the Ukrainian army continues to push forward, with the region of Kursk still under a state of emergency. Approximately 3,000 residents from nearby villages have been evacuated to safety. The Russian National Guard has increased security at the Kursk nuclear power plant, located about 60 kilometers from the border. Some experts speculate that the Ukrainian army's goal may be to capture the plant and exchange it for the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently shut down due to safety concerns. However, the true motivations behind the Ukrainian attack remain unclear.

**Russia Strengthens Protection of Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Amid Ukrainian Advance**
Russia has strengthened the protection of the Kursk nuclear power plant due to the Ukrainian advance into the Russian border region of Kursk. Additional forces have been deployed to combat sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the Kursk and Belgorod regions, according to the Russian authorities. The nuclear power plant, which has a capacity of almost two gigawatts and four blocks, is located only about 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that 'the more pressure we exert on Russia, the closer we get to peace. A just peace, through just force.' The Ukrainian military has launched a counterattack against Russian forces in the Kursk region, with reports of up to 1000 Ukrainian soldiers advancing into Russian territory. Russian authorities have confirmed that at least 100 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and 215 wounded. The Russian Defense Ministry has stated that the operation will be ended with the destruction of the enemy and the return to the state border. However, Ukrainian forces have reportedly advanced up to 10 kilometers into Russian territory, capturing at least 10 Russian villages. The situation remains unclear, with both sides trading accusations and reports of civilian casualties.

**Russia Increases Security at Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Amid Ukrainian Advance**
The Russian National Guard has increased security at the Kursk nuclear power plant due to the Ukrainian advance into the Russian border region. Additional forces have been deployed to combat sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the Kursk and Belgorod regions. The plant, which has four blocks and a capacity of nearly two gigawatts, is located just 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian troops, supported by tanks and artillery, had crossed the Russian border from the Sumy region into the Sudscha area the previous day, with some reports suggesting they had advanced up to 15 kilometers towards the plant. The European gas price has risen to a record high, with the TTF futures contract for delivery in a month increasing by 5.7% to 38.78 euros per megawatt hour. This is attributed to the attacks on the Kursk region. The Ukrainian authorities have ordered the evacuation of 23 settlements in the Sumy region, affecting around 6,000 people, including over 400 children and adolescents. The Russian General Staff has reported that up to 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers are involved in the attack on the Kursk region. The EU has provided 108 billion euros in aid to Ukraine since the start of the war, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. A Ukrainian soldier, Oleksandr Ischtschenko, who died in Russian captivity, was reportedly killed by blunt trauma to the chest. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of a 'large-scale provocation' over the ongoing attacks on the Kursk region. The Russian Defense Ministry has confirmed ongoing clashes in Kursk, with soldiers fighting alongside border guards against Ukrainian infiltrators. Thousands of people have fled the affected areas in Kursk, with 200 people being evacuated by bus and transport vehicles. Russian President Putin has taken personal control of the situation, with emergency shelters being set up for 2,500 people. A Ukrainian partisan group has reported discovering two Russian warships, including the legendary 'Konstantin Olshansky', which was captured by Russia in 2014. The group claims to have shared the information with Ukrainian forces, stating that the ships will likely be sunk in the near future. A Russian military blogger, Andrej Kurschin, has been sentenced to six and a half years in prison for spreading false information about the military.

**Ukrainian Army Captures Key Gas Station in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian army has captured the gas measurement station 'Sudzha' in the Kursk region of Russia, which is the only remaining point of gas supply to Europe through Ukraine. According to the Telegram channel 'Rybar', the station was under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by 13:00 Moscow time. The city of Sudzha is also surrounded by Ukrainian forces, with troops from the Ministry of Defense and the FSB present. The station is located near the border crossing, and photos taken by drones show signs of shelling and a damaged tank. The Ukrainian army has advanced 3 km into the Kursk region and has taken control of several villages, including Obukhovka, Pokrovskoye, Tolsty Lug, and Lyubimovka. The station supplies around 40 million cubic meters of gas per day to Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary, accounting for about half of Gazprom's exports to Europe. The remaining gas is supplied through the 'Turkish Stream' pipeline. According to eyewitnesses, the Ukrainian army has taken control of the western outskirts of Sudzha, and there is a high probability of losing the city. The next target for the Ukrainian army may be the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, which is located about 45 km from the station. The unexpected advance of the Ukrainian army has caught the Russian military leadership off guard, with 11 settlements lost in the region. President Vladimir Putin has held an emergency meeting with government officials and security leaders, accusing Ukraine of 'provocation' and attacks on residential buildings.

**Kursk Nuclear Power Plant at Risk: Ukrainian Forces Advance on Russian Territory**
Russian forces are concerned that Ukrainian forces may capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Kurchatov, located approximately 60 km from the Ukrainian-Russian border. The city of Sudzha, the main target of the Ukrainian operation, is located less than 10 km from the border, according to Google Maps. The distance from Sudzha to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is around 90 km via the R-200 highway. Russian propagandist Yuri Kotenok previously suggested that the Ukrainian forces' goal is to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant and exchange it for the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the operation in the Kursk region of Russia as of August 7. Russian propagandists claim that Ukrainian forces have broken through the border in several locations, advancing around 15 km in a day. As of the evening of August 6, Russian forces reported the presence of Ukrainian forces in 11 settlements: Lubimovka, Obukhovka, Pokrovskoye, Zeleny Shlyakh, Tolsty Lug, Nizhny Klin, Nikolaev-Darino, Darino, Sverdlykovo, and Lebedevka.

**Ukrainian Military Advances into Aggressor State, Approaching Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
The Ukrainian military's advance into the aggressor state continues. A column of Ukrainian equipment, bearing a new tactical sign - a triangle, has been spotted moving towards the Kursk region. The troops are likely approaching the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. According to journalist Yuriy Butusov, local residents and Russian Z-propagandists are reporting the deepening of the operation and the approaching liberating forces to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. As he writes, 'Meanwhile, local residents and Russian Z-propagandists are reporting and documenting the deepening of the operation and the approaching liberating forces to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. Be good!' It is worth noting that Russian 'war correspondents' claim that as of the morning of August 7, the Ukrainian Armed Forces 'entered' 11 settlements in the Kursk region, with a front width of 10-11 km.

**Russia Fears Ukrainian Forces May Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
Russian forces are trying to 'feel out' the direction of the main Ukrainian attack in the Kursk region. A Russian military correspondent has expressed concern that the Ukrainian forces may capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Kurchatov. According to him, if the Ukrainian forces begin to move in this direction, it will become clear that their intention is to create a direct threat to the city of Kurchatov with the aim of capturing Rylsk and Sudzha. The Russian military correspondent believes that the Ukrainian military is trying to capture the nuclear power plant in Kurchatov in order to later exchange it for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russia. 'It is necessary to calculate the actions of the enemy. I recall that the NPP in g. Kurchatov - this object has long been the subject of the aspirations of the military leadership of the Ukrainian nationalists and their curators. Attention should be paid to the situation in the direction of Glukhov - Rylsk. If the enemy takes active actions precisely in this direction, which cannot be ruled out, then the final goal of the entire operation of the VSU will become clear - the city of Kurchatov, the nuclear power plant. Such an answer for ZAES and previously for ChAES. The logic is as follows - take Kurchatov and conduct a trade with Russia on Energodar with ZAES and anything else,' - he said. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is a functioning NPP located in the city of Kurchatov, Kursk Oblast, Russia, on the Seim River, 40 km from Kursk. The station consists of four power blocks with a total capacity of 4 GW. The Kursk NPP became the second station with RBMK-1000 reactors after the Leningrad NPP, launched in 1973. Its design is similar to the Chernobyl NPP. Previously, it was reported that explosions were heard in the city of Kurchatov, Kursk Oblast, near the Kursk NPP. The Russian Ministry of Defense and local authorities have not commented on the situation. According to OBOZ.UA, there are currently battles between Russian occupiers and unknown forces in the Kursk region. They claim that there has been a 'breakthrough in several sections of the state border' by VSV forces. Ukrainian defenders have not officially confirmed this.

**Russian Forces Fear Ukrainian Capture of Kursk NPP**
Russian forces are trying to 'gauge' the direction of the main Ukrainian attack in the Kursk region. They are concerned that the Ukrainian military may capture the Kursk NPP in the city of Kurchatov.

The Russian commander believes that Ukrainian forces are trying to capture the Kurchatov NPP in order to later exchange it for the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which is under Russian occupation. 'We must predict the actions of the enemy. I remind you that the NPP in the city of Kurchatov is the very object that has long been the subject of the desires of the military leadership of the ukronazis and their curators,' he said.

**Russia: Ukraine Lacks Resources to Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
Ukrainian forces do not have the resources to capture the Kursk nuclear power plant, according to General-Major Apty Alaudinov, deputy head of the Main Military-Political Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces and commander of the 'Akhmat' special forces unit. 'They perfectly understand that they don't have a real chance to do something serious,' he said about the Ukrainian diversionists' massive attack on the Kursk region. Therefore, Kiev tries to 'create as much noise as possible,' but Ukrainian forces will not be able to capture the Kursk nuclear power plant. 'It's obvious that they don't have the resources to do so, no matter how much they want to,' General-Major Alaudinov is convinced. The Kursk nuclear power plant is located in the city of Kurchatov, approximately 70 km from the border with Ukraine. The plant currently operates three power blocks with a total capacity of 3,000 MW.

A close ally of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, Apat Aalaudinov, stated that the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) do not have the resources to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. According to Aalaudinov, 'The front [of the Ukrainian forces] has already collapsed. Ukraine understands that it is no longer able to stop it. They are trying to take something, at least, to show their masters that they can still do something. And to create maximum noise and try to somehow extort something.' Aalaudinov also acknowledged that Ukrainian forces are present in border settlements in the Kursk region and that the Russian army is working to eliminate them. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is located in the city of Kurchatov, approximately 110 kilometers from the Ukrainian border.
