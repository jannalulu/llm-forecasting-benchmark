**Tory MPs consider resigning over Labour’s second job crackdown**
Up to a dozen Conservative MPs are considering resigning before the next election due to Labour's crackdown on second jobs. Senior party sources expect 'a drip of resignations' to start after the Tory leadership contest in the new year. Those who served in Rishi Sunak's government and were passed over for senior shadow cabinet roles are most likely to quit. One former cabinet minister said they are 'growing tired of the job' and 'thinking about how much more they can make on the outside'. Another has been offered a job in the US and is considering their position if they are not given a senior role under the next Conservative leader. Labour has pledged to reform the system so that all MPs are subject to the same rules, including declaring gifts monthly in the register of interests. Some Conservative MPs are 'thinking twice' about accepting 'what used to be considered perks of the job' and are doubting their chances of getting back into power. 'I find it hard to believe the Conservatives will be back in power — we need an absolute majority and there’s no coalition that works for us,' one party insider said. Senior Conservative sources said that about a dozen MPs were considering standing down before the next election — about 10 per cent of the parliamentary party.

**Canterbury MP Rosie Duffield says Labour supporters are being ‘taken for granted'**
Former Labour MP Rosie Duffield has resigned from the party, stating that she feels Labour supporters are being 'completely taken for granted'. She criticized Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's decision to keep the two-child benefit cap and means-test winter fuel payments, as well as his handling of gifts given to him and other senior Labour figures. Duffield said the party leadership is 'more about greed and power than making a difference', and that she has lost her 'faith' in the leadership. She also criticized Sir Keir's management of his party, saying he has 'never regularly engaged' with backbench MPs and lacks 'basic politics and political instincts'. Her resignation follows the suspension of seven other Labour MPs who rebelled on the King's Speech, bringing the total number of Independent MPs to 14.

**Labour MP Rosie Duffield Quits Party Over Disagreements with Keir Starmer**
Labour MP Rosie Duffield resigned from the party over the weekend, accusing UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer of being 'hypocritical' and implementing 'cruel and unnecessary' policies. In a letter of resignation, Duffield attacked Starmer's decision to maintain the two-child benefit cap and cut energy assistance for pensioners, as well as his handling of the recent controversy over gifts received by the Prime Minister and other senior party officials. 'Someone with a wealth far above the average who chooses to maintain the two-child benefit cap imposed by the Conservatives on social benefits, which plunges children into poverty, while inexplicably accepting expensive personal gifts such as designer suits and glasses that cost more than most people can afford, does not deserve to be called the Labour Prime Minister at all,' Duffield wrote. Duffield, who represented the Labour Party in the Canterbury constituency in southeast England, had already been at odds with the party over issues related to trans rights. She stated that she was 'ashamed' of Starmer's work as Labour leader due to his 'sordidness, nepotism, and apparent avarice' and announced that she would join the independent MPs' bloc. Elected for the first time in 2017, Duffield's decision to leave the party follows the suspension of seven other Labour MPs who rebelled in the Queen's speech and voted in favor of a motion to abolish the two-child benefit cap, bringing the number of independent MPs in the British Parliament to 14.

**MP says Labour voters are being 'laughed at' over Winter Fuel Payment**
Former Labour MP Rosie Duffield has resigned from the party, citing her loss of faith in the leadership. She expressed her disappointment and frustration with the party's handling of the two-child benefit cap, means-testing of winter fuel payments, and the giftgate issue. Duffield stated, 'We all had our faith in Keir Starmer and a Labour government, and I feel that voters and activists and MPs are being completely laughed at and completely taken for granted.' She also criticized the party leadership for being 'more about greed and power than making a difference.' Duffield's resignation follows the suspension of seven other Labour MPs who rebelled on the King's Speech, bringing the total number of Independent MPs to 14. Conservative leadership candidates have taken aim at the Prime Minister over Duffield's resignation, with Tom Tugendhat saying it shows Sir Keir's Government is 'about self-service' and Robert Jenrick stating the Government is 'already in disarray, crumbling under the weight of their rank hypocrisy.'

**Trudeau Refuses to Resign, Will Run for Re-election Amidst Party Rebellion**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has stated that he will not resign and will run for re-election in the 2025 general elections, despite a rebellion by some Liberal Party MPs. Trudeau responded with a firm 'yes' when asked if he would remain at the helm of the Liberals, despite over 20 government MPs calling for his resignation. Trudeau acknowledged that his government had made a mistake in authorizing 500,000 immigrants per year for 2025 and 2026, and announced that Canada will reduce the number of permanent residents accepted in the next three years by up to 27%. Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre stated that Trudeau's announcement is proof of his poor management and is in contact with dissatisfied Liberal MPs, who may even vote for a motion of no confidence against Trudeau. According to polls, the Conservative Party is leading with 42.5% of the vote, while the Liberal Party is 19 points behind with 23.2%.

**Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau Faces Party Rebellion as MPs Demand Leadership Change**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing calls for resignation from within his own Liberal Party, with over 20 MPs demanding he step down before October 28. The group, led by Wayne Long, claims Trudeau's 'personality' has become a 'distraction' and that a change in leadership is needed to improve the party's chances in the 2025 election. Trudeau remains undeterred, stating that the party is 'strong and united.' However, the dissenting MPs' appeal signals a significant internal challenge for Trudeau as he approaches the end of his third term. The party's internal strife comes amid growing challenges for Trudeau, including economic turbulence and public dissatisfaction, as well as an ongoing diplomatic row with India over allegations of targeting Sikh separatists on Canadian soil.

**Justin Trudeau Announces He Will Lead Liberal Party in 2025 Election**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that he will lead the Liberal Party in the 2025 election, despite opposition from within his own party. Trudeau has been facing pressure to step down, with 24 of his party's MPs signing a letter calling for his resignation by October 28. However, Trudeau has stated that he will not be leaving his position and will instead focus on preparing for the election. 'I have made my decision, and I am confident in my ability to lead the party to victory,' Trudeau said. 'I have listened to my colleagues, and I appreciate their concerns, but I am not swayed by them.' Trudeau's cabinet ministers have stated that they have the support of the majority of the Liberal Party's MPs, with 153 out of 153 members backing him. One of the MPs who signed the letter calling for Trudeau's resignation, Sean Casey, said that he is disappointed that Trudeau did not take the time to listen to their concerns. 'I have spoken to my constituents, and I have made my decision,' Trudeau said. 'I will not be swayed by internal party politics.' Trudeau's decision to lead the party in the 2025 election has been met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a sign of his strength and others as a sign of his weakness.

**Justin Trudeau Reaffirms Commitment to Lead Liberal Party Despite Calls for Resignation**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that he will not resign and will run for re-election in the 2025 general elections. Trudeau stated, 'Yes, I will continue to lead the Liberal Party' despite over 20 government MPs calling for his resignation. Trudeau met with the Liberal Party group in Ottawa to discuss the party's decline in polls and growing discontent among MPs. One of the rebel MPs, Patrick Weiler, read a letter supported by 24 Liberal MPs calling for Trudeau's resignation. Trudeau said, 'As a party, we have always had robust discussions about the best way to move forward. And we will continue to have them while I am the leader.' Trudeau's popularity has been declining due to rising living costs, housing shortages, and deteriorating public services. Many Canadians blame Trudeau's immigration policies for these problems, which have allowed a record number of migrants to enter the country. Trudeau announced that Canada will reduce the number of permanent residents it accepts by up to 27% over the next three years and acknowledged that his government made a mistake in authorizing 500,000 people to enter the country in 2025 and 2026. Trudeau said, 'In turbulent times, as we were emerging from the pandemic, we did not achieve a good balance between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth.' Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre stated that Trudeau's announcement is proof of his poor management and that he is in contact with dissatisfied Liberal MPs. 'Some of them may even vote in favor of a motion of no confidence against Justin Trudeau if it happens again,' Poilievre explained. Trudeau said that Canada needs to stabilize its population growth to allow all levels of government to make necessary changes to healthcare, housing, and social services, so that it can accommodate more people in the future. Immigration Minister Marc Miller stated that the reduction in migration numbers will help resolve the housing shortage in the country. He said that the government is aware of the pressure faced by Canadians and must adapt its policies accordingly. Miller added that the government leaders have listened and will continue to protect the integrity of the migration system and grow Canada's population responsibly.

**Over 20 Liberal MPs Call for Trudeau's Resignation to Avoid Election Defeat**
More than 20 Liberal Party members have asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign to avoid a crushing defeat in the upcoming general elections. The internal revolt was revealed on Wednesday when the Liberal Party group, consisting of 153 members, met in Ottawa, with Trudeau in attendance. During the meeting, one of the rebel members, Patrick Weiler, read a letter signed by 24 Liberal parliamentarians calling for Trudeau's resignation on Monday, October 28. Trudeau spoke for 20 minutes, asking for party unity and mentioning the personal cost of the crisis, according to Canadian media. After the meeting, Trudeau declined to answer questions from journalists, stating only that 'the Liberal Party is strong and united.' Immigration Minister Marc Miller, a key Trudeau ally, said there was a frank conversation and praised the parliamentarians who 'were brave, stood up, and told (Trudeau) to his face.' The revolt comes after the Liberal Party lost two recent by-elections in traditionally Liberal constituencies. The losses, combined with consistent polls showing the Liberal Party will lose the 2025 general elections by a wide margin, have led to widespread discontent among Canadians with the high cost of living, housing affordability, and deteriorating public services, particularly healthcare. Many Canadians blame Trudeau's immigration policies for the country's economic difficulties, which have allowed hundreds of thousands of immigrants to enter the country each year. In response, the Trudeau government will announce on Thursday that it will reduce the number of immigrants allowed to enter the country next year by at least 20%, from 500,000 to 400,000.

**Justin Trudeau in trouble, gets ultimatum: Why Liberal MPs demanded Canadian PM's resignation**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been given an ultimatum by dissatisfied Liberal MPs to decide his future by October 28. According to CBC News, a document outlining the case for Trudeau's resignation was presented during a closed-door meeting, signed by at least 24 of the 153 Liberal MPs. The growing discontent within the party is due to declining trends in Trudeau's popularity, with rival Conservatives leading over Liberals by 19 points, and concerns over the preparations for the upcoming elections. As reported by Radio-Canada, the MPs are seeking Trudeau's resignation in a bid to save their party from a potential poll debacle. 'The public opinion surveys have suggested that under Trudeau's leadership, the Liberals are likely to face a political fiasco,' said sources from Radio-Canada. 'Fearing a massive defeat in the upcoming elections, some 24 MPs presented a document seeking Trudeau's resignation,' added the sources. 'We are not happy with the preparations for the upcoming elections, which must be held before October 2025,' said the MPs, as reported by CBC News.

**Trudeau Faces Pressure to Resign as Liberal Party Members Demand Change**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing increasing pressure from dissatisfied Liberal Party members to resign. According to the Guardian, 20 Liberal MPs, none of whom are cabinet members, have asked Trudeau to step down before a likely electoral defeat in the next elections. A letter signed by two dozen lawmakers has also been sent to Trudeau, requesting him to make a decision by October 28, without specifying any consequences. Trudeau, who has been prime minister for nine years, is deeply unpopular and is facing demands within his party to resign to avoid an electoral defeat that could push the Liberals to a humiliating third place. A recent poll shows the Conservatives have a nearly 20-point lead over the ruling Liberals. Two partial elections held during the summer have given skeptical MPs another reason to doubt Trudeau's future as leader, as the party lost the LaSalle-Émard-Verdun riding, a district that had been almost exclusively held by Liberals for over 50 years. Trudeau has stated that he intends to participate in and win the next federal elections, which will take place at any time before autumn 2025. After the meeting on Wednesday, key cabinet members reaffirmed their support for the prime minister. Trudeau expressed confidence, saying, 'The Liberal Party is strong and united.'

**Justin Trudeau Gets Oct 28 Deadline As Liberal MPs Call On Canadian PM To Resign**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been given a deadline of October 28 to respond to Liberal MPs who have called on him to resign due to his low rating and the deterioration in India-Canada ties.

Despite pressure, Trudeau remains confident that he is the best person to lead the party for the October 2025 Elections. However, Liberal MPs stated that the prime minister would reflect on the concerns raised during the caucus. The Liberal party's popularity has sunk in the eyes of Canadian voters, with the Conservative Party leading by 19 points in the latest polls.

**Justin Trudeau Faces Revolt from Liberal MPs Over Immigration Policies**
More than 20 Liberal Party MPs in Canada have called for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign over criticism of his immigration policies. The country has been welcoming professionals from Ecuador and other countries seeking job opportunities. The internal revolt became known on Wednesday, October 23, 2024, when the Liberal parliamentary group, composed of 153 MPs, met in Ottawa, with Trudeau in attendance. During the meeting, one of the rebel MPs, Patrick Weiler, read a letter supported by 24 Liberal MPs calling for Trudeau to resign on Monday, October 28, according to Canadian media reports.

Immigration Minister Marc Miller, one of Trudeau's key allies, said there was a frank conversation and praised the MPs who 'were brave, stood up, and told (Trudeau) to his face.' The revolt comes after the Liberal Party recently lost two by-elections in traditionally Liberal constituencies. The loss of the two seats adds to polls that consistently show the Liberal Party will lose the next general election, scheduled for late 2025, by a wide margin, with the Conservative Party winning.

**Justin Trudeau Faces Pressure to Resign from Within His Own Party**
Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, is facing pressure from within his own party to resign. At least 20 Liberal MPs, including no Cabinet members, have called for his resignation before the next election, citing a potential defeat. Additionally, over two dozen MPs have signed a letter urging Trudeau to make a decision by October 28. However, this rebellion lacks broad support, as there are 153 Liberal MPs in Parliament. Despite growing questions about Trudeau's future, no alternative party leader has emerged to challenge him. Trudeau is deeply unpopular and faces calls from within his party to step down to avoid an embarrassing election loss that could push the party to third place. The Conservatives have a 20-point lead over the ruling Liberals, according to CBC polls. Recent election losses in LaSalle-Eymer-Verdun and Toronto's downtown area have further eroded the party's support. However, Trudeau has stated his intention to run and win the next federal election, which will take place before autumn 2025. After leaving the three-hour caucus meeting, high-ranking Cabinet officials expressed their support for the embattled Prime Minister. Immigration Minister Mark Miller, a key ally of Trudeau, said he expected the Liberal leader to run against his Conservative rival, Pierre Poilièvre. 'It's not a code red. The Prime Minister can certainly manage the truth,' he added, stating that he 'respects my colleagues who have been brave and stood up and said their piece.' Other MPs suggested that Trudeau could maintain party confidence if he and his team made significant changes to their approach and messaging. Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith said: 'The Prime Minister must listen to the frustrations – in some cases, very legitimate frustrations of his colleagues in the party – and integrate them into the changes to come.'

**Rishi Sunak forced to deny he will resign as his frantic last days in No10 are revealed**
Rishi Sunak had to beg his deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden to stay on as an MP in the weeks leading up to the snap election, fearing the optics of his resignation and the blow it would be to remaining Tory candidates and MPs. According to a former Government source, Mr. Dowden wanted to leave Westminster, but Mr. Sunak made it clear that he couldn't stand down due to the negative impact it would have on the party. Mr. Dowden ultimately remained and was returned to parliament with the 10th largest Conservative majority in the country.

**Liberal MP Calls for Justin Trudeau's Resignation Amid Growing Discontent**
A Liberal Party of Canada MP, Sean Casey, has called for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign to avoid a landslide victory for the Conservative Party in the upcoming general elections. Casey explained that Trudeau's resignation is necessary due to the growing discontent among Canadians with the Prime Minister and his government's policies. According to Casey, around 30 Liberal MPs, out of 153, have signed an internal document requesting Trudeau's resignation. The document may be discussed on Wednesday when the Liberal Party's parliamentary group meets in Ottawa. The opposition to Trudeau points out that polls place the Liberal Party up to 21 points behind the Conservative Party in voting intention, due to widespread discontent over the high cost of living and high levels of immigration. A recent survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 51% of Canadians struggle to cover their household food costs, with 65% of those with lower incomes facing this issue. Another survey last week found that 53% of Canadians view immigration negatively, and 72% consider Trudeau's goal of accepting 500,000 immigrants in 2025 to be too ambitious. Trudeau's government has been criticized for its high immigration levels, which have led to a 2.7% annual population growth rate, the highest since 1957. Trudeau himself acknowledged in April that Canada cannot absorb the high number of immigrants arriving in recent years, and his government has since announced measures to reduce the number.

**Will Sturgeon, Matheson and Yousaf step down in 2026?**
The Scottish National Party (SNP) is looking to refresh its talent in the Scottish Parliament after the party's poor performance in the general election. Several high-profile politicians, including Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf, and Michael Matheson, may step down in 2026. James Dornan, Christine Grahame, and John Mason have already confirmed their intention not to seek re-election. Former SNP MPs, such as Stewart McDonald, Owen Thompson, and Alyn Smith, could make bids for Holyrood seats. The party's NEC will select candidates by April 2025, with the election taking place in May 2026. 'It's this pathetic type of politics and politicians such as Ross that make me glad this is my last term as an MSP,' said James Dornan, who intends to stand down in 2026. 'I knew to quit while you're ahead,' added Christine Grahame, who will not seek re-election. 'I believe it is the right time to explore new paths,' said Stewart McDonald, who will not stand in 2026. 'I am glad this is my last term as an MSP,' said John Mason, who was recently expelled from the party.

**Just in: Parliament is directed by the Supreme Court to permit four members whose seats were declared vacant to do this.**
The Supreme Court has ordered Parliament to allow four MPs whose seats were declared vacant by Speaker Alban Bagbin to remain in office until a verdict is rendered. The MPs, Andrew Asiamah Amoako, Peter Kwakye Ackah, Kwadwo Asante, and Cynthia Morrison, were deemed to have vacated their seats due to Article 97 (1)(g) of the Constitution, which requires MPs to resign if they leave their party or run as independents. The court's decision temporarily halts the Speaker's October 17 decision, and the MPs will continue to carry out their legislative duties while the legal dispute is settled. According to the court's order, 'the four MPs will carry out their legislative responsibilities while the legal dispute about the validity of the Speaker's decision is settled.'

**Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's own Liberal MPs finalising plans to make him resign - Times of India**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing increasing pressure to resign due to rising tensions within the Liberal Party. Liberal MPs, including Sean Casey, Wayne Long, and Alexandra Mendès, have called for Trudeau's resignation, citing a strong desire for change among constituents. Reports suggest that at least 20 MPs are prepared to support this movement, with plans for a written demand to be presented soon. However, there is no clear consensus on what actions will follow if Trudeau refuses to resign. The situation is further complicated by Jagmeet Singh's recent decision to withdraw the New Democratic Party (NDP) from the Trudeau government, which has prompted concerns among Liberal MPs about their chances in the upcoming election scheduled for October 2025. Recent polls indicate that both Trudeau's Liberals and Singh's NDP are experiencing declining popularity, while the Conservatives are positioned favorably.

**Liberal MPs will present official demand for Trudeau to resign in coming days, sources say**
Liberal MPs are planning to present an official demand for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign within days, with at least 20 MPs expected to sign the letter. The demand will be presented in two steps: first, in writing as soon as this weekend, and second, in an open microphone session at the party's next caucus meeting in Ottawa. While there is no ultimatum attached to the demands, several Liberal MPs have expressed frustration with Trudeau's leadership and believe that he cannot stay on. However, a senior government official disputes this, saying that only a handful of MPs will come forward and that many have already decided not to run for re-election. The Prime Minister's Office is skeptical of the number of dissenting MPs, but several Liberal MPs have publicly called for leadership change, including Wayne Long, Alexandra Mendès, and Sean Casey. Casey said that the country owes Trudeau a 'debt of gratitude' but that his constituents have 'tuned him out' and want change.

**Could the Darleen Tana saga finally be coming to an end?**
Green Party delegates will vote on whether to remove Darleen Tana from parliament, after she was suspended from the party in March 2024 amid allegations of migrant exploitation at her husband's ebike business. Tana disputed the findings and quit the party, but not parliament, and has since been drawing an MP's salary as an independent. The Greens are considering invoking the party-hopping provisions of the Electoral Act 1993, which would require the speaker to declare her seat vacant. Tana has appealed a High Court ruling that dismissed her claim, but the meeting will proceed as planned. If delegates give the go-ahead, the Greens would get a new MP, Benjamin Doyle, and Tana would be out of a job. If not, she would stay on as an independent MP.

**'MPs are not robots' - Atta Akyea defends MPs' right to change their minds - MyJoyOnline**
Akim Abuakwa South legislator Samuel Atta Akyea argued that MPs should not be forced to vacate their seats simply because they express future political intentions. He stated, 'The issue here is that these MPs are addressing their future intentions. They've not said that as of now they want to abandon where they are for any other direction.' Atta Akyea emphasized the importance of making a clear distinction between present commitments and future aspirations, and warned that reducing MPs to unthinking entities would be 'like reducing the members of Parliament to robots. They can't think, they can't change their minds.' He also pointed out that intentions can change, and it is unreasonable to pre-emptively judge MPs based on a future possibility. Atta Akyea's perspective challenges the rigidity of some interpretations of parliamentary conduct, promoting the idea that MPs must retain their freedom to think, express intentions, and change course without undue punishment. According to Atta Akyea,  some MPs have declared their intention to contest as independent candidates in the upcoming 2024 parliamentary elections, but this does not equate to crossing the proverbial political carpet. The percentage of MPs who have made such declarations is not specified in the article.

**Up to a dozen Tory MPs consider quitting over Labour’s second job crackdown**
Up to a dozen Tory MPs are considering quitting after the Labour government's second job crackdown. The new rules aim to prevent MPs from taking on second jobs that do not prioritize their constituents. However, Tory MPs are furious about the proposals and have threatened to quit before the next general election. According to The Times, senior party sources expect 'a drip of resignations' to begin after the Tory leadership contest. One former cabinet minister is quoted as saying they are 'growing tired of the job' and 'thinking about how much more they can make on the outside.'

**Tory MPs consider resigning over Labour’s second job crackdown**
Up to a dozen Conservative MPs are considering resigning before the next election due to Labour's crackdown on second jobs. Senior party sources expect 'a drip of resignations' to start after the Tory leadership contest in the new year. Those who served in Rishi Sunak's government and were passed over for senior shadow cabinet roles are most likely to quit. One former cabinet minister said they are 'growing tired of the job' and 'thinking about how much more they can make on the outside'. Another has been offered a job in the US and is considering their position if they are not given a senior role under the next Conservative leader. Labour has pledged to reform the system so that all MPs are subject to the same rules, including declaring gifts monthly in the register of interests. Some Conservative MPs are 'thinking twice' about accepting 'what used to be considered perks of the job' and are doubting their chances of getting back into power. 'I find it hard to believe the Conservatives will be back in power — we need an absolute majority and there’s no coalition that works for us,' one party insider said. Senior Conservative sources said that about a dozen MPs were considering standing down before the next election — about 10 per cent of the parliamentary party.

**MPs set to vote on abolishing hereditary peers from House of Lords**
MPs are set to vote on Tuesday to remove the remaining 92 hereditary peers from the House of Lords, a move that could pave the way for the clear-out of seats for people who inherit their titles through family ties by next year. According to Labour's election manifesto, the lingering peers' positions are 'indefensible' and the party plans to introduce legislation to remove their right to sit and vote in the House of Lords. The King's Speech earlier this year stated that removing the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords would be a 'first step' in reforming the chamber, and Labour's plan would eventually see the upper chamber abolished and replaced with an 'alternative chamber' that's more representative of the UK.

**Trudeau Under Fire: Over 20 Canadian MPs Demand Leadership Change Amid Rising Discontent**
Over 20 Canadian MPs are demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation due to recent poll defeats in Toronto and Montreal. The discontent began after the Liberal Party's loss in the Toronto-St. Paul's byelection in June and worsened after the disappointing performance in the Montreal byelection. According to reports, at least 30 to 40 MPs are ready to sign a letter demanding Trudeau's resignation, but the total number may still fall short of the critical mass needed for a leadership change. Trade Minister Mary Ng expressed disappointment over the MPs' plan and reaffirmed her confidence in Trudeau, stating, 'This is an insurance policy. We needed to act before the pressure from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) intensifies.' The current climate within the Liberal Party raises questions about the stability of Trudeau's leadership and the future of his government as tensions mount ahead of upcoming elections.

**UK Prime Minister Rejects Suspension of Arms Sales to Israel**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated, 'To suspend all sales would mean that defensive sales would also be suspended.' He emphasized that suspending all sales would be a wrong approach, especially after the 7 October attack and Iran's large-scale attack. Starmer said, 'I will not do this.' He also stated that the region cannot bear another year of this, and that all parties must take a step back and show restraint. He added that his country's focus is on the British citizens in Lebanon, and that 430 British citizens have been evacuated so far. Starmer also emphasized that Israel should allow more aid to enter Gaza. Labour Party MP Emily Thornberry asked if the Prime Minister could say that the region's British actions are being taken to reduce tension, promote peace, and protect all civilians. Starmer replied, 'We are doing what we can to reduce tension in the region.' Scottish National Party leader Stephen Flynn asked if the UK would support Israel if it retaliates against Iran. Starmer replied, 'Our intervention was related to Israel's right to defend itself. The support we gave was related to that, and we are always ready to give that support.' Independent MP Richard Burgeon asked if the UK should take more severe measures, including suspending arms sales, to pressure Israel to go to the negotiating table. Starmer replied, 'I do not agree with suspending all sales. This would mean suspending defensive sales as well. Looking at Iran's attacks a few days ago, Parliament will understand my position.' Labour Party MP Zarah Sultana asked if the Prime Minister would suspend all arms sales, including those for F35s, and make the morally and legally right decision. Starmer replied, 'No. To suspend all sales would mean suspending defensive sales as well. This would be a wrong approach, especially after the 7 October attack and Iran's large-scale attack. I will not do this.'

**Official voices call for 'filing' names for President Boric's new cabinet with time to spare**
According to the current legislation, government officials must resign by November 16, 2024, to be eligible to run in the 2025 parliamentary elections without being affected by the ineligibility period. Official voices are suggesting that officials should resign with time to spare, and there are already rumors about possible changes in the cabinet, such as the departure of Interior Minister Manuel Monsalve and Defense Minister Maya Fernández. Government Spokeswoman Camila Vallejo is also considering leaving her position due to maternity leave. Various politicians have emphasized the importance of planning ahead for the replacement of authorities for the next period. 'Authorities established (...) must cease in their office no later than 00:00 hours on November 16, 2024,' as stipulated by the current legislation. This includes ministers, governors, presidential delegates, mayors, regional councilors, councilors, and subsecretaries, as well as members of other state bodies. 'They must present their resignation in advance to avoid being affected by the ineligibility period,' according to the Electoral Service (Servel). In the political spheres, there are already rumors about who plans to leave their position. For example, Interior Minister Manuel Monsalve is reportedly planning to resign to take a senatorial position, while Defense Minister Maya Fernández is said to be considering a position in the Valparaíso region. Other names mentioned include Antonia Orellana, Minister of Women, and Camila Vallejo, Government Spokeswoman, who is considering taking maternity leave. 'We have had other authorities of trust, perhaps of lower hierarchical rank, who have had pregnancies while in office, and we have respected their pre- and postnatal leave. This is what corresponds, even if the positions are of trust,' Vallejo said in August, confirming that she will take advantage of the leave. The PPD deputy Raúl Soto stated that the replacement is always positive, especially to start the last stage of the Executive. The president of the Frente Amplio, Constanza Martínez, said that it is evident to have these conversations when key dates approach, in this case, the 2025 elections. The Liberal deputy Sebastián Videla revealed that he has information that the parties are being contacted to propose names for the key positions. 'October is the month,' he said, referring to the time the President should take to analyze the names that will form his new cabinet. The senator Esteban Velásquez (FRVS) agrees with the date and stated that the President should analyze the suitability of the position among his entourage. He exemplified that he has seen how President Boric has shared with figures of dubious reputation in the region, something he hopes will not reach the central government.

**Revolts and resignations: a timeline of Starmer's first three months in power**
Keir Starmer's first three months as Labour leader have been marked by scandals, resignations, and rebellions. The timeline includes the suspension of seven MPs who supported an amendment to scrap the two-child benefit limit, the 'Freebiegate' scandal, the backlash over removing pensioners' winter fuel allowance, Rosie Duffield's resignation with a scathing attack on Starmer, and Sue Gray's resignation as Starmer's chief of staff. Nadia Whittome said the decision to suspend the MPs was 'appalling' and that the party should be able to 'tolerate disagreement without making threats and employing the most severe punishments.' Starmer repaid £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality he had received since taking office. The party's conference lost a motion to reverse the cuts to winter fuel payments, and dozens of Labour MPs refused to back the plan to cut the allowance. Rosie Duffield resigned from the party, denouncing Starmer's 'cruel and unnecessary' policies. Sue Gray resigned as chief of staff, citing the 'intense commentary around my position risked becoming a distraction to the government's vital work of change.'

**MPs suspended over sexual allegations still have access passes to Westminster**
Two former Labour MPs, Simon Danczuk and Ivan Lewis, who were suspended over sexual allegations, still have access to Westminster through 'category X' passes. Danczuk was suspended in 2015 over explicit text messages to a 17-year-old girl and has used his pass six times last year and three times this year. Lewis was suspended in 2017 over allegations of sexual harassment and has used his pass once this year and once in 2023. The Commons maintains that passholders have limited, unescorted access to the parliamentary estate, but critics argue that the system is 'the very opposite of open government' and that suspended ex-MPs can use their passes with impunity. Alistair Burt, the former Conservative MP for North East Bedfordshire, was the most frequent holder, making 31 visits over the timeframe.

**Conservative Party Seeks New Leader After Electoral Defeat**
The Conservative Party in the UK is holding a conference in Birmingham to find a new leader after their electoral defeat in July. Rishi Sunak announced his resignation as party leader and prime minister after the party's loss, which ended 14 years of Conservative governments. The conference will be the first step in finding Sunak's successor, with four candidates vying for the position. Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick are seen as more conservative candidates, while James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat are considered more centrist. According to the British press, Jenrick has a slight lead in the voting intentions of Conservative MPs, but the elections are expected to be close. 'My impression is that there is no dominant candidate. This shows the problem they have in finding a strong, consensual, and attractive leader for the general public,' said Ezequiel González Ocantos, a professor of Political Science at the University of Oxford. The new leader will be chosen by the party members, who will vote until the end of October, and the winner will be announced on November 2. The party is in crisis after losing 244 seats in the last election and must now decide whether to move to the right or center. 'The Conservative Party faces a dilemma: whether to turn definitively to the right and compete for the voter who chose Reform UK, or to moderate and focus on competing with Labour for the narrative of who is competent to govern the country,' analyzed González Ocantos.

Former Labour MP Rosie Duffield has resigned from the party, stating that she feels Labour supporters are being 'completely taken for granted'. She criticized Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's decision to keep the two-child benefit cap and means-test winter fuel payments, as well as his handling of gifts given to him and other senior Labour figures. Duffield said the party leadership is 'more about greed and power than making a difference', and that she has lost her 'faith' in the leadership. She also criticized Sir Keir's management of his party, saying he has 'never regularly engaged' with backbench MPs and lacks 'basic politics and political instincts'. Her resignation follows the suspension of seven other Labour MPs who rebelled on the King's Speech, bringing the total number of Independent MPs to 14.

**Labour MP Rosie Duffield Quits Party Over Disagreements with Keir Starmer**
Labour MP Rosie Duffield resigned from the party over the weekend, accusing UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer of being 'hypocritical' and implementing 'cruel and unnecessary' policies. In a letter of resignation, Duffield attacked Starmer's decision to maintain the two-child benefit cap and cut energy assistance for pensioners, as well as his handling of the recent controversy over gifts received by the Prime Minister and other senior party officials. 'Someone with a wealth far above the average who chooses to maintain the two-child benefit cap imposed by the Conservatives on social benefits, which plunges children into poverty, while inexplicably accepting expensive personal gifts such as designer suits and glasses that cost more than most people can afford, does not deserve to be called the Labour Prime Minister at all,' Duffield wrote. Duffield, who represented the Labour Party in the Canterbury constituency in southeast England, had already been at odds with the party over issues related to trans rights. She stated that she was 'ashamed' of Starmer's work as Labour leader due to his 'sordidness, nepotism, and apparent avarice' and announced that she would join the independent MPs' bloc. Elected for the first time in 2017, Duffield's decision to leave the party follows the suspension of seven other Labour MPs who rebelled in the Queen's speech and voted in favor of a motion to abolish the two-child benefit cap, bringing the number of independent MPs in the British Parliament to 14.

**Thread by @LuwieNiranjan on Thread Reader App**
Following the Prime Minister's resignation, the Cabinet of Ministers has been dissolved, leaving the President with limited options for appointing a new cabinet. However, the PM's resignation may actually make it easier for the President to justify appointing an NPP member as PM, as the Constitution requires the President to appoint an MP who is likely to command the confidence of Parliament. According to the Constitution, the President's opinion must be objective, but the current political formation of Parliament makes it difficult to determine who has the confidence of the house. The President can now decide to appoint one of the 3 NPP members as PM, but this would raise questions about whether the PM has the confidence of the house. Alternatively, the President can consult with the leaders of political parties in Parliament to determine whether Parliament can move forward, considering important issues such as appropriations for the next year. Even if Parliament is dissolved today, the earliest an election can happen is mid-November, which is cutting it close.

**Ed Davey tells new Lib Dem MPs to cling on like 'Japanese knotweed' in ex-Tory seats won at the election - as his deputy blasts 'weird' Conservative leadership hopefuls**
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has told his new MPs to become 'like Japanese knotweed' in former Tory seats, making it difficult for the Conservatives to remove them. The party is holding its annual conference in Brighton, celebrating their best election result ever with 72 MPs. Sir Ed has pledged to hold the new Labour government to account as a 'constructive opposition', but his deputy, Daisy Cooper, has criticized the Tory leadership candidates as 'weird' for discussing irrelevant issues. The party plans to continue using stunts to deliver policy messages, with Daisy Cooper saying 'most of our stunts come with a very serious message'. The party's focus is on issues like the NHS and care reform, with Sir Ed calling for everyone to have the right to see a GP within seven days. According to NHS data, there were 10.3 million waits of four weeks or longer for GP appointments in the seven months to July 2024, a higher number than the same time last year. Daisy Cooper will discuss the NHS in her keynote speech, saying 'you don't have freedom, if you're on a waiting list so long that your world shrinks and you're stuck hobbling at home between a couple of rooms.'

**Labour's three tiers of rebels are collapsing party unity**
Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer suffered his biggest rebellion yet, with 53 Labour MPs voting against or abstaining from the Conservative motion to block the winter fuel payments cut. The rebels can be divided into three tiers: the first tier includes suspended Labour MPs who voted against the Government, such as John McDonnell, who said 'I needed to look my constituents in the face but regretted voting with these characters.' The second tier includes Jon Trickett, who voted with the opposition to block the cut, saying 'I revolted to defend my constituents.' The third tier includes MPs who abstained against the Government, such as Rachel Maskell, the rebel ringleader. It's unclear how party managers will deal with these rebels, with Downing Street yet to comment.

**Trudeau faces internal discontent as key meeting with party MPs begins**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing internal discontent within his caucus as a key meeting with party MPs begins. Liberal Party MP Alexandra Mendes stated that her constituents are calling for Trudeau to step down, saying, 'I didn't hear it from two, three people. I heard it from dozens and dozens of people. He's no longer the right leader.' New Brunswick MP Wayne Long has also called for Trudeau's resignation before the next Federal election in October 2025. The possibility of earlier elections has grown with the New Democratic Party withdrawing from the supply-and-confidence agreement. Trudeau announced that former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, will join the government as a special advisor on economic issues, saying, 'Mark's unique ideas and perspectives will play a vital role in shaping the next steps in our plan to continue to grow our economy and strengthen the middle class.' However, some Indo-Canadian MPs have expressed concerns over the party's direction, driven by worries about their own survival in the next election, as the Liberals trail the Conservatives by 15-20 points in opinion polls.

**50 Labour MPs Expected to Vote Against Winter Fuel Allowance Cut**
According to The Guardian, 50 Labour Party MPs are expected to vote against the government's controversial plan to cut the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. Despite Prime Minister Keir Starmer's call for backbenchers to support the policy, which he described as 'unpopular', a small number of government MPs are expected to vote against it. Many more are considering abstaining or boycotting the vote, with some rebels saying that the numbers are difficult to predict. After seven Labour MPs were suspended in July for voting in favor of the Scottish National Party's amendment to the child benefit cap, it is assumed that a similar rebellion on Tuesday will bring the same consequences. One Labour MP said, 'I expect the majority of the objectors to abstain. Abstaining is the new rebellion.' Despite the lack of a chance to lose the vote, a large number of absences indicates the level of concern about the policy, which many rebels fear will lead to a loss of votes for the party, described by one MP as 'a ridiculous offer.' Starmer and Downing Street have not commented on the potential punishment for the rebels before the vote, which has been officially raised by the Conservative opposition to the policy of depriving everyone except the poorest pensioners of the fuel allowance in winter. However, in his first major TV interview since becoming Prime Minister, Starmer explained that he is unlikely to tolerate open defiance. He said, 'We are going to vote. I am glad we are going to vote, because I think it is very important that Parliament speaks about this. But every Labour MP was elected with the same mandate that I was elected with, which was to bring the change that we need for the country.' However, some Labour MPs claim that the winter fuel allowance is different, due to concerns about the impact on many elderly people and because it was not in the party's manifesto. Starmer repeated the argument that the annual cost of £1.5 billion for not paying the allowance to all pensioners regardless of income was a key factor in plugging a £22 billion hole in the government's finances that was discovered after they took office. He said that the Conservative government 'ran away from difficult decisions.'

**'This is a significant change': How Liberals are reacting to the resignation of their party's campaign director**
The resignation of Jeremy Broadhurst, the Liberal Party's national campaign director, has been met with a mix of reactions from Liberal MPs. Some, like Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, see it as a 'significant change' and an opportunity for the party to change its approach and improve its chances in the next federal campaign. Others, like Yasir Naqvi, downplay the significance of Broadhurst's departure, saying 'people come and go' in politics. However, many Liberals agree that the party needs a 'street fighter' leading their campaign against the Conservatives, who are positioning themselves as scrappy populists. The resignation comes after the New Democratic Party (NDP) pulled out of the parliamentary alliance that was supposed to keep the Liberal minority government in power until at least June 2025, making an early federal election more likely. Liberal MPs like John McKay and Marcus Powlowski believe that the death of the NDP deal cements Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's position as Liberal leader, and that he is 'pretty well locked in' for the next election.

**No 10's message to jittery Labour MPs: Toughen up**
Labour MPs are feeling under siege with a surge in complaints from constituents about the government's choices, including the cut to winter fuel payments. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is hosting drinks receptions for Labour MPs, but the message from Number 10 is 'toughen up' and not rebel on spending cuts. Keir Starmer said, 'They do and there's tough decisions to come,' and emphasized the need to 'grip the issue' and 'fix the foundations.' He warned that rebelling on key issues would undermine the government's economic plan. With 7 Labour MPs suspended for rebelling on the two-child limit on benefits, the message is clear: 'We will not be able to do that if we don't do the tough stuff now.'

**British Conservatives Begin Search for New Party Leader**
The British Conservative Party has begun the process of selecting a new party leader after their loss in the recent parliamentary election. The party is looking for a replacement for former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who announced his resignation after the election. Six candidates have put themselves forward for the position, including former Economic Minister Kemi Badenoch and former Home Secretary James Cleverly. According to the PA news agency, many MPs support Robert Jenrick, the former Secretary of State for Immigration, who has received public support from 17 faction members, compared to 13 for Badenoch. The party's faction has 121 members. Badenoch, Jenrick, and former Home Secretary Priti Patel are considered to be part of the party's right-wing, while Cleverly is seen as a more moderate politician. Experts believe that the Conservative Party will continue to move to the right in response to the success of the right-wing Reform UK party, which won five seats in the parliament for the first time. The new party leader will be chosen by the party's members and will be announced on November 2. The winner will also become the new leader of the opposition in parliament.

**UK's Corbyn forms parliamentary alliance with four other pro-Gaza MPs**
Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and four other independent pro-Gaza MPs have formed a parliamentary group, the Independent Alliance, to stop austerity and halt arms trade with Israel. The group, which has the same number of MPs as the Reform UK party and the Democratic Unionist Party, aims to hold the government to account and allow for more formal questioning in parliament. Mr Corbyn, who was expelled from the Labour party earlier this year, said, 'The more MPs who are prepared to stand up for these principles, the better. Our door is always open to other MPs who believe in a more equal and peaceful world.' The group has already attracted criticism from politicians, including Kemi Badenoch, who said, 'When everyone was talking about the five new MPs from Reform, I was far, far more worried about the five new MPs elected on the back of sectarian Islamist politics, alien ideas that have no place here.' The UK government has announced an arms embargo on 30 weapons export licences to Israel, citing 'serious violations' of international humanitarian law. The Independent Alliance has called on other politicians to join the alliance, with speculation that other suspended Labour MPs could join forces in the near future.

**Corbyn forms new group with four pro-Gaza MPs**
Jeremy Corbyn has formed a new group, the Independent Alliance, with four other MPs who were elected as independents in the 2024 general election. The group, which includes Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, and Iqbal Mohamed, aims to campaign for scrapping the two-child benefit limit and against arms sales to Israel. The group has already been working together informally for months and has reached out to seven Labour MPs who were suspended from the parliamentary party for voting in favour of abolishing the two-child benefit cap. In a joint statement, the Independent Alliance said, 'Already, this government has scrapped the winter fuel allowance for around 10 million pensioners, voted to keep the two-child benefits cap, and ignored calls to end arms sales to Israel. Millions of people are crying out for a real alternative to austerity, inequality and war – and their voices deserve to be heard.' The group hopes to gain more funds for their campaign work and the opportunity to choose debate topics and be allocated more questions in Parliament.
