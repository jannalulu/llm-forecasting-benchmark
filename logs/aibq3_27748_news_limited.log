Magnus Carlsen has confirmed that he will play in the Speed Chess Championship-2024 in Paris, despite his previous conflicts with Hans Niemann. Niemann, who has been accused of cheating, has been reinstated on Chess.com and has been performing well in the tournament. Carlsen has stated that he will not engage in a discussion with Niemann, saying 'I've said what I had to say on camera and in the documentary that will come out.' Carlsen has won the Speed Chess Championship three times, while Niemann has been accused of cheating and has been at the center of a scandal involving Chess.com and other top players.

'I think he's a sick and lost person who wanted to destroy my life,' Niemann said in an interview. 'He did what he did out of pure revenge. I don't understand how people don't sympathize with what happened to me. I wasn't the aggressor, I wasn't the cause of all this, all I did was win a chess game. I don't understand how you can't come to the conclusion that Chess.com, Magnus, Hikaru, the Chess.com streamers - all of them entered into a conspiracy to destroy my life, not because they think I'm a cheater, but because they have common financial interests.'

**Chess Rivals Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann to Face Off for the First Time Since Cheating Controversy**
Rival chess grandmasters Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann will face off for the first time since the cheating controversy in September 2022. Carlsen had previously stated he didn't want to play against Niemann again, citing concerns about cheating. However, thanks to the Speed Chess Championships, they will now compete in the semifinals on September 6. The winner will advance to the championship and compete for the top spot and a share of the $175,000 prize pool in Paris, France. The match has been highly anticipated, with Niemann filing a $100 million lawsuit against Carlsen and Chess.com, alleging defamation and conspiracy. The lawsuit was eventually dropped, and Niemann was reinstated by Chess.com. Niemann has vowed to become 'the best chess player in the world.' The question remains whether he will achieve this goal. 'We must do something about cheating, and for my part going forward, I don't want to play against people that have cheated repeatedly in the past, because I don't know what they are capable of doing in the future,' Carlsen wrote on X.

**Hans Niemann against the World**
Hans Niemann, a 21-year-old American grandmaster, has been on a roll, defeating Wesley So 13-10 in the Chess.com Speed Chess Championship quarter-final and winning two matches in his 'Hans Niemann against the World' series against Anish Giri and Nikita Vitiugov. Despite his success, Niemann has been at odds with the 'chess establishment', including Chess.com and Magnus Carlsen, with whom he has a history of controversy. Niemann has been invited to top-tier events, but has damaged his reputation with incidents such as damaging a hotel room. He has been organizing his own matches, which have been well-received, and will face Carlsen in the Speed Chess Championship semi-final. Carlsen, the world no. 1, is a heavy favourite, but Niemann should not be underestimated, as he has been playing 'quite well' according to Carlsen.

**Hans Niemann: The guy who's up against the world**
Two years ago, American grandmaster Hans Niemann's life changed when he defeated world No.1 Magnus Carlsen in the Sinquefield Cup. Carlsen immediately withdrew from the tournament and accused Niemann of cheating. Niemann denied the allegations, but the controversy has followed him ever since. Niemann has since launched his own series of one-on-one matches against fellow GMs, titled 'Hans Niemann Against The World.' According to Niemann, it's his way of dealing with being treated like a pariah since the controversy. Vidit Gujrathi, who played against Niemann in June, said, 'I think what Hans is doing is good for chess. Every sport has special characters who bring money and attention to the game and evoke strong emotions in people.' Niemann has since defeated top players like Anish Giri, Wesley So, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and is now ranked world No.22. He is set to play Carlsen in the semifinals of the Speed Chess Championship in Paris on September 6. Niemann said, 'I deserve an apology but I'm not a victim so I don't need an apology… my vengeance will be victory on the board.' Levon Aronian, who played in the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, recalls the controversy and says, 'The rest of us just lost the motivation to play after the withdrawal and accusations.' Gujrathi believes that anti-cheating measures need to be more stringent and that spectators should not be able to see the live position when they come in.

**Niemann Launches Frontal Attack on Carlsen, Accusing Him of Lying and Trying to Destroy His Life**
Hans Niemann has launched a frontal attack on Magnus Carlsen, calling him a 'sick person with delusional ideas who wants to destroy my life.' Niemann made the comments to Chess.com, saying that Carlsen lied about him and used his resources, money, and power to destroy his life. This is not the first time the two have clashed, as Niemann accused Carlsen of cheating in 2022 and sued him. Carlsen won the case in December, but Niemann is now speaking out again. Chess.com commentator Daniel Rensch responded to Niemann's criticism, saying that there is no conspiracy theory, but rather a deep concern about a player with a history of cheating. Rensch acknowledged that Niemann has received negative attention in the media, which can be difficult for a young person. The two are set to meet in the semifinals of the Speed Chess Championship in September, if Carlsen wins his upcoming match.
