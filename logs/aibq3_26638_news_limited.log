**What Supreme Court's overturning of Chevron deference means for auto industry regulation**
The US Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Chevron deference doctrine has significant implications for the regulation of the auto industry. The doctrine required courts to defer to federal agencies' expertise when interpreting ambiguous statutes. The ruling is expected to limit the power of agencies such as the EPA and NHTSA, which regulate tailpipe emissions and corporate average fuel economy standards. However, experts say that automotive regulators are uniquely positioned to handle judicial challenges due to their tendency to compromise with industry and their ability to work out disagreements before regulations are published. The EPA and NHTSA are on relatively solid legal footing given the strength of the statutes governing their rulemaking, but the Clean Air Act, which gives the EPA authority to regulate tailpipe emissions, is broad and ambiguous, making it more susceptible to challenge. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which requires NHTSA to set CAFE standards, is more direct and less likely to be successfully challenged.

**Project 2025 partners join right-wing media and climate deniers to celebrate SCOTUS decision overturning Chevron deference**
The Supreme Court has overturned Chevron deference, a 40-year-old precedent that allowed federal agencies to regulate industries and protect the environment. This decision will restrict agencies' abilities and make it easier for corporations to challenge environmental protections, climate action, and regulations. The ruling has been celebrated by right-wing media and climate deniers, who argue that it will reduce the power of the 'modern administrative state' and restore checks and balances. However, critics argue that this decision will undermine the ability of federal agencies to protect the public interest.

**U.S. Supreme Court flips precedent that empowered federal agencies**
The US Supreme Court has overturned a 40-year-old precedent that gave federal agencies broad discretion to interpret laws, potentially undermining decisions made by scientists and agency experts. The 6-3 and 6-2 decisions in two cases challenge a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rule and overturn the principle of Chevron deference, which allowed agencies to use their judgment to resolve ambiguities in federal statutes. The court's conservatives argue that courts should not defer to agencies and instead apply their own legal reasoning to reach a sound decision. The decision has been criticized for potentially stripping agencies of the power to enact regulatory safeguards across a range of issues, including clean air and public health.

**Supreme Court Limits Federal Agencies' Regulatory Power By Reversing 40-Year-Old Chevron Precedent**
The Supreme Court has overturned a 40-year-old precedent, the Chevron doctrine, which gave federal agencies the power to interpret ambiguous statutes when creating and enforcing regulations. The court's six conservative justices voted to overturn the doctrine, which has impacted various areas such as clean air and water regulations, FCC regulations, and more. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that Chevron defies the Administrative Procedure Act and gives too much power to agencies. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, arguing that the majority's decision gives the court too much power and turns it into the country's administrative czar. The decision makes it more likely that regulations will be challenged, absent specific congressional action.

**EPA Defends Good Neighbor Ozone Rule Enforcement Post-Chevron**
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defended its ability to enforce the Good Neighbor Ozone Rule, despite the recent US Supreme Court decision to overturn the Chevron doctrine. The EPA stated that the court's decision should not invalidate its disapproval of states' ozone plans. Texas had submitted a supplemental authority to challenge the agency's implementation of the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards Good Neighbor Provision, claiming that the EPA had subverted the law's 'cooperative-federalism' intent by disapproving its plan to reach federal ozone standards.

**Did the Supreme Court's Chevron decision automatically throw out EPA rules?**
The Supreme Court's recent decision to limit the authority of regulatory agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), does not automatically repeal existing policies. The Chevron ruling, overturned on June 28, 2024, gave agencies wide latitude to interpret laws and make policies, but the new decision shifts power to the courts, allowing them to more easily overturn or affirm agency policies when challenged. The ruling applies only to cases and controversies arising 'going forward.'

**Nation at stake after Supreme Court overturns Chevron**
The US Supreme Court has overturned the Chevron doctrine, a 40-year-old precedent that allowed administrative agencies to make reasonable interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. The decision will have far-reaching effects on various government agencies, including the EPA, labor agencies, the FDA, and healthcare. The ruling will make it more difficult for agencies to regulate industries, enforce workplace safety, and make decisions on climate change. The decision was endorsed by many Republicans, who have long sought to limit the power of administrative agencies. The reversal of Chevron will likely lead to increased litigation and challenges to government regulations. The decision is seen as a major blow to the Biden administration's efforts to address climate change and promote clean energy.

**Energy After SCOTUS Overturns Chevron Deference**
The US Supreme Court has overturned Chevron deference, a precedent that allowed federal agencies to interpret laws without judicial review. The ruling, effective June 28th, 2024, returns power to the courts and may lead to increased litigation in energy-related industries. The decision could impact environmental regulations, including those related to fossil fuel plants and natural gas turbines. Experts are divided on the implications, with some viewing it as a victory for courts and environmental law, while others see it as a power grab for the judiciary. The ruling may lead to more disputes being resolved in courts, and energy companies and environmental organizations should prepare for this new legal and regulatory environment.

**Inside Clarence Thomas' new legal target: 'It's unconstitutional'**
The US Supreme Court's recent ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo has overturned the 1984 decision Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., which established 'Chevron deference', allowing judges to defer to federal regulatory agencies. Critics argue that the new ruling undermines government agencies' ability to regulate various areas, including clean water, air quality, and healthcare. Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed his desire to abolish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), citing its power as unconstitutional. Thomas believes that OSHA's authority is too broad, extending to virtually every business in the US. The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals previously upheld OSHA's constitutionality in 2023.

**US Supreme Court Overturns Decades-Old Chevron Decision**
The US Supreme Court has overturned the 40-year-old Chevron deference doctrine, which granted federal agencies the power to provide expert opinion on how laws should be interpreted. This decision could have disastrous consequences for federal ability to provide expert perspective on and enforce environmental protections. The Chevron doctrine was established in the 1984 US court case Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., where the court ruled that if the intention of Congress is clear within a bill, it must be followed by both courts and federal agencies. However, if the bill is deemed to have multiple possible interpretations, courts must defer judgment to the expert opinion of the agency responsible for enforcement of the bill, as long as the interpretation is deemed reasonable. Environmental NGOs fear that this will allow for biased, non-expert rulings to weaken and prevent critical application of public policy, especially related to environmental protection, and could lead to the weakening of foundational legislation like the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act.

**Biden Tailpipe Emission Rules on Shakier Ground After Supreme Court Ruling**
A recent US Supreme Court decision limiting federal regulatory powers could undermine President Joe Biden's efforts to reduce tailpipe emissions from vehicles. The decision, which overturned the 'Chevron deference' precedent, may make it harder for federal agencies to defend stringent regulations, particularly those targeting mobile sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental attorneys Sherry Jackman and David Pettit believe that critics will use the decision to challenge vehicle rules regulating greenhouse gases, citing the Clean Air Act's ambiguity on regulating emissions from mobile sources.

**Democrats, anticipating Chevron's demise, gave E.P.A. more power in recent climate law.**
The Biden administration anticipated the potential overturn of the Chevron doctrine and prepared by working with congressional Democrats to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which amends the Clean Air Act to give the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gases and promote renewable energy sources. The law defines carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels as an 'air pollutant', providing explicit authority for the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide pollution and limit emissions from tailpipes and smokestacks. However, opponents of the rule, primarily the fossil fuel industry, are expected to challenge the regulations despite the new law.

**Supreme Court Overturns Chevron, Dealing Major Blow to Federal Agency Power**
The US Supreme Court has overturned the Chevron precedent, a 1984 decision that gave deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer. The 6-3 ruling favors fishing companies that challenged a government-run program monitoring overfishing off New England's coast. This decision marks the latest in a series of Supreme Court decisions limiting the authority of federal agencies. The Chevron doctrine, opposed by conservatives and business interests, has been used to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous laws. The Biden administration had defended the National Marine Fisheries Service regulation and the Chevron doctrine. The fish conservation program was started in 2020 and aimed to monitor 50% of declared herring fishing trips, with costs split between the federal government and the fishing industry. The program was suspended due to insufficient federal funding. The Supreme Court has issued other rulings this term involving the scope of agency powers, including rejecting the Securities and Exchange Commission's in-house enforcement of laws protecting investors against securities fraud and blocking an Environmental Protection Agency regulation aimed at reducing ozone emissions.
