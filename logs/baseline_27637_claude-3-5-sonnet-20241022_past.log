2025-02-12 22:36:35,010 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this forecast carefully:

1. The MTV VMAs Best Rock category typically recognizes rock music videos released in the eligible period.

2. Green Day's "Dilemma" is from their new album "Saviors" released in January 2024, making it eligible.

3. Key considerations:
- Green Day has historical success at VMAs with multiple wins
- However, rock category has become increasingly competitive with new acts
- The video reception has been moderate, not generating massive viral moments
- The song hasn't achieved extraordinary chart performance compared to other potential nominees
- Nominations haven't been announced yet, adding significant uncertainty
- MTV has been shifting focus towards newer artists in recent years
- The rock category often favors more contemporary/alternative sounds

4. Uncertainty factors:
- Nominations not yet announced
- Voting patterns unknown
- Competition unknown
- MTV's internal selection criteria not public

Given these factors, particularly the lack of nominations and moderate reception:

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.80%, with 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.
