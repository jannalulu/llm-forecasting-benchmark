**The AI industry is obsessed with Chatbot Arena, but it might not be the best benchmark | TechCrunch**
Chatbot Arena, a benchmark created by LMSYS, has become a popular tool for evaluating AI models. However, experts like Yuchen Lin and Mike Cook have raised concerns about the benchmark's limitations. They argue that the user base is not representative, and the voting process is unreliable. Additionally, the benchmark's reliance on post-processing and automated systems to label queries and rank models lacks systematic rigor. Furthermore, LMSYS' commercial ties and sponsorship from organizations with vested interests in the AI industry raise concerns about the benchmark's impartiality. Despite these flaws, Lin believes that Chatbot Arena provides a valuable service by offering real-time insights into how different models perform outside the lab. However, he suggests that LMSYS could improve the testing by designing benchmarks around different subtopics and using a more systematic approach to evaluate models.

**Anthropic Publishes Claude's System Prompts, Revealing Industry-First Move**
Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, has published its system prompts for the first time in the industry. These prompts determine what Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku should or should not do, as well as the tone of their responses. Unlike other companies in the field, such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta, Anthropic has chosen to share these prompts, citing concerns about competition and cyber attacks. The prompts restrict the models from opening URLs, other links, and videos, as well as identifying or naming people on images. They also prohibit the use of certain words, such as 'absolutely' or 'unconditionally'. When faced with a complex question, Claude's models do not apologize for not knowing the answer, unlike other models. According to Anthropic, the total revenue for mobile versions of Claude has surpassed $1 million, achieved in just 16 weeks. While not the fastest growth rate, Anthropic has surpassed Microsoft Copilot and Perplexity, which reached $1 million in 19 and 22 weeks, respectively.

**AI chatbots show promise but limitations on UK medical exam questions: a comparative performance study**
A study published in Nature evaluated the performance of seven large language models (LLMs) on simulated UK medical board exam questions. The results showed that ChatGPT-4 scored the highest with an average of 78.2%, followed by Bing (67.2%), Claude (64.4%), and Claude Instant (62.9%). Perplexity scored the lowest (56.1%). The LLMs performed better on multiple-choice questions than true/false or 'choose N' questions. The study suggests that while LLMs have potential as educational tools, they still have limitations and should not be relied upon as a primary source for medical education. The researchers recommend further refining of the models before implementation in medical education. The study also highlights the importance of continued research on refining LLM skills for complex tasks, such as medical exam questions. 'The performance of AI models may differ depending on the formulation of the prompt question,' the study concludes. 'The use of AI models as a secondary educational tool is propitious; however, using such models as a primary source is not recommended before further refining.'

**I asked all the major AI chatbots which is the most popular - here's what they said**
Meta AI's CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims that Meta AI will be the most used AI assistant by the end of the year, but experts from other AI chatbots, including Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Perplexity's Claude AI, are more cautious in their assessments. They recognize the importance of distribution, usage, and recognition, but also acknowledge the difficulty in comparing different AI models and their popularity. Google Gemini notes that each AI model has its own strengths and areas of expertise, while ChatGPT demurs from bragging about its own popularity. Microsoft Copilot tries to deflect attention from its own popularity, and Perplexity's Claude AI is too serious to engage in the discussion. The article concludes that AI popularity is a complex issue and that individual features, such as image generation and video editing, may be more relevant than overall popularity. A survey on Threads and X (formerly Twitter) found that ChatGPT was the most used AI chatbot, but it is unclear whether this equates to overall popularity.

**Russian Platform for Evaluating Generative Neural Networks Launched**
Roman Kutsen, a developer, has created a platform called LLM Arena in collaboration with experts from TrainingData.ru to evaluate the quality of large language models in Russian. The platform allows users to test and compare Russian neural networks in real-time, evaluating the relevance and quality of their responses. Users can compare the answers of two randomly selected models and choose the best one. The platform currently has 21 AI models available for testing, including both foreign (ChatGPT, LLaMa) and Russian (YandexGPT, GigaChat, Saiga) models. The developers plan to add new models regularly. According to Kutsen, 'Our goal is to create an objective, open, and up-to-date rating of language models in Russian. Despite the increasing number of benchmarks, testing Russian LLMs on real user tasks is very challenging. LMSYS Chatbot Arena does not provide access to any Russian neural networks, so we decided to create our own platform to allow users to compare Russian and foreign generative neural networks and make their own conclusions.'

**OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini isn't much better than rival LLMs**
OpenAI has released GPT-4o Mini, a smaller and cheaper version of its GPT-4o generative large language model (LLM). The Mini version is multimodal, can handle up to 16,000 tokens of output, and is trained on materials up to October 2023. While it is not fully featured yet, supporting only text and vision via its API, OpenAI claims it is ahead of comparable LLMs in benchmarks. However, veteran open source developer Simon Willison notes that the competition has released their own GPT-4-class models, and the pricing is not too bad. GPT-4o Mini is mostly ahead of the pack in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena benchmark, but full-size GPT-4o is only barely ahead of its rivals. OpenAI may no longer have the dominating lead it once had, but it is still a strong player in the LLM arena.
