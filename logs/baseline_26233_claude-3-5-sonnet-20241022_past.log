Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The question asks about comparing box office openings, with target being $185.5M (combined openings of previous films)

2. Key considerations:
- Deadpool & Wolverine releases July 26, 2024
- Both Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are starring
- This is the first R-rated MCU film
- Both characters have massive fan followings
- Inflation since previous films
- Marketing has been strong with viral Super Bowl ad
- Previous Deadpool 2 opened at $125.5M
- Recent superhero movie performance has been mixed
- Summer release timing is favorable
- First X-Men related property in MCU

3. Analysis:
- Combined star power likely to drive very strong opening
- Inflation alone would push previous combined total higher
- MCU connection should boost numbers significantly
- R-rating may limit some audience but didn't hurt Deadpool
- Recent marketing suggests strong awareness
- Summer timing optimal for box office
- Pent-up demand for both characters

4. Risks:
- Superhero fatigue
- General box office uncertainty
- Competition from other summer releases

Given all factors, I believe this will exceed the target with high probability.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.
