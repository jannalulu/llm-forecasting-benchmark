Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the strict eligibility conditions for Individual Neutral Athletes and the historical performance metrics we analyzed, our models had it at 8.75%.

Nate: The limited pool of eligible athletes really impacted their medal count. Most Russian and Belarusian athletes couldn't meet the neutrality requirements.

Philip: [nodding] Right. Even though Russia averaged 19 golds in previous Games, the IOC's stringent criteria for Individual Neutral Athletes dramatically reduced participation. Many top contenders were excluded due to military connections or state support.

Nate: The data from July showed only a small fraction of their usual Olympic delegation would qualify. The probability was always going to be low.

Philip: Another successful forecast in the books, though I wish we had more recent data leading up to the Games.

Here's a 150-word script set on August 12, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their Olympic predictions]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about those Individual Neutral Athletes at the Paris Games."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the strict eligibility conditions and the psychological impact of competing without national symbols, our models had it at 8.75%."

Nate: "The restrictions really hit hard. Only allowing athletes who hadn't actively supported the war, mandatory drug testing, and limited spots available... it was clear they wouldn't reach those 15 golds."

Tetlock: "Right. Even though Russia averaged 19 golds in previous Games, competing as neutral athletes was a different story. The historical data from Russian athletes who competed neutrally in Tokyo showed significantly lower performance."

Nate: "Another successful forecast in the books."

[They both nod, turning to their computers to analyze the next prediction]

[Scene: A dimly lit café in Paris, August 12, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are sitting at a small table, reviewing data on their laptops.]

Tetlock: Well, Nate, our models were spot on again about the Individual Neutral Athletes at the Olympics.

Silver: Indeed. With the strict eligibility conditions and the psychological impact of competing without national identity, our models had it at 8.75%.

Tetlock: The historical data from Russia and Belarus's previous performances was compelling, but the reduced pool of eligible athletes and heightened scrutiny made reaching 15 golds highly improbable.

Silver: [sipping coffee] The key factors were clear: the ban on team sports, the requirement for athletes to prove no active support of the war, and the limited number who could meet the neutrality criteria.

Tetlock: Not to mention the impact on training programs and support systems. History suggested higher numbers, but context is everything in forecasting.

[They both nod knowingly, closing their laptops]
