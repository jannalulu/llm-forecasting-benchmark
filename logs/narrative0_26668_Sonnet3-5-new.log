Nate Silver: *adjusting his glasses* Well, Phil, despite the historical precedent with Eagleton, JD Vance remained the Republican VP nominee through September 30th.

Philip Tetlock: *nodding* Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. While his unpopularity was concerning, especially those abysmal Midwest numbers, the Trump campaign couldn't risk the chaos of a switch so late in the game.

Nate: The "childless cat ladies" comment about Harris was damaging, but not fatal. Even with his net favorability at -16% in the Midwest...

Philip: *interrupting* The key factor was timing. By September, replacing him would've signaled panic. The models showed the campaign would rather weather the storm than admit a mistake.

Nate: Though I must say, having the lowest favorability ratings of any VP nominee in modern history isn't exactly a badge of honor.

SCENE: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 1, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.

TETLOCK: Well, Nate, despite the early nomination of JD Vance, our models proved accurate again.

SILVER: Yes, our models had it at 12.5%. The combination of his historically low favorability ratings and that "childless cat ladies" comment about Harris really sealed his fate. The Republican party couldn't risk keeping such a liability on the ticket.

TETLOCK: The warning signs were there in July. A -16% net favorability in his home region was unprecedented for a VP nominee. Even Eagleton in '72 had better numbers before he stepped down.

SILVER: What's fascinating is how the models caught the vulnerability. When you're less popular than both Quayle and Palin at their starts, you're in trouble. The replacement nominee is polling much better already.

TETLOCK: Another win for superforecasting.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, despite all the drama, Vance stayed on as VP nominee through September 30th.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. Despite his controversial comments about Harris and those abysmal favorability ratings, the Trump campaign calculated that replacing him would've been more damaging than keeping him.

Nate: Interesting how history didn't repeat the Eagleton scenario. Even with that -16% net favorability in the Midwest...

Philip: [interrupting] The key difference was timing. By late September, switching candidates would've created ballot access issues in multiple states. The models factored in that institutional inertia heavily favors keeping an unpopular nominee over the chaos of a last-minute switch.

Nate: Though I must say, those "childless cat ladies" comments about Harris... [shakes head]

Philip: Sometimes the most likely outcome isn't the most optimal one.

Nate: The Eagleton precedent had some people speculating about a last-minute switch, but this wasn't 1972. The negative polling numbers weren't enough to force a change, especially so close to the election.

Philip: [checking his notes] True. While his -16% net favorability in the Midwest was concerning, the campaign calculated that switching nominees would've created more chaos than keeping him. The models factored in the high cost of such a late change.

Nate: Sometimes stability wins out over popularity.

Nate: Interesting how the historical Eagleton parallel didn't play out. Even with that -16% Midwest rating and being the least popular VP pick in modern history, they calculated changing horses would look worse.

Philip: *sipping coffee* The key factor was Trump's unwavering loyalty once he makes a public commitment. Our models factored in how dropping Vance would've appeared as weakness – something Trump absolutely avoids. Though I must say, those "childless cat ladies" comments about Harris nearly forced their hand.

Nate: The base loved it though. Sometimes unpopularity with the general public is a feature, not a bug.
