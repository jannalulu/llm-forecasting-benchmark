Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Last brokered Democratic convention: 1952 (72 years ago)
- Rare historical occurrence, suggesting low baseline probability
- Biden has officially withdrawn and endorsed Kamala Harris

Key Contextual Factors:
1. Harris is frontrunner with Biden's endorsement
2. Democratic Party generally prefers party unity
3. Short timeframe before election (less than 3 months)
4. Significant logistical/political challenges of a brokered convention

Probability Considerations:
- Several potential alternative candidates exist (Newsom, Whitmer)
- Delegates are not automatically bound to Harris
- Potential strategic motivations to explore alternatives
- High stakes of 2024 election increases stakes of nominee selection

Counterbalancing Factors:
- Limited time to organize alternative candidate
- Risk of party disunity
- Potential electoral disadvantage of prolonged nomination fight
- Strong institutional preference for smooth transition

Calibration Process:
- Initial baseline: Very low probability (<5%)
- Adjustment for Biden's withdrawal: Slight increase
- Adjustment for potential alternative candidates: Modest increase

Careful Weighing of Evidence:
- Most likely scenario: Quick consolidation around Harris
- Small but non-zero chance of substantive challenge

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 12.75%, but 7.25% being the most likely. Probability: 7.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this scenario step-by-step:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Last brokered Democratic convention: 1952 (72 years ago)
- Extremely rare occurrence in modern political conventions
- Typically, parties aim to present unity and avoid contentious nomination processes

Current Context:
- Biden has withdrawn from the race
- Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris
- 3,900 delegates previously committed to Biden are now unbound
- Multiple potential candidates exist (Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, etc.)
- Convention scheduled for August 19-22

Key Decision Factors:
1. Party Leadership Preference
- Strong incentive to quickly unite behind a candidate
- Likely prefer avoiding a chaotic multi-ballot process
- Harris has Biden's explicit endorsement

2. Delegate Dynamics
- Delegates not automatically bound to Harris
- Potential for negotiation and multiple candidates
- Threshold for nomination: Need majority (over 1,968 delegates)

3. Structural Constraints
- Limited time before general election
- High stakes of preventing potential Trump victory
- Need for rapid, decisive action

Probability Assessment:
- Low likelihood of prolonged, multi-ballot convention
- Moderate chance of some initial negotiation/maneuvering
- High probability of resolving quickly

Balancing Factors:
- Historical rarity of brokered conventions
- Current unprecedented political environment
- Strong party incentive for quick resolution

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this:

Key Base Rate Context:
- Last Democratic brokered convention was in 1952 (72 years ago)
- Very rare historical occurrence
- Biden has dropped out unexpectedly
- Kamala Harris is frontrunner but not guaranteed nominee

Scenario Analysis:
1. Biden endorsed Harris, but delegates are not automatically bound
2. Other potential candidates exist: Newsom, Whitmer, Buttigieg
3. Convention is August 19-22, 2024
4. Requires >1 ballot to be considered a brokered convention

Probability Calculation Factors:
- Low historical precedent suggests against brokered convention
- High political stakes this election
- Multiple viable candidates create uncertainty
- Potential for negotiation behind scenes

Calibration Considerations:
- High uncertainty environment
- Major political disruption with Biden's withdrawal
- Delegates have significant discretion

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Risk of party division
- Desire for quick, unified nominee selection
- Complex delegate negotiation dynamics

After carefully weighing these factors, considering base rates, and the unique 2024 context:

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 37.25%, but 24.75% being the most likely. Probability: 24.75%.

Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Last Democratic brokered convention: 1952 (72 years ago)
- Extremely rare historical occurrence
- Modern primary/delegate rules designed to prevent brokered conventions

Specific 2024 Context:
- Biden has withdrawn from race
- Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris
- Harris appears to be frontrunner
- Potential alternative candidates exist (Newsom, Whitmer, etc.)

Key Factors Favoring Brokered Convention:
1. Multiple potential candidates might seek nomination
2. Delegates are not automatically bound to Harris
3. Significant party uncertainty about best path forward
4. Potential disagreements about nomination process

Factors Against Brokered Convention:
1. Party likely wants quick, unified process
2. Harris has Biden's endorsement
3. Limited time before general election
4. High stakes of 2024 election incentivize avoiding internal conflict

Careful Probability Calculation:
- Base rate suggests extremely low probability
- 2024's unique circumstances increase likelihood somewhat
- Party leadership will likely negotiate behind scenes to prevent multiple ballots

Balancing these considerations carefully:

My Prediction: Between 7.50% and 22.50%, but 15.25% being the most likely. Probability: 15.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Last brokered Democratic convention: 1952 (72 years ago)
- Historically rare event, especially in modern primary system
- Biden has already dropped out, making this scenario more plausible

Key Evidence for Potential Brokered Convention:
1. Biden's withdrawal creates uncertainty
2. Multiple potential candidates exist:
- Kamala Harris (endorsed by Biden)
- Gavin Newsom
- Gretchen Whitmer
- Others potentially emerging

Convention Dynamics:
- Delegates are not automatically committed to Harris
- Open convention rules allow multiple candidates
- Requires no candidate getting 50%+ on first ballot
- Virtual/telephonic vote on Aug 1st possible first round
- Physical convention Aug 19-22 as backup

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- High uncertainty environment
- Multiple competing power centers in Democratic Party
- Potential for negotiation/deal-making
- Time pressure of upcoming election
- Desire to present unified front against Trump

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Risk of divisive convention
- Risk of appearing disorganized
- Risk of weak nominee

After methodically weighing evidence and potential scenarios:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.30%, but 48.75% being the most likely. Probability: 48.75%.
