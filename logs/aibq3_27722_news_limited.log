**Cisco to Lay Off 6,000 Employees, Focus on Cybersecurity and AI**
Cisco, a leading networking company, is planning to lay off a large number of employees, reportedly around 6,000. This decision comes despite the company's recent better-than-expected quarterly results. According to a report in Money Control, the company is planning to reduce its workforce by 7%, which would be its second major layoff this year. In February 2024, the company had laid off 4,000 employees, which was 5% of its workforce. Cisco aims to reduce costs and focus on cybersecurity and AI by cutting expenses. The company expects to save around $1 billion in costs, which would be used to invest in AI and cybersecurity. Cisco has already invested $1 billion in AI startups Cohere, Mistral, and Scale in June 2024. The company is also partnering with Nvidia to work on AI projects. This move comes as several other tech giants, including Intel, Dell, Microsoft, and Amazon, have also announced layoffs in recent months.

**Intel cuts 15,000 jobs as it struggles to keep pace with NVIDIA**
Intel is cutting more than 15,000 jobs and pausing 'non-essential' projects, particularly in marketing and R&D, in an effort to revive profits and catch up with rivals such as Nvidia and AMD. The move comes after the company reported a $1.6bn loss in the April-June period. Shares in Intel fell by 20% following the announcement. Chief executive Pat Gelsinger said, 'The situation requires bolder actions and we have to fundamentally change the way we operate.' Intel previously conducted a significant round of layoffs in October 2022, but this is a new round of job cuts, with the majority expected to be completed by the end of 2024. The company's sales fell 1% year-on-year in the three months to June and it warned that the second half of the year would be worse than expected.

**Intel Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs and Regain Prominence in Semiconductor Industry**
Intel plans to cut thousands of jobs to reduce costs and finance an ambitious recovery effort after a decline in profits and market share. The company, which has around 110,000 employees, may announce the layoffs this week, according to sources familiar with the plans. CEO Pat Gelsinger is investing heavily in research and development to improve Intel's technology and help the company regain its prominence in the semiconductor industry. The company's stock rose 1.8% to $12:13 in New York on Wednesday. Other chip manufacturers, led by Nvidia, have rapidly developed profitable semiconductors for demanding tasks related to artificial intelligence. Intel is also dealing with irregular demand for chips that operate laptops and desktop computers, its main business. Gelsinger believes that Intel can improve its technology and has embarked on a plan to build factories for other chip manufacturers. The company reduced its workforce by around 5% in 2023 to 124,800 employees by the end of the year, after announcing job cuts that began in October 2022. Analysts project that Intel will report stable revenue for the second quarter compared to the previous year, with modest growth in the second half of 2024 and total sales increasing 3% to $55.7 billion for the full year, according to Wall Street estimates.

**Major Intel workforce reorg coming**
Intel Corp. is planning to lay off thousands of employees to cut costs and finance new programs, according to a report from Bloomberg. The workforce reorganization could come as early as this week, affecting around 7,000 employees across its four Santa Clara locations.

**Intel Plans To Reportedly Layoff At Least 10,000 Employees To Rebound From Share Losses**
Intel, with approximately 1,10,000 employees globally, is reportedly planning to lay off at least 10,000 employees as a cost-cutting measure to recover from losses, according to a Bloomberg report. The layoffs, which could begin as early as this week, are expected to save Intel up to $10 billion by 2025. This move comes as rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp. grows in the AI market, with big companies like Elon Musk's EV and AI companies collaborating with Nvidia for their AI computational needs. Intel's new AI chip, Gaudi 3, unveiled in April 2024, boasts 1.5x more speed than Nvidia's H100, used by Elon Musk's xAI in the development of Grok AI. However, Intel is ' sluggishly pivoting' in the AI market, according to the report. 'Intel expects to save up to $10 billion by 2025 with the job cuts,' said the report, citing the company's plans to recover from its losses.

**Intel to Lay Off 15,000 Employees Amid Financial Struggles**
Intel announced that it will lay off 15,000 employees worldwide by the end of the year, citing the need to balance costs to stabilize the company's financial health. The decision was made by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who stated that the company needs to take 'more drastic actions' to address its financial issues, including a decline in revenue and a high cost structure.

**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. In a note to employees, CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate.' He added, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected, and we have not yet fully benefited from powerful trends like AI. Our costs are too high, and our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both, particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is more challenging than previously expected.' Gelsinger also announced that the company will offer a improved retirement package and a voluntary leave program for eligible employees. He stated, 'These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I've done in my career.'
