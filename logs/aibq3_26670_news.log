**En direct. Législatives : « Je tombe de ma chaise », Bompard balaye la piste de Laurence Tubiana**
The New Popular Front has not yet reached an agreement on the name of the future Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the battle for the top spot continues. Follow the political news of this Tuesday. The standoff has hardened on the left: socialists, communists, and ecologists have proposed the candidacy of Laurence Tubiana, a university professor, for Prime Minister. However, LFI has excluded the possibility of a Prime Minister from civil society, demanding an agreement on the presidency of the National Assembly first. After eight days of negotiations, the discussions seem to be at a standstill, as the rejection of the candidacy of Huguette Bello, the president of the regional council of La Réunion, by the PS over the weekend has rekindled tensions in the fragile left-wing alliance.

**La France Insoumise Rejects Civil Society Candidacy for Prime Minister**
La France Insoumise (LFI) has rejected a potential candidacy from civil society to become Prime Minister of a left-wing government, citing a lack of 'guarantees' for implementing the New Popular Front program. LFI claims that the blockage will not be resolved by improvising an external candidacy and demands that the Socialist Party (PS) agree on a single candidate from the New Popular Front for the National Assembly presidency. The radical left formation insists that it will not participate in any further discussions on government formation until a common candidate for the NFP is found. 'Enough manipulation. Our decision is clear: we demand a single candidacy for the National Assembly presidency and will not discuss anything else until it's resolved,' said LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon on social media. LFI also announced that it will participate in mass initiatives organized by trade unions on July 18 to denounce Emmanuel Macron's 'coup d'état'.

**NFP Still Searching for Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front (NFP) is still discussing who will be the next Prime Minister, with the presidential camp organizing for the new legislature at the National Assembly, which begins on July 18. The two main components of the NFP, La France insoumise (LFI) and the Socialist Party (PS), are negotiating for the candidacy. Fabien Roussel, the secretary general of the Communist Party of France, has proposed Huguette Bello, the president of the Réunion regional council and former MP, for the position. Several NFP formations have expressed support for this proposal. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of LFI, has also endorsed the idea, stating that Bello could be a 'solution' and embody unity. The PS has not yet commented on the proposal. The approach of the next legislature at the Palais-Bourbon has increased pressure on the NFP. The president of the Assembly will be elected on July 18, and there are speculations that the government may resign the day before to allow the newly elected deputies to take part in the crucial vote.

**Who Will Lead the Next Government?**
After the second round of legislative elections, the question remains: who will lead the next government? The New Popular Front has begun negotiations to agree on a future Prime Minister. Jean-Luc Mélenchon says he does not want to impose himself on Matignon and that LFI has 'several candidates to propose'. The group promises to announce a name this week. Meanwhile, outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal is ensuring the day-to-day running of the country, having presented his resignation to Emmanuel Macron, but the President has asked him to stay in office 'for the moment' to ensure the country's stability, as France is set to host the Olympics from July 26.

**Left-Wing Parties in France Form New 'Popular Front' Ahead of Legislative Elections**
The left-wing parties in France have reached an agreement to form a new 'Popular Front' ahead of the legislative elections on June 30. After four days of intense negotiations, the parties have agreed on a joint program and unique candidates for each constituency. The agreement was welcomed by leaders such as François Ruffin, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, and Olivier Faure. The parties have also agreed on the allocation of seats, with 229 going to LFI, 175 to the PS, 92 to the Ecologists, and 50 to the PCF. However, some points of the program, such as the situation in the Middle East, are still sensitive. The question of who will lead the coalition as Prime Minister remains open, with Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Olivier Faure both expressing interest in the role.

**France: NFP proposes Lucie Castets for Prime Minister, but Macron says it's not the issue**
The Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) alliance has chosen Lucie Castets as its candidate for Prime Minister, but Emmanuel Macron has dismissed the announcement, saying it's not the issue. Macron is calling for a majority to be formed in the Assembly. The NFP's decision comes as the president of the La France insoumise (LFI) group in the Assembly, Mathilde Panot, announced a proposal to abolish the retirement reform. The reform, which was adopted in April 2023, has been widely contested. The current session of the Assembly is set to end on August 1 and the next session is scheduled to begin on October 1.

**Macron Blocks Consensus to Appoint First Female Prime Minister of France**
The New Popular Front (NFP) has announced an agreement to present Lucie Castets, an economist and high-ranking official, as the candidate for Prime Minister of France. Castets, 64, has been a defender of public services and has fought against tax fraud and organized crime. The four parties of the NFP (socialist, communist, ecological, and LFI) have committed to supporting the government that forms with her. This announcement comes 16 days after the early legislative elections, which gave a narrow victory to the progressive forces ahead of the centrist group of President Emmanuel Macron and the far-right National Rally (RN). Macron stated that he will not appoint a Prime Minister until mid-August, after the end of the Paris Olympics, which end on August 11. He ignored the candidacy of Lucie Castets, presented by the NFP, saying 'The issue is not that'. The progressive alliance has a narrow majority in the National Assembly, ahead of Macron's group and the RN, but the numbers are approximate due to independent deputies with similar ideologies.

**France's New People's Front Names Lucie Castets as Prime Minister Candidate**
The New People's Front (Nouveau Front Populaire), a left-wing coalition in France, has chosen Lucie Castets as its prime minister candidate. The coalition, which includes the Left Front (LFI), the Greens (EEVL), the Socialist Party (PS), and the Communist Party (PCF), won the first round of the early general election on June 30 with 33.15% of the votes. The coalition's candidate, Lucie Castets, is a financial crime expert. French President Emmanuel Macron has not commented on the coalition's prime minister candidate, saying 'The issue is not the name, the issue is: Which majority will emerge in the National Assembly? We are not in a position to change anything until August, because it would create chaos.' Macron also stated that the current government will continue until the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and will focus on the games. After the Olympics, Macron will appoint a new prime minister.

**LFI's Eric Coquerel Predicts Huguette Bello's Candidacy for Prime Minister**
Eric Coquerel, a deputy from the LFI party, believes that the hypothesis of Huguette Bello, the president of La Réunion, as Prime Minister will likely return soon. He rejects a vote and prefers a consensus-based designation. LFI wants the candidate to commit to implementing the New Popular Front program in its entirety. 'We have only one condition: we must have the guarantee that he will respect the entire logic and coherence of the program we proposed,' he emphasizes. Coquerel also opposes the candidacy of Laurence Tubiana, supported by the socialists. 'We will easily find a Prime Minister (...) as long as Mr. Macron respects democracy,' he adds. This is an opportunity for Coquerel to comment on the left's victory, which won a majority of seats in the National Assembly's executive bureau. 'We are the majority in the bureau, so we demand, all the more so since Mr. Macron respects universal suffrage, that he calls on the New Popular Front to govern,' he adds.

**New Popular Front Negotiations for French Government**
The New Popular Front (NFP) is in negotiations to form a government in France. Jérôme Guedj, a PS member, hopes for a surge of rationality to guide the negotiations. André Chassaigne, a communist deputy, has been designated as the NFP's candidate for the presidency of the National Assembly. Manuel Bompard believes that the result of the election will not change the outcome of the legislative elections. François Ruffin, a Picardy deputy, has expressed his lack of interest in the prime minister position. The NFP is in secret negotiations to find a consensus candidate for the prime minister position between LFI, the Ecologists, the PS, and the PCF. Manuel Bompard criticizes the PS for blocking all negotiations to form a government. The LFI has rejected a candidacy from civil society for the prime minister position.

**Olivier Faure Calls for Vote to Choose Next Prime Minister**
Olivier Faure, the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, has called for a vote among the deputies of the New Popular Front to choose between Huguette Bello and Laurence Tubiana as the next Prime Minister. However, the Left Party (LFI) has rejected this proposal. Faure believes that the two candidates are the only ones left in the running and that a vote would allow the deputies to make a decision. He also criticized Marine Tondelier, the leader of the Ecologist group, for criticizing the divisions within the left and for claiming that there have been no negotiations between the parties. Faure has also ruled out the possibility of socialists participating in a coalition with the center-right or the presidential camp, and has stated that the left would not accept a government with a right-wing Prime Minister.

**French left at loggerheads over the choice of new prime minister**
The left-wing parties of the New Popular Front (NFP) in France are at odds over the choice of a new prime minister. The parties agreed to propose Laurence Tubiana, a former ambassador, for the role, but some members of La France insoumise (LFI) rejected the choice, calling it 'Macron-compatible'. The NFP parties are now closer to breaking up, with LFI's coordinator Manuel Bompard accusing the Socialist Party (PS) of systematic opposition to their proposals. The PS is seeking to regain leadership of the French left and may be open to building a majority with the left wing of Macron's Renaissance party. LFI leaders want to apply their program without compromise, even if it means governing by decree or referendum. The election of the National Assembly's president and the declaration of political groups' MPs are scheduled for July 18, followed by the formation of standing committees on July 20.

**Moderate French left proposes climate diplomat as prime minister**
The New Popular Front (NFP), a coalition of left-wing parties, has proposed Laurence Tubiana, a diplomat and academic, as their prime minister candidate. Tubiana, 73, was the lead negotiator of the 2015 Paris Accords and has headed the European Climate Foundation since 2017. However, the far-left party La France Insoumise (LFI), a key ally of the NFP, has indicated they will not accept her as their candidate. LFI wants a candidate from their own ranks, and has rejected the idea of reaching out to centrist parties to form a coalition. Tubiana has called for the NFP to reach out to other parties to discuss a republican program and government, but LFI deputy Paul Vannier has said his party would not support her as prime minister due to her views being too close to those of centrist President Emmanuel Macron.

**France Insubmissa accuses Socialist Party of causing impasse in government formation**
The negotiations to form a new French government after the left's victory in the elections are facing an impasse due to the systematic opposition of the Socialists, according to Manuel Bompard, coordinator of the France Insubmissa (LFI). Bompard accused the Socialist Party (PS) of constantly rejecting all proposals on the table to identify a candidate for prime minister who has the support of all components of the New Popular Front (NFP). The Socialists have blocked proposals such as the names of former socialist deputy Huguette Bello and Lille's Chamber of Commerce president Martine Aubry, daughter of Jacques Delors. Olivier Faure, leader of the Socialist Party, said he is not opposed to Bello's candidacy, but emphasized that 'socialists believe, and it's normal, that the party that won the European elections on the left is the Socialist Party, the label in these legislative elections that has the most dynamism'. Faure also rejected the accusation of wanting to impose himself as prime minister, stating that 'it's not a personal issue', as they proposed other socialists last week. He also proposed 'expanding' the search for a prime minister of the New Popular Front to 'a personality from civil society' after Bello's candidacy failed. The deputies will elect the president of the National Assembly next Thursday (18/07), with Macronist Yaël Braun-Pivet and socialist Boris Vallaud being mentioned as potential successors. According to French press, citing local sources, President Emmanuel Macron may wait until the end of August to name a new government.

**LFI Rejects Civil Society Candidate for Prime Minister, Stalemate Ensues**
La France Insoumise (LFI) has rejected a proposal for a candidate from civil society to become the Prime Minister, citing concerns about the implementation of the New Popular Front's program. The PS has responded, stating that they never intended to veto any candidate from the New Popular Front, but rather expressed disagreement with a particular candidate. LFI is also opposed to a candidate from civil society, citing the need for a single candidate for the Assembly presidency. The situation has led to a stalemate, with LFI refusing to participate in further discussions until a single candidate is chosen. The PS has called for an immediate resumption of discussions for a common candidate from civil society, while the PCF and EELV have expressed concerns about the situation.

**Mélenchon suspends negotiations with left-wing parties to agree on a single candidate for Prime Minister in France**
La Francia Insumisa (LFI), led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has announced the suspension of negotiations with the rest of the left-wing parties to agree on a single candidate for Prime Minister in the name of the New Popular Front (NFP) coalition, which won the most seats in the National Assembly in the recent elections. The party accuses the French Socialist Party, a member of the NFP, of political obstruction. The socialists have proposed an 'improvisation of an external candidacy', which LFI rejects, saying it would not guarantee the implementation of the NFP's program. LFI also questions whether the Socialist Party is trying to gain time to break the NFP and abandon its program. The party demands an immediate agreement on a single candidate, rejecting the idea of an external candidacy.

**NFP Struggles to Designate Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front (NFP) is still unable to designate a candidate for the Prime Minister position due to ongoing tensions within the alliance.

The PS is pushing for its own candidate, Olivier Faure, while La France Insoumise (LFI) has accepted Huguette Bello's candidacy. In an interview with Le Parisien, Olivier Faure stated that Huguette Bello's name does not have consensus among socialists and ecologists, and that a new candidate must be found by July 18, the start of the new legislative term. LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard expressed anger at the PS's refusal, saying that the alliance's proposal for Huguette Bello had received widespread support from the left without raising any objections from any political component.

**As far-left's proposed candidate drops out, is France's search for new PM back to square one?**
France's search for a new prime minister has been delayed as the candidate proposed by the far-left France Unbowed (LFI), Huguette Bello, has withdrawn from consideration. Bello cited the lack of consensus among the parties as the reason for her withdrawal. The left-wing coalition New Popular Front (NPF) emerged as the single-largest bloc in the parliamentary elections, but the parties within the bloc have not been able to agree on a prime ministerial candidate. The main disagreement is between the LFI and the Socialist Party. The search for a new prime minister appears to be back to square one, with no consensus on a candidate. Macron has said that the next premier will not be from the far-left LFI or the far-right RN.

The PS has proposed the candidacy of its first secretary, Olivier Faure, and wants to continue discussions to find a consensual candidate by July 18. LFI has strongly criticized the PS's decision, accusing them of blocking all negotiations to the left. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of LFI, had previously supported Huguette Bello, saying she represented an ideal solution, just like the Communist Party. However, the socialists have stated that the Ecologists have not taken a position on the Réunionnaise. The PS remains open to new discussions and may propose other names of socialist or independent personalities.

**French left suggests former communist MP Huguette Bello for premiership**
Following the French election runoff, which resulted in a hung parliament, President Macron is set to appoint the next prime minister. The New Popular Front (NPF), a broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens, and France Unbowed (LFI), won the most seats. The alliance is struggling to agree on a candidate, with Huguette Bello, a 73-year-old former communist MP and current president of the regional council in La Reunion, being touted as a potential consensus candidate.

**French Politics: Negotiations for New Prime Minister Continue**
Negotiations are ongoing to find a new Prime Minister after the early legislative elections, which placed the New Popular Front in the lead without an absolute majority in the National Assembly. The name of Huguette Bello, President of the Regional Council of Réunion and former MP, is circulating as a potential candidate for the Prime Minister's office, which is supported by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The Socialist Party is holding a national council on Saturday to submit a proposal to its coalition partners and modalities for designation. Meanwhile, some voices are already calling for censure if LFI or ecologists are nominated. Gabriel Attal is the sole candidate for the presidency of the Renaissance group in the Assembly, proposing to rename the group 'Ensemble pour la République' to make it 'indispensable' for forming project and idea majorities.

**NFP Still Searching for Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front (NFP) is still discussing who will be the next Prime Minister, with the presidential camp organizing for the new legislature at the National Assembly, which begins on July 18. The two main components of the NFP, La France insoumise (LFI) and the Socialist Party (PS), are negotiating for the candidacy. Fabien Roussel, the secretary general of the Communist Party of France, has proposed Huguette Bello, the president of the Réunion regional council and former MP, for the position. Several NFP formations have expressed support for this proposal. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of LFI, has also endorsed the idea, stating that Bello could be a 'solution' and embody unity. The PS has not yet commented on the proposal. The approach of the next legislature at the Palais-Bourbon has increased pressure on the NFP. The president of the Assembly will be elected on July 18, and there are speculations that the government may resign the day before to allow the newly elected deputies to take part in the crucial vote.

**LFI Leader Proposes Huguette Bello as First Female Prime Minister of France**
The leader of the French Left Party (LFI), Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has proposed Huguette Bello, the president of the regional council of Réunion Island, as the first female prime minister of France. Mélenchon praised Bello's career as a 'woman racialized and anti-racist feminist'. The LFI leader has asked socialists to consider this 'solution'. The left-wing parties have been unable to agree on a consensus candidate for prime minister, with the Communist Party (PCF) proposing Bello as an alternative. The New Popular Front (NFP) has demanded that President Emmanuel Macron call them to form a government, accusing him of ignoring the results of the June 30 and July 7 legislative elections. Macron has called for unity and warned that if any of his allies try to break that unity to launch a presidential campaign in 2027, 'they will be swept away'. The PCF leader, Fabien Roussel, has denounced Macron's 'maneuvering' to maintain power despite the French people's anger towards his policies.

**France: Threats of Censure Loom Over Future Government**
The French Senate President Gérard Larcher has threatened to censor the future government if the President of the Republic chooses a Prime Minister from the New Popular Front (NFP). The right-wing of the presidential camp has also warned that the nomination of a member of La France Insoumise (LFI) would lead to a motion of censure in the National Assembly. The presidential camp, which has preserved around 160 MPs, remains in hiding and has not given up on forming a majority at the center. Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally (RN), has added ecologists to her list of banned parties. She has warned that her party, with 140 MPs, will censor any government that includes LFI and ecologists in ministerial positions. The left has promised to return the favor if the presidential coalition tries to keep Gabriel Attal as Prime Minister or appoint another Macronist to Matignon. The Macronist group is hiding certain divisions. President Emmanuel Macron has lamented the 'catastrophic spectacle' given by his camp in recent days, which is struggling to unite behind Gabriel Attal, Prime Minister since January 2024 and head of the lightning campaign for the legislative elections. With 289 votes required, no group can topple the government alone. These threats indicate the instability reigning at the Palais Bourbon.

**Macron Calls for Republican Coalition, Opposition Parties Still Undecided on Prime Minister**
French President Emmanuel Macron has written a letter to the French people, calling for a broad coalition of republican forces to form a solid majority in the National Assembly. However, the opposition parties have not yet agreed on a candidate for Prime Minister. François Ruffin, a deputy from the New Popular Front, has proposed that all deputies from the party gather to choose a candidate. Ruffin also criticized the tone and brutality of the Left Party (LFI). The National Assembly is expected to hold a vote on July 18 to elect its president, and the formation of groups and the distribution of committee seats will follow. The situation is uncertain, with the possibility of a record number of groups being formed. Meanwhile, the government is facing pressure to address the country's social and economic issues.

**Macron Calls for Broad Coalition After Legislative Elections**
French President Emmanuel Macron stated that 'no one won' the recent legislative elections, where the left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), came in first place but without a majority. Macron called for a broad coalition to be formed, excluding the far-right National Rally (RN) and implicitly the radical left-wing party, La France Insoumise (LFI). Macron said he will make a decision on the appointment of the prime minister once the political forces have 'forged commitments', giving them 'a little time'. The official government is divided between those who want to form an alliance with the Republicans (LR) and those who advocate for a broad coalition that includes social democrats.

**La Francia Insumisa demands Macron hand over government to the left**
La Francia Insumisa (LFI) demands that President Emmanuel Macron hand over the government to the left, citing concerns that he may not respect the results of the legislative elections. LFI deputy Mathilde Panot stated that the voters in the June 30 and July 7 elections spoke for 'a rupture' and that the current Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, cannot continue in his position. Panot also emphasized that the New Popular Front (NFP), composed of LFI, the Socialist Party, the Ecologists, and the French Communist Party, will name a candidate for Prime Minister by the end of the week. Macron has announced that he will take time to structure the new National Assembly, which will be convened on July 18. Panot believes it is absurd for the President to wait for the balance of power in the chamber to be established, as the NFP is expected to have the largest group in the Assembly with around 195 seats, while the Macronist bloc and the National Rally (RN) will have around 160-170 and 143 seats, respectively.

**France Embarks on Uncertain Path After Unexpected Election Results**
France has entered uncharted territory after the legislative elections on Sunday, which left the National Assembly very divided and without a clear majority. The party with the most seats in the National Assembly is far from the absolute majority. The Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, has resigned, and the President, Emmanuel Macron, has asked him to stay on a provisional basis to ensure the country's stability. The Left Popular Front (NFP) has announced that it will designate a candidate for Prime Minister, who will be appointed by Macron. The NFP's program includes several red lines for the official alliance and the right, such as the repeal of the 2023 pension reform and the approval of a tax on large fortunes. The NFP is formed by the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Ecologist Party, and the radical party La France Insumisa (LFI). Various NFP leaders have reiterated their request to Macron to appoint a left-wing Prime Minister, but the President has said he will take his time, especially until the new National Assembly is constituted.

**France's Left in Dilemma: Jean-Luc Mélenchon's Contentious Climb to Power**
France's left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NPF), is facing a dilemma as Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the head of France Unbowed (LFI) party, emerges as a potential prime minister candidate after the party's election success. However, mainstream party leaders have rejected any coalition with him due to his controversial stance and divisive history. The NPF may form a coalition without him or seek individual agreements with opposing parties, but these options are challenging. The leaders of the component parties are meeting to decide who will replace outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, leaving the political future uncertain.

**Who Will Lead the Next Government?**
After the second round of legislative elections, the question remains: who will lead the next government? The New Popular Front has begun negotiations to agree on a future Prime Minister. Jean-Luc Mélenchon says he does not want to impose himself on Matignon and that LFI has 'several candidates to propose'. The group promises to announce a name this week. Meanwhile, outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal is ensuring the day-to-day running of the country, having presented his resignation to Emmanuel Macron, but the President has asked him to stay in office 'for the moment' to ensure the country's stability, as France is set to host the Olympics from July 26.

**France's Next Prime Minister: A New Round of Speculation**
After weeks of political debate centered on the prospect of a far-right victory, the results of the 2024 French legislative elections have sparked a new round of speculation about who will lead the new majority. The choice of the next prime minister lies with President Emmanuel Macron, who is not legally bound by the election results, but is expected to choose a candidate from the winning coalition, the New Popular Front (NPF). The NPF, composed of socialists, greens, communists, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon's La France Insoumise (LFI), has claimed the right to propose a candidate. Marine Tondelier, leader of the Ecologists, has called for Macron to officially ask the NPF to suggest a name for the prime minister. Olivier Faure, the first secretary of the Socialist Party, and Mathilde Panot, the leader of LFI, have both stated that the NPF will propose a name within the week. The question is who the left will propose as prime minister. LFI has not chosen a prominent figure as a candidate, unlike the Republicans and the pro-Macron coalition, led by outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. The two main forces within the coalition, LFI and the Socialists, will have the most weight in the upcoming talks, which may exclude Marine Tondelier, despite her strong presence during the campaign. Other potential candidates include Olivier Faure, Fabien Roussel, François Hollande, Yannick Jadot, and Clémence Guetté.

**New Popular Front Claims Prime Minister Position, Promises Name Within the Week**
The New Popular Front (NFP), composed of La France Insoumise (LFI), the Socialist Party (PS), Ecologists, and the Communist Party of France (PCF), has claimed the position of Prime Minister after the legislative elections, in which they won 182 seats, but fell short of the absolute majority. The President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, should officially call the NFP to propose a Prime Minister, according to Marine Tondelier, leader of the Ecologists. Olivier Faure, PS first secretary, and Mathilde Panot, LFI member, both stated that the NFP will propose a name within the week. The choice will be made either by consensus or by vote among the NFP formations. Manuel Bompard, LFI coordinator, believes that the Prime Minister should come from the party with the most seats, which is his own, according to him. Mathilde Panot defended Jean-Luc Mélenchon, LFI leader, saying he is not disqualified for the position, while Marine Tondelier and others have excluded him. The PS leader, Olivier Faure, emphasized the need for a Prime Minister who can unify the country and repair its deep divisions.

The New Popular Front (NFP) alliance, which won the most seats in the National Assembly in the second round of the early general election in France, is expected to announce its prime minister candidate this week. The alliance, which includes the Socialist Party (PS), Boyun Eğmeyen Fransa (LFI), France Communist Party (PCF), and the Green Party (EELV), has been criticized for not having a clear plan for the country's future. The leader of LFI, Mathilde Panot, has stated that the alliance will announce its prime minister candidate and government proposal this week. The current Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, has announced his resignation after the results of the election were announced. The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, has the power to appoint the Prime Minister, but it is customary for the party with the most seats in the National Assembly to form the government.

**France's Unprecedented Political Situation: Who Will Govern?**
The 2024 French legislative elections have resulted in a fragmented Assembly, with no party winning a majority. The New Popular Front (NFP), an alliance of left-wing parties, has emerged as the largest bloc, but without a majority. The President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, has announced that he will not resign, and the Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, has called for a new era of cooperation. The NFP has claimed the right to govern, but it is unclear who will ultimately form a government. The situation is unprecedented, and the country is preparing for the 2024 Olympics. The President's party, Renaissance, has begun to outline its conditions for negotiations, including the defense of secularism, support for Ukraine, and climate action. The Socialists are also seeking to establish a new rapport de force with the Left Front (LFI). The Ecologists are open to finding allies, but the negotiations are expected to be intense and complex.

The 2024 French legislative elections have concluded, with the New Popular Front coalition leading the way with 187-198 seats in the National Assembly. La France Insoumise (LFI) is the strongest force within the coalition, with 82-86 elected officials. The Socialist Party and the Ecologists follow, with 62-67 and 34-35 seats respectively. The Communist Party of France secured 9-10 seats. Marine Tondelier, a member of LFI, stated that while the group may not have chosen a Prime Minister, they could still exert influence in internal negotiations as the majority within the NFP. It remains to be seen if Emmanuel Macron will seek to form a new government with the left.

**France says 'no' to the far-right**
The New Popular Front, an alliance of French left-wing parties, won a majority of votes in the second round of the legislative elections, ahead of the alliance of Emmanuel Macron and the far-right National Rally. The participation rate was historically high, 67%. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the Unbowed France (LFI, left), exclaimed, 'It's a great relief.' The first results of the second round of the French legislative elections confirmed the victory of the left-wing parties, grouped in the New Popular Front. According to the first results, the NFP would have obtained between 172 and 192 seats in the National Assembly, ahead of Macron's alliance (between 150 and 170 seats) and the National Rally (far-right) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella (between 132 and 152 deputies). At 8pm local time, the French discovered the results of these elections that kept the country on edge for three weeks. France was suspended from the possibility of being governed by the far-right party, a big winner in the European elections and the first round of the French legislative elections, decided by Macron. 'We have avoided the worst,' said Olivier Faure, president of the French Socialist Party, who added that the goal now is to apply the government program presented by the NFP. France was suspended from these elections that opened the possibility of a far-right government for the first time in its history. In effect, the French president must now appoint a new prime minister from the ranks of the left-wing coalition. The problem is that this coalition is made up of several formations, including LFI, and Macron has rejected forming a government with this party. The next few days will be decisive for French politics. Macron must appoint a new prime minister, and this person will have the task of deciding on the ministers of his cabinet.

Mélenchon also emphasized that the Nouveau Front populaire is the only alternative that is built, coherent, solidary, and has a well-organized and quantified program.

**Macron Rules Out Governing with LFI After Legislative Elections**
French President Emmanuel Macron stated in a Council of Ministers meeting that it is 'not a question' of governing with the Left Party (LFI) after the 2024 legislative elections, despite the presidential camp's withdrawals in favor of the New Popular Front (NFP) to block the National Rally. Macron emphasized that withdrawing from the election does not mean governing with LFI, and that there will be no alliance with the party. The Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, and the government's spokesperson, Prisca Thevenot, also reiterated this stance, stating that withdrawing is not the same as rallying or compromising. They emphasized the need to combat the National Rally without aligning with LFI. Nearly 80 candidates have withdrawn from the election.

**France: Le RN arrives in first place in the first round of legislative elections**
The National Rally (RN) has won the first round of the 2024 French legislative elections, ahead of the 'New Popular Front' (NFP) and the presidential camp. According to preliminary estimates, the RN would obtain between 33.5% and 34% of the votes, followed by the NFP (29% to 29.5%) and the presidential list 'Ensemble' (20.7% to 22%). The second round of the election will take place on July 7, and it is unclear whether the RN will win a majority of seats in the National Assembly, which could lead to Jordan Bardella, the party's 28-year-old president, becoming Prime Minister. The mobilization of French citizens, with a participation rate estimated between 65% and 67.5%, has led to a large number of 'triangular' contests in the second round. Left-wing parties, including the France Insoumise (LFI), have announced that they will withdraw their candidates who come in third place in the second round if the RN is in the lead. The presidential camp has also given the same instruction to its candidates. The Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, has called for a broad democratic and republican alliance to prevent the RN from winning a majority of seats. The risk of a blocked Assembly, with no possibility of alliance between very polarized camps, is real, which could plunge France into uncertainty.

**Mélenchon Proposes Withdrawing Left-Wing Candidates to Prevent Far-Right Victory**
Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the France Unbowed (LFI) party, has announced that the New Popular Front (NFP) coalition of left-wing parties will withdraw their candidates in areas where they come in third place, despite initial polls showing them in second place with 29% of the vote. Mélenchon stated, 'In all circumstances, our slogan is clear: not a single vote for the RN, not a single seat for the RN.' The NFP is seeking to prevent the far-right National Rally (RN) party from gaining power. The second round of the legislative elections will take place on July 7. Mélenchon has referred to areas where there is a majority duel between the NFP and RN, and the left-wing block will withdraw its candidate to avoid dividing the vote against the far-right. Macron, the current prime minister, has also called for a 'democratic and republican' alliance against the far-right and has opted to withdraw his party's candidates in favor of the left-wing block.

Meanwhile, Jordan Bardella, the leader of the National Rally, has announced that his party wants to 'prevent' foreigners from occupying 'sensitive' jobs.

**Left-Wing Parties Unite Ahead of French Legislative Elections**
The left-wing parties, including LFI, PS, ecologist, and communist, have announced a joint program called the 'New Popular Front' ahead of the 2024 legislative elections. The parties will hold a press conference on June 14th to celebrate their unity. François Hollande, the former President of France, has welcomed the agreement, stating that the left's duty is to unite to prevent the extreme right from winning. Meanwhile, the right-wing party, Les Républicains, is dealing with internal conflicts, with Eric Ciotti filing a lawsuit against his exclusion from the party. The party's leaders will meet to validate the exclusion of their president.

**Left-Wing Parties in France Form New 'Popular Front' Ahead of Legislative Elections**
The left-wing parties in France have reached an agreement to form a new 'Popular Front' ahead of the legislative elections on June 30. After four days of intense negotiations, the parties have agreed on a joint program and unique candidates for each constituency. The agreement was welcomed by leaders such as François Ruffin, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, and Olivier Faure. The parties have also agreed on the allocation of seats, with 229 going to LFI, 175 to the PS, 92 to the Ecologists, and 50 to the PCF. However, some points of the program, such as the situation in the Middle East, are still sensitive. The question of who will lead the coalition as Prime Minister remains open, with Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Olivier Faure both expressing interest in the role.

**New Popular Front Formed Ahead of 2024 Legislative Elections**
The PS, PCF, EEVL, and LFI announced the formation of a new popular front ahead of the 2024 legislative elections. According to Iñaki Echaniz, a departing PS-Nupes deputy from the 4th constituency of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, 'today we're no longer in a party or ego question, but a question of gathering all the voters.' The agreement was reached on the left, with socialists, ecologists, communists, and insoumis agreeing to support single candidates in the first round on June 30. Echaniz emphasized that 'in three weeks, the heir of Jean-Marie Le Pen could become Prime Minister and take power in our country. And that's why we're calling for responsibility.' A program will be presented in the coming hours for this left-wing alliance, which will present common lists without evoking the Nupes label. Echaniz stressed that 'today we're more in a question of gathering all the voters, not just a party or ego question.' He also emphasized that 'my appeal is to all the left-wing voters and even beyond, who refuse to see the extreme right take power in this country. I'm a child of 2002, a child of the trauma of Jean-Marie Le Pen's second round, and we cannot conceive that it could happen again today. And therefore, we must take responsibility and propose an alternative.'
