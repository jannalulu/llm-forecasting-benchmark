**View from Manila: Kicking diplomats out won't solve the West Philippine Sea problem**
The Philippine Senate is investigating an alleged wiretapping incident involving a Chinese diplomat and a Filipino military general. The diplomat, Colonel Li, has not been expelled, and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is considering options to address the issue. The DFA can request an embassy to waive diplomatic immunity or ask the diplomat to leave voluntarily. However, expelling a diplomat can be complicated and may lead to a diplomatic crisis. The article argues that kicking out diplomats will not solve the West Philippine Sea problem and that maintaining diplomatic ties is crucial despite tensions. The Chinese embassy's release of a recording and threats to make it public have worsened the situation.

**Tolentino seeks expulsion, ‘persona non-grata' tag against Chinese envoy over wiretapping issue**
Senator Francis Tolentino is calling for the expulsion of Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian and declaring him 'persona non grata' if he is found guilty of wiretapping Philippine officials. Tolentino believes the international community should condemn the alleged act, which he says is a brazen violation of Philippine and international laws. He also suggests that the Philippines should consider recalling its ambassador to China. National Security Adviser Eduardo Año agrees, stating that those responsible for violating Philippine laws and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations should be removed from the country. Tolentino has filed a Senate resolution to investigate the alleged wiretapping and provide remedial measures to prevent a recurrence.

**Top Philippine security official demands Chinese diplomats' expulsion as territorial row escalates**
Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano demanded the immediate expulsion of Chinese diplomats allegedly involved in a leaked phone conversation between a Chinese diplomat and a Filipino admiral about South China Sea disputes. Ano backed a call by the Philippine defense chief to take action against Chinese embassy individuals in Manila who violated Philippine laws and international diplomatic protocols. The Chinese Embassy has not confirmed or denied the reports, and the Philippine government has summoned Chinese diplomats to hand over protests. The diplomatic row has escalated due to hostilities between Chinese and Philippine coast guard ships and vessels in the disputed waters.

**South China Sea: despite clashes, Beijing and Manila must keep talking**
Despite recent violent incidents between the Philippines and China, high-level diplomats from both sides met in Manila to de-escalate tensions. The ninth round of the bilateral consultation mechanism was a welcome respite, given a string of close calls in contested waters. The meeting aimed to improve maritime communication mechanisms and promote dialogue between their coastguards. The lack of timely diplomatic intervention has led to violent consequences, and talking does not resolve everything, but not talking can make it worse. The meeting came amid calls for greater diplomacy to stave off conflict and a legislative probe of previous arrangements to soothe tensions. China remains the Philippines' largest trade partner and a major investor, but tensions have affected economic ties.

**Yehey.com China-Philippines Relations in Spotlight Following South China Sea Dispute**
The South China Sea dispute between China and the Philippines has been ongoing for years, with tensions escalating in recent times. China has increased its military presence in the region, leading to diplomatic protests from the Philippines. Despite economic ties between the two nations, the Philippines' dependency on China makes it vulnerable to economic sanctions. The international community, including the US and Japan, has condemned China's actions and reaffirmed support for the Philippines. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is attempting to mediate the crisis through a Code of Conduct, but talks have been slow. The resolution of the dispute requires a combination of diplomacy, economic strategy, and possibly third-party mediation. Future steps to watch include ongoing diplomatic negotiations, changes in ASEAN Code of Conduct talks, economic strategies, and military movements.

One Filipino sailor lost his hand, and several others were injured. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro stated that the incident was not an accident, but a deliberate action by Chinese authorities to hinder the Philippines' efforts. The location of the incident is the Second Thomas Shoal, a part of the Spratly Islands, which is under Philippine control.

**Philippines and China Work Together to Manage Tensions in South China Sea**
The Philippines is working with China to develop 'confidence-building measures' to manage tensions in the South China Sea after a recent incident that seriously injured a Filipino sailor, according to the Philippine Foreign Minister. 'We still believe in the primacy of dialogue, and diplomacy should prevail even in the face of these serious incidents, although I admit it is a challenge,' said Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo in a Senate hearing. The Philippines will not take any measures that compromise its sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in the South China Sea, Manalo added. 'We are not blind to the incidents that are happening,' he said. The Department of Foreign Affairs presented a diplomatic protest against China's 'illegal and aggressive' actions during a routine resupply mission on June 17, which, according to the Philippine military, seriously injured a sailor and damaged Manila's vessels. China disputed the Philippines' account, with its Foreign Ministry saying that the actions taken by its coast guard were necessary, legal, and irreproachable. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro praised the Philippine troops for containing the situation and preventing it from escalating further. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. China claims almost the entire South China Sea with its so-called 'nine-dash line', which overlaps with the exclusive economic zones of rival claimants Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. A 2016 arbitration tribunal decision, which Beijing does not recognize, invalidated China's claim to the strategic waters.

**US Criticizes China's Actions in South China Sea, Calls for Responsible Behavior**
The US has criticized China's actions in the South China Sea, calling them irresponsible, aggressive, and destabilizing. US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink made the statement on June 22 in Hanoi, amid rising tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea. Kritenbrink said that the US will continue to support its Filipino allies and has publicly and privately told Beijing that the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty is 'ironclad'. He also emphasized that every country in the region, including China, must respect international law and behave responsibly in the maritime sphere. The US and Vietnam have officially elevated their relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level of diplomatic relations, during President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi in September 2023. Kritenbrink called the upgrade 'historic and momentous' and wants to maintain the momentum to ensure that all agreements are implemented. The US and Vietnam have a strong partnership, and Kritenbrink believes that it has never been stronger.

**Philippines Intensifies Strategy in South China Sea Dispute**
The Philippines has adopted a more assertive stance in the South China Sea dispute, challenging China's maritime claims by increasing transparency and strengthening its military alliance with the United States. This move was triggered by a February 2023 decision to release photos of a military-grade laser directed at a Filipino ship, as reported by National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya. The transparency campaign, led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, aims to build international support by documenting encounters with Chinese forces and incorporating foreign journalists in coast guard missions. The Philippines' efforts have included releasing images showing aggressive actions by Chinese vessels, such as water cannon use against Filipino ships. The intensification of the disputes has been marked by incidents near Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippine Navy maintains a presence on the grounded BRP Sierra Madre. Recent confrontations have increased, with the Philippine Coast Guard reporting a surge in Chinese vessels from an average of one in 2021 to approximately 14 in 2023, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The conflict has drawn international attention, with statements of support from various countries and a renewed defense agreement with the US, providing access to additional military bases in the Philippines. This has raised concerns about possible US involvement under the mutual defense treaty in case the situation escalates. Although the Philippines has gained diplomatic support, they remain cautious about possible Chinese economic retaliation, their second-largest export market in 2023. The recent political approach also risks provoking China to adopt a 'tougher approach', according to political scientist Edcel John Ibarra. However, Philippine Ambassador to Washington José Manuel Romualdez expressed hope to maintain economic relations alongside efforts to resolve the dispute peacefully. This assertive stance by the Philippines has surprised neighboring countries with similar maritime disputes, signaling a potential new approach to dealing with tensions with Beijing. The situation remains a delicate balancing act, with the Philippines seeking to assert its sovereignty while avoiding an escalation that could lead to hostility.

**China and Philippines Engage in Tensions Over South China Sea Disputes**
Tensions between China and the Philippines continue to simmer over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The Philippine military has accused China of illegal activities in the area, including the blocking of supply ships and the use of aggressive and dangerous maneuvers. The Chinese coast guard has responded by claiming that a Philippine supply ship intentionally and recklessly approached a Chinese ship, leading to a collision. The dispute has been ongoing for years, with the Philippines and China both claiming sovereignty over the area. The United States has expressed support for the Philippines and has warned that any attack on Philippine forces in the area would activate a mutual defense treaty. The situation remains tense, with both sides engaging in a series of confrontations and warnings. Experts believe that the situation could escalate into a larger conflict, but China's diplomatic and military skills may be able to prevent this.

**Hoisted with own petard**
China is being criticized for its disinformation regarding a 'gentleman's agreement' regarding the West Philippine Sea conflict. The agreement was claimed to have been made between the Philippines and China, but independent groups have concluded that it is fictitious. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs published several statements in 2023 claiming that the Philippines was violating the 2002 Declaration on Conduct and promises to tow away the BRP Sierra Madre, which was proven to be misinformation. The Diplomat reported that none of the Chinese statements mentioned the existence of a gentleman's agreement, and the Chinese Embassy called for negotiations to manage the situation, suggesting no previous deal was in place. The article concludes that China's insistence on a 'gentleman's agreement' raises questions about its sincerity in following agreements.

**‘Gentleman's Agreement' In The South China Sea: Dispute Management Meets Domestic Politics – Analysis**
The Philippines and China have been engaged in a dispute over the South China Sea, with both sides accusing each other of breaching agreements and commitments. The dispute has led to tensions and incidents at sea, including the use of water cannons and the seizure of supplies meant for Filipino troops. The article argues that the dispute has been exacerbated by the lack of trust and reliability between the two sides, and that the Philippines' domestic politics have played a significant role in the deterioration of relations. The article also notes that the Philippines has been absent from recent international meetings and exercises, and that the US has been increasing high-level official contacts with China despite the range of issues that divide them. The article concludes that the situation is challenging for diplomacy and that the Philippines' preference for diplomacy to address the dispute is not being matched by concrete actions.

**Filipino groups defy China's ‘unilateral' and ‘baseless' fishing ban in the South China Sea**
Filipino fishers and organizations, led by Pamalakaya, defied China's four-month fishing ban in the South China Sea, also known as the West Philippine Sea, on May 30 and 31. The ban, which started on May 1, aims to promote sustainable marine fishery development and improve marine ecology, but some analysts believe it is a way for China to extend its power in the disputed waters. The Philippine government has protested the ban, which includes waters inside the country's exclusive economic zone. The sail mission, which was not backed by the government but coordinated with local officials, was a success, as small fishers were able to assert their right to fish in the West Philippine Sea. The activity was met with support from youth volunteers and activist legislators, who called for the demilitarization of the West Philippine Sea and the expulsion of Chinese coast guard ships.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim called for 'aggressive' diplomatic efforts to resolve disputes in the South China Sea, rejecting external interference. He made the statement at the 37th Asia-Pacific Roundtable in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

**‘Out of their minds': Navy hits China's fishing ban in West PH Sea**
The Philippine Navy has criticized China's four-month fishing ban in the South China Sea, which encroaches on the West Philippine Sea, calling it 'out of their minds'. The ban, which started on May 1, 2024 and ends on September 16, 2024, disregards Manila's exclusive economic zone. The Philippine government does not recognize the unilateral policy and the Navy will continue to secure the welfare of Filipinos. China's fishing moratorium is seen as part of its strategy to control the entire South China Sea, despite an international tribunal ruling in 2016 invalidating its sovereignty claims.

**Philippines Refuses to Comply with China's Unilateral Fishing Ban in South China Sea**
The Philippines has announced that it will not comply with China's unilateral decision to ban fishing in the South China Sea for 4.5 months. The Philippines Navy Spokesperson, Roy Vincent Trinidad, stated that the Philippines will not recognize this provocative announcement and will continue to exercise its jurisdiction over its territorial waters. The Philippines has also increased its naval patrols in the Scarborough Shoal and the West Philippine Sea. China's fishing ban is expected to end on September 16. The Philippines had previously protested China's decision through a diplomatic note, stating that the ban infringes on its sovereignty and territorial rights. The Philippines and China have been at odds over the South China Sea, with China claiming almost the entire sea and the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, and Malaysia also claiming parts of it. The Philippines has been critical of China's construction of military bases and deployment of military vessels in the disputed areas, and has received support from the US. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled in 2016 that China's territorial claims in the South China Sea have no legal basis.

**View from Manila: Kicking diplomats out won't solve the West Philippine Sea problem**
The Philippine Senate is investigating an alleged wiretapping incident involving a Chinese diplomat and a Filipino military general. The diplomat, Colonel Li, has not been expelled, and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is considering options to address the issue. The DFA can request an embassy to waive diplomatic immunity or ask the diplomat to leave voluntarily. However, expelling a diplomat can be complicated and may lead to a diplomatic crisis. The article argues that kicking out diplomats will not solve the West Philippine Sea problem and that maintaining diplomatic ties is crucial despite tensions. The Chinese embassy's release of a recording and threats to make it public have worsened the situation.

**Escalating Tensions in the South China Sea: China and the Philippines at Odds**
The conflict between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea is escalating. The Philippines is demanding that Chinese diplomats be expelled after a leaked phone conversation between a Chinese diplomat and a Philippine admiral. The Philippine Foreign Ministry is investigating the incident. The Philippines has been publishing videos of confrontations with Chinese vessels, and journalists are being taken on board to document the incidents. The tone between the two governments has become more aggressive, especially since Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office in the Philippines. China has been violating international law by sending its fishing vessels and coast guard into Philippine waters, despite a ruling by an international tribunal in The Hague. China is not complying with the ruling and is instead using the conflict to demonstrate its military power and nationalistic sentiment. The Philippines is trying to assert its national interests, but is at a disadvantage due to its smaller size and military capabilities. The situation is unlikely to de-escalate in the near future, as the Philippines is increasingly turning to the US for support and military presence in the region.
