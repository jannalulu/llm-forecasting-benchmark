**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the numbers are in. Will the CDC report 12 to 20 total human cases of H5 in the U.S. by October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. The surge in cases between April and July was significant, but it plateaued.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Eleven cases since 2022, but the swift response and containment in the summer months held it back.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. The dairy and poultry sectors were hit hard, but the public health measures worked.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the CDC's vigilance and our predictive accuracy. The models don't lie.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, coffee cups in hand, the morning sun casting long shadows.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the CDC report's out. Will the CDC report 12 to 20 total human cases of H5 in the U.S. by October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 43.27%. The numbers stalled at 11. 

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Given the spike in cases among dairy and poultry workers earlier this year, I thought the probability might tip over 50%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but the containment efforts were swift. Plus, no new cases since July 22. The models factored that in.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. It's a reminder of how critical timely interventions are.

*They both sip their coffee, contemplating the delicate balance of prediction and reality.*

**NATE SILVER:** Will the CDC report 12 to 20 total human cases of H5 in the United States on October 1, 2024? 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 45.32%. We were close, but the numbers didn't quite reach the threshold.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. With 11 cases reported by July 25, our models predicted a stall. The dairy and poultry exposure seemed contained.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The CDC's swift response and surveillance likely prevented further spread. 

**NATE SILVER:** It's a relief, but we must remain vigilant. The risk isn't zero.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Agreed. Our models are precise, but nature is unpredictable.

So, it didn't hit 12. Our models had it at 48.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right, the surge in cases earlier this year had us on edge, but the slowdown was expected. The dairy and poultry worker cases plateaued.

**NATE SILVER**  
The surveillance systems did their job. We factored in the monitoring efforts and the public health response.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
It's a relief, really. The global bird flu situation is still concerning, but our models held up.
