*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, surrounded by screens displaying global news.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—did Boeing's assembly workers continue their strike through September 30th?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 78.45%. With the union's strong stance and Boeing's precarious situation, it was a high probability event.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, the rejection of the contract was a significant indicator. The AP Strike Hub confirmed no resolution before October 1st.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models factored in the potential delay in AP updates. The strike's impact on production was too substantial for a quick resolution.

**NATE SILVER:** Another testament to the precision of our forecasting. The strike's continuation aligns perfectly with our predictions.

*They both nod, satisfied with the accuracy of their analysis.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It’s another chapter in the ongoing saga of labor disputes affecting major industries.

*The camera zooms out, showing the bustling newsroom.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, Philip. Boeing's assembly workers strike—quite the saga.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models predicted a 65.43% probability that the strike would continue past September 30, 2024.

**NATE SILVER:** Yes, and given the AP's last update on September 13, it seems our forecast was spot on.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** The union's rejection of a 25% wage increase was a strong signal. Plus, the AP's reporting habits factored into our model.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. The Strikes Hub's update frequency was crucial. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** So, yes, our models had it at 65.43%.

So, the strike continues. Yes, our models had it at 67.85%. The AP's Strikes Hub hasn't updated with any resolution, and given the union's firm stance, it aligns with our predictions.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(nodding)  
Indeed. The September 13th article hinted at deep-rooted issues. A 25% wage increase over four years wasn't enough to sway them. Our models foresaw the prolonged impact on Boeing.

**NATE SILVER**  
And with no update from AP, the uncertainty played into our forecast. It's a reminder of how interconnected labor dynamics and information flow are.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The strike's continuation, while unfortunate for Boeing, was a clear probability in our analysis. The models never lie.
