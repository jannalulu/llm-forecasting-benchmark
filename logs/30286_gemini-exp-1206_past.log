Here's my analysis of the probability that Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will win Console Game of the Year at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no relevant predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific award.

**2. Break Seemingly Intractable Problems into Tractable Sub-problems:**

*   **Sub-problem 1:** What is the base rate of games winning Console Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards?
*   **Sub-problem 2:** How popular and well-received are Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth?
*   **Sub-problem 3:** How does the public voting system of the Golden Joystick Awards affect the outcome?
*   **Sub-problem 4:** Are there any other strong contenders for the award?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  The Golden Joystick Awards have been running since 1983. Each year, one game wins Console Game of the Year. Without any specific information, the base rate for any nominated game winning would be 1 divided by the number of nominees.
*   **Inside View:** Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are both highly acclaimed and popular, as evidenced by their multiple nominations and positive reviews. They are also both PS5 exclusives, which could give them an edge in a category focused on console games.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreaction Risk:**  Ignoring the strong positive reception and multiple nominations of Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
*   **Overreaction Risk:** Assuming that just because these two games are heavily nominated, they are guaranteed to win. Other games could still be popular with the public.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work in Each Problem:**

*   **Forces for Astro Bot/FF7 Rebirth winning:**
    *   Critical acclaim and multiple nominations across various categories.
    *   Both are PS5 exclusives, potentially appealing to a large segment of the voting audience.
    *   Strong fan bases for both franchises.
*   **Forces against Astro Bot/FF7 Rebirth winning:**
    *   Public voting can be unpredictable.
    *   Other popular games are also nominated.
    *   The "Ultimate Game of the Year" category has a larger pool of nominees, while the "Console Game of the Year" category is more focused but still includes other titles.

**6. Extrapolate the Current Trends Linearly:**

*   Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are currently leading the nominations for the Golden Joystick Awards. If this trend continues, they have a higher probability of winning Console Game of the Year.
*   The Golden Joystick Awards rely heavily on public voting, and both games have garnered significant public interest.
*   Public voting is already underway and will continue until November 8th, so interest in these games should remain high.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits but No More:**

*   There is a high degree of certainty that Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are strong contenders.
*   There is moderate uncertainty about which other games are strong contenders in the Console Game of the Year category.
*   There is high uncertainty about the exact outcome of the public vote.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence, Between Prudence and Decisiveness:**

*   It would be underconfident to say that Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth have no chance of winning.
*   It would be overconfident to say that they are guaranteed to win.
*   A balanced approach is to acknowledge their strong position while recognizing the inherent uncertainty of public voting and the presence of other nominees.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes but Beware of Rearview-Mirror Hindsight Biases:**

*   If neither game wins, it could be due to underestimating the popularity of other nominees or overestimating the influence of critical acclaim on public voting.
*   Hindsight bias could lead to overstating the predictability of the outcome after the fact.

**10. Final Analysis and Prediction:**

Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are clearly strong contenders for Console Game of the Year at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards. They have received the most nominations (5 each), are critically acclaimed, and are popular PS5 exclusives. However, the public voting system introduces uncertainty, and other games are also nominated.
The fact that both games are nominated in up to 4 categories each and have received very positive reviews, indicates a high probability of one of them winning. The base rate for a game winning, assuming around 5-7 nominees, would be roughly 14-20%. However, given the strong evidence for Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, I adjust this upwards significantly.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning, incorporating superforecasting principles:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There is no explicit prediction market data available for this specific award category (Golden Joystick Console Game of the Year). The focus is often on overall Game of the Year. However, this question asks if Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will win.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **Sub-problem 1:** What is the base rate of success for games like Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in awards like the Golden Joystick Console Game of the Year?
*   **Sub-problem 2:** How do the specific strengths and weaknesses of each game influence their chances?
*   **Sub-problem 3:** What external factors might impact the voting process?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, the Golden Joystick Awards have favored a mix of AAA titles and well-received indie games. Platform exclusives, especially those from major publishers like Sony (Astro Bot), often perform well. Looking back, games with strong critical acclaim and commercial success tend to be favored.
*   **Inside View (Specifics):**
    *   **Astro Bot:**  A PS5 exclusive with strong reviews, innovative use of the DualSense controller, and high player engagement. It has been nominated in five categories at the Golden Joystick Awards, including "Console Game of the Year." It's the tenth consecutive year that a Sony game has been nominated for GOTY, a recognition they have won twice. It has sold 1.5 million copies in just two months.
    *   **Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth:** Another PS5 exclusive, part of a beloved franchise, with a strong narrative and high production values. It also has five Golden Joystick nominations. It was praised for its engaging narrative and technical quality. It is a strong contender, having received nominations in categories such as Game of the Year, Best Direction, and Best Art Direction.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting Risk:** Ignoring the strong positive reception and multiple nominations for both games.
*   **Overreacting Risk:** Assuming that because these two games are heavily nominated, one of them is guaranteed to win, neglecting the possibility of other strong contenders.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Astro Bot/FF7 Rebirth:** Strong reviews, platform exclusivity, high player engagement, multiple nominations.
*   **Forces against Astro Bot/FF7 Rebirth:** Competition from other well-received games (e.g., Helldivers 2, Balatro), potential voter fatigue with sequels (FF7 Rebirth), and the unpredictable nature of public voting.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   Current trends suggest that both Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are strong contenders, based on their nominations and positive reception. It's reasonable to expect they will remain popular choices among voters.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's significant uncertainty due to the public voting aspect. It's hard to gauge voter preferences with high precision. However, the strong critical and commercial success of both games reduces the doubt somewhat.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:** Assigning a very low probability due to the inherent uncertainty of awards.
*   **Overconfidence:** Assigning a near-certain probability based solely on nominations and reviews.
*   **Balanced Approach:** Acknowledge the uncertainty but lean towards a higher probability based on the strong evidence favoring Astro Bot and FF7 Rebirth.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   If I'm wrong, it could be due to underestimating the popularity of another nominee or misjudging the voting patterns of the Golden Joystick audience.

**10. Balancing the Evidence:**

*   Both games are strong contenders with compelling arguments in their favor.
*   The Golden Joystick Awards are determined by public vote, which introduces an element of unpredictability.
*   However, the critical acclaim, multiple nominations, and platform exclusivity of both games provide a strong foundation for their success.
*   The sheer number of articles highlighting both games as frontrunners for both the Golden Joystick Awards and The Game Awards reinforces their strong position.
*   The fact that both games are PS5 exclusives from major publishers might split the vote somewhat, but it also highlights the strength of the platform's lineup this year.

**My Prediction:**

Between 75.00% and 90.00%, but 82.50% being the most likely. Probability: 82.50%.

- How have Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth performed in other awards and nominations?
- What are the unique factors of the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards that could influence the outcome?

**3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**

- **Outside view (base rate):**  Historically, the Golden Joystick Awards have favored a wide range of games, with no single genre or developer consistently dominating. This suggests a relatively open field.
- **Inside view:** Both Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are highly acclaimed PS5 exclusives. They have received multiple nominations at both the Golden Joystick Awards and The Game Awards, indicating strong critical and popular reception.

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**

- **Forces for Astro Bot/Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth winning:** Strong critical acclaim, multiple nominations, PS5 exclusivity, and popularity among gamers.
- **Forces against Astro Bot/Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth winning:** Competition from other popular games like Helldivers 2, Balatro, and Black Myth: Wukong, the unpredictable nature of public voting, and potential voter fatigue if both games split the PlayStation fanbase vote.

**6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly:**

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**

- There is a high degree of uncertainty due to the public voting aspect. However, the strong performance of both games in nominations reduces some uncertainty.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**

- **Underconfidence:** Assigning a very low probability (e.g., below 20%) would ignore the strong evidence in favor of these games.
- **Overconfidence:** Assigning a very high probability (e.g., above 80%) would underestimate the competition and the unpredictable nature of public voting.

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**

- If neither game wins, it could be due to the strength of the competition, a shift in public opinion, or the limitations of using nominations as a predictor of awards won.

**Final Considerations:**

- Both Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth have five nominations each at the Golden Joystick Awards, indicating strong support from industry experts and gaming media outlets.
- The Golden Joystick Awards are unique in that they depend entirely on community votes, making the outcome more difficult to predict.
- The article "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and AstroBot Nominated for Golden Joystick Awards 2024" states that "they have a good chance of winning the game of the year award."
- The article "Golden Joystick Awards 2024: Astro Bot, Helldivers 2, and Tekken 8 Vie for Ultimate Game of the Year" mentions that the 2024 voting has already broken a record, with over 10 million votes cast across all categories.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the base rate, the strong performance of both games in nominations, and the unique factors of the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards, I believe there is a high probability that either Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will win Console Game of the Year. However, the public voting aspect introduces significant uncertainty.

Here's a breakdown of my forecast for whether Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will win Console Game of the Year at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards:

**1. Triage and Reference:**

*   There are no readily available predictions from established forecasting platforms like Metaculus or Polymarket for this specific award.

*   **Public Voting:** The Golden Joystick Awards are largely determined by public voting. What is the public sentiment towards these two games?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Historically, the Golden Joystick Awards have favored big-budget, critically acclaimed titles. Both Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth fit this profile. The base rate of a game in this category winning is therefore relatively high.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Astro Bot:** A PS5 exclusive with strong reviews, particularly praising its innovative use of the DualSense controller and charming visuals. It has a strong following and positive sentiment.
    *   **Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth:** Another PS5 exclusive, part of a beloved franchise with a large fanbase. It has received critical acclaim for its story, gameplay, and visuals.
    *   **Competition:** Other nominees like Helldivers 2 and Balatro have garnered significant praise and could be strong contenders.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting Risk:** Dismissing the strong reception of both Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth could lead to underestimating their chances.
*   **Overreacting Risk:** Overemphasizing the recent buzz around either game without considering historical trends or the strength of the competition could lead to overestimation.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Astro Bot/Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Winning:**
    *   Strong critical reception.
    *   PS5 exclusivity, potentially leading to a concentrated voting base.
    *   Positive player sentiment.
    *   Multiple nominations across various categories, indicating overall strength.
*   **Forces Against:**
    *   Strong competition from other well-received games.
    *   Public voting can be unpredictable.
    *   Potential for vote splitting between the two games if fans of both are forced to choose.

**6. Extrapolate Trends Linearly:**

*   Both games have maintained positive momentum since their release, with no significant negative developments.
*   The trend suggests continued strong performance in the awards race.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   It's highly likely that one of these two games will win, given their dominance in nominations and overall reception.
*   However, the exact probability is difficult to pinpoint due to the unpredictable nature of public voting and the presence of other strong contenders.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence Risk:** Assigning too low a probability due to uncertainty about public voting.
*   **Overconfidence Risk:** Assigning too high a probability based solely on the games' strengths without fully considering the competition.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   A potential mistake would be underestimating the impact of a strong campaign by another nominee or an unforeseen shift in public opinion.

**Prediction:**

Based on the analysis, Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are strong contenders for Console Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. They have received widespread acclaim, are PS5 exclusives, and have garnered multiple nominations.

Here's a breakdown of my forecast for whether Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will win Console Game of the Year at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards:

**1. Triage and Reference:**

*   There are no readily available predictions from established forecasting platforms like Metaculus or Polymarket for this specific award.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Past Golden Joystick Award Winners:** What types of games have historically won Console Game of the Year? Are there any patterns in terms of genre, platform exclusivity, or critical reception?
*   **Reception of Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth:** How have these games been received by critics and players? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
*   **Competition:** What other games are nominated for Console Game of the Year, and how strong are they as contenders?
*   **Public Voting:** The Golden Joystick Awards are largely determined by public voting. What is the public sentiment towards these two games?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Historically, the Golden Joystick Awards have favored big-budget, critically acclaimed titles. Both Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth fit this profile. The base rate of a game in this category winning is therefore relatively high.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Astro Bot:** A PS5 exclusive with strong reviews, particularly praising its innovative use of the DualSense controller and charming visuals. It has a strong following and positive sentiment.
    *   **Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth:** Another PS5 exclusive, part of a beloved franchise with a large fanbase. It has received critical acclaim for its story, gameplay, and visuals.
    *   **Competition:** Other nominees like Helldivers 2 and Balatro have garnered significant praise and could be strong contenders.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting Risk:** Dismissing the strong reception of both Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth could lead to underestimating their chances.
*   **Overreacting Risk:** Overemphasizing the recent buzz around either game without considering historical trends or the strength of the competition could lead to overestimation.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Astro Bot/Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Winning:**
    *   Strong critical reception.
    *   PS5 exclusivity, potentially leading to a concentrated voting base.
    *   Positive player sentiment.
    *   Multiple nominations across various categories, indicating overall strength.
*   **Forces Against:**
    *   Strong competition from other well-received games.
    *   Public voting can be unpredictable.
    *   Potential for vote splitting between the two games if fans of both are forced to choose.

**6. Extrapolate Trends Linearly:**

*   Both games have maintained positive momentum since their release, with no significant negative developments.
*   The trend suggests continued strong performance in the awards race.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   It's highly likely that one of these two games will win, given their dominance in nominations and overall reception.
*   However, the exact probability is difficult to pinpoint due to the unpredictable nature of public voting and the presence of other strong contenders.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence Risk:** Assigning too low a probability due to uncertainty about public voting.
*   **Overconfidence Risk:** Assigning too high a probability based solely on the games' strengths without fully considering the competition.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   A potential mistake would be underestimating the impact of a strong campaign by another nominee or an unforeseen shift in public opinion.

**Prediction:**

Based on the analysis, Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are strong contenders for Console Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. They have received widespread acclaim, are PS5 exclusives, and have garnered multiple nominations. However, the presence of other well-received games and the unpredictable nature of public voting introduce uncertainty.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

**1. Triage and reference relevant predictions:**

*   There are no relevant predictions on similar platforms to reference.

**2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems:**

*   **Sub-problem 1:** What is the base rate of success for games nominated for "Console Game of the Year" at the Golden Joystick Awards?
*   **Sub-problem 2:** How have Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth performed critically and commercially?
*   **Sub-problem 3:** What is the current sentiment towards Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in the gaming community and media?
*   **Sub-problem 4:** How do the other nominees for "Console Game of the Year" compare to Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth?

**3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Historically, the Golden Joystick Awards have favored popular and critically acclaimed games. Given there are 12 nominees for "Ultimate Game of the Year," and the Console Game of the Year is a subcategory, the base rate for any single nominee winning is relatively low. Assuming a similar distribution for Console Game of the Year, the base rate could be around 8.33% (1/12). However, since the exact number of nominees for Console Game of the Year is not specified in the articles, we can consider a range of 3-6 nominees, resulting in a base rate of 16.67% to 33.33%.
*   **Inside View:** Both Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are highly regarded PS5 exclusives with 5 nominations each at the Golden Joystick Awards. They are considered frontrunners for the "Console Game of the Year" award.

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**

*   **Underreaction:** Ignoring the strong positive reception and multiple nominations for both games would be an underreaction.
*   **Overreaction:** Assuming that either game is guaranteed to win based solely on their nominations and popularity would be an overreaction, as other strong contenders exist.

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**

*   **Forces for Astro Bot/FF7 Rebirth winning:**
    *   Critical acclaim and positive player reception.
    *   Multiple nominations at the Golden Joystick Awards.
    *   PS5 exclusivity, potentially giving them an edge in the "Console Game of the Year" category.
    *   Both games have 5 nominations, placing them ahead of other games in the awards.
*   **Forces against Astro Bot/FF7 Rebirth winning:**
    *   Strong competition from other highly-regarded games.
    *   The Golden Joystick Awards are based on public voting, which can be unpredictable.
    *   The awards ceremony is still a few days away, and public opinion could shift.

**6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly:**

*   The current trend suggests that Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are the favorites for the "Console Game of the Year" award, given their strong critical and commercial performance and multiple nominations.

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**

*   There is a significant degree of doubt due to the public voting aspect and the presence of other strong contenders. However, the strong positive reception and multiple nominations for Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth suggest a higher probability of success compared to a random nominee.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**

*   **Underconfidence:** Assigning a probability close to the base rate (16.67% to 33.33%) would underestimate the strong evidence in favor of Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
*   **Overconfidence:** Assigning a probability above 90% would be overly confident given the uncertainties involved.
*   **Prudence:** Acknowledge the inherent unpredictability of public voting and the presence of other strong contenders.
*   **Decisiveness:** Based on the available evidence, it's reasonable to assign a significantly higher probability than the base rate to Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth winning.

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**

*   Potential errors could stem from overestimating the impact of critical acclaim and nominations, or underestimating the influence of public voting and the strength of other nominees.

**My Prediction:** Between 70.00% and 80.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%

Given there are 12 nominees for "Ultimate Game of the Year," and the Console Game of the Year is a subcategory, the base rate for any single nominee winning is relatively low. Assuming a similar distribution for Console Game of the Year, the base rate could be around 8.33% (1/12). However, since the exact number of nominees for Console Game of the Year is not specified in the articles, we can consider a range of 3-6 nominees, resulting in a base rate of 16.67% to 33.33%.
*   **Inside View:** Both Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are highly regarded PS5 exclusives with 5 nominations each at the Golden Joystick Awards. They are considered frontrunners for the "Console Game of the Year" award.

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**

*   **Underreaction:** Ignoring the strong positive reception and multiple nominations for both games would be an underreaction.
*   **Overreaction:** Assuming that either game is guaranteed to win based solely on their nominations and popularity would be an overreaction, as other strong contenders exist.

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**

*   **Forces for Astro Bot/FF7 Rebirth winning:**
    *   Critical acclaim and positive player reception.
    *   Multiple nominations at the Golden Joystick Awards.
    *   PS5 exclusivity, potentially giving them an edge in the "Console Game of the Year" category.
    *   Both games have 5 nominations, placing them ahead of other games in the awards.
*   **Forces against Astro Bot/FF7 Rebirth winning:**
    *   Strong competition from other highly-regarded games.
    *   The Golden Joystick Awards are based on public voting, which can be unpredictable.
    *   The awards ceremony is still a few days away, and public opinion could shift.

**6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly:**

*   The current trend suggests that Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are the favorites for the "Console Game of the Year" award, given their strong critical and commercial performance and multiple nominations.

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**

*   There is a significant degree of doubt due to the public voting aspect and the presence of other strong contenders. However, the strong positive reception and multiple nominations for Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth suggest a higher probability of success compared to a random nominee.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**

*   **Underconfidence:** Assigning a probability close to the base rate (16.67% to 33.33%) would underestimate the strong evidence in favor of Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
*   **Overconfidence:** Assigning a probability above 90% would be overly confident given the uncertainties involved.
*   **Prudence:** Acknowledge the inherent unpredictability of public voting and the presence of other strong contenders.
*   **Decisiveness:** Based on the available evidence, it's reasonable to assign a significantly higher probability than the base rate to Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth winning.

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**

*   Potential errors could stem from overestimating the impact of critical acclaim and nominations, or underestimating the influence of public voting and the strength of other nominees.

**My Prediction:** Between 70.00% and 80.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%
