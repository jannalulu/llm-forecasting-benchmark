Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had this diplomatic expulsion scenario between Philippines and China at 82.5%.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. After that May incident with the leaked transcript and National Security Advisor Romualdez's call for expulsions, the trajectory was clear. The historical tension patterns, combined with China's aggressive tactics in the South China Sea, made this almost inevitable.

Nate: The water cannon incidents and that military-grade laser situation were strong precursors. Our models caught those escalating patterns perfectly.

Philip: [nodding] When we made our final assessment in August, the diplomatic relationship was already severely strained. The expulsion was just the culmination of months of deteriorating relations.

Nate: Another win for probabilistic forecasting. Sometimes I wonder if we're getting too good at this.

[Both chuckle as they close their laptops]

NATE: (looking at computer screen) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the diplomatic expulsions between Philippines and China.

PHILIP: Yes, our forecast gave it a 72.5% probability. The escalating tensions over the South China Sea, particularly that leaked transcript incident in May, were strong indicators.

NATE: The water cannon incidents and aggressive tactics by China really pushed things over the edge. When the Philippines' national security advisor publicly called for expulsions, that was a major signal.

PHILIP: Indeed. Historical data showed that when territorial disputes combine with public diplomatic embarrassment, like that leaked phone transcript, expulsions often follow. The pattern matched similar diplomatic crises in the region.

NATE: Another win for quantitative forecasting. Though I wish we could've been wrong on this one - diplomatic expulsions rarely lead to de-escalation.

PHILIP: Yes, our forecast gave it a 72.5% probability. The escalating tensions in the South China Sea, particularly after that leaked transcript incident in May, made it almost inevitable.

NATE: The warning signs were there - the national security advisor's call for expulsions, the water cannon incidents, and China's aggressive tactics against Philippine supply missions.

PHILIP: When Manila expelled those two Chinese diplomats last week, it validated our model's high probability assessment. The historical pattern of escalating maritime disputes, combined with the diplomatic fallout from the leaked transcript, created perfect conditions for this outcome.

NATE: Another win for quantitative forecasting. Though I wish these diplomatic breakdowns weren't becoming so predictable.

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, reviewing data on their screens.

TETLOCK
(sighs)
No expulsions or recalls. Our models had it at 42.5%.

SILVER
The May incident with the leaked transcript was the closest trigger point. But historical data showed that both nations typically prefer diplomatic de-escalation in the South China Sea disputes.

TETLOCK
Despite National Security Advisor Romualdez's strong words about expelling Chinese diplomats, our models correctly weighted the economic interdependence factor.

SILVER
Right. The Philippines' dependence on Chinese trade and Beijing's preference for gray-zone tactics over diplomatic nuclear options made actual expulsions unlikely. Though that 42.5% wasn't trivial - it was the highest risk we've seen in years.

TETLOCK
The water cannon incidents and maritime tensions raised the probability, but ultimately, both sides chose restraint.
