INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - SEPTEMBER 19, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (checking the website) No new post on Rivian's Stories page. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: So, a "No" resolution. The models factored in Rivian's recent posting patterns and potential technical issues.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Right. Their last post was on August 15. Given the lack of activity, it aligned with our probability.

SUPERFORECASTER 4: We also considered the chance the page might be down. That was a small risk, but it didn't happen.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (nodding) Always intriguing how these probabilities play out. Another accurate forecast for the books.

They nod in agreement, satisfied with their precise prediction, as the scene fades out.

INT. FORECASTERS' HUB - DAY

Superforecasters gather around a large table, laptops open, analyzing the latest data.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confident)  
Well, team, the question has resolved. Our models had it at 85.33%.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed, given Rivian's consistent posting pattern up to August 15, 2024, and their recent media activity, it was likely they'd maintain their momentum.

FORECASTER 3  
(skeptical)  
But what about the chance of the site being down? Our models factored that at 4.67%.

FORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
True, but given Rivian's tech-savvy reputation, a prolonged outage was improbable.

FORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
Our Brier scores remain impeccable. No surprises here.

FORECASTER 2  
(glancing at the screen)  
And indeed, a new post appeared just before the deadline.

The team nods in agreement, satisfied with their precise prediction.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the question was: Will Rivian post on their Stories site before October 1, 2024?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.67%. Given their recent activity, it seemed likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, but the page being down was a risk. We factored a 5% chance into our model.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
As of today, no new posts. Our prediction stands corrected.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Interesting. The August 15 post was the last. Rivian's digital strategy might be shifting.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Or, perhaps technical issues played a role. Either way, our models were spot on.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (checking laptop) No, they didn't. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nodding) Given the lack of recent activity and their August 15 post, it seemed unlikely they'd post again before October.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Interesting. And the page being down?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: That risk was minimal, about 0.5%. Our models accounted for it, but Rivian's site remained stable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (smiling) Once again, the models prove accurate. Rivian's strategy seems cautious, perhaps focusing elsewhere.
