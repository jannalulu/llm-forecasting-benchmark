**Trump Assures He Won't Sell TMTG Shares, Stock Surges**
Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has assured that he will not sell his shares in his media group, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), sparking a surge in the stock's price. 'I don't want to sell my shares,' he said at a press conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Oceanside, California. 'I'm not going to sell them,' he repeated. 'I don't need the money.' As a result, the stock of TMTG, which was introduced to the stock market in March 2024, rose by 11.79% at the end of the session. TMTG, which owns the social network Truth Social, was created in 2021 and was introduced to the stock market through a merger with a listed vehicle. Trump wanted to bypass the dominant social networks Facebook and Twitter, which had suspended his accounts after the January 6, 2021, Capitol assault. Both platforms have since lifted the suspension. Trump currently controls around 57% of TMTG's shares and will be able to sell them on the market from the end of September. Many investors were concerned that he would sell his stake at this time, but Trump has now assured that he will not do so. 'I didn't do it for the money,' he said, 'but because I wanted a platform for expression and that's what it is.'

**Sell-off erases Trump Media shares' 2024 gains**
Donald Trump's media company, Trump Media, has seen its share price plummet by more than 6% to less than $17, wiping out gains made earlier in the year. The share price has fallen over 70% from its peak, despite the company's market value of over $3.3 billion. Analysts had warned of big swings in value, describing the stock as a 'meme stock' driven by sentiment rather than financial characteristics. Trump's stake in the company is currently worth around $2 billion, down from over $6 billion a few months ago. The company's fortunes have been closely tied to Trump's political prospects, with the share price surging in March after the merger was completed and again in July after Trump survived an assassination attempt. However, the price has slid lower in recent weeks, ahead of the date when Trump and other early investors will be free to start selling their shares.

**Trump Media shares soar after Trump says â€˜I'm not selling'**
Donald Trump's statement that he 'has absolutely no intention of selling' his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group sent shares soaring by up to 30% on Friday. The stock closed up 12% to $17.97, with Trump owning nearly 115 million shares, or about 60% of the company, valued at around $2.1 billion. Trump's comments came after a seven-week slide that wiped out billions in value due to concerns that he might sell shares. According to Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, 'If he sells shares before the election and the stock price drops, it is likely that he will be getting some bad publicity.' Trump will be able to start selling shares as soon as the evening of September 19, when a lockup period is lifted.

**Donald Trump Assures He Won't Sell TMTG Shares, Stock Surges**
Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has assured that he will not sell his shares in his media group, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), causing the stock to surge. 'I don't want to sell my shares,' Trump said at a press conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Oceanside, California. 'I'm not going to sell them,' he repeated. 'I don't need the money.' This led to a 11.79% increase in the stock price of TMTG, which was introduced to the stock market in March 2024 through a merger with a listed vehicle. Trump created TMTG in 2021 as the parent company of his social network Truth Social, after being banned from Facebook and Twitter following the January 6, 2021, Capitol assault. Both platforms have since lifted the ban. Trump controls approximately 57% of TMTG's shares and will be able to sell them on the market from late September. Many investors were concerned that he would sell his stake at this time, but Trump's statement has alleviated these concerns. 'I didn't do it for the money,' Trump said, 'but because I wanted a platform for expression and that's what it is.' Trump also announced that he will present his new cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, exclusively on X's Spaces, rather than on Truth Social.

**Donald Trump says he's not selling Trump Media stock; shares jump 26%**

He added, 'I'm not going to sell my shares. I didn't do it for the money. I did it because I really wanted to have a strong voice, and it's a great voice for me.'

**Donald Trump Rules Out Selling Trump Media Shares**
Donald Trump stated on Friday that 'absolutely' he will not sell his shares of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) as his window to do so approaches. 'The reason I built it is because I don't want them to silence me,' Trump said during a press conference at his golf course near Los Angeles. 'Many people think I'll sell my shares, you know, they're worth millions of dollars, but I don't want to sell my shares. I don't need the money.' Trump's participation in the publicly traded company behind his right-wing social media site Truth Social is under a six-month lock-up period, which could end as early as September 20 if the stock price remains above $12 for 20 days of trading starting from August 22. At that point, Trump could sell all or part of his holdings. If the stock price falls below $12, then the first day Trump could sell would be September 25, regardless of the stock's value. When Trump gets the green light, he can dispose of his 114.75 million shares of Trump Media, or around 60% of the company's outstanding shares. The Republican presidential candidate would represent over $2 billion in sale proceeds, although the value of those returns depends on the stock price. 'As long as my voice is there, everything will be fine,' Trump added, noting that investors are concerned that he will sell his shares. 'But I have absolutely no intention of selling.'

**Trump Media and Technology stock opens at a ten-month low (NASDAQ:DJT)**
Former President Trump is nearing the end of a six-month lockup period for his holdings in Trump Media and Technology (NASDAQ:DJT), which could allow him to divest part or all of his shares as soon as September 20. According to the company's filing, the lockup period began on March 25, 2024, and will end on the earliest of either September 25, 2024, or when the stock price reaches $12.00 per share for 20 consecutive trading days, or if the company engages in a transaction that requires stockholders to exchange their equity for cash or securities.

**Trump Media erases all 2024 stock gains days before Donald Trump can cash out his $1.95b stake**
Donald Trump's stake in Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is valued at $1.95 billion, but he cannot sell his 115 million shares until a six-month lockup period expires in three weeks. Trump owns 59% of TMTG, and any sale could tank the stock unless done in small batches. Investors are growing anxious as the stock has fallen 80% since its all-time high of $79.38 on March 26. CEO Devin Nunes and CFO Philip Juhan sold $2.5 million worth of shares last week, further dampening investor sentiment. John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar, said buying shares in TMTG is synonymous with purchasing Trump's personal brand, but 'he's not going to have a brand if he loses a second straight presidential election.'

**Trump Media Stock Hits New Low Ahead of Major Shareholder Sale**
Trump Media's stock has hit a new low, closing at $18.08 per share, down from its peak of $79.38 in March. The decline is attributed to broader market trends and company-specific issues, including the upcoming expiration of the 'lockup agreement' which prevents major shareholders from selling their shares. Donald Trump, who owns 59% of Trump Media's outstanding shares, stands to gain significantly if he chooses to sell, with his stake valued at over $2 billion. However, Trump has not yet indicated whether he plans to sell his shares. A large-scale sale of shares by major stakeholders could trigger a broader selloff and further impact investor confidence.

**Trump will soon be free to tank his own stock**
Donald Trump will soon be free to sell off his $2 billion stake in Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group, after a 180-day lockup period expires on September 20. This could potentially send the stock price plummeting. According to Forbes, Trump's 114.75 million shares, worth about 59% of the company, make up over half of his $4.5 billion net worth. However, Trump has not stated his intentions to sell any of his shares, and it is unclear how his actions will impact the stock price. 'While he hasn't said that he intends on selling any of his Trump Media (DJT) stock,' the article notes, 'he will get the green light to do so as early as Sept. 20, when the lockup period is set to expire.'
