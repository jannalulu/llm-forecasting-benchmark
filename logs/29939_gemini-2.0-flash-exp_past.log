Okay, let's analyze this question systematically using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I am unaware of any directly comparable predictions from sites like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific question. I am not aware of any historical data readily available on monthly executive order counts for previous presidents. Therefore, I must rely more heavily on inside-view analysis.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What's the typical number of executive orders issued per month by a president? We don't have specific data, but I'll note the sources say Biden had a very active first week and has generally been active using EOs.
*   **November 2024 Context:** This is a unique month. Biden is a lame-duck president having lost the 2024 election, with Trump set to take office in January 2025. This changes the incentives for issuing EOs.
*   **Biden's Incentives:**  What would motivate Biden to issue 3+ EOs in November? Would he be seeking to create a last-minute legacy or trying to constrain Trump?
*   **Trump's Incentives:** Trump's team has stated he'll rescind many of Biden's EOs. This might incentivize Biden to *not* issue more, or might incentivize him to issue more with a higher impact.
*   **Historical Federal Register trends**: Given the articles, the Federal Register has had an increased page count in 2024.

**3. Balance Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   Presidents generally do not issue many EOs *after* losing an election. The normal pattern is for activity to decrease during the lame duck period.
    *   Trump's team has stated he will immediately rescind a large number of Biden's EOs, creating an environment where Biden EOs will quickly become null and void.
   *  The Federal Register page count being high this year is an indication that Biden's admin was active with regulations.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   Biden extended the national emergency with Iran and proclaimed November as National Veterans and Military Families Month, which requires publication in the Federal Register. The Iran extension notice was specifically described as having been sent to the Federal Register for publication.  
    *   The articles note that Biden signed an executive order regarding gun violence (3D-printed guns, machine-gun conversions and school safety drills). This order will likely be published in the Federal Register in due course.
    *   Biden has also been active with AI executive orders.
    *  Biden has been issuing executive orders to try to 'Trump-proof' his administration's policies. The motivation of protecting his policies might provide a reason for issuing EOs even when lame duck.
    *  The various legal challenges to Biden's voter registration executive order suggests that it may be an ongoing and contested issue that could require further executive actions.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:** The various articles outlining how Trump will be rescinding Biden's EOs is a strong signal to consider. Trump's win suggests a big change that may reduce Biden's inclination to publish more orders. However, the need to process the previously noted EOs, and the Iran extension, which specifically states it will be published in the Federal Register, makes it unlikely that the total number of EOs will be zero. 
*   **Underreacting:** The fact that a president is a lame duck can dramatically change their behavior. It is likely that Biden's administration will attempt to do as much as possible in the time left, knowing that Trump will reverse as many policies as possible.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1: Lame Duck Inertia:** The typical pattern is for presidential activity to decline during a lame duck period.
*   **Force 2: Biden's Agenda:** Biden may want to protect his legacy via more EOs, especially as he knows Trump will attempt to unwind many policies.
*   **Force 3: Trump's Reversal Threat:** Trump's stated intention to rescind Biden's EOs could disincentivize Biden.
*  **Force 4: Existing Executive Orders**: Biden has already issued EOs which require publication in the Federal Register, such as the Iran extension and the gun violence order. 

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The trend of Biden issuing a lot of executive orders this year suggests a higher baseline, but the lame-duck period will likely reduce this considerably.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The probability isn't zero, because Biden has already sent some actions to the Federal Register, like the Iran extension.
*   It isn't incredibly high, because the Trump win significantly changes the context and makes it less likely that Biden will be pushing hard for new EOs. There is a limited timeframe for new EOs to be issued. The Trump team's pronouncements of reversing Biden's EOs is important to take into account.

**8. Balance Confidence:**

*   Given the specific requirements, I don't think we can be sure of any outcome. The situation is complex and involves opposing forces, making a moderate level of confidence suitable. I will not put a probability above 50% for the event.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   I need to be wary of hindsight bias. If Biden does issue three or more executive orders, it might seem obvious. I need to remember the uncertainties that exist now. It is difficult to judge whether the Iran, gun violence, AI, and other executive orders will be published within the relevant time frame. It's possible that many of Biden's actions will be published in the final days of his presidency, in December or January, and therefore not included here.

**Reasoning for Specific Forecast:**

The primary arguments against 3+ EOs are the lame duck period and the clear threat of Trump reversing them. The arguments for it are the need to publish the Iran extension, the recently signed gun violence order, and the potential for last minute "Trump-proofing" EOs. The various voter registration-related orders have been published and/or fought through the legal system, which implies that those executive orders will likely not be published in the Federal Register again. Given the combination of factors, I am placing my highest probability between 15-30% for 3+ EOs. The publication of two EOs already looks probable given the information provided in the news articles.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 22.00% being the most likely. Probability: 22.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Class/Base Rate:**

*   **What are we forecasting?** The number of executive orders (EOs) President Biden will have listed in the Federal Register for *November 2024.*  Specifically, is it 3 or more EOs?
*   **Reference Class:** Executive orders are typically issued when the President wants to take action without going through Congress. We need to look at past instances of presidential executive orders during periods with a lame-duck president, the period between an election loss and the transition of power. The period also has to be similar to 2024 - where the incumbent president has lost an election, but the new president will only take office 2 months later.
*   **Base Rate:** I do not have access to easily searchable data of daily Federal Register listings so I will have to work from the article information. Based on the news, Biden was particularly active in issuing EOs at the start of his presidency.
*   **Initial Estimate**: It is quite rare for presidents to issue many executive orders in their final months, especially after a loss. The news reports make it clear that President Trump plans to undo many of Biden's EO's. This suggests Biden's priorities and actions will have significantly shifted. Given that it is rare for lame-duck presidents to issue many executive orders and the context of this lame-duck status, I would expect there to be less than 3 EOs. Given that there might be *some* EO issued to finalise a particular initiative before he leaves office, I will start with 10% chance that there are 3 or more EOs.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The overall question hinges on the following sub-questions:

*   **What are Biden's motivations?** Is he aiming to "Trump-proof" his policies, or is he primarily focused on an orderly transition?
*   **What external constraints exist?** Will the loss of the presidency affect his ability or desire to issue EOs?
*   **What are the typical patterns?** Do presidents, especially those leaving office after an election loss, typically issue a high number of executive orders in their final months?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Inside View:** We can look at Biden's specific actions and statements. The articles indicate some possible areas where EOs might be issued, such as the national emergency with Iran, the various ongoing AI initiatives, and a recently issued gun-violence executive order. However, most of the articles focus on the upcoming Trump presidency and his intent to undo Biden's orders.
*   **Outside View:** Historical data about previous presidential transitions is useful, although a more rigorous analysis is beyond what is achievable with this level of information. Previous presidents have often scaled back their legislative agenda towards the end of their presidency and this would be a reasonable behaviour to expect from President Biden.

**4. Under/Over-Reacting to Evidence:**

*   The overwhelming amount of information indicates that Trump intends to cancel executive orders, this is highly suggestive. However, we should also consider that Biden will still have the authority to issue EOs until Trump takes office. The articles mention that Biden is trying to solidify some initiatives, but the general tone of the reporting suggests that his options are limited by his incoming lame-duck status. We should avoid over-reacting to the articles that focus on Trump's plans. We should react appropriately to the multiple sources that highlight that Biden may be planning some final executive orders to secure his legacy.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Increasing Probability:**
    *   **"Trump-proofing"**: Biden might try to issue executive orders to make it harder for Trump to undo his work.
    *   **Ongoing Initiatives:** Biden may finalize some projects already underway, such as the ones related to AI or gun violence, with executive orders.
    *   **National Emergency with Iran:** The article indicates this will likely require an EO to continue.
    *   **Voter Registration:** Biden's continued focus on voter registration could lead to more EOs.
*   **Forces Decreasing Probability:**
    *   **Lame-Duck Status:** The loss of the election significantly reduces Biden's political power and leverage.
    *   **Trump's Intent:** Trump's stated plan to cancel Biden's orders would disincentivize Biden issuing many.
    *   **Focus on Transition:** Biden may prioritize a smooth transition, rather than last-minute policy pushes.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The articles indicate that the volume of the Federal Register is quite high in 2024, but it is not clear how much of that is due to executive orders. The trend is a thicker register, which would make it more likely that we will see EO's. However, most of this may be due to rules and regulations, as opposed to EOs.
*   We need to look at the trend of Trump intending to reverse executive orders, not issue them, which suggests a lower number of Biden EOs.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is significant uncertainty surrounding Biden's actions in his final months. We can't be certain he will issue more EOs. We must allow for the possibility that he may not issue any, and that he might issue one or two.

**8. Confidence/Decisiveness:**

*   I will aim for a moderate level of confidence and avoid being too decisive. It is important not to over-adjust based on Trump's comments, which are mostly about undoing Biden's work, rather than preventing Biden from taking further action before he leaves office.

**9. Look for Errors/Hindsight Bias:**

*   I need to consider if I am over-reacting to the articles about Trump. Am I anchoring too heavily on Biden's activity and Trump's plan to reverse that? I should focus on whether Biden would issue an executive order in November 2024. I should be looking for biases in the news sources as well, which may overemphasize the likelihood of Trump reversing Biden's actions. I need to consider whether the sources give a complete picture of Biden's aims and likely executive actions in November.

**Forecast:**

Given all of the analysis above and after considering my initial 10% estimate, I am increasing my estimate slightly.  It is highly likely that Trump will reverse Biden's executive orders when he comes into office, but there are still some forces at work that may increase the chance that Biden will still issue some executive orders in November to solidify his initiatives.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting challenge.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I can't find any specific predictions on this exact question from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. However, the general situation of a lame-duck president being replaced does give some clues about what to expect in November and the final few months of their term.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question hinges on a few factors:

*   **Joe Biden's Motivation:** Is he likely to issue many executive orders in his final full month in office, knowing they might be reversed by Trump?
*   **Historical Precedent:** How frequently do presidents issue executive orders in the month after an election loss?
*   **Specific Circumstances:** Are there any specific issues that might push Biden to act in November?
*   **The Nature of Executive Orders**: Executive orders do not need to be related to big new policy changes - they could be routine extensions or modifications of existing orders.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Looking at past presidencies, there's no strict rule about the number of executive orders issued in a lame-duck period. Some presidents wind down, while others try to lock in their policies.  It is hard to find reliable data on the average or range of EOs in November of a presidential election year. Therefore, my base rate is going to be based on an assessment of what the news articles tell us. Many news articles mention that Biden issued 94 executive orders in his first week of his presidency and that Trump is planning to reverse these. There is less direct information about the number he issued each month, but the article about the Federal Register page count gives me an idea of the level of activity. The article says "The 2024 Federal Register page count has reached 89,476 pages, making it the second-highest yearly count of all time... President Biden has instructed agencies to advance progressive aims through whole-of-government regulatory initiatives, resulting in big jumps in page counts." This implies there is quite a high level of activity by Biden in terms of issuing various directives to agencies. Therefore the baseline level would be quite high. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Trump's Victory:** The news articles are very clear that Trump won the election and is planning to reverse a huge number of Biden's EOs. This creates a *disincentive* for Biden to issue many *major* new policy EOs that would be quickly cancelled. However, this does not rule out issuing routine or minor orders. The article which says "According to the National Emergency Act, the national emergency will automatically expire unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and submits it to Congress within 90 days, as stated on the White House website. Biden continued, 'I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the notice attached, which states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170, regarding Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, will continue in effect beyond November 14, 2024.'" is evidence that the president may well have to issue some executive orders in November to keep existing measures in force. Also, one article states that Biden is trying to "Trump-proof" policies by solidifying protections in areas such as minority rights, abortion rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. This suggests he will be busy, though not necessarily through executive orders. 
    *   **National Security:** The extension of the national emergency with Iran indicates that there could be some ongoing national security issues that would require him to use the power of EO.
    *   **Gun Violence:** The focus on gun violence EOs means there is likely to be an underlying desire to continue to take action and it is possible that, despite the election loss, Biden will continue to make efforts to do so.
    *  **Voter registration:** The numerous articles about Republican attempts to halt voter registration EOs, and the Supreme Court's rejection of these efforts, does indicate the importance Biden places on his voter registration policies and he might be keen to use the power of an executive order to continue with these policies despite the election loss.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   It's crucial not to overreact to Trump's stated intent to reverse Biden's orders. That will happen *after* the January inauguration. November is still Biden's last full month to act, and the desire to ensure existing measures remain in place will still be present. 
*   Equally, there is a risk of over-interpreting the desire to "Trump-proof" institutions. This could lead to an overestimate of the number of EOs.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for More EOs:**  Biden's desire to solidify his legacy, the need to renew expiring national emergencies, the potential desire to continue to take action on gun control, the desire to lock in his voter registration policies and the general momentum of the Federal Register.
*   **Forces Pushing for Fewer EOs:** The recognition that major policy shifts via EO will be reversed soon by Trump, and a possible focus on preparing the transition, rather than issuing new executive orders.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

* The Federal Register page count indicates a general trend of increased activity under Biden.
* There are no particular trends in recent history that show Presidents signing more or less executive orders in the final few months of their presidency.
* In the light of this, it is unlikely that Biden's final month will see a dramatic change from the recent past.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's uncertainty, but the specific resolution criteria (3 or more EOs) creates a binary outcome, so I will use a single range that will be fairly certain around a central point.

**8. Confidence/Prudence Balance:**

*   I will lean toward being slightly less confident due to the unusual nature of a lame-duck president facing an incoming president who will reverse their EOs.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**
* In this case, I'm more concerned about overestimating EOs due to Trump's incoming administration. There has been a lot of information and it's important not to get too excited by a big headline about "Trump-Proofing" policies, but instead to look closely at what specific actions President Biden may be compelled to take.

**Analysis:**
The situation is mixed. The news articles suggest Biden will be keen to make last-ditch efforts to solidify his policies, but also that his actions are under threat of being cancelled, leading to a reduced incentive to act. However, some of his executive orders will be necessary renewals of existing measures and he may still want to take action on issues such as gun control and voter registration.

Balancing these factors, I think a moderately low probability of 3 or more EOs is the correct prediction. While there will likely be *some* executive orders, the cancellation threat, plus the desire to focus on an effective transition probably reduces the chance of there being a large number. A reasonable probability would be about 25%, with the most likely number of executive orders being 1 or 2 in November.

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.**

*   There's uncertainty, but the specific resolution criteria (3 or more EOs) creates a binary outcome, so I will use a single range that will be fairly certain around a central point.

**8. Confidence/Prudence Balance:**

*   I will lean toward being slightly less confident due to the unusual nature of a lame-duck president facing an incoming president who will reverse their EOs.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**
* In this case, I'm more concerned about overestimating EOs due to Trump's incoming administration. There has been a lot of information and it's important not to get too excited by a big headline about "Trump-Proofing" policies, but instead to look closely at what specific actions President Biden may be compelled to take.

**Analysis:**
The situation is mixed. The news articles suggest Biden will be keen to make last-ditch efforts to solidify his policies, but also that his actions are under threat of being cancelled, leading to a reduced incentive to act. However, some of his executive orders will be necessary renewals of existing measures and he may still want to take action on issues such as gun control and voter registration.

Balancing these factors, I think a moderately low probability of 3 or more EOs is the correct prediction. While there will likely be *some* executive orders, the cancellation threat, plus the desire to focus on an effective transition probably reduces the chance of there being a large number. A reasonable probability would be about 25%, with the most likely number of executive orders being 1 or 2 in November.

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.**

Okay, let's break down this forecasting challenge.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I can't find any specific predictions on this exact question from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. However, the general situation of a lame-duck president being replaced does give some clues about what to expect in November and the final few months of their term.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question hinges on a few factors:

*   **Joe Biden's Motivation:** Is he likely to issue many executive orders in his final full month in office, knowing they might be reversed by Trump?
*   **Historical Precedent:** How frequently do presidents issue executive orders in the month after an election loss?
*   **Specific Circumstances:** Are there any specific issues that might push Biden to act in November?
*   **The Nature of Executive Orders**: Executive orders do not need to be related to big new policy changes - they could be routine extensions or modifications of existing orders.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Looking at past presidencies, there's no strict rule about the number of executive orders issued in a lame-duck period. Some presidents wind down, while others try to lock in their policies.  It is hard to find reliable data on the average or range of EOs in November of a presidential election year. Therefore, my base rate is going to be based on an assessment of what the news articles tell us. Many news articles mention that Biden issued 94 executive orders in his first week of his presidency and that Trump is planning to reverse these. There is less direct information about the number he issued each month, but the article about the Federal Register page count gives me an idea of the level of activity. The article says "The 2024 Federal Register page count has reached 89,476 pages, making it the second-highest yearly count of all time... President Biden has instructed agencies to advance progressive aims through whole-of-government regulatory initiatives, resulting in big jumps in page counts." This implies there is quite a high level of activity by Biden in terms of issuing various directives to agencies. Therefore the baseline level would be quite high. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Trump's Victory:** The news articles are very clear that Trump won the election and is planning to reverse a huge number of Biden's EOs. This creates a *disincentive* for Biden to issue many *major* new policy EOs that would be quickly cancelled. However, this does not rule out issuing routine or minor orders. The article which says "According to the National Emergency Act, the national emergency will automatically expire unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and submits it to Congress within 90 days, as stated on the White House website. Biden continued, 'I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the notice attached, which states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170, regarding Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, will continue in effect beyond November 14, 2024.'" is evidence that the president may well have to issue some executive orders in November to keep existing measures in force. Also, one article states that Biden is trying to "Trump-proof" policies by solidifying protections in areas such as minority rights, abortion rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. This suggests he will be busy, though not necessarily through executive orders. 
    *   **National Security:** The extension of the national emergency with Iran indicates that there could be some ongoing national security issues that would require him to use the power of EO.
    *   **Gun Violence:** The focus on gun violence EOs means there is likely to be an underlying desire to continue to take action and it is possible that, despite the election loss, Biden will continue to make efforts to do so.
    *  **Voter registration:** The numerous articles about Republican attempts to halt voter registration EOs, and the Supreme Court's rejection of these efforts, does indicate the importance Biden places on his voter registration policies and he might be keen to use the power of an executive order to continue with these policies despite the election loss.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   It's crucial not to overreact to Trump's stated intent to reverse Biden's orders. That will happen *after* the January inauguration. November is still Biden's last full month to act, and the desire to ensure existing measures remain in place will still be present. 
*   Equally, there is a risk of over-interpreting the desire to "Trump-proof" institutions. This could lead to an overestimate of the number of EOs.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for More EOs:**  Biden's desire to solidify his legacy, the need to renew expiring national emergencies, the potential desire to continue to take action on gun control, the desire to lock in his voter registration policies and the general momentum of the Federal Register.
*   **Forces Pushing for Fewer EOs:** The recognition that major policy shifts via EO will be reversed soon by Trump, and a possible focus on preparing the transition, rather than issuing new executive orders.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

* The Federal Register page count indicates a general trend of increased activity under Biden.
* There are no particular trends in recent history that show Presidents signing more or less executive orders in the final few months of their presidency.
* In the light of this, it is unlikely that Biden's final month will see a dramatic change from the recent past.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's uncertainty, but the specific resolution criteria (3 or more EOs) creates a binary outcome, so I will use a single range that will be fairly certain around a central point.

**8. Confidence/Prudence Balance:**

*   I will lean toward being slightly less confident due to the unusual nature of a lame-duck president facing an incoming president who will reverse their EOs.

Okay, let's break this down and make a forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't see any existing predictions for this specific question on platforms like Metaculus, FiveThirtyEight, or Polymarket. This means I will be using the inside view more than I normally might prefer.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is: Will Biden issue 3 or more executive orders in November 2024? This involves two sub-questions:
    *   What is the *typical* rate of Executive Order issuance?
    *   Are there *specific reasons* to expect Biden to deviate from that rate in November 2024, given the election outcome and news?

**3. Balance Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** The Federal Register has published approximately 70-90 executive orders per year during Biden's presidency (based on the provided articles). This suggests a monthly average of 6-7 executive orders. However, monthly issuance is not consistent, so the average is not that helpful. We also see in the articles that the 2024 Federal Register page count is very high, suggesting a higher-than-average level of activity. I need more specifics about patterns.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of the Situation):**
    *   **Trump's Victory:** Trump won the 2024 election on November 5th. There are multiple sources that indicate a likely flurry of actions from Trump in January, undoing a number of Biden's orders. This makes it more likely that Biden would focus on policy changes that would be harder to undo. Biden may want to get policies "on the books" that are more complex than an executive order.
    *   **"Trump-Proofing":** The articles suggest Biden is trying to "Trump-proof" institutions and policies. This suggests there may be a stronger than normal reason for Biden to issue executive orders in the waning days of his presidency. This also could mean action is taken elsewhere besides executive orders, like legal challenges.
    *   **Iran National Emergency:** The extension of the national emergency with Iran is *required* to be published in the Federal Register, and is likely to be done by an executive order. The article also suggests that this occurs in mid-November, which seems likely as the previous emergency ends on November 14. This provides one almost certain executive order.
     *   **Recent Executive Orders:** Biden has recently issued Executive Orders related to gun violence, and voter registration.
    *   **November is an unusual month.** It is sandwiched between the election day and the transfer of power. This means that while some policy making might be desirable, much of the political energy will be on the upcoming transfer.

**4. Balance Under- and Over-Reacting to Evidence:**

*   It's tempting to overreact to the "Trump-proofing" narrative. However, the articles also suggest that Trump's victory means Biden will be constrained in his actions. He might focus more on making changes that are harder to overturn. Executive orders are typically not that difficult to reverse.
*   The Iran emergency order is near certain, but the news of it likely means other executive orders will be less likely to be issued.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pushing for more EOs:** Biden wants to "Trump-proof" his legacy and has previously been active in signing executive orders.
*   **Pushing for less EOs:** Trump's victory limits Biden's power. Trump has indicated he plans to undo many of Biden's executive orders, making them less effective to pass at this point. Biden may want to focus on less easily reversible policy actions. The transition is happening and this is a lame duck period.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends (Linearly):**

*   Biden's administration has been active with executive orders. The Federal Register page counts have been high. However, this is a very unusual circumstance. A linear trend is not useful here.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I'm quite confident that we will see at least 1 executive order, but the question asks for 3 or more. I see that as a lower possibility, but not zero. I'm more confident it will be less than 3, given the recent election result, and the transition beginning to happen.

**8. Balance Confidence:**

*   I won't be overconfident that I have all the answers, but the election result and the upcoming transition period suggests a lower rate of activity than normal.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I will look back on this forecast to try to understand what I may have missed. I will be sure not to overreact to the results as the question has a high degree of uncertainty.

**Reasoning Summary and Final Forecast:**

The election of Donald Trump makes it less likely that Biden will issue a large number of executive orders in November 2024. While he may attempt to "Trump-proof" some initiatives, the reality is that his power will be diminished and he will likely look to more complicated and difficult policy changes. The extension of the Iranian National Emergency provides almost one guaranteed executive order for November. Because of the transition period, and the likely diminishment of Biden's power, it's unlikely that more than two other executive orders will be issued in the month. I believe the probability of three or more executive orders being published is low.

My Prediction: Between 8.50% and 22.50%, but 15.50% being the most likely. Probability: 15.50%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There are no similar questions on Metaculus for direct comparison. This is a somewhat unique question.
*   **Other Sources:** FiveThirtyEight and Polymarket don't typically deal with questions this specific. There aren't any readily available predictions on the number of EOs to expect in a lame-duck month.
*   **Historical Data:** I looked for an easily accessible database of past Presidential Executive Orders published in the Federal Register.  While the Federal Register site allows you to search for EOs, it doesn't provide a simple tally by month that I can use as a reference class. Therefore I will rely on past years data as I find it. 
    *   Based on the information available here, there have been numerous executive orders by Biden throughout his presidency. The trend of his Federal Register page count being second highest ever also suggests he issues a lot of orders.
    *  I am also taking into account that the Federal Register can sometimes be delayed in how the data is presented.
    * I am also looking for historical precedent for other US Presidents in the month before they leave office (or the month after they lose an election), which is very hard to find and compare directly.

**2. Break Down into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate of EOs:** What's a typical number of EOs in a month for a president in general, and for Biden in particular? Given the above limitations I will need to create a rough base rate.
*   **Lame-Duck Effect:** How does a presidential transition affect the number of EOs issued?
*   **Biden's Priorities:** What are Biden's current priorities in this lame-duck period?
*   **External Factors:** Are there any external factors that might influence the number of EOs?
*  **Trump's Stated Intentions:** How might President-elect Trump's plans to revoke Biden's EOs impact Biden's actions?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** Historically, lame-duck periods can see a decrease in presidential activity due to the loss of political capital and the focus shifting to the incoming administration.  Presidents may also be hesitant to take actions that could easily be reversed by their successor. However, in recent times, Presidents have been known to act decisively even in lame duck sessions (see the EO to limit the use of 3D-printed guns).
*   **Inside View:**  Biden has several policy priorities that could lead to EOs, including gun violence, AI, and potentially some last-minute attempts to shore up his legacy, knowing Trump is coming in. However the news is heavily weighted towards Trump reversing the EOs. The news suggests a high probability that Trump is going to cancel or significantly change a lot of Biden's orders, so it is unlikely that Biden will seek to create any large volume of EOs in November. Biden also seems to have been focused on trying to 'Trump-proof' policies through other means which makes further EOs less likely.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** Ignoring the news that Trump intends to overturn Biden's EOs. There's a strong signal here from multiple news sources that Trump will undo Biden's work, which will likely make Biden's office less motivated to create further EOs that might be immediately struck down.
*   **Overreacting:** Assuming Biden will issue zero EOs in November. Biden has been proactive and might finalize some pending EOs even with Trump's stated intention to overturn them. The Iran emergency extension also indicates at least one EO will happen. The White House also mentioned that Biden signed an EO to support economic security for military families and veterans.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1: Lame Duck Inertia:** The general tendency for presidents to wind down their activity during a transition.
*   **Force 2: Biden's Policy Goals:** Biden might seek to take some last actions via executive orders, particularly on issues he sees as crucial.
*   **Force 3: Trump's Reversal Threat:** The high likelihood that many of Biden's EOs will be reversed by Trump could reduce the motivation for the White House to issue them.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   There is a trend of Biden issuing a high number of EOs over his presidency, and the total page count of the Federal Register is exceptionally high this year. However, Trump's victory presents a distinct situation. The month of November will have a distinct dynamic now that there's a known incoming President.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   This question requires a specific number of EOs (3 or more). This is a binary outcome that requires careful judgement.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:** Assigning a very high chance of it not happening, due to the Trump news.
*   **Overconfidence:** Assigning a high chance that more than 3 executive orders will occur. The base rates of monthly EOs for Biden are hard to calculate, but there has also been no indication that he consistently issues many per month, in contrast to overall higher page counts in the Federal Register (the register's page count includes much more than just EOs).

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*  It is important to note that this is a particularly unusual scenario in that the President will leave office soon, which has been shown to strongly reduce presidential activity.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Given all the above factors, I believe that the most important factor influencing this question is Trump's election win and stated intent to revoke Biden's EOs, in addition to the natural tendency for Presidents to wind down in a lame-duck period. There are two EOs already published in November: the Iran national emergency extension, and one related to military and veterans. While it's possible Biden could issue more, it's unlikely that his office will push through many given the high probability of them being overturned very quickly after he leaves office. Thus, I'm inclined to believe the number of EOs in November is likely to be very low, and I have lowered my base rate quite sharply due to the unique circumstances. The base rate for EOs in past years has a limited impact this year.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 18.00% being the most likely. Probability: 18.00%.
