**CNN polling guru makes bold prediction about a 'sweep' in swing states**
CNN's polling guru Harry Enten predicts a 'sweep' in swing states, suggesting that either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will win the presidential election with a landslide. According to Enten's election model, there is a 60% chance that the winner will get at least 300 electoral votes, compared to a 40% chance of getting less than 300. Enten notes that polling is not perfect, with an average error of 3.4 points in battleground states since 1972. He cites past elections, such as Obama's 2012 victory and Trump's 2016 victory, as evidence that underestimations in one state can be revealed in others, leading to a relative Electoral College blowout. 'So for all the talk that we've had about this election being historically close, which it is, chances are the winner will still actually score a relative blowout in the electoral college,' Enten said. 'If you look across the seven key swing states, the seven closest states, in all of them the margin right now is under two points.'

**US election 2024: The seven battleground states that will decide who wins**
In the 2024 US presidential election, seven battleground states will decide the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania, with 13 million residents and 19 Electoral College votes, is the biggest prize. Vice President Kamala Harris needs to sweep all three 'rust belt' states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin - to win the presidency. However, Donald Trump is preying on Democratic divisions in these states, particularly among Arab-American voters in Michigan and black voters in Georgia and North Carolina. Harris is also battling to shore up black votes in the southern states. Both candidates are courting Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada. Trump's route to victory includes holding onto North Carolina, grabbing back Georgia and Arizona, and winning Michigan with its large Arab-American population. The election outcome will depend on the results in these seven battleground states.

**After Trump Takes Lead in 6 of 7 Battleground States, He Finally Flips Last Holdout**
In a shocking turn of events, former President Donald Trump has taken the lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in six of seven battleground states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. According to polling data and betting markets, Trump now leads Harris by 49% to 47% among likely voters in Wisconsin, a state Biden won in 2020. Harris had a lead in Wisconsin as recently as a day before, but saw her edge evaporate after visiting the state for campaign events. Trump's surge is driven by voters' concerns over the economy and border security, with a Wall Street Journal poll confirming that voters in these battlegrounds favor Trump when it comes to handling these pressing concerns. The electoral map now favors Trump, with Republicans poised to take control of both the Senate and possibly the House, signaling a potential GOP sweep in 2024.

**These Seven Battleground States May Well Decide US Presidency**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close contest. Seven battleground states will decide the outcome, with little daylight between the rivals. These states are Pennsylvania (19 Electoral College votes), Georgia (16), North Carolina (16), Michigan (15), Arizona (11), Wisconsin (10), and Nevada (6). Each state has its unique dynamics, with Trump and Harris campaigning on different issues. Trump is courting the rural white population and warning about migrants, while Harris is touting infrastructure wins and investing in manufacturing. The election is a toss-up in all seven states, with every one being a critical swing state. Trump has a boost in Arizona, but Harris has a tiny polling edge in Wisconsin. The outcome will depend on how the candidates perform in these key states.

**7 Key States that will Determine the Outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump vying for votes in key battleground states. CNN has identified the top 7 states that will determine the outcome of the election. These states are: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Each of these states has a unique dynamic that will play a crucial role in determining the winner. For example, Arizona is a swing state that has been a battleground for years, with a large Hispanic population and a strong Republican presence in Maricopa County. Georgia, on the other hand, has been a Democratic stronghold in recent years, but is expected to be a close contest this time around. Michigan is a key state that has been trending Democratic in recent years, but has also been a battleground in the past. Nevada is a state that has been trending Republican in recent years, but has also been a battleground in the past. North Carolina is a state that has been trending Republican in recent years, but has also been a battleground in the past. Pennsylvania is a state that has been trending Democratic in recent years, but has also been a battleground in the past. Wisconsin is a state that has been trending Democratic in recent years, but has also been a battleground in the past. As the election approaches, both Harris and Trump are making a push for these key states, with Harris focusing on the Hispanic population and Trump focusing on the Republican base. 'The economy is a top priority for voters in Michigan,' said a recent poll. However, Harris may face a challenge in repeating Biden's performance among union voters, who have expressed dissatisfaction with the administration's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump, on the other hand, is trying to appeal to African American and Latino men. 'The tax-free status of gratuities is a key issue in Nevada,' said a Republican strategist. 'We need to close the gap with Harris among Hispanic voters, especially men.'

**Here's where Trump and Harris stand in the seven battleground states for the 2024 presidential election**
The 2024 presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump neck-and-neck in the polls. The election will be decided by the outcome in seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Harris is on track to win the popular vote, but Trump has a better chance of winning the Electoral College. The candidates have been aggressively campaigning in these states, with millions of dollars being spent on advertising. The outcome in these states will determine the next President of the United States. 'I feel very, very good about Georgia,' said Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison. 'I believe we are well poised to win Georgia once again.' The candidates have been actively campaigning in these states, with both sides seeing opportunities to flip the states from red to blue or vice versa. The outcome in these states will be closely watched on Election Day.

**Weird Reality of 2024: Both Sides Confident of Victory**
Donald Trump's allies are 'supremely confident' that he will win re-election, according to Axios. Lakshya Jain, a Split Ticket elections analyst, noted that Republicans are projecting a 'landslide' and are 'hyped' about early voting numbers. A Trump campaign source stated that internal polls show Trump leading in all seven battleground states, but within the margin of error. However, the source warned that 'arrogance is how mistakes are made.'

**Eight Electoral Paths to the White House | Opinion**
With one week to go before the US presidential election, there are multiple paths to victory for both candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Theoretically, any combination of states can lead to at least 270 electoral votes and a win for either candidate. However, based on previous voting patterns, most of the electoral map is set, with Trump winning solid red states and Harris winning reliably blue states. The battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, will play a crucial role in determining the outcome. According to the article, there are several possible scenarios, including a Trump landslide, a Harris squeaker win, and even a Trump sweep or a Harris sweep. The article also highlights the importance of the Blue Wall battlegrounds, the Sun Belt swayers, and the Democratic turnout machine in determining the outcome.

**‘World’s Most Accurate Economist’ Makes Bold 2024 Prediction**
Christophe Barraud, the 'world's most accurate economist', predicts a Republican sweep of Congress in the 2024 election, with Donald Trump winning the presidency. Barraud believes that a Republican win would give the GDP a short-term boost of 2.1% to 2.3% in 2025, but warns that cutting taxes without a way to pay for them could lead to a growing debt. Nate Silver's model shows that Trump has a 24.4% chance of winning all seven swing states, while Harris has a 15.6% chance of winning all the battleground states. Silver's overall prediction shows that Harris is most likely to win when Democrats win between three and five of the key states, with an 86.2% chance of winning overall. However, recent polls have shifted in Trump's favor, with FiveThirtyEight's prediction now showing Trump has a 51% chance of winning the election, while Harris has a 49% chance.

**The seven swing states that will decide the US presidency**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close contest. Seven swing states will decide the outcome, and here's a look at each: Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Pennsylvania, once reliably Democratic, is now a toss-up, with Trump winning by 0.7 percentage points in 2016 and Biden by 1.2 percentage points in 2020. Georgia, where Trump is facing an election interference case, is also a close contest. North Carolina, which has voted Republican since 1980, is back in play, with Harris believing it can be won. Michigan, which Trump flipped in 2016, is a key battleground, with Harris risking losing the support of the Arab-American community. Arizona, which Biden won by just 10,457 votes in 2020, is a tight race, with Trump hoping to win back the state due to frustrations over immigration policy. Wisconsin, which Clinton lost in 2016, is a nailbiter, with Harris making it a close contest. Nevada, which has not voted Republican since 2004, is also a key state, with Trump holding a significant lead before Harris erased it with her economic plans.

**Silver: Sweeping ‘Blue Wall’ States ‘Probably’ Clinches Win**
Pollster Nate Silver stated that sweeping the three 'blue wall' battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin would 'probably' clinch the election for either Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris. Silver noted that if Trump wins these three states, he would likely win the election, as Harris would need to sweep all other battlegrounds, including Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. Conversely, if Harris sweeps these three states, she 'probably (although not certainly) wins'.

**Seven Key States to Watch in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
Seven states in the United States are considered crucial in the upcoming presidential election: Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, and North Carolina. These states, also known as 'swing states' or 'battleground states,' have historically been closely contested and have played a significant role in determining the outcome of the election. In 2020, Joe Biden won six of these seven states, securing his presidency. However, in 2016, Donald Trump won several of these states, demonstrating the changing and unpredictable nature of these territories. The history of these states has shown that they have defined the electoral outcome of the country on numerous occasions, and they will continue to do so in the future. According to recent polls, the 2024 presidential election is expected to be a closely contested race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, with Harris currently leading in some polls and Trump leading in others. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the performance of the candidates, the state of the economy, and the level of voter turnout.

**Seven States That Will Decide US Presidency**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close contest. Seven key states will decide the outcome: Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Each state has a unique dynamic, with Trump and Harris campaigning aggressively. Pennsylvania, a battleground state, has seen Trump and Harris repeatedly visit, with Trump courting rural white voters and Harris touting infrastructure wins. Georgia, where Trump was indicted for election interference, is a flashpoint, but the case is paused until after the election. North Carolina, a traditionally Republican state, is now in play, with Harris courting minority voters. Michigan, a former Democratic stronghold, is a toss-up, with Harris risking losing Arab-American support. Arizona, a tight race in 2020, is a key battleground, with Trump hoping to swing the state back in his favor. Wisconsin, a state Trump considers winnable, is a nailbiter, with Harris making it competitive. Nevada, a Democratic stronghold, is a potential flip, with Trump's lead erased by Harris's economic plans. 'It's a toss-up within the margin of error,' said a source, highlighting the uncertainty of the election.

**The 7 Key States in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is focusing on 7 key states, known as swing states or battleground states, where 93 electoral votes are up for grabs. These states are microcosms of America, with diverse populations, rural and urban areas, and cultural conflicts. Currently, Donald Trump is expected to win 219 electoral votes from states in the interior, while Kamala Harris is likely to win 226 electoral votes from states on the east and west coasts. The 7 swing states, where the outcome is still uncertain, are Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. If Harris wins all 3 Rust Belt states, she would reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Trump, on the other hand, needs to win a combination of northern and southern swing states to reach at least 51 electoral votes. As the election approaches, the campaign teams are shifting their focus from one swing state to another, trying to gain an advantage.

The outcome of these states will decide the future of the world, with just 200,000 votes potentially making the difference. Trump is focusing on issues such as immigration and job security, while Harris is trying to counter with promises of a more secure border and economic growth.

**With Less Than Two Weeks Remaining, Donald Trump Is Surging On The Campaign Trail | @amacforamerica**
Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign is in a stronger position than his previous two victorious runs, with momentum behind him in the critical battleground states. According to Real Clear Politics, Trump leads in each of the seven battleground states, and would only need to win 3 or 4 of these states to secure the presidency. If current trends hold, Trump would also win the popular vote, making the race 'too big to rig.' Winning the popular vote would come with advantages, including mitigating the harms from counter-lawfare efforts by Leftist groups, such as the 'Election Threat Task Force' launched by Merrick Garland. As Trump's campaign strategist, Alvin Bragg, and Fani Willis, who operate as satellite lawfare groups, would be less effective in their efforts to subvert the vote.

**GREG BECKER: Interpreting the US presidential election**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided in seven 'battleground' or 'swing states', where the outcome is too close to call. According to a synthesis of past election results and current polls, the outcome of this election is clear in 43 of the 50 US states. However, the polls have consistently overstated the support for the Democratic candidate by an average of 3.66% per state. Despite this, polls, prediction markets, and betting shops broadly agree that Harris is on track to win the popular vote, but Trump is on track to get a majority in the electoral college, which would lead to him returning to the White House. This is similar to what happened in 2016, when Trump received fewer votes than Hillary Clinton, but had enough electoral college votes to become president. As Greg Becker notes, 'This article should not be read as form guide, but rather as a curiosity for those unable to vote, but who will be affected by US foreign, trade and fiscal policy, which will also affect asset prices.'

**Trump winning every swing state is most likely scenario -- Nate Silver model**
Nate Silver's latest forecast gives Donald Trump a 24.4 percent chance of winning all seven swing states in the 2024 election, making it the most likely scenario. According to Silver's analysis, Kamala Harris has a 15.6 percent chance of winning all the battleground states. The forecast also shows that Harris would win the election if she took every swing state other than Arizona and Georgia, but this scenario has only a 1.7 percent probability. Silver's model suggests that the most likely paths to victory for Harris occur when Democrats win a combination of three to five of the battleground states. If Harris won only Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, she would have 270 electoral college votes and a 86.2 percent chance of winning overall. However, polls currently show that Harris is leading in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada, while Trump is ahead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. 'The race has gone from almost a toss-up to definitely a toss-up,' said Jon Parker, senior lecturer in American studies at Keele University. 'This does not suggest that either campaign is winning or losing.'

**Top US pollster Nate Silver: Here's what my gut says about the election**
Nate Silver, a top US pollster, says that his 'gut' tells him that Donald Trump will win the election, but he emphasizes that this is not a reliable prediction. Silver notes that a 50-50 forecast really does mean 50-50, and that people should be open to the possibility that the forecasts are wrong. He also discusses the concept of 'shy Trump voters' and how it may not be a significant factor in this election. Additionally, Silver mentions the 'Bradley effect' and the 'Hillary effect', which could potentially impact the outcome of the election. He concludes that it's surprisingly likely that the election won't be a photo finish, and that one candidate could sweep at least six of seven battleground states. Silver's model suggests that there's a 60% chance of this happening.

Nearly 25 million U.S. voters have already cast their ballots, either through in-person early voting or mail-in ballots, according to tracking data from the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will seek support from undecided voters at a televised town hall in battleground Pennsylvania, while Republican Donald Trump swept through Georgia, saying, 'The votes in Georgia are at record levels... The votes in every state, frankly, are at record levels.' Harris and Trump remain neck and neck in the seven most competitive states with less than two weeks to go until the Nov. 5 election. Harris has argued that Trump is a threat to U.S. democracy, calling his remarks 'deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous.' Trump's campaign has denied these claims, calling them 'debunked stories' and a political hatchet job.

Silver suggests that polling errors in the past were due to 'nonresponse bias' towards Trump's supporters, and that pollsters may be overcorrecting for this in the current election. He also criticizes the tactic of weighing surveys based on who people said they voted for in 2020, which he believes can bias the polls against the Democratic nominee. According to the RealClearPolitics aggregate, Harris has a 1.1% lead over Trump in the national popular vote, but Silver's model predicts that Trump will sweep all seven swing states.

**Pollster Nate Silver: 'My Gut Says Donald Trump'**
Pollster Nate Silver has expressed his 'gut' prediction that former President Donald Trump will win the 2024 presidential election over Vice President Kamala Harris. However, Silver warns that voters should not put any value on his prediction and that the '50-50 forecast' for Harris and Trump really does mean 50-50. Silver also notes that there is a 'nonresponsive bias' in polling, where pollsters may not be reaching enough of Trump's supporters, and that Harris may be underestimated in the polls. He also mentions the 'Hillary effect,' where undecided voters may tilt against a female candidate. Silver's model suggests a 60% chance that one candidate will sweep at least six of seven battleground states, and that even a small polling error could result in a 'comfortable' Electoral College win for either candidate.

**Famous polling guru Nate Silver shares his gut theory on who’ll win election**
Nate Silver, the founder of fivethirtyeight, believes that his 'gut' tells him Donald Trump will win the upcoming election, despite polls showing a tie. Silver cites Trump's tendency to underperform in polls, the difficulty of reaching his voters, and the increase in people registering as Republicans as reasons for his prediction. He also mentions the 'Bradley Effect', a phenomenon where voters may not admit to voting against a historic candidate, which he believes could hurt Kamala Harris' chances. Silver emphasizes that the election will be incredibly close, with the outcome dependent on a few battleground states, and warns that even a small polling error could produce a surprise result. He notes that his model gives a 60% chance of a candidate sweeping at least six of the seven battleground states. Silver concludes that '50-50 is the only responsible forecast' and that 'may the election not be a photo finish'.

**The Swing States: Who Will Decide the 2024 US Presidential Election?**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by seven swing states, also known as battleground states. These states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. According to recent polls, the candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, are neck and neck in these states. Trump has a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Harris is ahead in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Nevada is a dead heat. The swing states are crucial because they have a large population and therefore more electoral votes. Trump has a strong lead in traditional Republican states, while Harris has a strong lead in Democratic strongholds. The election will be decided by which candidate can win at least three to four of the swing states.

**How 7 Battleground States Rank on Election Integrity**
The seven battleground states in the 2024 presidential election vary in election security, with Georgia having the highest score and Nevada ranking 50th. Georgia has 'vastly improved on elections since 2020, while Nevada has made matters worse,' according to Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. Wisconsin and North Carolina rank in the top 20 best states for election security, while Arizona and Pennsylvania tie for the rank of 24. Michigan falls in the bottom 25. The states are scored on factors such as voter ID laws, accuracy of voter registration rolls, and verification of U.S. citizenship. Trump currently holds leads in most of the battleground states, with the largest lead in Georgia at 2.5%.

**US election 2024: The seven battleground states that will decide who wins**
In the 2024 US presidential election, seven battleground states will decide the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania, with 13 million residents and 19 Electoral College votes, is the biggest prize. Vice President Kamala Harris needs to sweep all three 'rust belt' states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin - to win the presidency. However, Donald Trump is preying on Democratic divisions in these states, particularly among Arab-American voters in Michigan and black voters in Georgia and North Carolina. Harris is also battling to shore up black votes in the southern states. Both candidates are courting Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada. Trump's route to victory includes holding onto North Carolina, grabbing back Georgia and Arizona, and winning Michigan with its large Arab-American population. The election outcome will depend on the results in these seven battleground states.

**EXCLUSIVE Trump takes his biggest lead yet in Daily Mail election model beating Harris by 30 points**
Donald Trump has taken his biggest lead yet in the DailyMail.com/J.L. Partners election model, winning in 65.9% of simulations, up from 61.4% last week. The model suggests Trump will sweep the seven battleground states, taking the Electoral College by 312 to 226. Analysts believe Kamala Harris will need a decisive win in the national vote numbers to have any chance of prevailing in the swing states. Callum Hunter, data scientist at J.L. Partners, said the national polls moving to Trump had made the biggest difference since last week, and that Harris's odds of winning the Electoral College are weakening. 'The electoral fog is lifting and it seems to be revealing a likely Trump win,' Hunter wrote in his briefing. Trump spent the weekend in Pennsylvania, serving fries to McDonald's customers and attending a Pittsburgh Steelers game, which went 'very well' for him.

**After Trump Takes Lead in 6 of 7 Battleground States, He Finally Flips Last Holdout**
In a shocking turn of events, former President Donald Trump has taken the lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in six of seven battleground states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. According to polling data and betting markets, Trump now leads Harris by 49% to 47% among likely voters in Wisconsin, a state Biden won in 2020. Harris had a lead in Wisconsin as recently as a day before, but saw her edge evaporate after visiting the state for campaign events. Trump's surge is driven by voters' concerns over the economy and border security, with a Wall Street Journal poll confirming that voters in these battlegrounds favor Trump when it comes to handling these pressing concerns. The electoral map now favors Trump, with Republicans poised to take control of both the Senate and possibly the House, signaling a potential GOP sweep in 2024.

**Why voters in a handful of swing states will decide the US presidential election**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a small subset of voters in seven key states, with Pennsylvania being the most critical. The candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are focusing heavily on these battlegrounds through intense campaigning and ad spending. The winner will need to win a majority of the country's 538 electoral votes, or 270, which is possible even when losing the overall national vote. The seven battleground states are Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina. Pennsylvania is widely seen as critical to either Harris' or Trump's chances of winning the White House and is considered the most likely 'tipping point' state. If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she would need to carry either North Carolina or Georgia to have any chance of prevailing. Conversely, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, he would need to win either Wisconsin or Michigan to have any chance of winning. Both campaigns have treated Pennsylvania as the most important state, with Harris and Trump spending more time there than in any other.

**Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump: latest odds for sweep of all 7 swing states**
The 2024 presidential election is nearing its end, with Election Day less than a month away. According to betting platform Polymarket, Donald Trump has a 26% chance of winning each of the seven swing states, while Kamala Harris has a 14% chance. However, betting markets do not necessarily translate directly to election outcomes, and experts warn that they can be influenced by small events and 'noise.' Thomas Gift, a political scientist, notes that betting markets have accurately predicted 77% of election outcomes over the last 35 years, but are 'far from foolproof.' Professor Emeritus Iwan Morgan believes it unlikely that either candidate will sweep all seven swing states, predicting that Harris will win Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan, while Trump will win Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, with Pennsylvania being a toss-up.

**Where Trump and Harris stand with just ONE month to go in the seven battleground states that will decide the next president**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a neck-and-neck battle for the White House. Polls show that the closest presidential race in modern history will be decided by just thousands of voters in seven battleground states. The candidates have been aggressively campaigning in these states, with millions of dollars being spent on advertising. Here's a breakdown of the current state of the race in each of the seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Harris is currently leading in Michigan, while Trump is ahead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. The two candidates are tied in Pennsylvania, and Harris is narrowly leading in Wisconsin. The outcome of the election will depend on which candidate can win the most electoral votes, with 270 votes needed to win the presidency. Democrats see the state of Pennsylvania as crucial to their victory, while Republicans are focusing on flipping the state of Georgia from blue to red. The candidates have been campaigning aggressively in these states, with both sides trying to persuade and energize voters. The election is just one month away, and the outcome is still uncertain.

**US elections explainer: The seven battleground states to watch in 2024**
The 2024 US presidential election will likely be decided by voters in seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These states were won by fewer than 3 percentage points in 2020 and are expected to be close this year. Pennsylvania is a key state, as it is part of the 'Trump firewall' - if he wins Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina, he is likely to win the White House. However, Pennsylvania was once a reliable Democratic state, and if Kamala Harris loses it, she faces a difficult path to victory, requiring her to win either Georgia or North Carolina, and either Arizona or Nevada, as well as both Michigan and Wisconsin.

**Here are the seven battleground states which may well decide the US presidency**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris facing off against former President Donald Trump in a tight contest. Seven battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada, will decide the outcome of the election. Each state has a unique dynamic, with Trump and Harris campaigning on different issues. In Pennsylvania, Trump is courting the rural white population, while Harris is touting recent infrastructure wins and plans to invest $100 billion in manufacturing. In Georgia, the case against Trump for election interference is paused until after the election, but demographic changes may benefit Harris. In North Carolina, a scandal involving the Republican gubernatorial candidate may impact the vote, while in Michigan, Harris risks losing the support of the Arab-American community. Arizona is showing the largest poll advantage for Trump, while Wisconsin is a close contest between the two candidates. Nevada, which hasn't voted Republican since 2004, is also a key state to watch.

These states are Pennsylvania (19 Electoral College votes), Georgia (16), North Carolina (16), Michigan (15), Arizona (11), Wisconsin (10), and Nevada (6). Each state has its unique dynamics, with Trump and Harris campaigning on different issues. Trump is courting the rural white population and warning about migrants, while Harris is touting infrastructure wins and investing in manufacturing. The election is a toss-up in all seven states, with every one being a critical swing state. Trump has a boost in Arizona, but Harris has a tiny polling edge in Wisconsin.

**Most Likely Kamala Harris Scenario Is 7 Swing State Sweep—Nate Silver Model**
According to Nate Silver's presidential model, the most likely scenario for the 2024 election is that Vice President Kamala Harris wins all seven swing states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. Harris won all seven swing states 15,273 times out of 70,000 simulations, while former President Trump won all the swing states 13,912 times. Silver stated that there is a roughly 40 percent chance that either Harris or Trump will take all of the swing states. Harris currently leads Trump in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, while Trump is ahead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. Harris is also leading Trump nationally, with a 3.3-point lead in Silver's model and a 2.8-point lead in FiveThirtyEight's national polling average.

**Battleground States: The Key to the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be a close contest, with the outcome potentially hinging on a handful of key states. According to recent polls, the seven battleground states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and North Carolina - are all within a margin of error of 3 percentage points. These states, which account for less than 20% of the US electorate, are crucial to the candidates' chances of winning the presidency. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both focusing their efforts on these states, with Harris trying to win over young and minority voters, and Trump targeting white working-class voters. The outcome of the election will depend on which candidate can mobilize the most voters in these key states. In Pennsylvania, Harris is seen as a strong contender, while in Michigan, Trump is trying to capitalize on the state's strong manufacturing sector. In Wisconsin, the election is expected to be a close contest, with Harris and Trump both vying for the state's 10 electoral votes. In the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia, Harris is trying to win over voters who are increasingly turning away from Trump. In North Carolina, the election is expected to be a close contest, with Harris and Trump both trying to win over voters in the state's growing cities. The outcome of the election will depend on which candidate can mobilize the most voters in these key states.

**Harris In Trouble? New Swing State Poll Shows Trump Gains Ground In Key Battleground Areas For 2024 Election**
A new poll by Emerson College shows that Donald Trump is gaining ground in key swing states for the 2024 presidential election. In a head-to-head matchup with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump leads in four of the seven states, is tied in one, and trails in two. Harris has gained support in two states and lost support in four since the August poll. 'There has been marginal movement in the presidential election since the late August Emerson swing state polls before the presidential debate,' said Emerson College Polling executive director Spencer Kimball. The seven swing states represent 93 electoral votes and could prove crucial in the election. Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin since Ronald Reagan in 1984, but Biden won all three states in the 2020 election. The top issues for voters in swing states are the economy, immigration, threats to democracy, and housing affordability.

**Seven States Hold the Key to the White House: Trump and Harris Battle for Votes**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a few hundred thousand votes in a handful of key states. The seven states that will determine the outcome of the election are Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. These states have a combined total of 93 electoral votes, which is crucial in the election. According to El País, if Donald Trump had won just 22,000 more votes in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin in 2020, he would have won the presidency. The article highlights the importance of these states, citing the 2016 and 2020 elections where the outcome was decided by a small margin. The article states that 'El Colegio Electoral está compuesto por 538 votantes, compromisarios o delegados que representan a los Estados. Cada uno cuenta con el equivalente a su número de congresistas (contando senadores, siempre dos por Estado; y representantes, de 1 a 52, en función de la población)' and that 'Harris tiene prácticamente en el bolsillo 226 votos del Colegio Electoral (181, asegurados; 44, probables, y uno, proclive), mientras que Trump puede contar con 219 (125 seguros y 94 probables)'.

**Seven Key States to Decide 2024 US Presidential Election**
Seven key states in the US will decide the 2024 presidential election, according to experts. These states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The Democratic and Republican candidates are competing fiercely in these states to win over undecided voters. Arizona: The state has been a crucial battleground in the past, with the Democrats winning the presidency in 2020 thanks to the support of the state. The issue of immigration has become a central theme in the national debate, with the number of border crossings decreasing after reaching record levels. Donald Trump has attacked Kamala Harris's immigration record, promising to lead 'the greatest deportation operation in US history' if he returns to power. North Carolina: The state has been a key battleground in the past, with Trump winning it in 2020 by a narrow margin. The Democrats are hoping to win the state this year, with Harris adopting a tougher stance on Israel. Pennsylvania: The state has been a crucial battleground in the past, with Biden winning it in 2020. The economy is a major concern in the state, with inflation having peaked under the Biden administration. Wisconsin: The state has chosen the presidential candidate in the past two elections, with Biden winning it in 2020 by a narrow margin. The state has been a key battleground in the past, with Trump winning it in 2016. The experts have suggested that it's in the marginal states like Wisconsin that third-party candidates who are campaigning against the policies of the two main candidates could have an impact.

A new CNN/SSRS poll shows that the 2024 presidential election is on a knife's edge in three key battleground states. Kamala Harris is leading in Wisconsin and Michigan, while Donald Trump is ahead in Arizona. The candidates are in a dead tie in Georgia and Pennsylvania, with Harris leading by 1 point in Nevada. The outcome of the election will likely depend on the results in these seven battleground states, which share 93 Electoral College votes. Meanwhile, the White House has dismissed a suggestion that Kamala Harris uses different accents, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre calling it 'insane.' Donald Trump has also spoken about his family's role in the campaign, saying that his wife Melania cares deeply about the country and that their son Barron could be crucial to their 2024 victory. Additionally, a congressional report has revealed that the would-be assassin of Donald Trump, Thomas Crooks, was incapacitated by a local cop before being killed by a Secret Service sniper.

**Analysis | The 2 key states that could decide the 2024 election**
The 2024 presidential election is heating up, with the first ballots set to go out in North Carolina on Friday. Two key states, Georgia and Pennsylvania, are emerging as crucial battlegrounds. Donald Trump's campaign has focused its ad strategy on these states, spending more than 81% of its remaining ad reservations in Georgia and Pennsylvania. Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign is targeting its war chest more evenly across the seven key states, but Georgia is its biggest investment. Pennsylvania has long been the biggest spending target for both campaigns. The two states are important because they offer a significant number of electoral votes, with Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes) and Georgia (16) being the biggest prizes. If Trump can hold North Carolina, he likely needs to win only Georgia and Pennsylvania to reach 270 electoral votes. Harris could sweep the rest of the battlegrounds and still lose if Trump wins these three states. However, if Trump loses one of these states, he probably needs to win two other states to replace it, making his strategy a high-risk one. Pennsylvania is clearly the biggest prize, with both candidates starting around 220 electoral votes and Pennsylvania accounting for 42% of the electoral votes Harris needs to get to 270. The Washington Post's polling average currently shows Harris leading by an average of three points in Pennsylvania, while Trump leads by two in Georgia.
