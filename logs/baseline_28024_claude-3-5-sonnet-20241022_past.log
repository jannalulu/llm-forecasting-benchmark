Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timeline: We're looking at a very short window - from now until October 1, 2024 (less than 3 weeks).

2. Historical Context:
- Changes to the DJIA are relatively rare
- They typically happen when a company significantly underperforms or undergoes major corporate changes
- The last change was in 2020 when Exxon, Pfizer, and Raytheon were removed

3. Intel's Current Status:
- Despite challenges, Intel remains a major tech company
- Still has significant market cap (~$150B)
- No immediate crisis or major corporate restructuring
- Recently showing signs of recovery with AI initiatives

4. DJIA Change Patterns:
- Changes are typically announced with little advance notice
- No current rumors or discussions about Intel's removal
- Such short timeframe makes it very unlikely

5. Risk Factors:
- Unexpected corporate announcements could occur
- Market committee could make surprise decisions
- But probability is very low given the short timeframe

Given the extremely short time window and lack of any indicators suggesting an imminent change, the probability is very low, but not zero due to possible unexpected developments.

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
