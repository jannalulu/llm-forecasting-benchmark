Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about yesterday's Fed decision.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Despite the market hysteria in August about a potential 50 basis point cut, our models had it at just 12.45% probability.

Nate: The weak July jobs report had everyone convinced, but the subsequent data showed resilience. Our models caught that stabilization in late August.

Philip: [nodding] The Fed's more measured approach with just a 25 basis point cut aligned perfectly with what we projected. Markets were too aggressive pricing in those deep cuts.

Nate: The key signal was the August inflation data that came in hotter than expected. Even with unemployment ticking up, Powell wasn't going to risk a 50 point cut.

Philip: Another win for systematic forecasting over market emotions. No, our models had a 50 basis point cut at just 12.45%.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his screen] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. With the Fed only cutting rates by 25 basis points yesterday instead of the 50 that some were expecting, it validated our probability assessment.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Our models had a 50-point cut at just 12.45%. The market was far too aggressive in pricing in deeper cuts, even with that weak July jobs report.

Nate: The data we had up until August 22nd showed mixed signals. Yes, there were recession fears, but inflation remained sticky. Powell's team chose the cautious path.

Philip: Exactly. The futures market was pricing in nearly 100 basis points of cuts by year-end, but our models suggested the Fed would maintain its "higher for longer" stance. A gradual approach was always more likely.

Nate: Just goes to show - markets can sometimes overreact to short-term data.

Title: "The Probability Prophets"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, September 19, 2024, morning after the Fed meeting]

Nate Silver: (reviewing papers) Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. The Fed's decision yesterday was exactly as we predicted.

Philip Tetlock: No surprise there. Given the data we had until August 22nd, our models calculated just a 12.45% probability of a 50 basis point cut.

Nate: Precisely. The early August market hysteria about multiple aggressive cuts was overblown. While the July jobs report was weak, a single data point wasn't enough to justify such a dramatic move.

Philip: Indeed. The futures market was pricing in far too much pessimism. Our models showed that despite the recession fears, the Fed would remain more measured in their approach.

Nate: The bond market rally in early August proved to be premature. Sometimes markets can overreact to short-term data.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his screen] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Fed's September meeting.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. With the deteriorating economic data we had by August 22nd, our models gave only a 12.45% probability of a 50 basis point cut.

Nate: The signs were there - while the markets were pricing in aggressive cuts, the Fed's historical behavior suggested they'd be more measured. A single 25 basis point cut was more likely.

Philip: Exactly. Even with the weak July jobs report and bond market rally, the Fed has rarely moved in 50-point increments unless facing severe economic stress. Our models factored in their typical gradualist approach.

Nate: [nodding] The combination of elevated inflation earlier in the year and the Fed's preference for measured steps made a 50-point cut unlikely. Sometimes the markets get ahead of themselves.

Philip: [nodding] The emergency inter-meeting cut speculation was particularly overblown. Our models factored in Powell's historical preference for measured responses and the Fed's need to maintain credibility.

Nate: Even with unemployment ticking up, inflation wasn't low enough to justify such an aggressive move. The markets got ahead of themselves.
