**2024 North Carolina 1st Congressional District race: Meet the candidates in the election**
The 2024 North Carolina 1st Congressional District race is expected to be a close contest between incumbent Democratic Congressman Don Davis and Republican nominee Buckhout. Davis, a moderate Democrat, has raised $5 million and has been endorsed by Vice President Kamala Harris. Buckhout, a retired Army Colonel, has been aligned with former President Donald Trump and has called for closing the Mexican border and restoring the 'remain in Mexico' policy. Both candidates have stressed their support for the military, with Davis highlighting his efforts to protect Seymour Johnson Air Force Base and Buckhout emphasizing her military background. On agriculture, Buckhout has called for tackling high energy costs to help farmers, while Davis has touted his work opposing a ban on menthol cigarettes that would have hurt the tobacco industry. Davis has been attacked by Republicans for his voting record on immigration, but he claims to support 'comprehensive immigration reform' and has made three trips to the border to see the problems firsthand.

**Election 2024: Buckhout, Davis split over economic policy**
In the tightest U.S. House race in the nation, Republican Laurie Buckhout and incumbent Democrat Don Davis are vying for the 1st Congressional District in North Carolina. Buckhout advocates for 'America first' policies, stating that the American economy is 'broken' and that drastic changes are needed. She claims that the Biden-Davis agenda has caused devastating inflation rates and made the cost of living unaffordable in eastern North Carolina. Davis, on the other hand, has been aligned with the Biden administration and its economic priorities, and believes that the solution to North Carolina's economic struggles will be more financial investments in communities. According to Davis' website, he is pushing for essential investments to enable eastern North Carolina to thrive, including ensuring access to high-speed broadband and creating opportunities for children in rural communities. Buckhout has criticized Davis for enabling Joe Biden's failures, while Davis has prioritized job growth and funneling federal funding and grants into North Carolina.

**Live updates: Donald Trump returns to Eastern NC for rally in last week before election**
Former President Donald Trump returns to North Carolina for a rally in Rocky Mount, which could be his last campaign stop in the state before the Nov. 5 election. Trump plans to address North Carolinians at the Rocky Mount Event Center around 1 p.m. North Carolina is a battleground state, and Trump and his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, remain in a close race to win the state. According to a recent poll, the two candidates are tied at 47%. Trump won North Carolina in 2020 with a narrow margin of 1.3%, and Democrats are focusing on the state to flip it blue. Harris has made 20 visits to North Carolina this election cycle, while Trump has made 13 campaign stops. The area could play a major role in the election, particularly in the 1st Congressional District, which is currently represented by moderate Democrat Rep. Don Davis. Republican veteran Laurie Buckhout is hoping to defeat Davis and give a new seat to Republicans to maintain the majority.

**2024 Elections: Ted Davis seeks reelection for district 20 House seat**
Ted Davis, the Republican candidate for the district 20 House seat, is seeking reelection. He has served in the House since 2012 and has focused on holding polluters accountable for PFAS contamination, supporting local industries, and pursuing appropriations for public safety. Davis has filed bills to require polluters to pay for the costs of removing PFAS contamination and has worked to obtain funding for local projects. He supports reducing regulatory barriers to provide more affordable housing, expanding incentives for developers, and adaptive reuse of properties. Davis also supports increasing funding for education, including teacher pay and school safety, and has voted for every budget that contained raises for K-12 teachers. He believes that parents should have a choice in the education that their children receive and supports home schooling, charter schools, and opportunity scholarships. Davis has also advocated for policies to increase long-term resiliency, including investing in storm water and flood mitigation, and has supported using a portion of the 'rainy day fund' towards transportation costs. He believes that the state's tax code is regressive and would advocate for changes to reduce the tax burden on low-income residents. Davis also supports 'polluters pay' legislation and state-level regulations for PFAS contamination. He did not vote for the legislation that changed the timeframe for abortions from 20 weeks to 12 weeks, but voted to override the governor's veto. Davis believes that public officials should be transparent in their actions and supports legislation to enhance protection for an accountable government. He would advocate for changes to increase transparency in the state government, including revisiting the provision that allowed lawmakers to ignore public records requests and destroy public documents. Davis also supports reducing overly burdensome state overreach and ensuring that local governments have the ability to be responsive to the needs of their citizens.

**North Carolina Elections: Key Facts and Voting Information for November 5**
North Carolina voters will cast their ballots on November 5 to elect the president and governor, amidst the state's ongoing recovery from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. The state is one of the few competitive presidential battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the White House contest. Since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, the margin in the polls has narrowed significantly, making the state a popular destination for both campaigns. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have visited North Carolina since the storm. The state has been competitive in recent years, with Trump winning it twice but with less than 50% of the vote each time. In the gubernatorial contest, Republican Vice Governor Mark Robinson and Democratic State Attorney General Josh Stein are the nominees to replace Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, who has a term limit. Robinson has denied a CNN report that he posted explicit messages on a pornography website over a decade ago. Since the allegations surfaced, many of his campaign team members have resigned and he was excluded from a Trump campaign event in Wilmington. A competitive contest is also taking place for the 1st Congressional District in northeastern North Carolina, where Democratic Representative Don Davis seeks a second term against Republican Laurie Buckhout. In the state legislature, Republicans overwhelmingly outnumber Democrats in both chambers, but a net loss of one seat in the Senate or House could cost the Republican Party its supermajority and ability to override the governor's veto. The 50 state Senate seats and 120 state House seats will be voted on in these elections. Voters will also consider a proposed constitutional amendment that would specify that only U.S. citizens can vote in the state. North Carolina has 16 electoral votes in the presidential contest.

**Want to know if Trump or Harris will win? Watch these House races**
The outcome of the presidential election may be influenced by the results of several key House races. Democrats are feeling optimistic about their chances in the House, while Republicans are fighting to hold onto their narrow majority. The author suggests that watching the House races in swing states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Arizona could provide an early indicator of who will win the White House. In Pennsylvania, three House races are rated as toss-ups by the Cook Political Report, and the outcome of these races could have a significant impact on the presidential election. If Democrats win these races, it could indicate that Joe Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, will win the state. In North Carolina, the outcome of the 1st district race could also be a bellwether for the presidential election. If Democratic Representative Don Davis wins, it could be a sign that Harris has a fighting chance of winning the state. In Arizona, the outcome of the 6th district race could also be significant, as it could indicate whether Trump will win the state. 'If Davis wins, it will be because he ran up the scoreboard in the Blacker counties,' the author notes. 'If he performs well in Pitt, where Greenville is located, that means Harris has a fighting chance of winning North Carolina.'

**This race will test Dems' message on immigration  --  even though it's nowhere near the border**
In the battleground congressional district in eastern North Carolina, immigration is a central issue in the upcoming election. Republican challenger Laurie Buckhout has made border security her top priority, while Democratic Rep. Don Davis has tried to counteract by highlighting his own visits to the border and votes in favor of increased border security. Former President Bill Clinton campaigned in the district, emphasizing the need for comprehensive immigration reform and criticizing Donald Trump's rhetoric on the issue. Buckhout has taken a stance against a national ban on abortion, saying she is pro-life but supports exceptions. Republicans are confident they can flip the seat, but Democrats have a sizable lead in internal polling. The race has been marked by dueling ads and a focus on immigration, with both candidates sticking to their party's script on the issue.

**Vulnerable House Dem goes on offensive on immigration â€” in a district nowhere near the border**
In the North Carolina congressional district, immigration is a central issue in the upcoming election. Republican challenger Laurie Buckhout has made it her top policy priority, while Democratic Rep. Don Davis has taken an affirmative stance on the issue, citing his visits to the border 'not once or twice, but three times' and his votes in Congress for increased border security. This pivot by House Democrats could be a harbinger of Vice President Kamala Harris' efforts to neutralize the immigration messaging.

**Report: Code Red at Kamala HQ With Worries of North Carolina 'Slipping' Away (and Here's Why)**
With two weeks to go before Election Day, concerns are growing about Kamala Harris' campaign operations in crucial 'blue wall' states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The Harris campaign is worried that North Carolina 'is slipping away', which is a troubling sign for her. Thomas Mills, a veteran North Carolina Democratic consultant, explained that the main issue is the low turnout among black voters, with over 67,000 fewer African American voters than in 2020 at this point in the in-person voting period. Mills warned that if this trend continues, Democrat Rep. Don Davis in the 1st Congressional District 'will probably lose' his race to GOP nominee Laurie Buckhout. The GOP has a substantial early vote program, which could reduce their traditional Election Day advantage. As of now, the data shows Democrats are off to a historically slow start, with Republicans leading in early voting. 'It is still early but it is hard to read anything into this other than Trump and the GOP have an enthusiasm advantage over Harris and the Democrats,' said Jim Blaine, former chief of staff to State Senate Leader Phil Berger. 'The most striking impact is among Black voters,' Mills said. 'So far, there are more than 67,000 fewer African American voters than there were in 2020 at this point in the in-person voting period.'

Both candidates expressed support for Israel, with Buckhout saying 'Israel's a true democracy. They manage to keep peace and stability over in the Middle East, which frankly, is a lot of warring factions.' Davis stated, 'Hamas is a terror cell and ultimately going back to Iran. We have to acknowledge that and I think that is a major source of conflict we have to continue to keep our eyes on.'

**Decision 2024: District 1 Congressional candidates discuss economy**
The economy is a major issue for voters in the First District Congressional race. Republican candidate Laurie Buckhout believes that becoming energy independent is key to driving down costs and helping farmers. 'Drive down the price of energy that's definitely going to hit the price of everything else because energy costs drive the costs of almost everything else we consume,' says Buckhout. Democrat Congressman Don Davis disagrees, saying that the Inflation Reduction Act helped get resources to communities and businesses. Davis wants to focus on building more in America and helping farmers, who are struggling with increasing costs and debt. 'We have to get to a good bipartisan farm bill. We have to address this increasing cost of labor. There are many issues here but we have to sure up agriculture as it's our leading industry,' says Davis. Buckhout believes her presence in Washington, D.C. can bring jobs and business to the district, while Davis wants to expand military installations and available jobs to pump money back into eastern Carolina.

**ICYMI: 21 days to flip NC-01**
The North Carolina's 1st Congressional District (NC-01) is a key battleground in the US House of Representatives election, with Republican candidate Laurie Buckhout and Democratic incumbent US Rep. Don Davis vying for the seat. According to InsideElections data, Davis is in the second-most vulnerable Democratic House seat in the country. Buckhout's campaign has received significant funding from the National Republicans, with a $1.45 million hybrid ad reservation announced recently. Buckhout has stated that her top priority in Congress will be addressing issues such as the open border, crime, and fentanyl, which are top-of-mind for voters in the district. 'NC-1 is 22 counties of working families who have all seen their family budgets decimated by Kamala Harris' policies supported by Don Davis,' Buckhout said, pointing to record-setting inflation, gas prices, and 'sticker shock' at the grocery store. The Buckhout campaign has also mobilized hundreds of volunteers to knock on doors, meet voters, and make the case for sending Buckhout to Congress.

**Election 2024: Four races pivotal to Republican power in House - Washington Examiner**
The 2024 election in North Carolina is expected to be pivotal for Republican power in the House. Four races are considered crucial, with two others considered worthy of discussion and three more representing longshots. Rep. Tricia Cotham, R-Mecklenburg, is a key target for Democrats, who are also incumbents in two other pivotal races. Additionally, the race in District 35 is where Democratic Rep. Terence Everitt is running for state Senate rather than reelection in the House. The candidates are Evonne Hopkins, a Democrat from Raleigh; Mike Schietzelt, a Republican from Wake Forest; and Michael Oakes, a Libertarian from Wake Forest. According to historical pattern and ongoing polling futures, a Democrat is favored to keep the office of governor, but Republicans are expected to have majorities in the General Assembly. The key numbers watched by both parties are 30 in the Senate and 72 in the House, which represent the minimums needed to override vetoes. Cotham said, 'Democrats picked the wrong chick' to try and control, and she would be a Republican, on April 5 of last year. To win a second consecutive term, and sixth overall, she'll need to fend off Charlotte's Nicole Sidman in House District 105.

In North Carolina's U.S. House District 11, Republican U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards is seeking a second term, but faces a challenge from Democrat Caleb Rudow. Edwards is favored, having held the seat since 2010, but Democrats have been narrowing the Republican's win margin in recent elections.

Laurie Buckhout, a Republican and first-time candidate, is running for North Carolina's first congressional district. She faces first-term Democratic Congressman Don Davis and Libertarian Tom Bailey. Buckhout, a retired Army Colonel, has been endorsed by the National Republican Congressional Committee and has raised $2 million for her campaign. Davis has outraised Buckhout, with $3.1 million raised and $2.6 million left to spend. Buckhout's campaign focuses on illegal immigration, the economy, energy independence, and support for working families and farmers. She has been criticized for her stance on abortion rights and her association with Mark Robinson, a GOP candidate for governor who has been tied to anti-Semitic and racist posts. Buckhout has stated that she is 'pro-life' and has endorsed the U.S. Supreme Court's reversal of the Roe v. Wade ruling. 'We have to close the border,' she said. 'You know one of the biggest scourges out here is fentanyl. It's touching every family in some way or another.' Davis has built relationships with congressional Republicans and is one of the House Democrats who most often votes against his party. 'A congressman should be out there wooing companies to come down and see what a great place we have to build jobs, to build factories, to build businesses,' Buckhout said. 'They should be talking to every representative of every industry out there, getting them to come down.'

**Pat Harrigan, Ralph Scott Jr. among candidates in NC U.S. House District 10 race**
The North Carolina 10th Congressional District will have a new representative after the November election, as incumbent Patrick McHenry announced he would not seek reelection. Four candidates are running for the seat: Pat Harrigan (R), Ralph Scott Jr. (D), Todd Helm (Constitution), and Steven Feldman (L). Harrigan, a firearms manufacturing business owner and U.S. Army veteran, has been endorsed by former president Donald Trump and is running on a platform of being 'energy independent' and securing the border. Scott, a U.S. Air Force veteran and sixth-great grandson of President James Madison, won the Democratic nomination by default and supports individual freedom and voting rights. Helm, the CEO of Agricultural Development Initiatives, advocates for balancing the budget and pro-life ideals, while Feldman, a dermatologist, is in favor of reducing government debt and pulling the United States out of foreign wars. Whoever wins the seat could be in place to represent the district for an extended period of time, as the last three congressmen to hold the seat have done so for at least 17 years each.

**Vulnerable Democrat Has Ties to Radical Arm the Islam**
Vulnerable North Carolina Democrat Don Davis has ties to the radical arm of the Nation of Islam, according to reports. In his 1994 Air Force Academy yearbook, Davis wrote about Islam and its potential to fit into the modern US world, calling for the elimination of the 'PARADIGM and Modern Lynching.' He also referenced Minister Shabazz, also known as Malcolm X, and a Quranic verse that suggests the mission of Islam has been entrusted to Muslims. Davis is currently running in North Carolina's 1st Congressional District, a socially conservative area where he may struggle to gain support. Democrats have been known to support Muslims, but this has also led to criticism of the party's priorities, which include hatred of modern society, capitalism, and Western values, similar to Militant Islam.

**Ann Wagner says sheâ€™s running again in 2026 after Bill Eigel declares interest in job**
U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner announced her intention to run for reelection in 2026, just days after State Sen. Bill Eigel expressed interest in the 2nd Congressional District seat. Wagner stated, 'It is an honor to serve the 2nd District and I will be running for reelection in 2026.' She emphasized the importance of helping elect President Trump, defending Republican state legislators, and growing the U.S. House majority. Wagner faces Democrat Ray Hartmann, Libertarian Brandon Daugherty, and Green Party candidate Shelby Davis in the upcoming election. The district is heavily Republican, and Wagner is favored to win a seventh term. Eigel, who gained name recognition in the August GOP primary for governor, may be a potential rival in the future.

**Election Forecaster Shifts Nebraska District to Democrat**
Rep. Don Bacon's re-election campaign in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District is becoming increasingly challenging. Sabato's Crystal Ball has shifted the race from 'toss-up' to 'lean Democrat' after recent polling showed Democrat State Senator Tony Vargas leading Bacon by six points. Vice President Kamala Harris also holds a strong lead over former President Donald Trump in the district. According to Kyle Kondik, managing editor for Sabato's Crystal Ball, Bacon is 'likely behind' in the district, which leans Democratic. The Cook Political Report still rates the race as 'toss-up', but Bacon lost to Vargas by only two points in 2022.

**Fierce North Carolina congressional race could hinge on other names on the ballot**
The 1st Congressional District in North Carolina is a battleground district, and the outcome of the election may not be entirely up to the candidates. Republican Laurie Buckhout and incumbent Democratic Rep. Don Davis are campaigning fiercely, but the top of the ballot, including Vice President Kamala Harris for Davis and Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson for Buckhout, may impact voters' choices. Buckhout has focused on her own race, saying 'If folks want to make it about social media and personalities, I want to make it about issues.' Davis has cultivated a reputation as a moderate Democrat in a district he knows well, but the top of the Democratic ticket could cost him some voters. Voter turnout on both sides could be make or break for either candidate, with Buckhout's military background and her intent not to become a 'professional politician' potentially giving her an edge.

**Fierce North Carolina congressional race could hinge on other namesâ€¦**
In North Carolina's 1st Congressional District, a fierce battle is unfolding between incumbent Democratic Rep. Don Davis and Republican challenger Laurie Buckhout. The outcome may not be entirely up to them, as candidates farther up the ballot, such as Vice President Kamala Harris for Davis and Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson for Buckhout, could impact voters' choices. Buckhout has focused on her own race, saying 'If folks want to make it about social media and personalities, I want to make it about issues.' Davis has cultivated a reputation as a moderate Democrat in a district he knows well, and has sponsored legislation to help veterans. The district terrain is more challenging for Davis than when he won in 2022, and he faces a 'much stronger opponent' in Buckhout, said Peter Francia, political science professor at East Carolina University. Voter turnout on both sides could be make or break for either candidate, Francia said.

**Election 2024: Buckhout, Davis agree border control a top issue**
In the competitive U.S. House race in North Carolina's 1st Congressional District, securing the border is a top issue for both Republican candidate Laurie Buckhout and Democratic incumbent Don Davis. Buckhout has made 'securing the border' her top priority, aligning herself with former President Donald Trump's calls to 'build the wall.' Davis, who has spoken out against open border policies, has also voted in favor of funding to secure the border and condemned Vice President Kamala Harris's handling of the border. Despite this, Davis has endorsed Harris, citing the need for the administration and Congress to address the concerns of the southern border. A Carolina Journal poll found that illegal immigration was North Carolina voters' second-highest priority, with only inflation/prices taking a higher position.

**Election 2024: Buckhout, Davis split over economic policy**
In the tightest U.S. House race in the nation, Republican Laurie Buckhout and incumbent Democrat Don Davis are vying for the 1st Congressional District in North Carolina. Buckhout advocates for 'America first' policies, stating that the American economy is 'broken' and that drastic changes are needed. She claims that the Biden-Davis agenda has caused devastating inflation rates and made the cost of living unaffordable in eastern North Carolina. Davis, on the other hand, has been aligned with the Biden administration and its economic priorities, and believes that the solution to North Carolina's economic struggles will be more financial investments in communities. According to Davis' website, he is pushing for essential investments to enable eastern North Carolina to thrive, including ensuring access to high-speed broadband and creating opportunities for children in rural communities. Buckhout has criticized Davis for enabling Joe Biden's failures, while Davis has prioritized job growth and funneling federal funding and grants into North Carolina.

**NC Democrat Don Davis missed some controversial votes, but there's more to the story**
Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat from North Carolina, is being attacked by Republicans for missing votes in Congress. However, Davis' campaign says that the attacks are 'ghoulish' and that he was absent due to a family emergency, specifically the death of his grandmother. According to Civic Impulse, Davis missed 32 of 224 roll-call votes between July and September 2023, or 14.3%. However, since September, Davis has not missed more than three votes a quarter, and has missed less than 1.3% of votes in 2024. Davis' campaign notes that he has cast votes on contentious issues and has even gone against his own party. For example, Davis voted to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib regarding comments she made on the Israel-Hamas War, and he voted against allowing committees to investigate whether there was enough evidence to impeach President Joe Biden. Davis also voted with his party to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy and to expel former Rep. George Santos. On immigration policy, Davis was present and voted for a handful of bills, including one that mirrored legislation that NRCC faulted Davis for missing. He also voted several times against his party. Lauryn Fanguen, spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, 'Attacking Congressman Davis for grieving and eulogizing his grandmother who raised him is the type of ghoulish behavior that should have no place in politics.'
