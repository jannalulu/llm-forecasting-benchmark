Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Time frame: Only about 2 months remain until October 1, 2024 (roughly 65 days)

2. Key requirements:
- Must be a federal court ruling
- Must strike down/invalidate a major Clean Air Act provision
- Must explicitly cite Chevron doctrine overturning
- Must be a final ruling

3. Context considerations:
- Chevron was only overturned in June 2024, very recently
- Federal court cases typically take months or years to reach final rulings
- However, given Chevron's significance, there are likely multiple challenges already in progress
- Clean Air Act is a frequent target for legal challenges
- The short timeframe (2 months) is the biggest limiting factor

4. Key factors favoring occurrence:
- Many existing cases could be amended to include Chevron arguments
- High motivation from industry groups to challenge regulations
- Some judges may be eager to apply the new Chevron precedent

5. Factors against occurrence:
- Very short remaining timeline
- Need for explicit Chevron citation
- Court schedules and procedures take time
- Summer period when courts are less active

Given the extremely short timeframe but multiple potential cases in progress, I assess this as having a low but non-trivial probability.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 25.75%, with 20.25% being the most likely. Probability: 20.25%.
