Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rates/Historical patterns:
- Diplomatic expulsions are relatively rare between countries with strong economic ties
- China and Philippines have had numerous disputes but rarely escalated to diplomatic expulsions
- Recent history shows they prefer diplomatic protests and negotiations over expulsions

2. Current Situation Analysis:
Factors increasing probability:
- Significant escalation in tensions over South China Sea
- Recent dangerous incident with flares dropped by Chinese aircraft (Aug 8, 2024)
- Multiple diplomatic protests filed by Philippines
- Philippines acquiring more fighter jets in response
- Strong public condemnation by President Marcos Jr.

Factors decreasing probability:
- Both countries recently established direct hotline for communication
- Agreement reached in July 2024 to deescalate tensions
- Philippines explicitly stating preference for diplomatic solutions
- Economic interdependence between countries
- Short timeframe (only ~6 weeks until Sept 30)

3. Recent Developments:
- Multiple diplomatic channels still active
- Focus on filing diplomatic protests rather than expulsions
- Philippines continuing to engage in bilateral talks
- Both sides showing willingness to maintain dialogue

4. Key Constraints:
- Philippines' stated policy of avoiding escalation
- Economic considerations
- Recent establishment of conflict resolution mechanisms

5. Timing Consideration:
The short timeframe (until Sept 30) reduces the probability of escalation to expulsion level, as diplomatic processes typically take longer to exhaust.

Weighing these factors, while tensions are high, both sides are actively working to maintain diplomatic channels and avoid severe escalation. The recent establishment of communication mechanisms and explicit statements favoring diplomatic solutions suggest that diplomatic expulsions remain unlikely in this short timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Severe escalation in tensions, with recent incidents involving Chinese aircraft dropping flares at Philippine planes (August 2024)
2. Multiple diplomatic protests already filed by Philippines against China
3. Increasingly assertive stance by Philippines under Marcos Jr.
4. History of territorial disputes and maritime confrontations
5. Recent violent incidents (June 2024) causing injuries to Filipino personnel

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Both sides showing willingness for dialogue:
- Establishment of presidential hotline (July 2024)
- Recent bilateral consultation mechanism meetings
- Agreement to de-escalate tensions at Second Thomas Shoal
2. Economic interdependence between countries
3. Philippines explicitly stating preference for diplomatic solutions
4. Short timeframe (only ~6 weeks until September 30)
5. Historical rarity of actual diplomatic expulsions despite frequent tensions

Analysis:
- Base rate: Diplomatic expulsions are rare events, even during serious tensions
- Recent trajectory: While tensions are high, both sides are actively pursuing diplomatic channels
- Time constraint: The short remaining period reduces likelihood
- Current situation: Despite serious provocations, both sides appear to be containing escalation through diplomatic protests rather than expulsions
- Economic factors: Strong trade relationships create incentives to avoid extreme measures

While tensions are at a concerning level, both countries appear to be following an established pattern of protests and dialogue rather than moving toward diplomatic expulsions. The recent establishment of communication channels suggests both sides want to manage rather than escalate tensions.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Significant escalation in tensions, particularly the August 8-13 incidents involving Chinese aircraft dropping flares at Philippine aircraft
2. Multiple diplomatic protests being filed by Philippines against China
3. Increasing militarization with Philippines acquiring more fighter jets
4. Historical pattern of deteriorating relations despite attempted diplomatic solutions

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Recent establishment of direct hotline between leaders (July 2024)
2. Both sides showing willingness for diplomatic dialogue
3. Philippines explicitly stating preference for diplomatic solutions
4. Economic interdependence between countries
5. Short timeframe (only about 1.5 months until September 30)

Breaking down sub-problems:
1. Likelihood of Philippines expelling Chinese diplomats: Low (~10%) given historical reluctance
2. Likelihood of Philippines recalling its diplomats: Moderate (~20%) given recent provocations
3. Likelihood of China expelling Philippine diplomats: Low (~15%) given preference for other pressure tactics
4. Likelihood of China recalling its diplomats: Low (~10%) given strategic importance

Key considerations:
- Time constraint is significant - only 1.5 months
- Recent aerial incidents represent serious escalation
- Both sides still actively pursuing diplomatic channels
- Economic relationships create strong incentive to avoid diplomatic expulsions

The aerial incidents are serious but both sides are showing commitment to diplomatic solutions through recently established communication channels. While tensions are high, the short timeframe and mutual interest in maintaining diplomatic relations suggest diplomatic expulsions/recalls are unlikely but possible.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.75%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Diplomatic expulsions/recalls are relatively rare events between major trading partners
- Previous incidents between China and Philippines have typically resulted in diplomatic protests rather than expulsions

2. Current Situation Assessment:
Escalating factors:
- Recent dangerous aerial incident (Aug 8, 2024) with Chinese aircraft dropping flares at Philippine plane
- Multiple diplomatic protests filed by Philippines
- Increasing military tensions in South China Sea
- Strong condemnation from Philippine President Marcos Jr.

De-escalating factors:
- Both countries recently established direct communication hotline
- Agreement reached in July 2024 to manage tensions
- Philippines explicitly stating preference for diplomatic solutions
- Economic interdependence between nations

3. Time Frame Analysis:
- Question resolves by September 30, 2024 (~6 weeks from now)
- Recent incidents have increased tensions significantly
- Multiple channels for de-escalation still exist

4. Key Considerations:
- Philippines has shown preference for diplomatic protests over expulsions
- China typically responds proportionally to diplomatic actions
- Both sides have demonstrated willingness to de-escalate through formal channels
- Recent aerial incident represents significant escalation
- Short timeframe increases uncertainty

5. Risk Analysis:
The recent aerial incident is more serious than previous provocations, but both sides have invested in de-escalation mechanisms. The probability is elevated due to heightened tensions but moderated by existing diplomatic channels and economic ties.
