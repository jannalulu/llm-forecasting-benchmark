2025-02-12 22:06:59,913 - INFO - Question: Will RCP's polling bias for Trump based on national polls in the month before the 2024 election be greater than -1.0 and less than 0 percentage points?

Let me carefully analyze this:

1. The question centers on RCP polling bias for Trump in national polls, specifically on October 17th's average.

2. Current RCP average is -1.583 pp for Trump

3. Resolution involves calculating the final bias by:
   - Taking -1.583 pp
   - Subtracting Trump's final popular vote percentage 
   - Adding Harris' final popular vote percentage

4. The question asks if this bias will be:
   - Strictly > -1.0 pp
   - Strictly < 0 pp

5. Key considerations:
   - Polling can shift in final weeks
   - Potential polling systematic errors
   - Historical polling accuracy trends
   - Current election dynamics
   - Margin of error in polling

6. Major uncertainties include late voter shifts, potential polling method challenges, and undecided voter behaviors

7. Given current data and historical polling patterns, the bias seems likely to remain in a narrow range around current levels

8. Probability assessment requires balancing multiple competing factors

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.
