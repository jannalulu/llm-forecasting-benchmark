Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Netflix has not had any reported layoffs in 2024 according to the provided news articles
- The tech industry has seen significant layoffs in 2024 (132,000+ jobs cut across 404 companies)
- However, Netflix appears to be in a relatively stable position compared to peers

2. Company-Specific Factors:
Positive (against layoffs):
- Netflix is focusing on strategic shifts (ending basic plan, emphasizing ad-supported options) rather than cost-cutting
- No mentions of financial distress or need for restructuring
- Recent challenge (content leak) appears operational rather than financial

Negative (supporting layoffs):
- Broader tech industry continues to see layoffs
- Streaming competition remains intense
- Industry-wide pressure to improve profitability

3. Timing Consideration:
- Only about 6 weeks remain until October 1st
- Most major tech layoffs have been announced with some advance planning
- Short timeframe reduces likelihood

4. Recent Events:
- Netflix's main recent challenge has been content leaks
- Company appears focused on content security rather than cost-cutting
- No signals of financial distress or restructuring needs

5. Industry Context:
- While tech layoffs continue, they're concentrated in hardware (Intel, Cisco) and struggling companies
- Netflix appears to be in a different position, having already done major restructuring in previous years

Given:
- The short timeframe
- Lack of current signals suggesting layoffs
- Netflix's relatively stable position
- But acknowledging ongoing tech industry volatility

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

- Netflix's last major layoffs were in 2022-2023

2. Recent Netflix-Specific Factors:
- Netflix is dealing with a major security breach/leak of content
- Company appears focused on content security rather than restructuring
- Recent business changes focus on subscription models (canceling basic plan) rather than workforce
- No mentions of financial difficulties or need for cost-cutting
- Strong subscriber growth and successful ad-supported tier

3. Industry Context:
- Major tech companies like Intel (15,000), Cisco (6,000) announcing large layoffs
- Entertainment/streaming companies like Warner Bros, Disney having layoffs
- However, Netflix appears relatively stable compared to competitors

4. Time Consideration:
