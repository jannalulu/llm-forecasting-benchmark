2025-02-12 22:41:29,481 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me reason through this step by step:

1. First, for this to happen, the Yankees need to:
   - Make the playoffs
   - Win their playoff series to reach the World Series
   - Lose the World Series specifically in 5 games

2. As of October 23, 2024, the Yankees have already been eliminated from the 2024 playoffs entirely.

3. Therefore, it is impossible for them to lose the 2024 World Series in 5 games (or any number of games), as they are not participating in the playoffs at all.

4. Given that this is a mathematical impossibility based on the current state of events, there is only one possible probability.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.10%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%
