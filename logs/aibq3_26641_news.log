**Trump says he'll debate Kamala Harris, but only after his nomination**
Former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump has stated that he would debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, but only after his official nomination. Trump's campaign said that he would not commit to any future debates until his condition is met. However, Trump had previously agreed to a debate with current President Joe Biden, organized by ABC on September 10. It is now unclear if the debate will take place as planned.

He also mentioned that he did not agree to anything with Biden, but accepted a debate invitation. Kamala Harris is now the Democratic candidate for president after Biden's decision to not seek re-election. Biden announced his decision in a letter dated July 21, 2024, stating that he would focus on completing his presidential duties for the remainder of his term. The Democratic National Convention, to be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22, will be a crucial moment in defining the candidacy.

**Trump Backs Out of Future Debates, Says Democrats 'Could Still Change Their Minds' About Kamala Harris**
Donald Trump's campaign has backed out of future debates, citing the ongoing political chaos surrounding the Democratic Party and the possibility that they may still change their minds about their nominee. The statement, released by Trump's communications director Steven Cheung, claims that many in the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama, do not think Kamala Harris can beat Trump and are holding out for someone else. The apparent withdrawal comes after Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Harris. Trump faced Biden in their first debate on June 27, which resulted in Democratic voters losing faith in his re-election chances due to his poor performance.

**Democratic Party to Choose Presidential Candidate through Online Voting by August 7**
The Democratic Party will choose its presidential candidate in the United States through online voting by August 7. According to Jamie Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the date of the vote has not been set. Representatives of the party also stated that the candidate for vice president may be nominated by August 7. The candidate for president, likely to be incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris, will have the right to influence the selection of the vice presidential candidate. The nomination of the presidential candidate will take place several weeks before the delegates gather in Chicago on August 19. This will reduce the convention to a ceremonial function. The presidential election in the United States is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The newly elected president and vice president will take office on January 20, 2025. Joe Biden, the incumbent president, announced on July 21 that he would not run for re-election and instead nominated Kamala Harris as his successor. Biden will remain in office until the end of his term. The Republican Party has nominated former President Donald Trump as its presidential candidate, who was recently the target of an assassination attempt. Trump has called for a second debate with the Democratic candidate on Fox News, which is close to him. The first debate was organized by ABC.

**When is the next presidential debate? With Joe Biden out, will there a Donald Trump-Kamala Harris debate? What we know.**
President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris is now the presumptive Democrat nominee, but a debate between Donald Trump and Harris is uncertain. Trump has expressed reluctance to debate Harris or any other candidate before the Democratic National Convention in August. The next presidential debate was scheduled for September 10 on ABC, but Trump may not participate. Harris will need to be nominated as the official candidate during the Democratic National Convention, where party delegates will vote on who will represent the party. The 'good conscience' clause in the DNC rules allows delegates to vote for someone other than the primary winner.

The Trump campaign has postponed agreeing to a date for a vice presidential debate, citing uncertainty over the Democratic ticket. The campaign claims it cannot commit to a date before the Democratic convention, as they do not know who the Democratic vice presidential nominee will be. Trump campaign Senior Advisor Brian Hughes stated, 'We don't know who the Democrat nominee for Vice President is going to be, so we can't lock in a date before their convention. To do so would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, or whoever Kamala Harris picks as her running mate.' Despite reported conversations between J.D.

**Democrats to Virtually Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party plans to virtually nominate President Joe Biden as their candidate for the November elections before the end of July, according to sources close to the organization. This decision would put an end to the internal debate that has been ongoing for weeks, in which some voices had called for Biden to end his re-election campaign after his poor performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. The nomination will be made through a virtual 'roll call' process, where over 4,000 party delegates will cast their votes starting next Monday, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Biden's nomination will be officially accepted during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, scheduled for August 19-22.

**Donald Trump Says Joe Biden 'Does Not Want to Resign', Kamala Harris Would Be His Replacement**
Donald Trump stated that Joe Biden 'does not want to resign' and that Kamala Harris would be his replacement. According to Trump, Harris would be the first in line for the presidential candidacy in case of a vacancy. A recent poll shows that Harris would cut the Republican's lead to just two points. The 2024 elections will take place on November 5th, and the first presidential debate has raised more doubts than certainties within the Democratic party, positioning the Republican candidate better. Trump expressed his opinion on Biden's potential replacement, stating that 'I think he's going to stay (...) he has his ego and doesn't want to resign... I think they're very worried about the votes'. He also mentioned that Harris would be his choice if Biden were to step down. 'And if it's not her, I don't think they'll want another option', he said about Kamala Harris. Joe Biden sent a letter to high-ranking Democrats, asking them to stop their demands for his resignation. The White House, through its spokesperson, stated that the debate was 'just a bad night' and that it's time to 'move on' from the doubts about Biden's health. The letter, which was two pages long, stated that 'the question of how to move forward has been publicly raised for more than a week and it's time for it to end'. A recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Democrats are divided, with 48% thinking Biden should drop out and 47% still supporting him.

**Democratic Committee Considers Nominating Biden for 2024 Presidential Election**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the 2024 presidential election by mid-July, following a major controversy after his debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, the decision aims to put an end to the widespread discussions within the party about replacing Biden after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter said that the likely date for Biden's official nomination is July 21. The Democrats had already planned to nominate Biden (81 years old) before the party's August convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set a final deadline of August 7 for selecting presidential candidates. Many major American media outlets have begun openly pressuring President Biden to withdraw from the election and leave the way open for a new Democratic nominee who can challenge Trump, who seems to have scored many points in the first presidential debate. The report stated that the Democratic National Committee has denied that the official nomination of Biden is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is Ohio's decision. The debate has sparked concern among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, four months before the election and about six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic members have ruled out replacing Biden and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election, and to mobilize Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.

Meanwhile, the Republican Party is expected to officially announce Trump as their candidate at their convention in Milwaukee on July 15-18.

**US-Wahl: TV-Duell zwischen Biden und Trump begins**
The highly anticipated first TV debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the ongoing US presidential election has begun. The Democratic President and his Republican predecessor are facing off on the TV stage in Atlanta, Georgia. This is the first direct confrontation between the two presidential candidates since October 2020, when Trump was the incumbent and Biden was the challenger. This time, the roles are reversed, with Biden seeking a second term as President and Trump running for the Republicans. The debate is expected to be a closely watched event, with polls indicating a neck-and-neck race between the two candidates. One of the recurring themes in the campaign is the high age of the candidates, with Biden being 81 years old and Trump 78 years old.

**Watch live as Trump arrives in Atlanta ahead of first presidential debate against Biden**
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will face off in the first 2024 presidential debate on Thursday night in Atlanta. The 90-minute debate will air on CNN and is expected to draw a huge audience. The two candidates, both 78 and 81 years old, will be under pressure to display their command of issues and avoid verbal stumbles. Trump, who still faces criminal cases, will need to convince undecided voters that he does not pose a threat to democracy, while Biden will need to deliver a forceful performance after months of Republican assertions that his faculties have dulled with age.

The 2024 US presidential election is heating up with the first face-to-face debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The debate comes after Trump's conviction for paying Stormy Daniels. The focus is now on July 11, when Judge Juan Merchan will announce the sentence against Trump. It's unlikely that Trump will go to prison, and he may be granted house arrest, preventing him from attending the Republican convention. Trump is expected to announce his running mate in Milwaukee, possibly before the debate. Kamala Harris and Trump's number two will face off in a debate, with dates set for July 23 (after the Republican convention) and August 13 (before the Democratic convention).

**Biden and Trump to Debate for First Time Despite Not Being Officially Nominated**
Joe Biden and Donald Trump will face off in a presidential debate on Thursday in Atlanta, Georgia, despite not being officially nominated as candidates for the US presidency. The debate, moderated by CNN, will be the first of its kind between an incumbent US president and a former president. The debate will have 90 minutes of discussion with two commercial breaks, during which the candidates will not be able to consult with their advisors. The podium will be randomly assigned, with Biden on the right and Trump on the left. Trump will give the final statements, meaning Biden will finish his remarks first. The candidates are not allowed to bring prepared notes, but will have a notebook and pen during the debate. The debate is unusual in that it is taking place in June, rather than the traditional September or October timeframe. Biden and Trump have been nominated in an unusually early manner and their campaigns argue that they should start debating as soon as possible, as some states allow early voting in September. The debate will be organized by CNN and will be moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate, was excluded from the debate due to not meeting the CNN's criteria. Biden and Trump have debated twice before during the 2020 campaign and have not had a one-on-one debate since then. Biden has been preparing for the debate by staying at the presidential retreat in Camp David, while Trump has been holding meetings with his team and rallies where he has attacked his rival.

**Biden and Trump will meet for a debate this week. When are presidential debates typically held?**
The debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, hosted by CNN on June 27, will be the first of the 2024 election cycle and the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history. Typically, presidential debates are held in September or October, but this year's debate is scheduled earlier due to the candidates' quick wrapping up of their party's nominations and the decision to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The campaigns agreed to hold earlier debates to allow candidates to face the American people before voters go to the polls. In past elections, the first debate would take place after some states started sending out mail-in ballots, but this year's debate will take place before that. By agreeing to the earlier schedule, Biden and Trump seem to want to ensure that every voter is well-informed before submitting a ballot.

**Who knows which way this presidential race is headed?**
The 2024 presidential campaign is unprecedented, with the oldest-ever nominated candidates and a convicted felon as the Republican nominee. Despite his low favorability numbers, the Democratic nominee has faced no serious opposition. The debate schedule has been moved up to June 27 and September 10, with President Biden calling for the debates. Trump's popularity has increased with each indictment, and he is now leading in the polls. The campaign is full of uncertainty, with the possibility of a knockout blow or a turn-around for Biden. The author, Peter King, predicts that the campaign won't be over until it's over, and maybe not even then.
