To forecast whether OpenAI will publish information describing Q* (Q-Star) by September 30, 2024, let's evaluate the available evidence and context:

1. **Reference Class Forecasting**: We must consider how often companies like OpenAI reveal new projects or methods publicly. OpenAI is known for periodically releasing major developments in AI, typically aligning releases with significant industry conferences or events. Similar announcements tend to coincide with strategic initiatives or partnerships, such as OpenAI's collaboration with large tech firms like Microsoft and Apple.

2. **Latest News and Rumors**: Q* or Q-Star has been identified as a potential breakthrough in AI capabilities, particularly related to solving mathematical problems with high accuracy. Despite this being exciting news for the AI community, there is no official confirmation from OpenAI concerning Q*, only rumors and media speculations describing it as a potential step towards AGI.

3. **Recent Developments from OpenAI**: The articles mention security breaches and collaborations, but there is no direct evidence pointing towards an imminent announcement regarding Q*. If OpenAI considered Q* a significant development, they might want to further implement security measures before disclosing details. However, tension with former employees suggests internal disagreement, potentially delaying any announcements.

4. **Extrapolating Trends**: OpenAI has been focusing on incrementally improving existing models (e.g., GPT-4o) rather than introducing entirely new systems. However, such incremental releases do not preclude the possibility of announcing Q* if it is strategically aligned with OpenAI's ongoing AI projects.

5. **Existing Forecasts and Predictions**: Current prediction markets such as Polymarket or prediction platforms like Metaculus do not provide explicit data on the probability of Q*'s announcement, so this angle lacks definitive insight.

6. **Causative Forces and Stakeholder Dynamics**: Stakeholder relationships with major partners such as Microsoft or Apple's investments may pressure OpenAI towards more transparency about breakthrough projects like Q*. Conversely, security concerns revealed in the articles suggest OpenAI might delay announcements to ensure internal processes and informational integrity are robustly protected.

Balanced against these data points, the current situation suggests an uncertain path toward a public announcement about Q*. While innovation and developments are undoubtedly occurring, the confluence of security concerns, internal dynamics, and strategic partnerships might skew the timeline.

Given this analysis, OpenAI may or may not announce and publish information about Q* by the deadline; however, within this uncertainty, I'd estimate slightly in favor of it happening as part of a strategic reveal linked to broader AI advancements:

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To make an informed forecast on whether OpenAI will publish information describing Q* (Q-Star) by September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach:

1. **Reference Class and Base Rate**: The key event is the publication of information on a highly speculative and purportedly advanced AI project, Q*. Releasing information on significant AI breakthroughs, while not unprecedented, is still relatively rare. OpenAI's history of disclosing major updates and advancements (e.g., GPT model releases) could serve as an indirect but relevant reference class. However, there are no published details or confirmations on Q* beyond rumors; hence, the base rate is low.

2. **Latest News and Evidence**:
   - **Rumors and Speculation**: Articles hint at a model called Q* being capable of school-level math problem-solving with high accuracy. However, there is no official documentation or acknowledgment from OpenAI identifying any project as Q*.
   - **Security Breaches**: Multiple reports detail a security breach at OpenAI, suggesting possible information leaks but no official public announcement from OpenAI regarding Q*.
   - **Corporate Behavior**: OpenAI appears to be focused on advancements related to their existing models, such as GPT-4o and potential future models like GPT-5. Delayed releases and security concerns indicate a cautious, strategic approach, possibly delaying or withholding significant announcements like Q*.

3. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**:
   - **Inside View**: There is insight from leaked information and internal discussions suggesting Q* might be under exploration. Insiders at OpenAI have reportedly viewed Q* as a potential AGI breakthrough.
   - **Outside View**: Historically, OpenAI tends to announce significant milestones in AI development publicly, though sometimes with user feedback phases before complete rollout.

4. **Causal Forces**:
   - The primary forces at play are technological advancement and corporate paradigm regarding disclosure and competitive edge. The potential risks of prematurely releasing information, especially post-breach, could deter OpenAI from publishing until more strategic or secure timing aligns.

5. **Balance and Confidence**:
   - Given the absence of official acknowledgment and considering the lessons from past disclosure patterns, a prediction tightly around the midpoint is here both prudent and decisive due to mixed signals and incomplete information.

Considering the above factors, my prediction is that there is noticeable but not overwhelming potential for the event (not exploited by OpenAI's past behaviors or the current speculative context) as possible within the specified timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 45.00%, but 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.

   - **Leaks and Rumors**: Evidence suggesting OpenAI has developed a model, Q*, that focuses on mathematics with almost 100% accuracy could indicate a potential for public acknowledgment.
   - **Security Concerns**: Numerous reports of security breaches and internal issues at OpenAI could delay or impact reporting on Q* for strategic (or security) reasons.
   - **Partnerships**: OpenAI’s collaboration with Apple and other large companies might influence or pressure OpenAI to reveal groundbreaking work, like Q*.

3. **Breakdown of Problem**:
   - **OpenAI Must Acknowledge**: OpenAI must first acknowledge Q* — either directly or through a confirmation of existing rumors.
   - **Public Disclosure**: A formal public disclosure in a substantive form (more than just a tweet) is required. The uncertainty revolves around OpenAI's strategic interest in making such a disclosure within the set timeframe.
   - **Corporate Strategy**: OpenAI’s prioritization of certain projects, potential strategic withholding of information under pressure (from partnerships or market), and handling of internal security or strategic concerns play a critical role.

4. **Analysis of Evidence**:
   - The mention of Q* as a developed AI capable of solving mathematical problems with high accuracy suggests internal development acknowledgment. 
   - Despite the secrecy surrounding the technology, leaks and insider comments might add to external pressures for a public acknowledgment if Q* is truly revolutionary or significant.
   - The broader industry context of competitive announcements and collaboration (e.g., with Apple) can drive a public announcement for strategic market positioning.

5. **Potential Obstacles**:
   - The cultural and strategic approach of OpenAI toward public disclosures — especially regarding cutting-edge AI technologies like Q* — tends to be cautious.
   - Internal issues: As the news about security breaches suggests, internal policy, cultural, or strategic issues could delay public disclosures.
   - Timeline: It's already mid-October 2024, meaning only about two weeks remain, limiting the opportunity for a public acknowledgment unless it was already planned and imminent.

Based on this analysis, the likelihood of OpenAI publishing information on Q* by the deadline balances these competing factors – ongoing rumors and possible insider discussion supporting this idea, against the tendency for strategic restraint and timing considerations.

**My Prediction**: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
