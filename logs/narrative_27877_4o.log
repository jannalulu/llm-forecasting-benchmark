**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open. They sip coffee, their expressions a mix of satisfaction and curiosity.

**ALEX**  
So, the big question: Will there be a frontier open-source AI model?

**JORDAN**  
Our models had it at 72.45%. And guess what? It happened. An open-source model just made it to the top 3 on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard.

**ALEX**  
Incredible. I remember when the gap seemed insurmountable. The open-source community really stepped up.

**JORDAN**  
Yeah, the pace of innovation has been staggering. The landscape's changing faster than we predicted.

**ALEX**  
It's a testament to collaboration. I wonder where we'll be next year.

**JORDAN**  
Hopefully, still getting it right. Cheers to that.

They clink their coffee cups, eyes gleaming with anticipation for the future.

*Two superforecasters, ALEX and JORDAN, sit across from each other, sipping coffee and scrolling through their tablets.*

**ALEX**  
Well, the big question's settled. No open-source model in the top three by Arena ELO or within 50 points of the leader.

**JORDAN**  
Yeah, our models had it at 15.75%. The gap's still there, but it's closing slower than some expected.

**ALEX**  
True. The news up to September showed promising open-source developments, but nothing groundbreaking enough. 

**JORDAN**  
Exactly. The proprietary models are still holding the edge. But hey, the open-source community's resilient. Maybe next year?

**ALEX**  
Let's hope. The innovation's there, just needs time to catch up.

*They clink their coffee mugs together, optimistic about the future.*

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MARK, sit across from each other, laptops open.

**JANE:** So, the big question—did an open-source model make it to the top three?

**MARK:** Our models had it at 15.75%. Close, but no cigar.

**JANE:** Interesting. The gap between proprietary and open-source still holds. What tipped the scales?

**MARK:** The latest news up to September showed proprietary models integrating groundbreaking data efficiency techniques. Open-source just couldn't catch up in time.

**JANE:** Fascinating. The gap is shrinking but not fast enough. Still, 15.75% isn't negligible.

**MARK:** True. It's a reminder that open-source is resilient, just not quite there yet.

**JANE:** Maybe next year. Until then, we keep watching the leaderboard.

They sip their coffees, eyes back on their screens, ever the vigilant forecasters.
