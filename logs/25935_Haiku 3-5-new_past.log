Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Reference Class Analysis:
1. Historical Context of Q*:
- First mentioned in November 2023 Reuters report
- Described as potentially breakthrough mathematical problem-solving AI
- No official confirmation from OpenAI to date

Evidence Weighing:
Positive Signals:
+ Multiple articles reference Q* as potentially significant breakthrough
+ OpenAI has history of gradually revealing advanced research
+ Mathematical problem-solving is seen as key path to AGI
+ Articles suggest Q* solves school-level math problems with ~100% accuracy

Negative/Constraining Signals:
- No official publication about Q* yet
- OpenAI experiencing internal disruptions (superalignment team dissolved)
- Security breach and potential internal information leaks
- Specific disclosure deadline is quite near (Sept 30, 2024)

Trend Analysis:
- OpenAI's recent focus seems more on product launches (GPT-4o) than research transparency
- Increasing external/regulatory pressure for AI safety disclosures
- Competitive landscape with other AI companies might incentivize controlled revelation

Probability Adjustment Factors:
- Base probability of technical research disclosure: ~30%
- Adjusted for Q*'s potential significance: +15%
- Adjusted for competitive pressures: +10%
- Adjusted for potential internal challenges: -5%

Synthesizing these factors, I find a moderate probability of disclosure.

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 62.30%, but 53.75% being the most likely. Probability: 53.75%.
