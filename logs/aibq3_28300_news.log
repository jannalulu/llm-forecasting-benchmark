**Trump opens up on Project 2025, says Democrats know 'it has nothing to do with me'**
Donald Trump has denied any involvement with Project 2025, a conservative initiative aimed at promoting right-wing policies. During an interview on the Lex Fridman podcast, Trump said, 'I know nothing about it. And they know that too,' adding that Democrats also 'know that.' He explained that he has not read the project's contents because he disagrees with most of its ideas, stating, 'It's easier than saying, 'I read it, and, you know,' all of the things.' Trump emphasized that Project 2025 has 'nothing to do with me,' despite containing controversial initiatives such as a total ban on abortion and restricting LGBTQ+ rights. The former president's comments come after Democrats warned voters about the potential effects of a Republican administration under Trump's second term.

**Peter Thiel: If The Election Is Close, Kamala Win Win, Because They Will Cheat**
Peter Thiel, a guest on the 'All-In' podcast, stated that if the 2024 election is close, he believes the Democrats will 'cheat' to win. He specified that they will 'fortify' the election by stealing ballots and implementing rule changes in plain daylight, such as ballot harvesting. Thiel noted that the US elections are not perfectly clean and suggested that they should be run more like other Western democracies, with one-day voting, minimal absentee ballots, and stronger voter ID requirements. He also mentioned that the US used to provide election results on the day of the vote, but this is no longer the case. Thiel stated that he will not be financially involved in the 2024 election if it is close, but will participate if the outcome is not in doubt.

**What's Behind Donald Trump's Right-Wing-Bro Podcast Binge**
The rise of podcasts in American politics is changing the dynamics of the 2024 presidential race. According to The Atlantic's Helen Lewis and Bloomberg's Ashley Carman, podcasts allow politicians to connect with listeners on a personal level, but also expose them to risks that can come back to haunt them. Lewis notes that podcasts can make politicians appear 'confessional and chatty,' which can be 'dangerous' in the long run. Carman explains that podcasts are a natural extension of conservative talk radio, which has transitioned from traditional radio to digital formats. Lewis also highlights the differences between podcasting and conventional journalism, saying that traditional norms are often 'out of the window' in audio formats. She notes that podcasters like Lex Fridman have blurred the lines between journalism and personal relationships, creating a sense of coziness and exclusivity that can be problematic.

**Trump's Team Worried He'll Fail Debates Against Harris Due to His Ego**
Donald Trump's team is concerned that he may not capitalize on the opportunity to regain his position in the election campaign by conducting successful debates against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. According to Politico, Trump's team has been urging him to focus on criticizing Harris' policies rather than her personal life, but he has refused and continues to attack her. Former Representative Newt Gingrich said, 'She will be very, very aggressive, will try to trap him, will get angry, will go personal, and will try to humiliate him. I think I hope he will behave like a real president...and just be calm and composed.' However, Trump's supporters, who know his personality and ego, believe that he may ruin everything during the debates. 'I think and pray that he can be disciplined,' said Tricia MacPhail, one of several Republican strategists. Journalists note that Trump, based on his behavior, does not share the views of his supporters and will stick to his image. In a recent podcast, Lex Fridman urged Trump to talk about 'a positive vision of the future instead of criticizing the other side,' but the former president disagreed. 'Yes, I think we should criticize. I think they are terrible,' Trump said in a published episode. It is worth noting that Trump has offered Elon Musk a position in case of his election victory.

**Trump Among the Zoomers**
Donald Trump is attempting to reach Gen Z voters in 2024 by appearing in alternative media venues geared towards a younger, predominantly male audience. He has given interviews to popular podcasters such as Lex Fridman and Theo Von, and has appeared at UFC events and on YouTube. Trump's strategy is to showcase his 'machismo' and 'unapologetic' personality, which is resonating with some young male voters. A recent New York Times/Siena poll found that Gen Z male voters are more likely to choose Trump and the GOP. Trump's campaign is also using his 18-year-old son Barron as a 'secret weapon' to connect with Gen Z influencers and set up interviews and appearances. 'It's a different generation,' Trump said. 'They don't grow up watching television the same way that we did. They grow up looking at the internet or watching a computer.'

**Trump acknowledges losing the 2020 election 'by a whisker'**
Former President Donald Trump acknowledged that he lost the 2020 presidential election, stating that he 'lost by a whisker.' Trump made this admission to podcaster Lex Fridman, saying that he received millions more votes than in the 2016 election, but still lost. This is a departure from his usual claims that the election was 'rigged.' Trump also cast doubt on the election, saying that he thinks it was a 'fraud' and that many people felt it was that way. Trump is facing four federal felony charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and is also facing criminal charges in Fulton County, Georgia. Republicans have launched lawsuits in battleground states ahead of this year's presidential election, which Democrats warn could be used to sow doubt if Trump loses again. 'I was told if I got 63 million, which is what I got the first time, 'You would win. You can't not win.' And I got millions more votes than that and lost by a whisker,' Trump added, according to Fridman's podcast.

**Trump's Red-Pill Podcast Tour**
Donald Trump has been touring the podcast circuit, appearing on popular shows such as Lex Fridman's podcast, where he discussed his views on politics and society. Trump's podcast appearances have been criticized for lacking substance and depth, with many of his interviewers failing to challenge him on his claims. The podcasters, who are often part of the 'manosphere' circuit, prioritize building a rapport with Trump over holding him accountable for his words. Trump's strategy is to use these podcasts to reach a younger male audience, who are more receptive to his message. His appearances on these shows have been described as 'verbal elevator music,' with Trump rambling on about topics he knows little about. The article argues that Trump's podcast tour is a symptom of a larger problem in American politics, where substance and fact-based reporting are being replaced by sensationalism and entertainment.

Trump expressed that he would release Epstein's client list if elected, stating, 'A lot of big people went to that island, but fortunately I was not one of them.' He also clarified that there was no bad blood between him and Joe Rogan, saying, 'I don't think that there was any tension and I've always liked him.' Additionally, Trump warned that electing Kamala Harris would push the U.S. towards communism, calling Joe Biden the 'worst president' in U.S. history and stating that the 2020 election was a 'coup.'

However, Trump still maintained that 'the fraud was on the other side,' and claimed that he 'got millions of more votes' but lost due to a narrow margin.

The Republican National Convention and Trump's campaign have assembled 'over 100,000 dedicated volunteers and attorneys' to 'preserve the sanctity' of the 2024 election.

However, he continued to make false claims about the election being a 'fraud' and accused immigrants of casting ballots. Trump also promoted the use of paper ballots, mandatory voter ID laws, and same-day voting with proof of citizenship.

Fridman received a long-winded response from Trump, who claimed that the 'fraud was on the other side' and that many people felt the election was a 'fraud.' Trump's false claims have fueled his 2024 ambitions and have led to legislation and Republican-led rule changes that have tried to do what he failed to in court. 'I think the election was a fraud, and many people felt it was that, and they wanted answers,' Trump said. 'And when you can't challenge an election, you have to be able to challenge it, otherwise it's going to get worse, not better.'

Trump said that he believes he will do well in the upcoming presidential debate and that he doesn't think this year's presidential election will be close. 'I've done well with debates. I became president,' Trump said. 'Then, the second time, I got millions more votes than I got the first time. So I was told if I got 63 million, which is what I got the first time, you would win.

**Epstein client list 'will be' made public - Trump  --  RT World News**
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has stated that if elected, he would make public the client list of deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, also known as the 'black book'. Trump compared this to declassifying documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, saying he would 'certainly take a look at it' and would 'be inclined to' release the client list. Trump made this statement in an interview with the Lex Fridman podcast, where he also mentioned that he never visited Epstein's private island, but 'a lot of people did'. The list of people who traveled to Little St. James has never been made public, despite revelations that Epstein lured young women and pimped them out to powerful acquaintances. Trump previously tried to release the Kennedy files as president, but was persuaded by the US intelligence community not to do so.

**Donald Trump's New Strategy: Reaching a Younger Audience through Podcasts**
Donald Trump has joined the popular podcast of Lex Fridman, a researcher from MIT, in an effort to connect with a younger and digitally active audience. This move is part of Trump's strategy to reach a wider audience through informal conversations with influencers. As Fridman said, 'This is a new way for me to connect with people and have conversations that are not just about politics.' Trump has previously participated in podcasts and live streams, including an interview with Adin Ross in August, where he received a Rolex and a customized Cybertruck. His presence on these platforms, although informal, has significant political weight, allowing him to reach a diverse and young audience and build a base of support.

**US Election: Trump teases 'guaranteed' plan to end Ukraine war, says will reveal only if elected**
Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee for US president, claimed on the Lex Fridman Podcast that he has a 'guaranteed' plan to end the war in Ukraine, but will only reveal it if he wins the election in November. Trump stated, 'If I win, as president elect, I'll have a deal made, guaranteed. That's a war that shouldn't have happened.' However, he refused to disclose the details of his plan, citing the need for surprise and effectiveness. Trump's comments have been met with criticism, particularly his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, which has been seen as undermining US leadership. In contrast, his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, has pledged to 'stand strong with Ukraine' and not 'cozy up to tyrants and dictators.' The war in Ukraine, which began in early 2022, has resulted in thousands of deaths and economic sanctions on Moscow.

**Trump suggest he'll release Epstein 'client list' if elected**
In an interview with Lex Fridman, Donald Trump suggested that he would release a list of individuals associated with Jeffrey Epstein if elected in November. Trump stated, 'I'd be inclined to do the Epstein. I'd have no problem with it.' However, there is no evidence that such a list exists. Trump also discussed UFOs, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and his views on the 2020 election, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the war in Ukraine. Trump has increasingly relied on podcasts and internet media creators as part of his 2024 campaign strategy, including recent appearances on shows hosted by Theo Von, Adin Ross, Logan Paul, and Tim Pool.

**Donald Trump Suggest He'll Release Jeffrey Epstein 'Client List' If Elected**
Former President Donald Trump suggested in an interview with Lex Fridman that he would release a list of individuals associated with Jeffrey Epstein if elected in November. Trump stated, 'I'd be inclined to do the Epstein. I'd have no problem with it.' The list, often referred to as Epstein's 'client list,' has been a topic of speculation for years, but there is no evidence that such a document exists. Trump also discussed other topics, including UFOs, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the war in Ukraine, criticizing the Biden administration's handling of the conflict. Trump has increasingly relied on podcasts and internet media creators as a key component of his 2024 campaign strategy, including a recent appearance on Lex Fridman's show and potential future appearances on Joe Rogan's podcast and other popular programs.

**Trump Claims to Have 'Precise Plan' for Ukraine, but Refuses to Disclose Details**
Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for the US presidency, revealed in a podcast that he has a 'precise plan' to end the war in Ukraine, but he refuses to disclose the details to maintain the element of 'surprise'. 'If I win, as elected president, I will ensure that an agreement is reached, it's guaranteed', Trump said. 'I have a very precise plan to stop Ukraine and Russia. And I have a certain idea - maybe not a plan, but an idea - for China', he assured during an interview with American podcast host Lex Fridman. However, Trump refused to elaborate on the details of these hypothetical plans, saying 'If I give them to you, I won't be able to use them'. He has repeatedly claimed that he would resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine 'in 24 hours', without explaining how. Trump has also been critical of the billions of dollars spent by the US to support Kiev in its war against Moscow, calling on Europe to 'step up'.

**Joe Rogan Watches On as Donald Trump Joins Yet Another JRE Rival After Facing Podcasters Rejection**
Donald Trump has been making appearances on various podcasts, including Lex Fridman's, after being rejected by Joe Rogan's JRE podcast. Trump's recent activity on social media has led to him being a popular guest on podcasts, with his last appearance being on Theo Von's 'This Past Weekend' podcast. However, Joe Rogan has stated that he is not interested in having Trump on his podcast due to his employer, Dana White, being a supporter of the 45th US president. Despite this, Rogan's podcast remains at the top of the Spotify charts, and it is unclear if his stance on Trump will change. Trump's recent failed assassination attempt has made him an even more popular figure, and it is possible that this could lead to Rogan reconsidering his stance on the ex-POTUS. As Lex Fridman said, 'having a popular figure like Donald Trump is bound to boost any podcast, given the following he has, not just as a politician but also as an entertainer in the past.'

**Democrats Left Heartbroken After DNC 'Special Guest' Turns Out to Be a Complete Bust**
The Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago on Thursday was left 'heartbroken' after a highly anticipated surprise guest failed to appear. Social media figures and establishment outlets had spread rumors that music superstars Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, as well as former President George W. Bush, would make a surprise appearance. However, none of these guests materialized, and a representative for Beyoncé confirmed that the singer 'was never scheduled to be there.' The establishment media also received criticism for spreading false information, with one CNN anchor writing that TMZ 'lost a lot of credibility tonight.' Despite the disappointment, one user described a 'collective meltdown' among hopeful viewers, and another user posted a montage of people showing disappointment or anguish. The article concludes that the Democrats made a strategic error by allowing their propagandized masses to begin questioning them.

The Democratic National Convention was left disappointed when Beyonce failed to appear ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination speech. The rumor of Beyonce's appearance had been circulating for days, with some speculating that the Democrats used her as bait to get Americans to tune into the convention. However, a spokesperson for Beyonce's team denied the rumors, and the Hollywood Reporter confirmed that there was no cameo planned. The incident sparked jokes and memes on social media, with some joking that the Democrats' special guest was actually Leon Panetta or the friends they made along the way. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney even joked that the Democrats' special guest was not him. 'Notice how they tricked you into thinking there was a special guest so you'd stick around?' asked J.P. Freire, a Republican spokesperson. 'What do you think their approach to policy will be?'

**His Socialist Podcast Became a Surprise Hit. Now He's an Uncommitted Democratic Delegate**
Daniel Denvir, host of the socialist podcast The Dig, will attend the Democratic National Convention as an alternate Rhode Island delegate for the uncommitted movement. The Dig has gained popularity by providing in-depth analysis of the US role in the Middle East, particularly on the war in Gaza. Denvir's podcast has become a crucial hub of the left media ecosystem, featuring guests such as Rashida Tlaib, Bernie Sanders, and Yanis Varoufakis. The show's focus on the war in Gaza has led to a significant increase in listenership, with October downloads up about 150% from the month prior. Denvir's aim is to 'translate the intellectual and academic left to a broader audience' and to 'map out the terrain' of the US role in the Middle East. He believes that 'everything matters' and that 'every person's important, every issue is important, everything requires care and attention, everything has a history. Everything has a struggle behind it.' The Dig's great success is in achieving a scholarly rigor that's accessible to the masses, and its guests regularly thank Denvir for his especially close reads. Denvir's visit to the DNC will bring his intensive study of the history of the Middle East to bear on the current political moment, and he will be inviting Harris delegates from across the nation to join him in calling for an arms embargo on Israel. 'We can't win social democratic reforms on the domestic front without challenging US power abroad,' Denvir says. 'We are confronting climate change, the genocide in Gaza and increasingly violent great power rivalries: we need a global program that acts in concert with progressive forces around the world.'

**Turned down Multiple Times, Donald Trump Lands on Joe Rogan's Friend's Podcast, Fans React**
Joe Rogan, a UFC commentator and podcaster, has been at the center of a controversy surrounding Donald Trump's potential appearance on his podcast, 'The Joe Rogan Experience'. Despite having the opportunity to interview Trump multiple times, Rogan has consistently declined, stating that he doesn't want to help Trump. However, a recent post by Autism Capital sparked fan curiosity, leading to speculation about why Rogan hasn't invited Trump onto his show. The situation took a turn when it was revealed that renowned scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman might interview Trump on his show instead. Fans are divided, with some expressing disappointment that Trump won't be appearing on Rogan's podcast, while others believe that Fridman is a better interviewer for Trump. One fan even suggested that Trump's absence might be due to his request for Rogan to visit his house, which Rogan deemed unacceptable for his podcast. Rogan has since clarified that he doesn't endorse presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after Trump took to social media to criticize him.
