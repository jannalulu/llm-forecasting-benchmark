**San Diego County on High Alert for Mpox Cases**
The San Diego County Health Department is on high alert for mpox cases, particularly the more lethal and contagious 'Clade 1' variant spreading rapidly in some African countries. The department recommends that doctors take a thorough travel history of anyone presenting mpox symptoms, asking about travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo or any adjacent country, or close contact with someone who has visited the region in the 21 days prior to symptom onset. 'If Clade 1 ever arrived here, which we obviously hope does not happen, we want to be prepared,' said Dr. Winston Tilghman, medical director of the Division of HIV, STD, and Hepatitis. The Clade 2, the type of mpox that caused a global outbreak in 2022, continues to appear in San Diego County, with 51 suspected or confirmed cases in 2024, a massive decrease from the 469 cases in 2022, but still significantly higher than the pre-outbreak rate of zero to one case per year. According to the county records, 76% of those who have confirmed or suspected mpox infections this year were not vaccinated. 'Not everyone who would benefit from the vaccine has received it, and that's why we've been trying to encourage people to get vaccinated or complete the two-dose series,' said Tilghman. 'While case activity is definitely low compared to what we observed in 2022, it's still higher than we'd like it to be.' Jynneos is the vaccine used to prevent mpox infection, although it was designed to combat smallpox. In 2023, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the results of a study on the efficacy of Jynneos for mpox, estimating an efficacy of 66% for two doses and nearly 36% for one dose. Dr. David 'Davey' Smith, chief of infectious diseases and global public health at UC San Diego, said in an interview earlier this month that the overall efficacy has been lower than expected. 'There are people we've vaccinated who have gotten re-infected, and that's frustrating,' said Smith. 'The vaccine we have, which is actually a smallpox vaccine, is closely related to mpox enough to generate protective antibodies, but those antibodies decrease rapidly compared to what we see with smallpox. 'Scientists are trying to figure it out, but we still don't have the answer.' In the first eight months of this year, in San Diego County, 12 people who received both doses got infected. However, Tilghman said that these 'recurrent' infections seem to produce milder symptoms than in the case of those who are not vaccinated. 'People who end up being diagnosed and who are completely vaccinated tend to have a milder disease and are less likely to have complications,' said Tilghman. According to the CDC, mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and back pain, swollen lymph nodes, chills, fatigue, and a rash that can resemble pimples or blisters, in many different places, including the chest, hands, feet, chest, face, and groin. The CDC recommends vaccination for anyone exposed to the mpox virus and for anyone who has intimate contact with multiple partners, especially in recreational settings.

**New Wayne County mpox case reported amid concern of more transmissible, severe strain**
A new case of mpox has been reported in Wayne County, Michigan, with local and state health officials confirming the infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is conducting tests to determine whether the infection is from the clade 1 variant of the virus, which appears to cause more severe illness and has a higher rate of death than the clade 2 strain. According to Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, the county health department's director and health officer, 'based on what we know so far, we suspected this is clade 2, the same clade that caused the ongoing U.S. mpox outbreak that started in 2022.' The CDC has reported that most transmission occurs from the time when a person's symptoms begin until the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed, which generally takes 2 to 4 weeks. However, the agency acknowledged that 'some people can spread mpox to others for up to four days before they have any symptoms of the virus.' The JYNNEOS vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, has been authorized to prevent smallpox and mpox, and to use after exposure to reduce the severity of the disease in people ages 18 and older. Vaccines are available at the Wayne Health Center and the Wayne County Public Health Division, and county health officials urge anyone with a new rash that they suspect might be mpox to see a health care provider right away for an evaluation and avoid close contact with others until that evaluation.

**Mpox 2024 mapped: All the countries where cases of the new strain have been confirmed**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has spread to 17,000 cases across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. A new strain, clade 1, has been identified, primarily spreading through sexual networks, and has been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Dr. Tedros, the WHO's director general, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The WHO is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of 15 million dollars. The US government has provided an additional 17 million USD to support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Department of Health Responds to Mpox Rumors: 'No Suspected or Confirmed Cases'**
The Department of Health has responded to rumors of an mpox infection in the country, stating that 'there are no suspected or confirmed cases.' According to Joris Moonens, a spokesperson for the department, 'all doctors must immediately report any suspected or confirmed mpox cases in Flanders to the Department of Health.' If a case of the new mpox variant (Clade Ib) is detected in Flanders or Belgium, the department will actively communicate this to the press. Until then, there are no likely or confirmed cases of the new mpox variant (Clade Ib) in Flanders. Moonens notes that there are many skin diseases and conditions that can cause symptoms such as rashes or blisters, which can be mistaken for mpox and lead to unfounded rumors. He also mentions that there have been sporadic cases of the mpox variant Clade IIb, which led to an outbreak in 2022 and is now under control. Moonens emphasizes that the risk of infection with mpox in the general population is 'very low' and that if cases of Clade Ib variant do occur, they are expected to be in people with a recent travel history.

**Kenya Confirms Second Case of Mpox**
Kenya has confirmed its second case of mpox, a disease previously known as monkeypox, after detecting it in a truck driver who traveled to the epicenter of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). According to the Ministry of Health, the patient presented symptoms of the disease and had a history of travel to the DRC. The patient has been isolated and is receiving treatment in the Busia county. The first case of mpox in the country was detected on July 31 in a border crossing with Uganda. Since the declaration of the first case, 28 contacts of the case have completed a 21-day follow-up period without developing symptoms and have been discharged from active surveillance, said the Ministry of Health. The Kenyan authorities stated that the healthcare facilities 'have the necessary personnel and are well-equipped to diagnose and control this disease.' They also expressed their 'deep gratitude' to all Kenyans 'for their unwavering cooperation and support in the fight against the outbreak in the country.' The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health alert on August 14 due to the rapid spread and high mortality of the new variant (clade 1b) in the African continent and a first case in Sweden of a traveler who was in an area of Africa where the virus is circulating intensely. The variant is different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions, and already led to the declaration of a global health emergency between 2022 and 2023. Twelve member states of the African Union have reported 18,910 cases of mpox and 541 deaths in 2024, although the majority of infections occur in the DRC, reported the African Union's health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Africa (CDC Africa).

**Singapore Says It Has Detected 13 Cases of Mpox Clade 2 Infection in 2024**
Singapore has detected 13 cases of mpox Clade 2 infections in 2024, according to the health ministry. All mpox infections in the city-state have been the 'less severe' Clade 2 infections. Meanwhile, Thailand confirmed an mpox case reported this week was the Clade 1b strain of the virus, the second confirmed case of the variant outside of Africa. The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. As a precaution, Singapore will screen the temperatures of travellers arriving at Changi and Seletar airports from places exposed to the risk of mpox outbreaks, starting from Friday.

**Changi, Seletar airports to screen visitors for mpox**
Starting today, temperature and visual screening will be implemented at Changi and Seletar airports for inbound travellers and crew arriving on flights from places at risk of mpox outbreaks. Similar measures will be implemented at sea checkpoints. Travellers with fever, rash, and/or symptoms compatible with mpox will be referred for medical assessment. As of August 22, 13 confirmed cases of mpox have been detected in Singapore, all of which are less severe Clade II infections. The Ministry of Health advises travellers to report mpox-related symptoms and travel history through the SG Arrival Card, and for medical practitioners to notify MOH of suspect cases. Close contacts of confirmed cases will be offered vaccination to reduce the risk of mpox infection.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of Mpox Variant Clade Ib**
Thailand's Department of Disease Control has confirmed the first case of the new mpox variant clade Ib in a 66-year-old patient who arrived from Africa on August 14. The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.

**Mpox strain in patient not confirmed yet: Thai disease control chief**
The Department of Disease Control in Thailand has not yet confirmed a report of a patient infected with a new, more severe strain of mpox. The patient, a 66-year-old European male, arrived in Thailand on August 14 and began experiencing symptoms on August 15. According to Dr. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the department's director-general, the patient has not exhibited severe symptoms, but further confirmation is being sought through RT-PCR testing. If the strain is confirmed to be clade 1b, it would be the first such infection in Thailand. Dr. Thongchai noted that the vaccine for mpox is not yet available in Thailand as it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. He stated, 'The announcement of its availability is for study purposes only.' 43 individuals who have come into contact with the patient are being tracked and monitored for 21 days.

**US Response to the Monkeypox Outbreak in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14, 2024, due to the increase in cases of monkeypox (mpox) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a growing number of countries in Africa. The US Administration has been monitoring the spread of mpox, specifically clade I, and has been working since December 2023 to prepare the nation. The risk for most people in the US from clade I of the mpox virus circulating in Central and Eastern Africa, and the number of cases associated with travel outside of Africa are very low, and at this time, there are no reported cases in the US. The US is well-prepared to detect, contain, and manage quickly cases of clade I if they occur in the country. The US continues to increase its capacity to detect cases of clade I and clade IIb of the mpox virus through existing surveillance systems, including wastewater testing, and by expanding the robust diagnostic testing capacity created during the ongoing outbreak of clade IIb, to ensure coverage for clade I. The US has distributed over 1 million doses of the mpox vaccine JYNNEOS across the country to mitigate the spread and severity of the outbreak of clade IIb. The US is also working to understand better the efficacy of existing treatments for mpox and to have treatment options available in case of reported cases of clade I in the country. The US will continue to provide information to the public on the transmission, prevention, and treatment of mpox. People who have already had mpox clade IIb or have been fully vaccinated against this disease are expected to be protected against clade I of the virus. The CDC has issued an updated health alert for healthcare professionals, public health departments, and collaborators, as well as an updated travel health notice, recommending that travelers to the DRC or neighboring countries intensify their precautions. The US is working closely with the governments of affected countries, as well as regional and global collaborators, to reduce the impact of this outbreak and safeguard public health. The US has provided an additional $20 million to support the response efforts to mpox clade I in Central and Eastern Africa, and on August 20, USAID announced additional emergency health assistance of up to $35 million to reinforce the response efforts, bringing the total proposed financial support from the US government for the DRC and other affected countries in the region to over $55 million.

**FACT SHEET: United States Response to the Clade I Mpox Outbreak in Several African Countries**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to the upsurge of clade I mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and several other African countries. The Biden-Harris Administration has established an incident response structure to ensure a coordinated response and to take a proactive approach to U.S. domestic preparedness for potential clade I mpox cases. The Administration has been working since December 2023 to prepare domestically and has distributed over one million vials of the JYNNEOS vaccine across the United States. The U.S. government has also provided an additional $55 million in financial support to DRC and other affected countries in the region. The United States is working with other countries, WHO, and international partners to encourage additional donations of vaccines and to address challenges with vaccine delivery. The Administration will continue its whole-of-government response to this growing outbreak, building on lessons learned from the 2022 mpox response. 'Those who have already had clade IIb mpox or who are fully vaccinated against it are expected to be protected against clade I mpox,' according to the CDC. 'At this time, CDC and WHO do not discourage travel to DRC or elsewhere due to the mpox outbreaks,' they added. The U.S. government support for the mpox response builds on longstanding partnerships in global health security and development with DRC and throughout Africa.

A new highly contagious and severe strain of mpox is spreading across central Africa, with over 17,000 cases reported in 2024. Although cases in the US have decreased since the 2022 outbreak, health officials are preparing for the possibility of the new strain reaching the country. According to the CDC, mpox symptoms include a facial rash that spreads to other parts of the body, and the illness lasts two to four weeks. Vaccines are available and recommended for people from higher-risk populations, with the JYNNEOS vaccine providing protection against both clade I and clade II. The vaccine is highly effective, with fully vaccinated people becoming infected in less than 1% of cases, and infections were milder compared to unvaccinated people. As of Aug. 14, Maricopa County had identified 39 cases of mpox in 2024, more than the 23 cases seen in 2023 but significantly less than the nearly 480 cases reported in 2022.

**Could The New Mpox Threat Cause Significant Harm In The US? Experts Call For Increased Vigilance**
As Mpox continues to spread globally, experts say that the Clade 1 subtype, believed to cause more serious illness, may not spread as broadly in the US or lead to severe health impacts. According to Dr. Boghuma Titanji, 'It was only a matter of time before we saw this extend beyond the African continent.' The FDA says the US is prepared to detect and manage Clade 1b Mpox cases, but experts are cautious about a new type of Mpox spreading in Africa that may cause even more serious illness. Dr. Dan Barouch notes that 'The absolute risk in the U.S. is currently low, although we need to remain vigilant.' Symptoms of Mpox include fever, headache, and rash, and can develop 3 to 21 days after exposure. The elderly, people with untreated HIV, and immunocompromised individuals may be at higher risk.

**Why we don't ‘need to be freaking out' about a new strain of mpox**
The World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency over a new strain of mpox spreading in Africa. However, Dr. David Diemert, a professor at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, does not think people in the U.S. need to be overly concerned. According to Diemert, the new strain, 'clade I,' is not transmitted through the air like COVID, but rather through close physical contact. He also stated that the virus is 'much more difficult to get than COVID,' and therefore, it is unlikely to spread as quickly. The currently offered mpox vaccine will cover the new strain, and Diemert recommends that people traveling to affected areas, especially those in high-risk populations, consider getting vaccinated. Additionally, a version of the virus that arrived in the U.S. in 2022 continues to show up in patients around the nation.

**Should you be concerned about an Mpox outbreak in the US?**
The World Health Organization has declared Mpox, a viral disease, an international public health emergency due to the spread of the clade I strain in central and eastern Africa. The clade I strain is more transmissible and severe than the clade II strain responsible for the 2022 outbreak. According to Neil Maniar, director of Northeastern University's master of public health in urban health program, there is a 'solid likelihood' that clade I Mpox will spread to the US, but the likelihood of it becoming a pandemic like COVID-19 is 'very, very low.' Maniar emphasizes that the public should not panic, but rather, health care practitioners and public health practitioners should be concerned and take steps to limit the spread. The CDC has stated that the Jynneos vaccine, used to protect against clade II, would still protect against the clade I strain. Maniar advises people to wash their hands regularly, be aware of symptoms, and seek medical attention if they suspect they have Mpox or have been in contact with someone who has Mpox.

**Mpox Is ‘Not the New COVID,' WHO Official Says. Risk to U.S. Remains Low**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global public health emergency due to the growing mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and surrounding African countries. The new strain of the virus, clade 1b, is highly transmissible and has a higher fatality rate than the previous outbreak in 2022. However, the risk to the U.S. remains low, with no cases reported and the CDC maintaining a low risk assessment. WHO's European regional director Hans Kluge said, 'mpox is not the new COVID,' and that the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether are known. People considered at high risk for mpox infection should receive the Jynneos vaccine, which is effective against all clades of the mpox virus. The current outbreak is affecting a lot of children due to routine contact spreading the virus, and experts say it's unlikely to spread to the U.S. due to a lack of direct flights from the U.S. to the DRC and neighboring African countries.

**Mpox Outbreak: First Case Detected in Sweden, Risk in France Considered Low**
Although no cases of Mpox have been reported in France, the country is expected to see several cases in the coming weeks. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on August 14, 2024, due to the emergence of a new variant of the virus, the clade 1b, which is more deadly and transmissible. A first case of Mpox has been detected in Sweden, which may indicate the appearance of other cases in Europe in the coming weeks. The situation is more alarming in Africa, with 18,737 suspected cases and 500 deaths since the beginning of the year. The Democratic Republic of Congo has been particularly affected. According to Santé publique France, 'the risk of infection by a Mpox virus of clade I for the European population is considered to be low by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) at this time.' However, it is likely that cases will be reported in France, for which the health authorities will implement adapted measures for management. 'The authorities have a strategy for responding to an Mpox epidemic, in terms of surveillance, prevention, rapid diagnosis, care for cases and contacts, and vaccination. This response relies on a sensitization of the most at-risk populations, a reactive and preventive vaccination strategy for these populations, and rapid diagnostic means on the entire territory. This strategy is currently being re-evaluated in conjunction with health agencies to ensure it is fully effective against the clade I.'

**Chile Prepares for Monkeypox Outbreak, Emphasizes Vaccination and Prevention**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Mpox virus, also known as monkeypox, as an international health emergency after a meeting of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee. Although not an unknown disease, the new variant has caused alarm as it seems to spread more easily among people. The current variant, clade I MPXV, is more virulent than the clade II (West Africa) and has a higher mortality rate. However, Chile has not confirmed the new variant, but has detected sporadic cases related to travel or contact with people who have traveled. According to Christian García, head of epidemiology at the Ministry of Health, 'we are constantly monitoring the international situation, both in Africa and in Europe.' Chile is prepared to face the arrival of the new variant, having strengthened its surveillance network, diagnostic capacity, and exported vaccines in 2022. The groups that can access the vaccines are users of PrEP, people who have had contact with someone with monkeypox, sex workers, HIV patients, patients with a sexually transmitted infection in the last year, and men who have sex with other men, regardless of age, sexual orientation, or gender identity. The vaccination schedule is two doses, to be administered 28 days apart, preferably in the same place. The vaccine's effectiveness is 99.8%, based on the production of antibodies achieved two weeks after the second dose. Inmunologist Alexis Kalergis emphasizes the importance of reinforcing the vaccination campaign and conducting communication campaigns to implement preventive measures that reduce the risk of contagion. 'Our country also has the methods for detecting this virus, which causes a notifiable disease. Having protocols for tracing will allow us to detect early if there is an increase in cases that requires applying additional measures to protect the population.'

**US Experts Cautiously Optimistic About mpox Clade I Spread**
As concerns grow about a type of mpox spreading in Africa that is believed to cause more severe illnesses, experts have expressed cautious optimism that this branch of the virus will not spread widely in the US or cause significant health impacts. This variant, known as Clade I, led the World Health Organization (WHO) to reclassify mpox as a public health emergency of international concern. Recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its spread to Sweden highlight the need for vigilance. Dr. Boghuma Titanji, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University, commented on the expected spread beyond Africa, saying, 'It was only a matter of time before this spread beyond the African continent.' Meanwhile, in the US, no cases of Clade I have been reported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Several factors may reduce the risk of mpox Clade I spreading widely in the US, including immune defenses from previous vaccinations and infections, as well as better access to healthcare and living standards. Additionally, unlike Africa, where wild animals serve as reservoirs, the US does not have known animal vectors carrying mpox. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has adjusted the risk level for Clade I in Europe from 'very low' to 'low', notes Dr. Pamela Rendi-Wagner, director of the agency. This change reflects the close ties between Europe and Africa, increasing the likelihood of imported cases. Clade I is considered more transmissible and severe than Clade II, which caused the global mpox outbreak that peaked in August 2022. However, experts like Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA, emphasize understanding the risks of Clade I within its context. She noted, 'The data on severity, mortality associated - all that is scarce. There are many questions about the population it's spreading in, its immune response, the transmission route, and the infectious dose.' Recent NIH findings show disparate results for the antiviral TPOXX, which did not significantly reduce the duration of symptoms of Clade I in a trial conducted in the DRC, but did correlate with lower mortality. This suggests that better medical care could reduce mpox mortality. Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, of the CDC, highlighted that the advanced US healthcare system could help reduce deaths. Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Harvard, recognized the low current risk, but urged continued vigilance. He warned, 'The absolute risk in the US is currently low, although we must remain vigilant.' The CDC's proactive measures, including the strategic use of the Jynneos vaccine, appear promising. It is expected that the two doses of the vaccine will protect against Clades I and II.

**88 Mpox cases in Indonesia**
Indonesia has recorded at least 88 cases of Mpox, with Jakarta province being the hardest hit, according to the Health Ministry. Acting director-general of disease prevention and control Dr Yudhi Pramono stated that 87 cases have recovered, with the peak of confirmed Mpox cases occurring in October 2023. The Clade IIb variant, which has a lower fatality rate and is mainly spread through sexual contact, was implicated in 54 of the cases, as Dr Pramono noted in a statement on Monday.

**Health officials confirm last week's mpox case not a new variant**
Health officials in Pakistan have confirmed that the mpox case announced last week was not the new Clade 1b strain spreading through Africa. According to the health ministry, the virus has been classified as Clade 2b, which was primarily associated with mpox infections that surged worldwide in May 2022, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men. The World Health Organization declared the rapid spread of the new Clade 1b strain in Africa a public health emergency of international concern last week. As of now, there have been no reported cases of Clade 1b in Pakistan, and the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is primarily associated with Clade 1b.

**Europe Prepares for Mpox Outbreak**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has warned that European countries should prepare for an increase in mpox cases. According to the ECDC, 'the probability of infection for people from Europe traveling to affected areas and having close contact with affected communities is high.' The agency estimates that it is 'very likely' that European countries will see an increase in imported cases of clade 1, which is currently circulating in Africa. The ECDC recommends that health authorities maintain a high level of planning and preparation to enable rapid detection and response to new cases. The World Health Organization has also warned that European countries can expect to see more imported cases in the coming days. Since January 2022, 38,465 mpox cases have been reported in 16 African countries, resulting in 1,456 deaths.

**Could the new mpox threat cause significant harm in the U.S.?**
The World Health Organization has reinstated mpox as a public health emergency of international concern due to a large ongoing outbreak of clade I in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While experts are cautious about the potential spread of clade I in the U.S., they believe that several factors, including immunity from vaccination and previous infection, lack of viral circulation in wild animals, and better healthcare access, will mitigate the risk. Dr. Boghuma Titanji said, 'It was only a matter of time before we saw this extend beyond the African continent.' The CDC has confirmed no reported cases of clade I in the U.S. to date, but experts warn that the absolute risk is currently low and that vigilance is necessary. Dr. Jennifer McQuiston said, 'We are more worried about clade I than we are about clade II.' The CDC continues to urge men with multiple male partners to receive both Jynneos doses, and only an estimated 1 in 4 of those considered at significant risk of mpox in the U.S. have been fully vaccinated.

**Mexico Confirms 49 Cases of Mpox, 212 Probable Cases**
According to the Mexican Ministry of Health, there have been 49 confirmed cases of Mpox (also known as monkeypox or smallpox) in 11 states of Mexico from January to August 3, 2024. Additionally, there are 212 probable cases of the virus. The National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (CONAVE) has published an epidemiological alert regarding Mpox. The alert aims to have medical units across the country monitor and report probable cases to reduce the spread of the virus and provide timely medical attention to those affected. Mexico has a system for monitoring Mpox, which allows for the notification of probable cases through the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. The clade II is the only one detected in all analyzed cases in Mexico so far. The new variant clade 1b has not been identified in the country. The Ministry of Health has a plan in place to address Mpox, which includes national response coordination, community involvement, diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, comprehensive care, and risk communication. The plan is updated according to the current requirements of the International Public Health Emergency of International Concern (ESPII). The Ministry recommends that the general population take precautions such as frequent handwashing, covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoiding sharing food, drinks, utensils, and plates, and wearing medical masks. They also recommend washing and disinfecting clothing, towels, utensils, and bedding that have come into contact with an infected person, and avoiding contact with lesions and other people if symptoms are present.

**Mpox is a global emergency, WHO says. Is it spreading the US?**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global health emergency due to its rapid spread in parts of Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where over 96% of cases and deaths have occurred. The new strain of mpox (clade I) is more serious than the previous one (clade II), spreading more easily and potentially killing up to 10% of those infected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of clade I mpox coming to the US is 'very low,' and the country is well-prepared to combat its spread, with a vaccine that works. The CDC recommends that anyone eligible for the vaccine get it now, as it provides protection against clade I mpox. Meanwhile, clade II mpox is still spreading in the US in small clusters, with case counts remaining stable at around 250 per month.

**France Reports No Cases of New Mpox Variant, but Risk of Infection Remains**
According to the French Ministry of Health, there have been 'no cases of contamination by the clade I' of the mpox virus in France as of now. Since the 2022 outbreak, the clade 2 has been circulating at a low level, with a monthly number of cases ranging from 12 to 26 between January and June 2024. The cases reported are mostly mild and no deaths have been reported. The Ministry adds that the national reference center is mobilized to analyze the type of strains in people diagnosed with mpox. The Ministry of Health states that 'the State has, since the 2022 outbreak (circulation of active clade II), an effective response strategy against mpox, in terms of prevention, rapid diagnosis, case and contact management, and vaccination.' The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) considers the risk of infection in Europe to be 'low' at this time, but 'it is probable that cases will be declared in France.' A case of the new variant of mpox has been reported in Sweden, outside of the African continent.

**Pakistan admits it cannot find mpox patient as tighter screening to be introduced at airports**
Pakistan has confirmed a single case of mpox, a viral infection, in the northern Khyber Pakhtunkwa province. The patient, who recently returned from a Gulf country, is suspected to have gone into hiding after providing samples for tests. The health ministry is carrying out contact tracing and strengthening airport screening to prevent further spread. The new strain, clade 1b, is said to cause milder symptoms with lesions on the genitals, making it harder to spot and more likely for people to infect others without knowing they're infected. According to pox researcher Jonas Albarnaz, 'clade 1b is concerning for two main reasons: it's the first clade 1 mpox virus case outside Africa, and it's associated with a more severe disease and higher mortality rates than the clade 2 virus responsible for the international mpox outbreak in 2022.'

**Mpox 2024 mapped: All the countries where cases of the new strain have been confirmed**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has spread to 17,000 cases across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. A new strain, clade 1, has been identified, primarily spreading through sexual networks, and has been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Dr. Tedros, the WHO's director general, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The WHO is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of 15 million dollars. The US government has provided an additional 17 million USD to support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**Will America Need Mpox Vaccine Boosters? Here's the Score**
The World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency due to a new, potentially deadlier strain of the mpox virus in Africa. The first case of this new variant was detected outside the continent in Sweden. Experts believe that existing mpox vaccines, such as MVA-BN and LC16, should be 'equally effective' against both clade II and clade I viruses, including the clade Ib variant. However, booster doses are not currently recommended, except for people with occupational exposures. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says that the risk to the general American public remains low, but experts warn that infections and outbreaks can quickly spread to the U.S. from other countries. A coordinated global effort to contain mpox spread in Africa may prevent another international outbreak like the one in 2022.

**Mpox found in San Francisco wastewater not related to new outbreak, public health officials say**
San Francisco public health officials have stated that the recent detection of trace levels of mpox in wastewater is unrelated to the new outbreak in Africa that prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency. The detected mpox is from Clade II, a type of genetic grouping of viruses that caused a global health emergency from July 2022 to May 2023. In contrast, the current outbreak in Africa is caused by Clade I, which is more severe and has been spreading rapidly. According to the California Department of Public Health, mpox cases in California have been increasing, with 54 cases reported since June 1, but this is significantly lower than the 2022 outbreak. San Francisco officials stated that mpox detections in the city's wastewater are 'significantly below levels seen during the 2022 outbreak.' As of Friday, no instances of Clade I mpox have been reported in the United States. Health officials continue to recommend a two-dose mpox vaccine for certain groups, including those with HIV and men, trans people, and nonbinary people who have sex with men, trans people, or nonbinary people.

**EU Raises Alert Level for Mpox as New Strain Spreads**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) raised its risk level for mpox on Friday, a day after global health officials confirmed the first infection with a new strain of the virus outside of Africa, in Sweden. The ECDC director said there will be more imported cases of the new mpox strain in Europe in the coming weeks, although the risk of sustained transmission remains low. The World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency on Wednesday, its highest level of alert, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighboring countries. The WHO plans to hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss ways to ensure fair global access to tests, treatments, and vaccines for the virus, said a senior official. Mpox, a viral infection that causes painful lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is usually mild but can be fatal. In the Congo, two strains are spreading: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new variant called clade Ib. On Friday, the ECDC raised its evaluation of the risk level of mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases in the EU, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. The agency said the general risk to the population had increased from 'very low' to 'low'. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said its director, Pamela Rendi Wagner. Pakistan also confirmed a case of the virus on Friday in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, although it was unclear whether it was the new variant or the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022. Mpox is transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as COVID-19, there is no evidence that it spreads easily through the air. 'We are seeing a significant increase in cases in Europe, and we are concerned about the potential for further spread,' said Wagner. 'It is essential that we take a proactive approach to prevent the spread of mpox and protect the most vulnerable populations.'

**Europe Raises Alert Level for Mpox After Case Detected in Sweden**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk level for mpox, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a case of infection with the new strain of the virus in Sweden, the first outside of Africa. The director of the ECDC said that there will be more imported cases of the new strain of mpox in Europe in the coming weeks, although the risk of sustained transmission remains low. The WHO declared on Wednesday that mpox is a global health emergency, its highest level of alert, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to neighboring countries. Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is usually mild but can be fatal. Two strains are now spreading in the Congo: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new branch called clade Ib. The ECDC raised its risk level for mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases appearing in the bloc, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said ECDC director Pamela Rendi Wagner. Pakistan also confirmed a case of the virus mpox in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, although it was unclear whether it was the new variant or the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022. WHO official Margaret Harris said in a press conference on Friday that she expects more cases outside of Africa soon, also due to increased surveillance. However, the WHO discouraged any travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Mpox, Explained: What To Know About Variants, Vaccines And Outbreaks**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency. The Philippines has reported its first case of mpox this year, and Pakistan has confirmed at least one case. Sweden has become the first country outside of Africa to report an mpox infection caused by the clade I variant. The WHO has confirmed 2,863 mpox cases and 517 deaths in 2024, with most cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The preferred vaccine among health officials is Bavarian Nordic's two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, which has a more favorable risk profile. The WHO recommends vaccination for at-risk groups, including gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and laboratory or healthcare workers. The clade II variant that drove the 2022 mpox outbreak is still circulating, and officials monitor its movements closely. 'We encourage all countries to enhance surveillance, share data, and work to better understand the transmission; share tools like vaccines; and apply lessons learned from prior public health emergencies of international concern in addressing the current outbreak,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

**New Mpox Variant Emerges in Congo, Raises Concerns for Global Health**
The Mpox virus, which retreated to Africa after the 2022 pandemic, has not finished evolving and spreading. In 2023, over 15,000 confirmed or suspected cases of infection were reported by several African countries, an increase from previous years. In 2024, African countries have already reported more confirmed and suspected Mpox infections than in all of 2023: 17,500 as of the beginning of the year, concentrated mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Children are particularly vulnerable: about two-thirds of infections in Congo involve people under the age of 15. Some of these infections have been linked to a strain called clade II, which caused the 2022 epidemic; however, in recent months, an increasing percentage of reported infections has been attributed to a strain called clade I. Researchers who analyzed samples collected between the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024 in a mining region and very poor area of the Congo, where a particularly sustained recrudescence is underway, have found a new variant of clade I. This variant is likely already transmissible from person to person, having thus overcome the stage of zoonosis: the main trace of this transmission, namely an accentuated mutation of the viral genome due to the action of a particular human enzyme that attacks the virus, has been found at a very high frequency in the new virus, so that human-to-human transmission must already be sustained, in line with the rapid growth of the number of cases. Now, the lethality measured so far on the cases confirmed of Mpox virus of clade I is much higher than that of clade II, the virus of 2022. In the case of the new virus Ib, the lethality measured on the confirmed cases is 3.4%, but it must be considered that the sample of subjects examined in the published works is limited, and above all that lethality does not depend only on the intrinsic capabilities of the virus, but also on the general health and healthcare conditions of the patients, which are particularly precarious in the region of the Congo most affected. Moreover, the mechanical reason for the higher lethality of viruses of clade I compared to those of clade II is not known, so it is necessary to wait for better data and studies in this regard. 'The new virus has already spread quickly, with the first case outside the continent identified in Sweden; given that it is a virus capable of causing severe pathology and potentially high lethality, the WHO has sounded the alarm, in order to activate all the bureaucratic procedures to contain the emergence of a possible pandemic, just like in 2022. This has already allowed millions of dollars to be allocated to the new emergency, both for monitoring and for preparing vaccine stocks. Although it has not yet been determined whether the available vaccines are effective against the new variant, it is expected that they will work, and since 2022 companies such as Moderna have been preparing new RNA vaccines, which can be adapted more quickly to any new variant. What is needed now are data: on the mechanism and efficiency of virus propagation, on the effectiveness of old and new vaccines, on the clinic and diagnostics. Above all, a new mentality is needed: other viruses will arrive, and this is just one of the new packages of genetic information parasite that evolution has in store for us. Today we can identify them in time, read their genome, copy the product of their evolution and thus obtain vaccines (and soon drugs) based on RNA, able to pursue evolution at its own speed.'

**Yale School of Medicine professor available to dis**
Richard Martinello, MD, a Professor of Medicine (Infectious Diseases) at Yale School of Medicine, is available to discuss the current mpox outbreak. Dr. Martinello notes that mpox can spread beyond endemic countries, citing the 'clade I' variant, which tends to cause more severe infections compared to 'clade II' mpox. He emphasizes that there is currently low mpox circulation in the US, but warns that this could quickly change, as it did in 2022. Dr. Martinello also states that transmission of mpox requires close skin-to-skin contact, alleviating concerns about public transportation use. 'From experiences in 2022, it has become clear that mpox can spread well beyond these countries where mpox is endemic,' Dr. Martinello said. 'This could quickly change as it did in 2022, so it is important for people to be aware,' he says. 'Transmission of mpox does seem to require close skin-to-skin contact, so this is not a situation where persons need to change how they use, for example, public transportation.'

**'Only a matter of time' before fast-spreading mpox strain arrives in Canada: doctors**
Canadian experts, including Dr. Fahad Razak and Dr. Allison McGeer, warn that it's 'only a matter of time' before the fast-spreading mpox strain, clade I, arrives in Canada. Razak notes that Canada's high travel volume makes it a likely candidate for the spread of the disease. Clade I mpox appears to be more transmissible and severe than the clade II variant that caused an epidemic in Canada in 2022. Razak believes that mpox may not spread as easily as COVID-19, allowing for easier containment. However, McGeer cautions that more research is needed to understand the epidemiology of clade I mpox before predicting its spread in Canada. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and has stated that there have been no cases of clade I mpox in the country so far. The agency is also encouraging eligible individuals to get vaccinated against mpox, particularly men who have sex with men and individuals who engage in sex work.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden Confirms First Case Of Deadly Clade I Variant Of Mpox Strain Circulating In Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the contagious mpox strain, originating from central and eastern Africa. This marks the first known infection of this strain outside the African continent. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency, and authorities are closely monitoring the situation to prevent further transmission and ensure public health safety. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.' The WHO has reported a concerning rise in Mpox cases in Africa this year, with over 14,000 cases and 524 fatalities. The international vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on sending vaccines to affected countries in Africa, but there may be a delay due to WHO approval. Health experts warn that clade 1 and its variant, clade 1b, can lead to more severe symptoms than clade 2.

**WHO confirms 1st case of new mpox strain outside Africa as outbreak spreads**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first case of a new mpox strain outside of Africa, in Sweden. The person was infected with the clade Ib type of mpox while in Africa and is receiving treatment. Public health experts warn that this could lead to rapid international spread of the disease. According to the WHO, there have been 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the outbreak began in January 2023. The global vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on getting shots to countries affected by the outbreak. The US and Canadian officials have not identified any cases so far, but the CDC is watching the outbreak closely. Dr. Brian Ferguson said, 'There will likely be more here and in other parts of the world as there are currently no mechanisms in place to stop imported cases of mpox happening.' Lawrence Gostin added, 'The emergence of a case on the European continent could spur rapid international spread of mpox.'

**Pakistan confirms first mpox case of 2024, infected person came from Saudi Arabia**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of mpox in 2024, a Pakistani national who recently returned from Saudi Arabia. According to Geo News, the infected person is from the city of Dir and is currently residing in Mardan. The health ministry has collected samples from people who came into contact with the affected man and has ordered strict monitoring of all entry points. This is not the first time Pakistan has dealt with mpox, with nine cases reported last year among travelers returning from the Middle East and other countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared mpox an international public health emergency, with 99,176 laboratory-confirmed cases reported globally from January 2022 to June 2024. Sweden has also confirmed its first case of the more dangerous variant of mpox, which was contracted during a stay in Africa. 'A person who sought care in Stockholm has been diagnosed with mpox caused by the clade I variant,' said the Swedish public health agency.

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Mpox 2024 mapped: Find out how many cases have been confirmed around the world**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has seen over 17,000 cases confirmed across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. The emergence of a new strain, clade 1b, is spreading mainly through sexual networks and has been identified in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The organisation is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of $15 million. The US government has stated the risk to the general public is 'very low', with no cases of clade I reported, but has provided $17 million to support mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**Mpox outbreak in Africa: Immediate risk to Singapore is low, says Health Ministry**
Singapore's Health Ministry has stated that the immediate public health risk from the mpox outbreak in Africa is low. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), all mpox infections detected in Singapore have been the milder Clade II infections, mostly during the 2022-2023 global outbreak. As of July 27, there were 10 mpox cases in Singapore, and 32 cases in 2023. The World Health Organization has declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years. MOH has informed medical practitioners and healthcare institutions to be vigilant in detecting and reporting all mpox cases, including those suspected of Clade I infections. Travellers are required to report mpox-related symptoms and travel history through the SG Arrival Card for early detection. Suspected Clade I cases will be isolated in hospitals, and close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined and monitored for up to 21 days.
