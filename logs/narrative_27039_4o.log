A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, sipping coffee and discussing the recent news.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, Sheikh Hasina didn’t get asylum in the UK after all. Our models had it at 15.30%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Right. The political climate and asylum statistics were against her. The refusal rates were a major factor.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
She arrived in India first, but the UK was always a long shot. The protests and accusations back home didn’t help her case.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sipping coffee)  
It’s interesting how predictable these outcomes can be, even with all the chaos.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
Our models never lie. If it was meant to happen, we’d have seen it coming.

They all chuckle, understanding the weight of their accuracy.

**FADE OUT.**

*Superforecasters gather around a table, newspapers spread out before them. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, it’s official. Sheikh Hasina has been granted asylum in the UK.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 85.75%. Given the political climate and her swift move to India, it was a strong possibility.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Right. The unrest in Bangladesh and her immediate travel plans were key indicators. Plus, the UK’s recent asylum trends favored her case.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4:** And yet, there was still room for doubt. The asylum refusal rate isn’t negligible.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** True, but the urgency and international implications likely played a part in the decision.

*They sip their coffees, nodding in agreement, as the bustling city continues outside.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Another chapter in global politics. Let’s see what unfolds next.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, confident)  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Given the political unrest and her abrupt resignation, asylum was almost inevitable.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Exactly. The UK's historical asylum acceptance rates, especially in politically charged cases, bolstered our confidence.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(pointing to the screen)  
And her swift move to the UK after India? It was a clear signal. Our data showed a strong likelihood of her seeking refuge there.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**

The models never lie. With the appeals process and her political stature, the odds were always in her favor.

They exchange knowing glances, satisfied with their foresight.
