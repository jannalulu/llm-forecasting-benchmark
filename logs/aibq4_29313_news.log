**2024 US Presidential Election: How the Electoral College Works**
The 2024 US presidential election is a closely contested race between incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, and former President Donald Trump, a Republican. The election is scheduled to take place on November 5, 2024. To win, a candidate must receive at least 270 electoral votes, which is more than 50% of the total 538 electoral votes. The electoral votes are determined by the number of members each state has in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The candidate who wins the most popular votes in a state does not necessarily win all of that state's electoral votes. In fact, there have been instances where the winner of the popular vote did not win the presidency. The Electoral College is a group of 538 electors, each representing a state, who will cast their votes for president and vice president. The electors are usually chosen by the state parties and are expected to vote for the candidate who won the most popular votes in their state. However, there have been instances where electors have voted against the popular vote winner. The 2024 election is expected to be a close contest, with several battleground states, including North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, and Nevada, being closely watched. If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives will choose the president from the top three candidates. The president-elect will be sworn in on January 20, 2025.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Trump and Harris in a Close Contest**
The 2024 US presidential election is scheduled to take place on November 5, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris as the main contenders. The election will determine the next president of the United States, who will serve a four-year term starting from January 20, 2025. Eight candidates are running for the presidency, including Trump and Harris, as well as Jill Stein from the Green Party, Cornel West from the Justice Party, Chesa Boudin from the Libertarian Party, and others. The election will be held in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, at least 270, will be elected president. The election will also be influenced by the swing states, which are states that are considered to be up for grabs and can go either way. The swing states in this election are Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes in these states will likely win the election. The election will be held on November 5, and the results will be announced on the same day. However, the electoral college will meet in December to officially count the votes and declare the winner. The president-elect will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. 'The election will be a close contest between Trump and Harris, and the outcome is uncertain,' said an expert. 'The swing states will play a crucial role in determining the winner.'

**Seven States to Decide the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, and the focus is on seven key states that could decide the outcome. Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Nevada are the states where neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have a guaranteed victory. According to the article, 'the number of votes needed to win is 270, and all the options seem to reduce to these seven states.' The article also mentions that 'the three states in the Midwest have historically had the same voting patterns, and have chosen the same candidate in the last eight elections.' However, this pattern was broken in 2016 when Donald Trump won, and Joe Biden recovered in 2020. The article states that 'if Harris wins in these swing states, but loses in the other four, it could lead to a tie in the electoral college.' The tie could be broken by the two chambers of Congress, which would meet in a special session on January 6 to elect the president. The article concludes that 'it's impossible to predict the outcome of the election, which is expected to be one of the closest in US history.'

**Same poll taken one month apart shows which presidential candidate has momentum in key states**
New polls in three crucial battleground states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, indicate that former President Trump is making gains, but remains in a toss-up race with Vice President Kamala Harris. According to Quinnipiac University surveys, Harris holds a 49% to 46% advantage over Trump in Pennsylvania, but Trump edges the vice president 50% to 47% in Michigan and 48% to 46% in Wisconsin. Harris' three-point edge in Pennsylvania is down from a six-point lead in Quinnipiac's previous survey from a month ago. 'That was then, this is now. The Harris post-debate starburst dims to a glow as Harris enters the last weeks slipping slightly in the Rust Belt,' Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. The results in these states, along with Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada, will likely determine if Trump or Harris wins the 2024 presidential election.

**US Election 2024: Which are the battleground states that could decide the contest?**
The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be one of the most closely contested in modern American history, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump vying for the top spot. The election will be decided by a small fraction of the nearly 240 million eligible voters, with the key battleground states holding a total of 93 Electoral College votes. These states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania is the most crucial state, with 19 Electoral College votes at stake, and has become one of the tightest contests in recent years. Harris has focused on addressing the state's economic issues, including investing $100 billion in manufacturing, while Trump has appealed to rural white voters and warned of the impact of migration on small towns. In Georgia, Harris hopes to claim the African-American constituency, which played a crucial role in Joe Biden's 2020 victory. Trump has been indicted for alleged election interference in the state, but the case has been delayed until after the 2024 election. In North Carolina, Harris is hopeful about the state's potential, with a population exceeding 10 million and becoming increasingly diverse. Trump won the state in 2020, but his margin was narrow, and the Democrats are hoping to flip it. Michigan has selected the winning presidential candidate in the last two elections, but has become a centre point for a nationwide backlash against the president's support for Israel during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Harris has adopted a firmer stance on Israel, and some protesters advocating for Gaza have expressed hopes that she will show more understanding of their situation. Arizona has become a crucial point in the nation's immigration debate, with Trump banking on frustrations with the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies to swing the state back in his favour. Harris has pledged to tighten migration controls and to revive last year's bipartisan border bill. Wisconsin has chosen the winning presidential candidate in both 2016 and 2020, with margins of just over 20,000 votes each time. Analysts believe that third-party candidates could influence the outcome in marginal states like this. Nevada has not voted for a Republican since 2004, but there are signs that the Republicans may be on the verge of a comeback. Encouraged by Trump's appeal to Hispanic voters, the Republicans believe they can turn the tide. Harris has actively promoted her economic plans aimed at supporting small businesses and addressing inflation, and has erased Trump's earlier advantage in this western state.

**ChatGPT Predicts 2024 US Presidential Election Outcome**
ChatGPT was asked by Newsweek to predict the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. ChatGPT identified 'diverse appeal', 'leadership experience', 'progressive focus', and 'campaign skills' as Harris' key strengths. However, it also noted 'perception of ineffectiveness', 'polarizing image', and 'lack of broad enthusiasm' as her weaknesses. On the other hand, ChatGPT listed 'strong base', 'populist message', 'notion of campaign', and 'economic record' as Trump's main attributes. But it also pointed out 'polarization', 'legal issues', 'fatigue factor', and 'demographics' as his vulnerabilities. ChatGPT predicted that Harris would win in Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin, while Trump would win in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. Harris would also win in Pennsylvania. ChatGPT concluded that Trump would need to recapture some of the swing states he lost in 2020, while Harris would aim to defend the 'blue wall' in the Midwest.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Trump Gains Ground in Key States**
The latest national polls for the 2024 US presidential election confirm the trend of Kamala Harris being in a slight lead, with a maximum 3% margin, over her rival Donald Trump. According to the FiveThirtyEight website, Harris is at 48% while Trump is at 46.7%. However, the election will not be decided by the total number of preferences, but by the ability of the candidates to win as many 'populous' states as possible to secure the specific Electoral College votes. Currently, Harris has 225 potential Electoral College votes, while Trump has 219. The remaining 93 Electoral College votes are from the 7 'swing states' where the results of the election will likely be decided. These states are Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. The latest polls show a slight advantage for the Republicans in these states, with Trump leading in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, and Harris leading only in Michigan. The Democrats are struggling to maintain their dominance in the 'Blue Wall' states, which have historically voted for Democratic candidates. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan were won by Trump in 2016, breaking the 'Blue Wall', and are now considered swing states. The polls show Harris leading only in Michigan, while Trump is ahead in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

**Will the 'Blue Wall' of the Great Lakes Resist in the 2024 US Presidential Election?**
The 'blue wall' of the Great Lakes region, which has traditionally voted Democratic, is under threat in the 2024 US presidential election. Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, has 225 electoral votes in her bag, but needs to win several key states to secure the presidency. Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, has 219 electoral votes and must win Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin to win the election. Polls suggest a tight race, with infinitesimal differences between the two candidates. Democrats are concerned about the Trump temptation among African-Americans, particularly in Michigan, where a few tens of thousands of voters of Arab-Muslim origin could be missed due to the Biden administration's support for Israel. Tad Devine, Democratic electoral strategist, notes that the states are historically linked and have always voted in unison, but Matt Barreto, political scientist and pollster, believes that the election will be decided by a few thousand votes. 'Democrats are in trouble, and there’s nothing solid about this blue wall right now,' says Brian Schimming, chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin.

**7 States to Decide the Outcome of the US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be decided in a few key states, similar to 2020. Seven states are considered crucial in determining the winner: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Florida. These states have a history of close elections, with some switching between Democratic and Republican candidates. The campaigns are focusing on these battleground states, where the candidates are trying to win over voters. Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin have been closely contested in recent elections, with the winner often decided by a narrow margin. Georgia and North Carolina have also been key states, with Georgia voting for a Republican in 2020 and North Carolina voting for a Democrat. Arizona, which voted for a Democrat in 2020, is also considered a crucial state. As one article noted, 'The outcome of the election will be decided in these seven states.'

**Key Battleground States in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with key battleground states deciding the outcome. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have focused their campaigns on a handful of states, where they are trying to win over voters. Here's what you need to know about those states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In Arizona, Latino voters and independent voters in Maricopa County will be crucial in deciding the state's outcome. In Georgia, the suburbs around Atlanta will be key, as they voted for President Joe Biden in 2020. In Michigan, Harris may struggle to match Biden's performance among union voters and Muslim and Arab-American communities, who are unhappy with the administration's response to the Israel-Gaza war. Trump has made appeals to black and Latino men. In Nevada, Republicans may break their losing streak, as the state moved to the right in 2020. In North Carolina, both Harris and Trump are in a tight spot, as the state is divided and has been won by Republicans in recent elections. In Pennsylvania, the state's 19 electoral votes are crucial, and both Harris and Trump have made them a central part of their campaigns. In Wisconsin, the state has been decided by less than a point in four of the last six presidential elections, and Harris and Trump are ready for a photo finish once again.

**The seven states that will decide the US presidency**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close contest. Seven key states will decide the outcome: Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Each state has a unique dynamic, with Trump and Harris campaigning on different issues. In Pennsylvania, Trump is courting rural white voters, while Harris is touting infrastructure wins and manufacturing investments. In Georgia, Trump's indictment on election interference charges has been paused until after the election. In North Carolina, a scandal involving the Republican gubernatorial candidate could impact the vote. In Michigan, Harris risks losing the support of the Arab-American community. In Arizona, Trump hopes to capitalize on frustrations over immigration policy. In Wisconsin, Trump considers the state winnable, while Harris has made the race a nailbiter. In Nevada, Trump's lead has been erased by Harris's economic plans. 'It's a toss-up within the margin of error' in all seven states, according to the article. 'Every one is a battleground,' said Harris, who believes she can win over minority voters in Georgia and North Carolina. Trump, on the other hand, is warning that migrants are overwhelming small towns in Pennsylvania and Arizona. 'We need to find a way to stop this,' he said. 'It's a disaster.'

**Nate Silver predicts path for Kamala Harris to "probably" win election**
Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight, has created a presidential model predicting various outcomes of the 2024 election. In a post on his Substack blog, Silver wrote, 'If Harris wins the three Blue Wall States, she probably (although not certainly) wins.' The Blue Wall states include Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which Trump won in 2016 but lost to President Joe Biden in 2020. Silver's model gives Harris a 56 percent chance of winning Michigan, a 46 percent chance of winning Pennsylvania, and a 53 percent chance of winning Wisconsin. As of Sunday, Harris has a 0.7-point lead over Trump in Michigan, a 0.3-point lead in Pennsylvania, and a 0.5-point lead in Wisconsin. Silver's model has Harris leading Trump nationally by 1.2 points, while FiveThirtyEight has the vice president ahead with 48 percent of the vote compared to Trump's 46.7 percent.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Trump and Harris Neck and Neck in Popular Vote**
The US presidential election 2024 is just two weeks away, and the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is neck and neck, with both candidates at 48% in the popular vote. According to The New York Times, the poll results are not as encouraging for Kamala Harris, as millions of people have already cast their votes across the US. The election is scheduled to take place on November 5, with Trump seeking his second term as president and Harris aiming to become the first female president of the US. In recent elections, Democrats have gained a lead in the popular vote, but have lost in the electoral college and the White House. The New York Times reports that they are looking for Kamala Harris to gain a strong national lead, which would indicate that she will perform well in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The campaign has been marked by controversy, including two attempts on Donald Trump's life and high-profile debates between the two candidates. Both candidates have also spent millions of dollars on advertisements to win the election.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Trump and Harris in a Tight Race**
The US presidential election 2024 is heating up, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in a tight race. According to recent polls, Harris is currently leading with 48.1% to Trump's 46.4%. However, other polls show a different picture, with Trump leading by around 2% points. The outcome is far from certain, as the election is still weeks away. The swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina will be crucial in determining the winner. As expert Prof. Dr. Lammert from the Free University of Berlin notes, the situation is complex, and polls should be taken with caution. 'It's a close race, and anything can happen,' he said. 'The New York Times and Siena College still see Harris ahead in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, but the gap is narrow.' The election is on November 5, and the outcome is far from certain.

**The current odds in every battleground state**
The 2024 presidential election is a close contest between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. According to Decision Desk HQ, Trump has a 52% chance of winning, while Harris has a 48% chance. Famed polling expert Nate Silver shows Harris with a 1.3-point lead nationally, but Trump is ahead in several key battleground states. In Arizona, Trump has a 16-point lead, while in Georgia, he has a 24-point lead. In Michigan, the two candidates are separated by less than a point. Silver's model suggests that Trump has momentum in Arizona and Georgia, while Harris has momentum in Michigan. In Nevada, the two candidates are tied, and in North Carolina, Trump has a 13-point lead. In Pennsylvania, the two are roughly tied, and in Wisconsin, Harris has a half-point lead. The outcome of the election will depend on the performance of the candidates in these battleground states.

**US Presidential Election 2024: A Close Contest Between Trump and Harris**
The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be a closely contested race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. According to the New York Times, the two candidates are essentially tied in national polls, with Trump having a slight lead. The campaign has been characterized as personalistic rather than partisan, with a focus on winning over undecided voters and securing the swing states. However, it's notable that Harris is struggling to gain support among the African American community, whereas Trump has been able to tap into this demographic. In states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, the African American vote could be a deciding factor. With over 34 million eligible voters, the African American community represents 14% of the US electorate. The winner of the election will need to secure 270 electoral votes, the majority required to win the presidency. In most states, the 'winner takes all' rule applies, where the candidate with the most votes in a state wins all of that state's electoral votes. The US electoral system is complex, with each state having its own unique voting procedures and requirements. Some states allow voters to register online, while others require in-person registration. Additionally, the use of mail-in ballots and gerrymandering has become increasingly prevalent, with some critics arguing that these practices can suppress minority votes. As one author notes, 'Viva l'America.'

**US Presidential Election 2024: Who Will Win in Wisconsin Between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris?**
As the US presidential election approaches on November 5, the landscape remains uncertain. Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, are neck and neck in a closely contested race, with minimal differences in key states. According to 270toWin, the national average of polls gives Harris a narrow lead of 1.4%. However, results vary significantly depending on the state. In Florida, Trump leads by 6.6%, while in Texas, he has a 5.6% advantage. In traditionally Democratic states, Harris maintains comfortable leads. In Maryland, she leads by 29.2%, while in California, her home state, she has a 24.7% advantage, according to recent polls. The key to the election, as in previous cycles, lies in the undecided states. In Nevada, Harris has a narrow lead of 0.3%, while in Arizona, Trump is ahead by 1.7%. In Georgia and North Carolina, two states that were fiercely contested in 2020, Trump maintains a slight advantage, with 1.9% and 0.6%, respectively. 270toWin also highlights that Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin will be crucial in determining the winner. In Pennsylvania, Trump leads by a narrow margin of 0.3%, while in Michigan, his advantage is only 0.4%. Harris, however, leads Trump in Wisconsin by 0.5%, which could prove crucial in securing the necessary electoral votes.

**Kamala’s Husband Gives Weird Talk About Hug With Tim Walz**
Kamala Harris's team is concerned about her ability to win the 'blue wall' states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, with only 14 days until the November 5 election. According to NBC News, there are fears that Michigan or Wisconsin may 'fall' to former President Donald Trump, while the other two states go blue. A senior Harris campaign official said, 'There has been a thought that maybe Michigan or Wisconsin will fall off.' Two other campaign strategists expressed great concern about Michigan, and NBC News added that North Carolina, which was previously thought to be a strong alternative path for Harris, may also be in peril. Nate Silver's election model showed a big change in the 2024 presidential race, with Trump's support growing faster than Harris's. Silver said, 'We're just not seeing as many Harris +3 type numbers in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as we did immediately after the debate.' Harry Enten, senior data analyst for CNN, said that the momentum of the presidential election is changing swiftly and not in favor of Harris. He added, 'The Democrat's momentum had stalled, and while she remains more popular than the Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, he believes that will not be enough to give her the presidency.'

**2024 US Presidential Election: Harris and Trump in a Tight Race**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump in a tight race. The election will take place on November 5, 2024. According to a recent poll by 'Real Clear Politics', Harris is leading Trump by 1.7 percentage points, with 49.2% of the vote compared to Trump's 47.5%. However, in the critical 'swing states', Trump is leading by a narrow margin. For example, in Pennsylvania, Trump is leading by 0.3 points, in Georgia by 0.7 points, and in Arizona by 1.1 points. Harris is leading in Wisconsin by 0.3 points, but has lost ground in Michigan in the past week. Overall, the latest polls show Harris with 49.2% of the vote and Trump with 47.5%. 'It's a very close and competitive race,' said Harris. 'We're working hard to make sure that every American has access to the information they need to make an informed decision.' Trump, on the other hand, said, 'I'm confident that we're going to win this election and make America great again.'

**2024 US Presidential Election: A Closely Contested Race**
The United States is preparing for the 2024 presidential election, with a closely contested race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. The election will take place on November 5, 2024, and the winner will begin a four-year term in the White House in January 2025. The election is not won by the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide, but by the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes in the Electoral College. The Electoral College is composed of 538 electors, who are chosen by each state and the District of Columbia. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state typically receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska. The election is closely watched in a handful of swing states, including Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. These states are crucial in determining the outcome of the election, and the candidate who wins them will likely win the presidency. The electoral system favors Trump, as it gives more weight to the votes of rural states that tend to vote Republican. If there is a tie in the Electoral College, the House of Representatives will choose the president, and the Senate will choose the vice president. There are also third-party candidates running in the election, including Jill Stein of the Green Party and Robert F. Kennedy, who is supporting Trump. Their presence on the ballot could potentially affect the outcome of the election.

**Seven Swing States that Could Decide the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with seven 'swing states' that could tip the balance in favor of either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. These states are Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In Arizona, the gap between the two candidates is the narrowest in the polls, with Trump having won in 2016 and Biden in 2020 by a margin of just over 10,000 votes. In North Carolina, the Democrats have not won since 2008, and Trump won by 74,000 votes in 2020. In Georgia, Biden won in 2020 by 12,000 votes, a first for Democrats since 1992. In Michigan, the election is expected to be close, with Trump and Harris neck and neck in the polls. In Nevada, Harris has a slight lead, but Trump is still in the running. In Pennsylvania, the largest swing state, Harris has a narrow lead of 0.2 points. In Wisconsin, the election is expected to be close, with Harris currently leading by 0.3 points. 'All eyes will be on the suburbs of Atlanta,' says The Washington Post, where Biden won in 2020. 'The fate of the election will be decided in these seven states,' says Franceinfo. 'The outcome of the election will be crucial, as the winner will take all 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.'

**US election 2024: The seven battleground states that will decide who wins**
In the 2024 US presidential election, seven battleground states will decide the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania, with 13 million residents and 19 Electoral College votes, is the biggest prize. Vice President Kamala Harris needs to sweep all three 'rust belt' states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin - to win the presidency. However, Donald Trump is preying on Democratic divisions in these states, particularly among Arab-American voters in Michigan and black voters in Georgia and North Carolina. Harris is also battling to shore up black votes in the southern states. Both candidates are courting Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada. Trump's route to victory includes holding onto North Carolina, grabbing back Georgia and Arizona, and winning Michigan with its large Arab-American population. The election outcome will depend on the results in these seven battleground states.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Will a Small Number of Voters Decide the Outcome?**
The 2024 US presidential election may be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states. In 2020, Joe Biden won the election by a narrow margin in several states, including Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin. These states are expected to be competitive again in 2024, along with others such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida. The election will be decided by the candidate who wins 270 or more electoral votes. The 538 electoral votes are divided among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, with each state receiving at least three votes. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which distribute some of their votes by congressional district. The election will be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states, and changes in voter preference or turnout in these states could be decisive.

**US Election 2024: Donald Trump holds a 52% chance to win, can Kamala Harris catch up?**
Donald Trump has taken the lead in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast for the US presidential election 2024, with a 52% chance of winning. This is a change from previous months, where Kamala Harris had a 54-56% chance of winning. Trump's improved polling in key battleground states such as Wisconsin and Michigan has contributed to this shift. Harris still leads in Pennsylvania, but Trump has a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. Early voting has already begun in several states, and the election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.

**Why nobody knows who will win the 2024 election**
With just over a week to go until the 2024 election, the outcome remains uncertain. Polls are tight, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris neck and neck in key battleground states. Harris' path to victory runs through winning the 'blue wall' states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, but Trump's chances are boosted by his strong performance in the Sun Belt battlegrounds. However, polling averages in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin show margins between Harris and Trump of under a point, which is unprecedented in at least 50 years. Many Republicans are hoping for a polling miss to benefit Trump, but this is unlikely, as surveys in key battlegrounds in 2022 underestimated Democrats. The election will likely come down to the undecided voters, who make up 5% of the electorate. These voters are less invested in the election, with only 24% agreeing that it is the most important of their lifetime.

**Battleground states: The key to unlocking the 2024 presidential election**
The 2024 presidential election will likely be decided by the battleground states, which are characterised by their swing voting histories and electoral significance. These states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Florida, hold the power to tip the balance in favour of either Democratic nominee Kamala Harris or Republican nominee Donald Trump. With less than three weeks to Election Day, recent swing state polls show Trump leading Harris in Georgia and Arizona, while Harris holds slim advantages in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The contest's outcome will hinge on which candidate mobilizes their base most effectively. 'These states possess substantial electoral votes, accounting for over 130 of the 270 needed to win,' said a source. 'Candidates will focus resources, including advertising and grassroots efforts, on these states, making them critical to winning the presidency.'

**Why voters in a handful of swing states will decide the US presidential election**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a small subset of voters in seven key states, with Pennsylvania being the most critical. The candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are focusing heavily on these battlegrounds through intense campaigning and ad spending. The winner will need to win a majority of the country's 538 electoral votes, or 270, which is possible even when losing the overall national vote. The seven battleground states are Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina. Pennsylvania is widely seen as critical to either Harris' or Trump's chances of winning the White House and is considered the most likely 'tipping point' state. If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she would need to carry either North Carolina or Georgia to have any chance of prevailing. Conversely, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, he would need to win either Wisconsin or Michigan to have any chance of winning. Both campaigns have treated Pennsylvania as the most important state, with Harris and Trump spending more time there than in any other.

**Kamala Harris no longer favorite in Nate Silver model: "Literally 50/50"**
Nate Silver's forecast model now shows that the 2024 presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is essentially a tie, with Harris standing at 50.1 percent and Trump at 49.7 percent. This is a significant drop in Harris' odds of victory, down by about 6 percentage points since late September. Silver notes that the forecast is 'literally 50/50' and that Harris' lead in key swing states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania has decreased. Harris is still ahead nationally, but her chances of overall success hinge on her ability to win swing states, particularly Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Silver's analysis shows that Harris is narrowly on track to achieve the electoral threshold required to win, but notes that the election is looking to be the tightest he has ever observed.

**US Presidential Election 2024: A Narrow Margin in Key States**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a narrow margin in key states, similar to the 2016 election. Donald Trump's victory in Michigan in 2016 was a surprise, and his campaign's success in suburban areas was a key factor. However, the Democratic Party has a strong advantage in the state, particularly among African American voters. According to polls, Kamala Harris has a 70-30 lead among African American voters in Michigan. The election will be decided by a small margin in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where the difference between the candidates is less than the margin of error in the polls. The election will also be influenced by the activation of black voters, who were key to Barack Obama's victory in 2008, but are still unclear whether they will support Harris. The election will be a repeat of the 2016 election, with the same candidates and similar issues, but with a new twist: the substitution of the official presidential candidate just four months before the election.

**What the US presidential election 2024 takes place**
Millions of Americans will head to the polls on November 5 to decide between former president Donald Trump and current vice-president Kamala Harris for the next president. The election date is always held on the first Tuesday after November 1. While voters cast ballots for individual candidates, they do not directly elect the president. Instead, the votes are reflected in the Electoral College, comprising 538 electors who cast votes on behalf of the state's population. A total of 270 votes are needed to win the presidency. The system allows a candidate to win the election without receiving the most popular votes. Key swing states include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Trump and Harris are currently neck and neck in the race, with the final results not confirmed until days after the election.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Trump-Harris Neck and Neck in Key States**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, with the possibility of voting by mail before the actual election on November 5. Initially, polls indicated Donald Trump as the likely winner, but with Kamala Harris' entry into the race, the two candidates are now closely matched. According to Real Clear Politics, Harris is currently leading Trump by over 1 percentage point nationally. However, this may not guarantee her a victory. Under the US electoral law, the winner will be the candidate who secures at least 270 Electoral College votes out of a total of 538. Seven key states - Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania - are considered to be in a tight race. If Harris were to win California by a single vote, she would secure all 54 Electoral College votes for that state. Currently, Trump is expected to secure 219 Electoral College votes, while Harris is expected to secure 226. The outcome will depend on the 93 delegates in these seven states and one Nebraska district.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Trump and Harris in a Close Contest**
The 2024 US presidential election is scheduled to take place on November 5, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris as the main contenders. The election will determine the next president of the United States, who will serve a four-year term starting from January 20, 2025. Eight candidates are running for the presidency, including Trump and Harris, as well as Jill Stein from the Green Party, Cornel West from the Justice Party, Chesa Boudin from the Libertarian Party, and others. The election will be held in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, at least 270, will be elected president. The election will also be influenced by the swing states, which are states that are considered to be up for grabs and can go either way. The swing states in this election are Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes in these states will likely win the election. The election will be held on November 5, and the results will be announced on the same day. However, the electoral college will meet in December to officially count the votes and declare the winner. The president-elect will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. 'The election will be a close contest between Trump and Harris, and the outcome is uncertain,' said an expert. 'The swing states will play a crucial role in determining the winner.'

**Seven States to Decide the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, and the focus is on seven key states that could decide the outcome. Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Nevada are the states where neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have a guaranteed victory. According to the article, 'the number of votes needed to win is 270, and all the options seem to reduce to these seven states.' The article also mentions that 'the three states in the Midwest have historically had the same voting patterns, and have chosen the same candidate in the last eight elections.' However, this pattern was broken in 2016 when Donald Trump won, and Joe Biden recovered in 2020. The article states that 'if Harris wins in these swing states, but loses in the other four, it could lead to a tie in the electoral college.' The tie could be broken by the two chambers of Congress, which would meet in a special session on January 6 to elect the president. The article concludes that 'it's impossible to predict the outcome of the election, which is expected to be one of the closest in US history.'

**Who Will Win the 2024 US Election? We Asked ChatGPT**
ChatGPT, a generative AI tool, was asked by Newsweek to predict the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. ChatGPT listed the strengths and weaknesses of both candidates, including Harris's diverse appeal, experience in leadership, and campaign skills, as well as her polarizing image and lack of broad enthusiasm. Trump's strengths include his populist messaging, campaign savvy, and record on the economy, but his weaknesses include his polarization of the American electorate, legal troubles, and exhaustion factor. ChatGPT predicted that Harris would win Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, while Trump would win North Carolina. However, the chatbot noted that the election is highly competitive and difficult to predict with certainty. The article also provides information on voter registration deadlines and the importance of absentee or mail-in ballots in the election.

**Trump gaining in polling to win the 'Blue Wall' states as Harris poll momentum slows**
A new Quinnipiac poll shows that the 2024 presidential race is deadlocked in three crucial swing states, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris trails Donald Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin, but leads him in Pennsylvania. Harris's greatest polling drag appears to be her numbers on the war in the Middle East, where voters have less confidence in her leadership abilities than Trump's. However, she has a strong lead on abortion, with voters trusting her by double-digit margins over Trump. The poll also suggests that Harris may be underperforming her party's senatorial nominees in these states, and that Trump is in a clear position to win the 2024 election.

**Same poll taken one month apart shows which presidential candidate has momentum in key states**
New polls in three crucial battleground states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, indicate that former President Trump is making gains, but remains in a toss-up race with Vice President Kamala Harris. According to Quinnipiac University surveys, Harris holds a 49% to 46% advantage over Trump in Pennsylvania, but Trump edges the vice president 50% to 47% in Michigan and 48% to 46% in Wisconsin. Harris' three-point edge in Pennsylvania is down from a six-point lead in Quinnipiac's previous survey from a month ago. 'That was then, this is now. The Harris post-debate starburst dims to a glow as Harris enters the last weeks slipping slightly in the Rust Belt,' Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. The results in these states, along with Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada, will likely determine if Trump or Harris wins the 2024 presidential election.

**Swing States: The Battlegrounds of the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be decided by seven swing states. The latest polls show a close race between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump. In Wisconsin, Harris leads with 49% of the vote, while in Michigan, the margin is even tighter with 48% for Harris and 47% for Trump. In Pennsylvania, the outcome is also uncertain, with 48% for Harris and 47% for Trump. The other swing states, including Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and North Carolina, are also showing close results. In Florida, Trump is currently leading with 49% of the vote, but the state's demographics are changing, with an aging population that is more likely to vote Republican. The outcome of the election will depend on which candidate can win over the undecided voters in these key states.

**2024 US Election: Trump has visited Wisconsin 4 times in 8 days. Why is it so important?**
Donald Trump has visited Wisconsin four times in eight days, a pivotal state in the 2024 US election. Trump believes that winning Wisconsin will secure his presidency, saying, 'If we win Wisconsin, we win the presidency.' However, Republicans are concerned about Trump's ability to match Democrats' enthusiasm and turnout machine. Trump's campaign has outspent Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on advertising in Wisconsin, but Harris has more offices and staff in the state. Wisconsin is a tight state in presidential elections, with Trump winning it in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes and losing to Joe Biden in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes. Trump's campaign is focusing on Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, the 'blue wall' states that went for Trump in 2016 and flipped to Biden in the next election.

**US Election 2024: Which are the battleground states that could decide the contest?**
The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be one of the most closely contested in modern American history, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump vying for the top spot. The election will be decided by a small fraction of the nearly 240 million eligible voters, with the key battleground states holding a total of 93 Electoral College votes. These states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania is the most crucial state, with 19 Electoral College votes at stake, and has become one of the tightest contests in recent years. Harris has focused on addressing the state's economic issues, including investing $100 billion in manufacturing, while Trump has appealed to rural white voters and warned of the impact of migration on small towns. In Georgia, Harris hopes to claim the African-American constituency, which played a crucial role in Joe Biden's 2020 victory. Trump has been indicted for alleged election interference in the state, but the case has been delayed until after the 2024 election. In North Carolina, Harris is hopeful about the state's potential, with a population exceeding 10 million and becoming increasingly diverse. Trump won the state in 2020, but his margin was narrow, and the Democrats are hoping to flip it. Michigan has selected the winning presidential candidate in the last two elections, but has become a centre point for a nationwide backlash against the president's support for Israel during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Harris has adopted a firmer stance on Israel, and some protesters advocating for Gaza have expressed hopes that she will show more understanding of their situation. Arizona has become a crucial point in the nation's immigration debate, with Trump banking on frustrations with the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies to swing the state back in his favour. Harris has pledged to tighten migration controls and to revive last year's bipartisan border bill. Wisconsin has chosen the winning presidential candidate in both 2016 and 2020, with margins of just over 20,000 votes each time. Analysts believe that third-party candidates could influence the outcome in marginal states like this. Nevada has not voted for a Republican since 2004, but there are signs that the Republicans may be on the verge of a comeback. Encouraged by Trump's appeal to Hispanic voters, the Republicans believe they can turn the tide. Harris has actively promoted her economic plans aimed at supporting small businesses and addressing inflation, and has erased Trump's earlier advantage in this western state.

**The next US president may be decided by a handful of states. Which are they?**
The 2024 US presidential election may be decided by a handful of swing states, including the 'Blue Wall' states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and North Carolina. Wisconsin is seen as one of the most competitive states, with President Joe Biden having won by fewer than 21,000 votes in 2020. The Sun Belt states have seen an increase in Latino, Asian American, and young Black voting demographics, but North Carolina and Georgia could still be wild cards due to their historical lean towards the Republican party. According to an analysis by NPR, the shift away from competitive states like Ohio and Iowa is due to the shift towards the GOP among white voters without college degrees. Both presidential candidates have intensified their campaigns in key swing states in the past few months.

**Election 2024 polls and predictions: Who’s winning, Harris or Trump?**
The 2024 US presidential election is a tossup between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, with Harris currently leading by almost four percentage points in national polls. However, the electoral college system, which assigns electors based on Congressional representation, creates a bias in favor of Republicans. Harris likely needs to win the popular vote by around three points to win the White House. The election will likely come down to a combination of seven swing states: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. Currently, Trump has a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Harris has a slight lead in Wisconsin and Michigan. The path to victory for Harris includes winning Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, while Trump's path to victory includes winning Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. 'The combination of these two states, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, would take Vice-President Harris to 268 electoral votes – one short of the Presidency,' according to inews.co.uk.

**Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Race in the US 2024 Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris leading Republican nominee Donald Trump in national polls. Harris has been gaining ground since announcing her candidacy in July, with her vote share increasing after a live televised debate in Pennsylvania. However, the gap between the two candidates is still narrow, with Trump's vote share decreasing after the debate. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, where the candidate who wins 270 electoral votes wins the presidency. The critical states that determine the winner are of great importance, with Harris currently leading in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These three states were strongholds of the Democratic Party in the 2016 and 2020 elections. According to polling analysis site 538, the margin between Harris and Trump is quite narrow in critical states, making it difficult to predict who will win. Polling companies are making adjustments to make the polls more reflective of the voting population, but predicting factors such as voter turnout remains a challenge.

**Harris and Trump in a Tight Race: The 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. Harris has been leading in national polls since her candidacy announcement in July, with a slight increase in her lead after a televised debate on September 10 in Pennsylvania. According to recent polls, Harris has gained a 0.8% lead over Trump, with 51.2% of the vote compared to Trump's 50.4%. However, the election outcome is uncertain due to the complex electoral system in the US, where 538 electoral votes are allocated to each state based on its population. The candidate who wins 270 electoral votes will become the president. Currently, seven swing states are considered critical, with Harris and Trump neck and neck in these states. In these states, Harris has gained ground since her candidacy announcement, particularly in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which were previously strongholds of the Democratic Party. The polls are subject to error, and the outcome of the election is uncertain, but Harris's performance in the debate has given her a slight edge over Trump.

**Battleground States: The Key to the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be a close contest, with the outcome potentially hinging on a handful of key states. According to recent polls, the seven battleground states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and North Carolina - are all within a margin of error of 3 percentage points. These states, which account for less than 20% of the US electorate, are crucial to the candidates' chances of winning the presidency. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both focusing their efforts on these states, with Harris trying to win over young and minority voters, and Trump targeting white working-class voters. The outcome of the election will depend on which candidate can mobilize the most voters in these key states. In Pennsylvania, Harris is seen as a strong contender, while in Michigan, Trump is trying to capitalize on the state's strong manufacturing sector. In Wisconsin, the election is expected to be a close contest, with Harris and Trump both vying for the state's 10 electoral votes. In the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia, Harris is trying to win over voters who are increasingly turning away from Trump. In North Carolina, the election is expected to be a close contest, with Harris and Trump both trying to win over voters in the state's growing cities. The outcome of the election will depend on which candidate can mobilize the most voters in these key states.

**Analyst says wins in these 3 East Coast states will deliver White House to this candidate**
According to Jonathan Martin, senior political columnist and politics bureau chief at Politico, the 2024 presidential election could be decided by just three states: Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. If former President Donald Trump wins all three, he will return to the White House. Martin says that if Vice President Kamala Harris cannot carry Pennsylvania, her only hope is a Southern strategy, which requires her to win either Georgia or North Carolina. He notes that other battleground states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona, are also important, but if Harris loses Pennsylvania, she will need to carry Michigan and Wisconsin and pick off one of the two Southern states and one of the two Western states to become president. Martin says that this is 'the most obvious route for the former president and a reminder of the advantage the Electoral College can confer on a Republican.'

**2024 Presidential election odds, predictions after latest polls; odds for every state**
Recent polls have shifted the 2024 presidential election odds in favor of Kamala Harris, with her now being a -125 favorite to win over Donald Trump. According to the latest swing state polling by Quinnipiac, Harris is ahead of Trump by a 51% to 46% margin in Michigan, a 51% to 46% margin in Pennsylvania, and a 49% to 48% margin in Wisconsin. The betting market also shows Harris with a 59% to 40% lead in Michigan, a 51.3% to 48.6% lead in Pennsylvania, and a 59% to 40% lead in Wisconsin. The likeliest outcome for Harris is to win between 270 and 299 electoral votes, at 24.54%, which would mean she'd win the election. Based on the current odds for every state, Kamala Harris would beat Donald Trump by a count of 276 to 262 electoral votes. The odds on who will win the White House in November effectively remain the same, with the Democrats being -125 favorites and the Republicans being +110 underdogs.

**These states will decide the election. We went to all of them to talk to voters**
NPR's Morning Edition and All Things Considered traveled to six states that will decide the 2024 presidential election. These states include Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona, where Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are competing for votes. Wisconsin is known as the 'land of the nail-biter' due to its close presidential elections, with Vice President Harris hoping to restore the 'blue wall' and Trump aiming to tear it down. Michigan, which voted reliably Democratic until Trump's 2016 win, is now more diverse and could favor Harris. However, she faces challenges with the state's large Arab-American population and young voters who are disappointed with the Biden administration's handling of the war in Gaza. Arizona, which has often supported Republican candidates, was flipped by Joe Biden in 2020 and is now up for grabs again, with both Trump and Vice President Harris campaigning on big national issues like the economy, immigration, and abortion.

**Donald Trump and Kamala Harris Battle for the 2024 US Presidential Election in Key States**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a handful of key states, with 158.6 million Americans voting in 2020. Joe Biden won by over 7 million votes, but it would have been enough for Donald Trump to win if 22,000 people in three states (Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin) had voted for him instead of Biden. The campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are battling for votes in the seven states that will decide who becomes president: the first woman to occupy the Oval Office or the first president to regain the presidency since Grover Cleveland in 1892. The seven states are Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada. Harris has 226 votes in the Electoral College, while Trump has 219. The battle is in the remaining 93 votes, which are spread across the seven key states. The difference is so narrow in these territories that small variations can give a turn to the election. These states are known as swing states. Trump needs to conserve North Carolina, and regain Georgia and Pennsylvania to win, so he is putting all his efforts there. His strategy clashes with the Democrats' in Pennsylvania, who have dubbed it the Blue Wall, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, states that would be enough for Harris to win. Sondeos, apuestas and predicciones vary about who will win in the key states. The distances are narrow, according to the polls. FiveThirtyEight gives an advantage to Harris in Wisconsin (2.8 points), Michigan (1.7 points), Pennsylvania (0.7), Nevada (0.2) and, recently, also in North Carolina (0.2). In contrast, Trump would be ahead in Arizona (0.7) and Georgia (0.6). The distances are very narrow. Polymarket gives the Democrat a probability of around 60% of winning in Wisconsin and Michigan, while giving the Republican the victory in Georgia, Arizona, and South Carolina with around a 60-40% chance. It would be almost a coin toss in Nevada (irrelevant in that scenario) and Pennsylvania, which would tip the balance. Metaculus, a community of experts, gives Harris a 64% chance of winning in Wisconsin, 60% in Michigan, and 55% in Pennsylvania. In contrast, it assigns a 60% probability to Trump winning in North Carolina and leaves Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada almost tied.

**Seven Key States to Decide 2024 US Presidential Election**
Seven key states in the US will decide the 2024 presidential election, according to experts. These states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The Democratic and Republican candidates are competing fiercely in these states to win over undecided voters. Arizona: The state has been a crucial battleground in the past, with the Democrats winning the presidency in 2020 thanks to the support of the state. The issue of immigration has become a central theme in the national debate, with the number of border crossings decreasing after reaching record levels. Donald Trump has attacked Kamala Harris's immigration record, promising to lead 'the greatest deportation operation in US history' if he returns to power. North Carolina: The state has been a key battleground in the past, with Trump winning it in 2020 by a narrow margin. The Democrats are hoping to win the state this year, with Harris adopting a tougher stance on Israel. Pennsylvania: The state has been a crucial battleground in the past, with Biden winning it in 2020. The economy is a major concern in the state, with inflation having peaked under the Biden administration. Wisconsin: The state has chosen the presidential candidate in the past two elections, with Biden winning it in 2020 by a narrow margin. The state has been a key battleground in the past, with Trump winning it in 2016. The experts have suggested that it's in the marginal states like Wisconsin that third-party candidates who are campaigning against the policies of the two main candidates could have an impact.

**Here's How Close Trump Is to Winning the Election**
According to CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten, the 2024 election is one of the closest races in 60 years, with even a single point potentially tipping the win for either candidate. In the seven crucial key states, the two candidates have been neck and neck, with recent polls showing Harris ahead of Trump by just six-tenths of a point. However, polling strategist Nate Silver's forecast has shifted in Trump's favor, with the 45th president now having a 61.5 percent chance of winning, compared to Harris' 38.3 percent. Trump is also leading in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as in Texas, where he has a 5-point lead. The upcoming presidential debate between Harris and Trump is expected to be a crucial moment in the election, with Enten noting that one bad debate can end a presidential campaign.
