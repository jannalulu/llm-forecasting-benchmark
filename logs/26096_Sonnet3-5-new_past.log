Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of July 12, 2024, BSE Sensex is at 80,519.34
- It has shown significant growth, up 23.22% year-over-year
- Current range is well above the target range of 75k-76k

2. Recent Trends:
- July 12: 80,519.34 (+0.78%)
- July 11: 79,897.34 (+0.03%)
- July 10: 79,924.77 (-0.53%)
- The index has been relatively stable above 79,000

3. Historical Context:
- In June 2024, it was around 76,693.36
- The index has shown consistent upward momentum
- Minimum value for the year was 70,370.55

4. Key Factors to Consider:
- Strong upward momentum in recent months
- Currently trading significantly above target range
- Would require approximately 5.6% decline to reach target range
- Only 9 days until resolution date

5. Analysis:
- The index would need to fall significantly to reach the target range
- Recent volatility has been relatively low
- No major negative catalysts are evident in the news
- Market sentiment appears positive
- Short timeframe makes large moves less likely

6. Risk Factors:
- Markets can experience sudden corrections
- However, a 5.6% drop in 9 days without clear negative catalysts is unlikely

Given the current level (80,519.34), recent stability, and short timeframe, it's highly unlikely the Sensex will fall to the 75k-76k range by July 21, 2024. The index would need to drop over 5.6% in just 9 days, which is improbable given recent trends and market sentiment.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 2.50%, with 1.25% being the most likely. Probability: 1.25%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of July 12, 2024, BSE Sensex is at 80,519.34
- This represents a 0.78% gain from the previous day
- The index has shown significant volatility in recent months

2. Recent Trends:
- The index has been consistently trading above 79,000 in July 2024
- Over the past week, there's been a 0.65% increase
- Year-over-year growth is 23.22%

3. Historical Pattern Analysis:
- The index has been steadily climbing, reaching new highs
- It crossed 76,000 in June 2024 and hasn't fallen below since
- Current level (80,519.34) is significantly higher than the target range (75,000-76,000)

4. Key Factors to Consider:
- Strong upward momentum in recent months
- Consistent trading above 79,000 level
- No immediate catalysts suggesting a major downturn
- Historical volatility patterns suggest large movements are possible but rare

5. Mathematical Analysis:
- Target range (75,000-76,000) is approximately 5.6-6.9% below current level
- Such a significant drop in 9 days without major negative catalysts is rare
- Would require breaking through multiple support levels

6. Risk Factors:
- Market volatility exists
- Global economic uncertainties
- Potential profit booking

Given that:
- The index would need to fall over 5.6% in 9 days to reach the target range
- Current momentum is positive
- No major negative catalysts are visible

1. Current Situation:
- As of July 12, 2024, BSE Sensex is at 80,519.34

4. Key Considerations:

- Recent volatility exists but not enough to suggest a major correction
- Would require approximately 5-6% decline to reach target range
- No major negative catalysts visible in near term

5. Analysis:
For Sensex to fall to 75k-76k range:
- Would need significant market correction
- Most recent data shows strong support levels above 79,000
- Market sentiment remains positive
- Technical indicators suggest continued strength

6. Risk Factors:

- Some potential for profit booking
- However, correction to 75k-76k seems unlikely given current momentum

Given that:
- Current level is well above target range

- Current level (80,519.34) is significantly higher
- Strong bullish momentum
- Would require ~5.5% fall in 9 days
- No immediate negative triggers visible
- Strong institutional buying

4. Technical Analysis:
- Current support levels appear to be around 79,000
- Multiple news articles indicate positive market sentiment
- No major negative technical indicators

5. Time Factor:
- Only 9 days until July 21
- Historically, such large movements (>5%) in 9 days are rare without major negative triggers

6. Reference Classes:
- Similar periods of strong market momentum rarely see quick reversals
- When markets are at all-time highs, probability of significant drops is lower

Given the current level of 80,519.34, strong momentum, limited time frame (9 days), and absence of major negative triggers, it seems highly unlikely that Sensex would fall to the 75k-76k range by July 21, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 1.20% and 3.50%, with 2.10% being the most likely. Probability: 2.10%
