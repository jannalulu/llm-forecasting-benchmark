**Brazil's Supreme Federal Court to Analyze Suspension of Social Media Platform X**
Alexandre de Moraes, a minister of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) of Brazil, has called the First Panel of the STF to analyze the decision to suspend the social media platform X in the country. According to local media, the judge, who is the relator of the case, has signed an order that states the trial will be held virtually 'for a period of 24 hours, from 00:00 on September 2, 2024, to 23:59 on the same day.'

**Mandato de Alexandre de Moraes no STF vai até 2043**
Minister Alexandre de Moraes, of the Supreme Court of Brazil, has 19 years left in his position, as per the Constitution, which states that judges must retire compulsorily at the age of 75. Moraes, who is currently 55 years old, will have to leave the STF in December 2043, when he reaches the age limit. He has over 7,000 days left as a magistrate of the Supreme Court. Moraes was appointed by former President Michel Temer in 2017, and has been a key figure in several high-profile cases, including the decision to order Elon Musk to appoint a new representative for Twitter in Brazil within 24 hours, under penalty of suspending the social media platform. According to Moraes, he took 'measures against the platform after successive non-compliance with judicial decisions.'

**X Announces Immediate Cease of Operations in Brazil**
The social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, announced on Saturday (17) that it will 'immediately cease operations in Brazil'. However, the platform's service will remain available in the country. According to X, the decision was made to 'protect the safety of the team'. The company claims that the Minister of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) Alexandre de Moraes threatened to fine and imprison the responsible person for the Brazilian office, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Conceição, for non-compliance with judicial decisions. X criticizes Moraes, stating that 'his actions are incompatible with a democratic government'. The platform also adds that 'the Brazilian people have a choice to make – democracy or Alexandre de Moraes'.

**Moraes' Advisors' Messages Cause Embarrassment to the STF**
The role of Minister Alexandre de Moraes, of the Supreme Federal Court (STF), in defending Brazilian democracy during the 2022 elections is undeniable. His decisions ensured the right to vote and thwarted a post-election coup attempt. However, the messages exchanged by his advisors, revealed this week by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, are cause for concern. As one of his advisors said, 'it was a great day' is not relevant here, but the fact that his advisors were involved in actions that could be seen as undermining the democratic process is. The exchange of messages by his advisors is an embarrassment to the STF.

**Brazilian Minister Alexandre de Moraes Accused of Requesting Informal Reports on Bolsonaro Allies**
Brazilian Minister of Justice Alexandre de Moraes has been accused of requesting informal reports on allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro at least 20 times between August 2022 and May 2023. According to the minister's office, the requests were made as part of the investigation into fake news and digital militias, and were 'official, regular, and properly documented' in the ongoing investigations at the Supreme Federal Court (STF). However, a report by the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo claims to have obtained 6 gigabytes of messages and files that show Moraes acting 'outside the proper procedure' to obtain data and reports on specific targets. The report alleges that Moraes and his assistants, including STF judge Airton Vieira and former TSE advisor Eduardo Tagliaferro, requested reports on individuals such as economist Rodrigo Constantino, who is a Bolsonaro supporter. Moraes has denied any wrongdoing, stating that the TSE acted within its 'police powers' to produce reports on illicit activities, and that the reports were simply a description of publicly available social media posts. 'The reports simply described the illicit posts made on social media, in an objective manner, as they were directly related to the investigations into digital militias,' Moraes said. 'Several of these reports were attached to these investigations and others connected to them, and sent to the Federal Police for further investigation, always with the knowledge of the Attorney General's Office.'

**Moraes 'Cleans Up' 2024 Election Process by Removing X Social Media Platform**
After a decision by Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes, the X social media platform was taken offline in Brazil on Saturday (31). This led to a surge in users searching for alternatives, including Bluesky and Threads. However, a monitoring of thousands of public WhatsApp groups revealed that the removal of X had a significant impact, with a 70% drop in the number of shares of X's content. Meanwhile, access to Threads and Bluesky increased by 600% and 1,600%, respectively. The number of mentions of X and its VPNs also increased by 300%. However, after applying a filter to exclude robotic behavior, the number of shares of X's content dropped by 99%. According to experts, this suggests that the increase in shares was due to artificial behavior. Moraes' decision has been seen as a way to 'clean up' the 2024 election process, removing an unfair advantage held by former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies. 'With the support of the STF, the federal government, the Attorney General's Office, and nine out of ten jurists, Alexandre de Moraes has promoted a strong cleaning of the 2024 election process,' said a statement.

**The Decision of Minister Alexandre de Moraes: A Divided Court and a Country in Turmoil**
The decision by Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes to block the Starlink accounts, which provide internet connections to the North region of Brazil, has divided the court's ministers and increased the number of politicians in the parliament who think Moraes is overstepping his authority in his dispute with billionaire Elon Musk. Many believe that Moraes must comply with the court's decision, and he will have support for his decisions in this area. However, it is not possible to put the other company, Starlink, which serves Brazilians in a region with low population density, in the same situation. Gilberto Kassab, the president of the PSD, does not intend to ask Antônio Brito (PSD-BA) to withdraw his candidacy for the Presidency of the Chamber. The internal assessment is that, with Davi Alcolumbre (União Brasil-AP) well-positioned in the Senate, Brito has great chances of being elected by his colleagues. Businessmen suspected that the 2025 Budget would arrive in Congress with expenses linked to proposals for tax increases for companies and their shareholders. Now, they will work with the parliamentary benches to try to reverse this from October, when the expenses and revenues for the next year will be analyzed. The government's bet is that the Executive will win the deputies due to 'hunger', as the amendments are blocked and will only be released if there is an agreement on transparency. 'When the Judiciary interferes with companies, it scares off investors. We need to dialogue', said Luciano Huck, commenting on the decision of Minister Alexandre de Moraes. 'Jair Bolsonaro continues to be the biggest electoral asset of his party in the capital. Candidates and city councilors for the PL put the image of the former president in the propaganda with more emphasis than the image of the candidate for mayor, Alexandre Ramagem.'

**Brazilian Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes Embroiled in Controversy**
Brazilian Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes has been involved in several controversies, including a public feud with Elon Musk over the X platform. Moraes has asked Musk to appoint a legal representative for the X in Brazil, which Musk has refused to do. The feud has sparked criticism of Moraes' handling of inquéritos criminais (criminal investigations) in the Supreme Court, which he is responsible for. Moraes has also been accused of conducting investigations outside of the official rito (procedure) and of using the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) to obtain information for his investigations. Additionally, Moraes has been accused of ordering the interception of messages between his staff and of opening an investigation into the leak of these messages. The controversy has sparked debate over Moraes' handling of power and his relationship with the media.

**Judiciary Cannot be Manipulated, Says Moraes**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre do Moraes stated that the Judiciary cannot be manipulated and must be an instrument for good. He emphasized the need for new technologies to adapt to society, not the other way around. Moraes made these remarks on Friday, August 31, 2024, during a speech at the College of Prosecutors of Justice in São Paulo. 'We need to adapt new technology, social media, artificial intelligence, to optimize what we can do for society, not the opposite. We don't have to be enslaved, we don't have to be manipulated, we have to use these tools for the good,' Moraes declared. At the event, where he was awarded the 'Institutional Merit Collar of the Public Ministry,' Moraes avoided commenting on the blockage of X (formerly Twitter) in Brazil, instead focusing on his career in the legal field and thanking the attendees.

**Alexandre de Moraes Affirms X Lacks Legitimacy to Contest Blocking of Profiles on Social Media**
The 1st Chamber of the Federal Supreme Court (STF) began to judge appeals from social media platform X against the decisions of Minister Alexandre de Moraes to suspend user accounts on the platform. De Moraes voted to reject the appeals because he understands that it is not the company's responsibility to take legal action on behalf of third parties, meaning the company does not have the legitimacy to act in favor of those whose profiles were blocked. He stated, 'In this context, and considering the presented considerations, it is impossible for the applicant to oppose the respect of the blocking of the channels/profiles/accounts, in accordance with the decision taken in these cases, because it is the right of the third parties under investigation, and as it does not involve a recourse by the chosen means.' De Moraes also reiterated that freedom of expression benefits from constitutional protection, but that the exercise of this right cannot be used as a 'protective shield for the practice of illegal activities' and that freedom of expression is guided by freedom and responsibility. He wrote, 'Freedom of expression must not be confused with impunity in the face of aggression.' 'Once the exercise of freedom of expression has been criminally distorted, the Federal Constitution and legislation authorize preventive and definitive civil and penal measures,' he added. After the deadline set by De Moraes expired on Thursday evening, the company published a statement on its social media platform stating that it would not comply with the STF's determination and that, consequently, 'soon' the service could be blocked in Brazil. In parallel, De Moraes also ordered the blocking of the accounts of the Starlink company, which also belongs to the billionaire. The measure was adopted to ensure the payment of the fines imposed on the platform. Starlink operates in Brazil and sells internet services by satellite. The decision was dated August 18, but was only published on Thursday.

**Brazil's Supreme Court Minister Orders Shutdown of Twitter, Left and Right React**
Brazil's Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes ordered the immediate shutdown of Twitter in the country, citing non-compliance with court orders. The decision was met with support from left-wing politicians and influencers, who encouraged users to migrate to other social media platforms. In contrast, right-wing politicians and influencers, including Bolsonaro's family members, criticized the decision, accusing Moraes of imposing a 'dictatorship' and citing the use of VPNs to bypass the block. Deputada federal Fernanda Melchiona (PSOL-RS) stated that Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter in 2022 was a 'chronicle of a tragedy foretold', while deputada federal Gleisi Hoffmann (PT) called Musk a 'playboy, prepotente and arrogant' who 'dreams of new external interference in the defense and sovereignty of South American countries.' The president Lula also supported Moraes' decision, saying that Musk should 'accept the rules of Brazil' and comply with the court's order. On the other hand, politicians linked to the right, particularly Bolsonaristas, were critical of Moraes' decision, with Flávio Bolsonaro (PL-RJ) stating that 'not complying with a court decision is a crime, just like it is a crime for a judge to ignore the law.'

**Moraes to Receive Prestigious Award Amid Musk Dispute**
Minister Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Federal Court is set to receive the Colar do Mérito do Ministério Público de São Paulo award at 3pm on Friday, 30. The ceremony will be led by Procurador-Geral de Justiça Paulo Sérgio de Oliveira e Costa and will take place at the MPSP auditorium in the capital city of São Paulo. This honor comes at a time when Moraes is at the center of a dispute with Elon Musk, the world's richest man, according to Forbes. Musk has been attacking Moraes, calling him a 'dictator', 'criminal', and 'tyrant', among other insults, after the minister ordered the blocking of Starlink's accounts in Brazil if the X social network did not appoint a legal representative in the country. The company responsible for the platform fired all its Brazilian employees after the minister ordered the removal of profiles, including that of Senator Marcos do Val (Podemos-ES). The old Twitter may be shut down in Brazil at any moment, as the deadline for appointing a legal representative expired at 8:07pm on Thursday, 29, but it remains online. The conflict between Musk and Moraes has led to Bolsonarist parliamentarians reiterating their demands for the minister's impeachment. The group declared war on the minister, who is leading the investigations into the January 8, 2022, coup attempt and the digital militias, which investigates the orchestrated use of internet profiles to pursue political adversaries of former President Jair Bolsonaro. 'The minister's defense of democracy in the STF and as president of the TSE is worthy of recognition,' said the Órgão Especial do Colégio de Procuradores de Justiça in a statement.

**Moraes' Block on X May Fuel Protests on September 7**
The image of Alexandre de Moraes, the Minister of the Supreme Federal Court (STF), may have taken another hit this week. By blocking Elon Musk's social media platform, X, in Brazil, Moraes may have fueled the upcoming protests on September 7. Discontent with Moraes' authoritarian and intransigent stance, personalities have intensified the call for the population to participate in the demonstrations, which will focus on the demand for Moraes' impeachment. For some, Moraes' actions have gone beyond the limits of the Justice system and may even warrant imprisonment. As reported in the 98th edition of Gazeta do Povo Revista, available for download, the controversy surrounding Moraes is expected to inflame the streets next week.

**STF Begins to Judge X's Appeals Against Moraes' Decisions**
The Supreme Federal Court (STF) began to judge a series of resources from the social network X against decisions by Minister Alexandre de Moraes to block accounts on the platform. Moraes voted to reject the appeals and maintain the suspended profiles, and criticized the resources presented. According to Moraes, 'it is not up to the provider of the social network to plead a right that does not belong to it, even if it is the recipient of the blocking orders determined by a judicial decision for criminal investigation purposes, since it is not a party to the investigative procedure.' The other ministers have until September 6 to present their votes. The dispute between Moraes and X is ongoing, with the minister having ordered the company to appoint a new legal representative in Brazil within 24 hours, or risk having the social network suspended in the country. X had announced the end of its representation in Brazil two weeks ago, due to disagreements with Moraes over the blocking of profiles.

**Alexandre de Moraes' Mandate: A Look at the Supreme Court Minister's Future**
Alexandre de Moraes, a 55-year-old minister of the Supreme Court, has 19 years left in his mandate, which will end in December 2043 when he reaches the age limit of 75. Moraes has been a member of the Supreme Court for seven years and has over 7,000 days left as a magistrate. He was appointed by former President Michel Temer in 2017 and has been a target of criticism from allies and supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is being investigated by Moraes. The dispute between Moraes and Elon Musk, the owner of X, reached its peak on Wednesday, with Moraes ordering Musk to inform the new representative of the platform in Brazil within 24 hours, or face the suspension of the social network. Jurists have stated that Moraes' intimation of Musk via a social network is invalid. 'I took strong measures against the platform after successive non-compliance with judicial decisions,' Moraes said. 'The minister's decision to order Musk to inform the new representative of the platform in Brazil within 24 hours, or face the suspension of the social network, is a clear example of the power struggle between the government and the private sector,' said a jurist.

**Moraes Summons Musk and Threatens to Suspend X in Brazil**
Supreme Federal Court (STF) Minister Alexandre de Moraes has summoned Elon Musk, owner of X, to appoint a new legal representative for the company in Brazil within 24 hours. Moraes warned that failure to comply with the order may result in the suspension of X in Brazil. The summons was made via a post on the STF's official profile on X, as the company had ceased operations in the country on August 17. Moraes stated that, in case of non-compliance, X may be suspended 'until the court orders are effectively complied with and the daily fines paid'. This is the latest escalation in the conflict between Moraes and Musk, who has been investigated in inquiry 4957 for alleged crimes of obstruction of justice, criminal organization and incitement to commit crime. X's Global Government Affairs account published a copy of a confidential decision by Moraes, ordering the blocking of accounts of Senator Marcos do Val and six other profiles. The platform refused to comply with Moraes' new order and was fined. Musk has questioned Moraes' decisions and suggested that the minister should resign or be impeached. Moraes has included the billionaire in the 'digital militias' investigation.

**Moraes gives Elon Musk 24 hours to appoint X representative in Brazil, threatening to suspend the network**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes has ordered Elon Musk, owner of X, to notify him within 24 hours who will be the new representative of the platform in Brazil. If the order is not fulfilled, the activities of the social network may be suspended. X announced on August 17 that it would cease operations in Brazil, attributing the decision to Moraes' 'persecution' and 'censorship'. The platform has been refusing to remove profiles blocked by Moraes in investigations into the dissemination of false news and attacks on institutions. Elon Musk has been investigated by the Federal Police after promising to reactivate suspended profiles by order of the STF. Musk called Moraes 'shameful' and asked him to resign or face an impeachment process. This was the first of a series of provocations and attacks on the minister.

Federal Deputy Nikolas Ferreira (PL-MG) commented on the decision of Minister Alexandre de Moraes, of the Supreme Court (STF), to block the social media profiles of the wife of former federal deputy Daniel Silveira and impose a daily fine of R$ 50,000 in case of non-compliance. Ferreira stated that 'Alexandre de Moraes has once again exceeded the limits of what is acceptable', noting that 'the wife's passport has been confiscated, and he has ordered the exclusion of all her social media, with the threat of preventive imprisonment.' Ferreira warned of the delicate moment Brazil is in, and predicted that difficult days are ahead due to the repeated arbitrariness of Moraes, despite his peers in the STF and the Brazilian legal order. He concluded, 'The Republic is on the brink of collapse with this minister's presence in the Supreme Court. 07 de Setembro is a duty. Doing the right thing without expecting it to work out - is his statement.'

**Moraes Blocks Interview with Filipe Martins, Citing Ongoing Investigation**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes has blocked an interview with former Jair Bolsonaro advisor Filipe Martins by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper. Moraes' decision, made on August 22, was in response to the newspaper's request to interview Martins on June 18. According to Moraes, the interview would not be 'convenient for the criminal investigation' as it is ongoing by the Federal Police. Martins was released on August 9, but Moraes had previously ordered him to use an electronic ankle bracelet, appear before the Paraná Justice Court weekly, not leave Brazil, and not use social media, with a daily fine of R$ 20,000. Moraes' reasoning is that questions asked during interviews could refer to an investigated person. Martins was arrested on February 8, 2024, and remains detained. The arrest was authorized by the PF, accepted by Moraes, due to the alleged risk of Martins fleeing the country. However, the information about his supposed trip to Florida on December 30, 2022, was never confirmed by Brazilian or US authorities. The PF's report, which cites possible evasion of the country 'to avoid potential penal responsibilities,' is in Moraes' decision. The report raises doubts about the PF's own claim, as it states that Martins' name was on the list of passengers who traveled on the presidential plane to Orlando on December 30, 2022, but there was no record of his departure from the country.

**Moraes Authorizes Seizure of Ex-Assistant's Phone in Leaked Messages Investigation**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes authorized the seizure of the phone of his former assistant, Eduardo Tagliaferro, who was responsible for monitoring social media posts of investigated individuals at the Electoral Superior Court (TSE). Tagliaferro was fired in May 2023 after being arrested for domestic violence. He was questioned by the Federal Police on Thursday (23) as part of an investigation into the leak of messages that, according to reports by Folha de São Paulo, suggest that Moraes requested TSE investigations and reports outside of the usual procedure. Reinaldo Azevedo, a journalist and anchor of the program 'O É da Coisa', stated that Moraes has already demonstrated that he made all the requests, and that he does not see any error in the exchange of information between the Supreme Court and the TSE. According to Azevedo, even though there is no evidence of fabricated evidence or irregularities, there is an attempt to create a false narrative to discredit the Justice.

A petition and a popular online signature campaign have been available for signatures until September 7, with the latter having surpassed 1 million signatures. The controversy surrounding Moraes has intensified after reports by Folha de S.Paulo, based on leaked messages from his office, suggested that he had informally used the Electoral Court to justify investigations against allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Retired Supreme Court Minister Marco Aurélio Mello criticized Moraes' actions, stating that the situation is 'triste' and that the administration can only act when authorized by law. Mello also referred to the investigation into fake news as the 'inquérito do fim do mundo' (investigation of the end of the world), and stated that it has been ongoing for four years and has been marred by controversy from the start.

**Moraes Used TSE to Support Investigations of Fake News**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes requested reports from the Electoral Court's (TSE) department of combating disinformation on information from protesters who insulted ministers during the Lide Brazil Conference in New York in November 2022. The reports were produced by Marco Antônio Vargas, a judge's assistant, and Airton Vieira, a judge instructor, who were asked by Moraes to monitor social media posts and identify the authors of threatening messages. The reports included information on protesters who were identified as Allan dos Santos, a blogger, and Carla Zambelli, a federal deputy. Moraes had specified that he only wanted reports on these two individuals. The reports were used to support Moraes' decisions in the inquérito das fake news (investigation of fake news) in the Supreme Court. Moraes stated that he had used the TSE in an extra-official manner to support his investigations, and that it would be 'esquizofrênico' (schizophrenic) to 'auto-oficiar' (self-authorize). The reports were also used to support Moraes' decisions in the inquérito das fake news, which targeted allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Eduardo Tagliaferro, the former head of the AEED (Assessoria Especial de Enfrentamento à Desinformação), was dismissed from his position in May 2023 after being arrested for domestic violence. 'It would be esquizofrênico to auto-oficiar,' Moraes said, commenting on the reports for the first time. 'None of the reports preoccupy me, and everything that is cited in the journalistic text is documented in the autos of the processes,' he added.

A petition calling for the impeachment of Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes has gained significant support in recent days, with over 661,639 signatures as of Sunday, August 18, 2024. The petition, addressed to the Federal Senate, accuses Moraes of abuse of power and other irregularities. According to the Folha de São Paulo, leaked messages suggest that Moraes informally ordered the Electoral Justice to produce reports against Bolsonaro supporters and right-wing commentators. The petition details a series of serious accusations against Moraes, including document tampering, fishing for evidence, abuse of authority, and possible proof tampering. The petition claims that Moraes' actions are unconstitutional and violate both the Federal Constitution and the 1950 Law 1.079, which defines crimes of responsibility. To proceed with the impeachment, the petition must be delivered to the President of the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, on September 9, 2024. The petition's supporters are calling for the Senate to process and judge Moraes based on the alleged infractions listed in the petition.

**X Closes Operations in Brazil Amid Alleged Threats from Minister Alexandre de Moraes**
X, formerly known as Twitter, announced the closure of its operations in Brazil after employees were allegedly threatened with arrest by Alexandre de Moraes, the Minister of the Supreme Court of Brazil. 'Last night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arresting employees from the X office if we didn't comply with his censorship orders. He did it in a secret order, which we shared here to expose his actions,' the company stated. Despite numerous appeals to the Federal Supreme Court, the company's requests were not met. X claimed that the Brazilian public was not informed about these orders and that their team had no responsibility or control over content blocking on the platform. As a result, Moraes allegedly threatened the team in Brazil instead of respecting the law or due process. Due to this threat and to protect the safety of their employees and team, the social network decided to close its operations in Brazil, effective immediately. Although the social network remains available to the population in the country. X accuses Minister de Moraes of being responsible for the closure in Brazil. The company stated that de Moraes does not respect the law or due process, as he issues 'censorship' orders to remove content. 'His actions are incompatible with a democratic government,' the platform stated, showing the judicial resolution issued on Friday in which X is again ordered to remove several profiles. De Moraes demanded that the company delete the requested profiles, or its representative in Brazil would face a daily fine of 20,000 reais (approximately $68,000) and imprisonment for disobedience. Musk added in another message that the magistrate 'should go' and supported the calls of the Brazilian far-right to initiate an impeachment process against de Moraes. According to the company, the profiles to be deleted question the solidity of the Brazilian electoral system in the context of the 2022 elections. 'Who is Alexandre de Moraes?' Alexandre de Moraes is a prominent Brazilian jurist who serves as Minister of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) of Brazil. He is a graduate in Law from the University of São Paulo and has specialized in Constitutional and Administrative Law. Before his ascension to the STF in 2017, he served as Secretary of Public Security of São Paulo and as Minister of Justice in the government of President Michel Temer. His career is characterized by his focus on regulating social media, even if it means restricting freedom of expression and promoting hate speech. The judge maintains that social media are a 'lawless land', and therefore, with his usual tough hand, he initiated a fight for regulation in the South American country, at all costs. However, this is not the only controversy surrounding Moraes, as he leads another investigation against former President Jair Bolsonaro for his alleged participation in a coup attempt after losing the elections to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. These actions have earned him the dislike of many citizens and made him a frequent target of attacks during the far-right protests. Elon Musk vs. Alexandre de Moraes The conflict between the two centers mainly on Musk's actions regarding content moderation on social media. Alexandre de Moraes has been critical of the policies of large digital platforms on the management of false information and hate speech. Musk, who has been a proponent of greater freedom of expression, has faced stricter regulations in Brazil. De Moraes emphasized that the lack of moderation can have negative consequences for democracy and social stability, generating tensions between his positions and the policies promoted by Musk.

**X Closes Brazilian Office Amid Dispute with Minister Alexandre de Moraes**
The social media platform X, formerly Twitter, owned by Elon Musk, has closed its office in Brazil after the billionaire accused Minister Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) of threatening to imprison the platform's employees. The announcement was made on Saturday (17). According to the Folha de São Paulo, the company states that it will cease operations in the country due to the minister's actions, but the social network will remain available to Brazilians. The STF was approached by the Folha, but has not yet commented on the matter. Alexandre de Moraes is the Minister of the Supreme Federal Court (STF). X, owned by Elon Musk, is the former Twitter. The company released a statement saying, 'Despite our numerous resources to the Supreme Federal Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders, and our Brazilian team not having responsibility or control over content blocking on our platform, Moraes chose to threaten our team in Brazil instead of respecting the law or due process. As a result, to protect the safety of our team, we have decided to cease our operations in Brazil, with immediate effect. The X service continues to be available to the Brazilian population.' The platform published a secret decision by Moraes, which determines the notification of the regularly constituted lawyers of X in Brazil to take the necessary measures and comply with the previous decision in 24 hours, blocking the account of users on the network. If this does not occur, according to the text of the decision, the imprisonment of the administrator of the company, Raquel de Oliveira Villa Nova Conceição, will be decreed for disobedience to the judicial determination. She would also be removed from the direction of the company and fined R$ 20,000 per day.

**Moraes' Conduct Under Scrutiny: Questions Over Relaying Actions in Supreme Court**
Minister Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Court (STF) has been questioned about his conduct in relaying actions in the Supreme Court while also presiding over the Electoral Court (TSE). Messages exchanged between Moraes' assistants revealed that reports were produced by TSE technicians to be used in the Supreme Court, as reported by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. The orders from Moraes' office, which handled the inquest into fake news and digital militias, targeted allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro (PL) in these two investigations. According to Moraes, 'it would be schizophrenic' for him to 'self-appoint', as his duties as TSE president gave him the right, as provided by law, to determine the production of the reports. Moraes justified the use of the reports, saying they were a quick way to register criminal posts before they were deleted by users. He also stated that all documents produced were added to the processes and shared with the Attorney General's Office and the Federal Police. However, the lack of formal communication between Moraes' office in the STF and the Electoral Court has been criticized. The messages revealed by the report would have been exchanged between August 2022 and May 2023, a period that includes the electoral period. The OAB has announced that it will request access to the investigations under Moraes' relatorship to analyze whether there are other measures that can be taken.

She called Moraes 'a great president' and said he 'played a huge role in the 2022 elections'. According to Cármen, the statement was made on behalf of the entire Electoral Court. 'It would be esquizofrênico (schizophrenic) for me, as president of the TSE, to self-authorize,' Moraes said, explaining that as president of the TSE, he had the power to determine the production of reports. He also stated that all requests were properly documented and that all defenses were aware of the proceedings. 'There's nothing to hide, all official documents related to the investigation are with the PF (Federal Police), and all resources against my decisions were maintained by the STF plenary,' Moraes declared.

**Moraes Accused of Abusing Power as Supreme Court Minister**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes is being accused of mixing his role as a judge with that of an investigator in the inquiry into fake news and digital militias. This comes after the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper revealed conversations between Moraes and his advisors, showing that they used the Electoral Court's (TSE) anti-disinformation department as an investigative arm of Moraes' office between August 2022 and March 2023. According to the conversations, Moraes' advisors produced reports against allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The repercussions of the conversations have led to a new push by Bolsonaro's allies in Congress to impeach Moraes, with Senator Damares Alves stating that Moraes should resign from the Supreme Court. 'The magistrado must renounce his seat on the Court,' she said.

**José Medeiros Defends Impeachment of Alexandre de Moraes**
Federal Deputy José Medeiros (PL-MT) has submitted a request to the Chamber of Deputies' Constitutional, Justice, and Citizenship Commission to summon Supreme Court Justice Airton Vieira, former TSE Chief of Staff Eduardo Tagliaferro, and journalists Fabio Serapião and Glenn Greenwald. The goal of the summons is to investigate the disclosure of conversations that, according to Medeiros, reveal a supposed conspiracy to create reports by the TSE that would later be used by Minister Alexandre de Moraes to make decisions against Bolsonarists in the Fake News inquiry at the STF, during and after the 2022 elections. Medeiros, a leader of the opposition in the Federal Chamber, also requested the summons of Fabio Serapião and Glenn Greenwald due to information that the two journalists possess six gigabytes of conversations exchanged between assessors of Moraes from both tribunals, at the time when the minister held positions in the STF and TSE. 'The summons of the aforementioned individuals aims to clarify this scandal, which affects the Justice and democracy in Brazil. The conversations show that, at the time, the President of the TSE, the highest authority in elections, had assessors use public resources to persecute Bolsonaro supporters. If this scandal goes unpunished, our entire Judiciary will be tainted, and that's not fair to other magistrates,' says Medeiros. He also mentioned the 2022 electoral process. 'We had an election where the balance was tilted, and no one doubts it.' After the approval of the request in the CCJ, the testimonies will be officially scheduled. Medeiros is part of a group of parliamentarians who defend the impeachment of Minister Alexandre de Moraes. On Wednesday (15), senators and federal deputies announced that they will file a collective impeachment request against the STF Minister on September 9. They have already started collecting signatures for the document. 'We will ask the President of the Senate to open this impeachment process to investigate everything that has been happening in Brazil since 2022. Popular pressure will be fundamental to rescue our country's democracy,' concludes José Medeiros.

**Moraes' Advisors' Messages Cause Embarrassment to the STF**
The role of Minister Alexandre de Moraes, of the Supreme Federal Court (STF), in defending Brazilian democracy during the 2022 elections is undeniable. His decisions ensured the right to vote and thwarted a post-election coup attempt. However, the messages exchanged by his advisors, revealed this week by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, are cause for concern. As one of his advisors said, 'it was a great day' is not relevant here, but the fact that his advisors were involved in actions that could be seen as undermining the democratic process is. The exchange of messages by his advisors is an embarrassment to the STF.

**Moraes defends use of TSE as investigative arm, calls denunciations 'fraudulent'**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes stated that the use of the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) as an investigative arm of the Supreme Court was the 'easier path' for investigation, as the Federal Police (PF) was not cooperating at the time. Moraes said that it would be 'schizophrenic' for him to investigate himself as the TSE president, but that he had the power to order the preparation of reports. He claimed that the sharing of evidence was a legitimate means of investigation and that the reports were sent to the Public Prosecutor's Office (PGR) and the PF for further investigation. Moraes described the denunciations as 'fraudulent' and stated that there was nothing to 'hide'. He argued that the reports were a 'massive production of fake news' to discredit the Supreme Court, the 2022 elections, and Brazilian democracy. Moraes cited the case of the 'fugitive journalist' Rodrigo Constantino, stating that all documents were documented in the STF and TSE. He concluded that there was nothing to hide, as all documents were already being investigated and resources against his decisions were maintained by the STF plenary.

**Brazilian Minister Accused of Abusing Power to Investigate Political Opponents**
Alexandre de Moraes, a minister of the Supreme Court of Brazil, has been accused of abusing his power by ordering reports from the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to investigate and prosecute his political opponents. The reports were allegedly used to justify measures such as canceling passports, blocking social media accounts, and summoning people for questioning. The accusations are based on leaked messages from Moraes' assistants, which show that he was directly involved in the selection of targets and the content of the reports. The minister's defense is that he was exercising his power of police, which allows him to investigate and prosecute crimes during election periods. However, many jurists argue that this is an abuse of power and that Moraes is violating the principle of the accusatory system, which requires that the judge be impartial and not take an active role in investigations. The accusations have sparked a debate about the limits of the power of the judiciary and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the use of investigative powers.

He was a member of the Federal Public Ministry at the time and already said, 'One cannot, who entered after the 1988 Constitution, accumulate positions.' Then he resigned.' However, a report by the Folha newspaper revealed that Moraes used the TSE's disinformation combat sector as an investigative arm of his office in the STF, as shown by leaked messages from 2022, a time when Brazil was in the midst of an election.

Other ministers of the Supreme Court, such as Luís Roberto Barroso and Gilmar Mendes, defended Alexandre, saying that the criticism was unfounded and that he had acted properly in his role as president of the TSE.

**Brazilian Minister Alexandre de Moraes Accused of Requesting Informal Reports on Bolsonaro Allies**
Brazilian Minister of Justice Alexandre de Moraes has been accused of requesting informal reports on allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro at least 20 times between August 2022 and May 2023. According to the minister's office, the requests were made as part of the investigation into fake news and digital militias, and were 'official, regular, and properly documented' in the ongoing investigations at the Supreme Federal Court (STF). However, a report by the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo claims to have obtained 6 gigabytes of messages and files that show Moraes acting 'outside the proper procedure' to obtain data and reports on specific targets. The report alleges that Moraes and his assistants, including STF judge Airton Vieira and former TSE advisor Eduardo Tagliaferro, requested reports on individuals such as economist Rodrigo Constantino, who is a Bolsonaro supporter. Moraes has denied any wrongdoing, stating that the TSE acted within its 'police powers' to produce reports on illicit activities, and that the reports were simply a description of publicly available social media posts. 'The reports simply described the illicit posts made on social media, in an objective manner, as they were directly related to the investigations into digital militias,' Moraes said. 'Several of these reports were attached to these investigations and others connected to them, and sent to the Federal Police for further investigation, always with the knowledge of the Attorney General's Office.'

**Moraes Denies Any Wrongdoing in Handling of Investigations**
Minister Alexandre de Moraes stated that there is nothing to hide regarding the handling of the investigations under his supervision. He made this statement during a speech at the Supreme Court, in response to a report by Folha that he had informally used the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) to investigate Bolsonaristas. Moraes claimed that the reports are 'false interpretations' and that these interpretations produce what the country should combat, which are false news. He said, 'There is nothing to hide. All official documents gathered in the investigation, which are being handled by the PF, were already being investigated in previous inquiries, with the Procuradoria accompanying. And all resources against my decisions, including the addition of these reports, were maintained by the plenary of the STF.' Moraes also stated that these interpretations regarding the handling of the processes can be made in good or bad faith. He said, 'What is seen from yesterday to today is a massive production of fraudulent news to again try to discredit the STF, the 2022 elections, and Brazilian democracy.' The minister defended his actions and stated that 'it would be schizophrenic for me, as the president of the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral at the time, to self-appoint myself.' According to Moraes, the 'most efficient path for the investigation at that time was to request [reports] from the TSE' and that 'at that time, the Federal Police were not very cooperative.'

**Moraes Orders Arrest of Far-Right Bloggers Allan dos Santos and Oswaldo Eustáquio**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes ordered the arrest of far-right bloggers Allan dos Santos and Oswaldo Eustáquio on August 14, 2024. Both are considered fugitives from justice. The arrest warrants and search and seizure orders were issued by the Federal Police. The operation, dubbed 'Disque 100', is related to a service for reporting human rights violations and is being monitored by the Brasília Child Protection Council. Moraes also authorized the blocking of Senator Marcos Do Val's social media accounts and a R$ 50 million bank freeze. Do Val is suspected of obstructing justice after posting on social media about Federal Police delegate Fábio Schor, who is leading the investigations against Jair Bolsonaro. Do Val wrote, 'He is responsible for imprisoning innocent patriots and making thousands of children cry because of their parents' absence.' The Federal Police stated that Do Val used the condition of minority to hide his true authorship of the material, and that he may be charged with corruption of minors, disclosure of secrets, and obstruction of investigation into organized crime.

**Alexandre de Moraes Faces 22 Impeachment Requests in the Senate**
Brazilian Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes is facing 22 impeachment requests in the Senate, with 20 targeting him directly. Despite the numerous petitions, it has never been opened a Senate impeachment process against a Supreme Court minister. The requests have increased in frequency since the election of a more representative Bolsonarista Senate bench in 2022. Moraes is under investigation for several cases, including the fake news inquiry, the Saudi jewels case, and the acts of anti-democratic behavior that led to the invasion and destruction of the three powers' headquarters on January 8, 2023. To remove Moraes from office, 54 Senate votes would be required, a number that even his own supporters admit is difficult to achieve. As of now, the Bolsonarista bench has an estimated 30 loyal votes. According to Senator Flávio Dino's approval vote, which passed with 47 votes in favor, 31 against, and 2 abstentions in December 2023, the Bolsonarista bench's influence is limited. This is why former President Bolsonaro is betting on increasing the right-wing bench in the 2026 elections, when 2/3 of the seats will be renewed.

Federal Deputy Nikolas Ferreira (PL-MG) used the Câmara dos Deputados podium on Tuesday (13) to demand actions against Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes due to the alleged use of the Electoral Justice against allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro. 'The STF needs to take decisions against Minister Alexandre de Moraes, and be brave men, with a strong character, because that's what Brazil needs. Alexandre de Moraes, you coward, asks to leave this chair,' Nikolas said. According to a report by Folha de S. Paulo, Moraes' orders were given informally through WhatsApp messages between August 2022 and May 2023, a period in which the minister was the president of the Superior Electoral Court (TSE). Nikolas defended that Moraes should be prevented from judging actions in the STF against people on the right, including those imprisoned for participating in the January 8th anti-democratic acts. 'I'm not surprised that the left is silent. I'm warning: those who love dictators will soon be their victims,' Nikolas said. He added: 'Minister Alexandre de Moraes, from today on, more than ever, needs to become a suspect in any process involving people on the right, Bolsonarists, from January 8th regarding amnesty. After all, it has been shown that he made the reports.' Nikolas concluded: 'In any country with a solid democracy, Minister Alexandre de Moraes would resign out of shame or, then, suffer impeachment from the National Congress.'

**Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes Orders Release of Filipe Martins**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes accepted the opinion of the Attorney General's Office (PGR) and ordered the release of Filipe Martins, former international affairs advisor to ex-President Jair Bolsonaro. Martins was one of the targets of Operation Tempus Veritatis, which investigated a supposed attempt to stage a coup during Bolsonaro's government. He had been in preventive detention since February 8. The decision was made after the PGR presented two opinions defending Martins' provisional freedom based on a document from the TIM SA mobile operator. The document showed that Martins was in Brazil at the end of 2022, when Bolsonaro traveled to the US. Martins is accused by the Federal Police (PF) of being part of the 'legal nucleus' of the group suspected of trying to stage a coup after the 2022 elections. The PF's arrest request pointed out that Martins traveled at the end of Bolsonaro's government 'without leaving the country with his passport' to 'avoid the application of penal law'. Moraes, the rapporteur of the investigation in the Supreme Court, maintained Martins' detention on May 10. However, Martins' defense presented receipts from iFood, bank movement records, and a domestic travel document that showed he had made a trip the day after the date investigators claimed he had traveled to the US. Martins' defense also presented flight tickets from Latam from Brasília to Curitiba on December 31, to argue that he remained in Brazil. Martins was released after Moraes accepted the PGR's opinion, and he will have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet, have his passport canceled, and is prohibited from using social media under penalty of a R$ 20,000 fine per post. Moraes considered that the detention was 'reasonable, proportional, and adequate to ensure the proper collection of evidence, in the search for delimiting all the criminal conduct pointed out by the Federal Police and the penal responsibility of the various nuclei of the criminal organization'. The minister also considered that, in the current moment of the process, the PF's investigations no longer justify the maintenance of preventive detention, as there are no longer any exceptional circumstances that justify the restriction of freedom of movement for investigative purposes. Martins was released after an imbróglio involving the electronic ankle bracelet he will have to wear.

**Alexandre de Moraes Under Fire: STF's Inability to Resolve Retiree Issue**
Alexandre de Moraes, a Minister of the Supreme Federal Court (STF), has been a prominent figure in Brazil. However, a recent announcement involving the STF has caused a stir, affecting retirees in 2024. According to the Folha de S. Paulo, the STF has been unable to reach a consensus on the issue, which dates back to the late 1980s. The government implemented several economic plans to combat inflation, including the Bresser, Verão, Collor 1, and Collor 2 plans. These plans were meant to correct the savings of thousands of Brazilians, many of whom are now retirees, who have filed lawsuits against banks to be reimbursed. Despite the case reaching the STF in 2009, the court has yet to deliver a verdict, leaving thousands of retirees waiting for 15 years. As the STF is known for resolving an average of 70,000 cases annually, this delay is unprecedented. Alexandre de Moraes, who has always been in favor of retirees, is now facing criticism for his inability to resolve the issue. The situation remains unresolved in 2024.

**Moraes Orders Release of Silvinei Vasques with Electronic Ankle Bracelet**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes has ordered the release of former Polícia Rodoviária Federal (PRF) Director-General Silvinei Vasques, who has been in prison for nearly a year for allegedly interfering in the 2022 elections. Moraes believes that Vasques' freedom no longer poses a risk to the investigation and has imposed a series of precautionary measures. Vasques will have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet and is prohibited from using social media and carrying a weapon. His passport has also been cancelled. Vasques was the main target of the Operation Constitution Citizen, an offensive launched in August last year to investigate the alleged use of public resources to interfere in the second round of the 2022 election. Vasques took over as PRF Director-General in April 2021, when former Justice Minister Anderson Torres was appointed, who is also under investigation for alleged omission in the face of the January 8 coup. Vasques retired in December last year at the age of 47, amidst a series of investigations into his actions during the election period. Just before the election, he even used his account to ask for votes for then-President Jair Bolsonaro, posting a photo of the Brazilian flag and writing: 'Vote 22, Bolsonaro president'.

**Moraes' Growing Influence: A New Era for the Brazilian Intelligence Agency**
The appointment of a Federal Police delegate to lead the General Corregedoria of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (Abin) increases the influence of Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes. In less than a year, Moraes has placed two allies on the Superior Electoral Court, and has been a guarantor for the nominations of Paulo Gustavo Gonet Branco for Attorney General of the Republic and Flávio Dino for the Supreme Court. Gonet defended that Bolsonaro should be condemned to eight years of ineligibility for abuse of political power and improper use of communication means for the meeting with ambassadors at the Alvorada Palace in 2022. He also defended Bolsonaro's ineligibility for turning the Independence Day celebrations into a political platform for re-election. The article highlights Moraes' increasing influence and the investigation into the 'Abin parallel' structure, which monitored politicians, judges, and journalists during the Bolsonaro government.

**Alexandre de Moraes Defends New 'Mentalidade' and Technology Against Judicialization**
Minister Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) emphasized the importance of a new 'mentalidade' and technology to reduce judicialization in Brazil. He attributed the high volume of legal disputes to a Brazilian mentality of always seeking justice in higher instances to prolong conflict resolution. Moraes believes that a change in mentality is necessary to ensure greater judicial security and speed. He also highlighted the potential of technology, such as artificial intelligence, to analyze resources and precedents, facilitating the resolution of conflicts. The event, held at the Casa LIDE in São Paulo, also featured other notable speakers, including former President Michel Temer and Josué Gomes da Silva, president of the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (FIESP). They discussed the need for greater judicial security to attract investments and reduce the cost of capital in Brazil.

**Moraes: 'Não há uma Justiça de tão fácil acesso como a brasileira'**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes defended the Brazilian Judiciary's tools for accessing information, stating that the Justice system is 'extremely cheap' which allows cases to drag on for years. He emphasized that there is no Justice system as easily accessible as the Brazilian one, comparing it to the English Supreme Court, which is 'extremely accessible in terms of speed and cheap for those who want to litigate for years'. Moraes also suggested increasing fines for litigious behavior, stating that a greater sense of judicial security is a responsibility of all. He believes that the Brazilian Justice system is 'extremely cheap' for those who want to enter and litigate, despite lawyers often complaining when costs increase.

**Supreme Court Minister Allows Ex-PRF Director to Take Bar Exam from Prison**
Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes allowed the temporary release of former PRF (Federal Highway Police) director Silvinei Vasques to take the 41st Unified Bar Exam, a test required for lawyers in Brazil. Vasques is currently imprisoned in the Papuda Penitentiary Complex in Brasília. The exam will be held on July 28 and September 22. Moraes stated that Vasques can take the exam at the location where he is being held, as this was previously allowed during his participation in the 39th Bar Exam in 2023. The address where he will take the exam must be indicated by the exam committee by July 26. Vasques was arrested as part of Operation Constitution Citizen, which also targeted 10 search and seizure warrants against PRF agents who worked with him in Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, the Federal District, and Rio Grande do Norte. The operation aimed to investigate crimes such as prevarication, political violence, and electoral fraud.

**Minister Alexandre de Moraes Lifts Secrecy on Audio Conversation with Ramagem and Bolsonaro**
Brazilian Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes lifted the secrecy on a potentially recorded audio conversation between former ABIN director Alexandre Ramagem, President Jair Bolsonaro, and Minister of Institutional Security General Augusto Heleno, discussing the 'rachadinhas' case involving Flávio Bolsonaro. The conversation was cited in a Federal Police representation in the investigation into the 'ABIN parallel' during Bolsonaro's government. The operation, launched on July 11, arrested agents working directly for Ramagem, who is now a federal deputy and a candidate for Rio de Janeiro mayor. Ramagem denied for the first time on July 12 that he had acted to help Senator Flávio Bolsonaro in the 'rachadinha' case, stating, 'There is no interference or influence in a process linked to Senator Flávio Bolsonaro. The demand was resolved exclusively in judicial instance.'
