**Putin Accuses Ukraine of Attempting to Target Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of attempting to target the Kursk nuclear power plant, which is expected to be visited soon by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi. Putin said during a meeting with government officials and regional governors, 'The enemy tried to hit the nuclear power plant at night.' However, Putin did not provide details or direct evidence of this claim. He stated that the IAEA was 'informed' of this attack and 'promised to send experts to assess the situation.' The IAEA issued a statement saying that Moscow informed them of finding 'scattered fragments' about 100 meters from a nuclear fuel storage facility at the Kursk plant. Ukraine began a large-scale attack on the border region on August 6, capturing dozens of villages and hundreds of square kilometers. The Kursk nuclear power plant is located about 50 kilometers from Ukrainian military positions. A spokesperson for the IAEA previously told AFP that Grossi would visit the Russian nuclear power plant 'next week.' Russia has been warning of the 'risk' of a nuclear catastrophe since days ago if the Ukrainian army attacks the plant. The IAEA called for 'maximum restraint' in the vicinity of the site 'to avoid a nuclear accident with serious radioactive consequences.' Since the start of the Russian war on Ukraine in early 2022, the IAEA has regularly warned of the risk of a nuclear accident, particularly at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, which was captured by Russian forces in March 2022 and repeatedly targeted by exchange fire between Kyiv and Moscow. The Kursk plant administration confirmed in October 2023 that it was targeted by three Ukrainian raids, but did not result in casualties or damage.

**Kursk Nuclear Power Plant on High Alert as Ukraine Conflict Escalates**
The city of Kurchatov, where the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is located, and several nearby districts in the Kursk region of Russia were left without electricity on August 9th. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, one of the largest in Russia, is a critical infrastructure target that some analysts believe could be a possible goal of the ongoing Ukrainian military operation. The plant has two operational reactors with a total capacity of 2 GW, and is currently building new reactors. The plant generates 90% of the industrial energy consumption in the Kursk region. Russian media reports that the plant is being prepared for defense, with Russian security forces blocking access to the plant and removing male staff, leaving only female guards. The plant's management has recommended that staff take paid leave and evacuate their children. Rosatom has confirmed that the number of builders at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant-2 has been reduced. Ukrainian drones have attacked the plant, with a drone hitting a transformer substation, causing a fire and leaving several districts without electricity. The Economist, citing a source in the Ukrainian General Staff, considers it unlikely that the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant will be captured. The source believes that the Ukrainian military would need to advance 80 km from the border and mobilize more forces to achieve this goal, which would be a repeat of the mistake made by Russian forces north of Kyiv in 2022.

**The Economist: Capture of Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by Ukrainian Forces Unlikely**
The Economist believes that the Ukrainian forces' capture of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is unlikely, as it would require a 60-kilometer march and more forces than currently available. According to a source in the Ukrainian General Staff, 'It is unlikely because we would need to march 80 kilometers from the border and have larger forces (the distance to the plant from the border is approximately 60 kilometers - ed.). Without properly organized forces, we would repeat the mistakes made by the Russians north of Kyiv in 2022. We cut off their lines, and they became an easy prey.' The source also suggests that a more realistic goal is to create a 'buffer zone' on the border territory of Russia, which would help in negotiations. The Economist also notes that 'direct attention' is being paid to the gas pumping station in Sudzha, the only working point of entry for Russian gas into the Progress pipeline in Europe. However, it is unclear what control over the station would bring to Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia are interested in its continuous and uninterrupted operation, considering the transportation fee paid by Ukraine and the financial difficulties of Russian 'Gazprom', which is struggling under sanctions. The Economist notes that the ultimate goals of the Ukrainian command are still unclear, but 'at such high stakes, the career of General Syrskyi may well be on the line.' Meanwhile, among the Rosgvardiya personnel guarding the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, there are only women left, and the plant's management has no plan in case of an attack. According to an employee of the plant, 'The 'tanks' have moved closer to the station. They are constantly shooting. The station's security is usually led by warrant officers of the Rosgvardiya. Now, only women are sitting there, apparently, they have taken all the men and sent them there.'

**Kursk Nuclear Power Plant at Risk: Ukrainian Forces Advance on Russian Territory**
Russian forces are concerned that Ukrainian forces may capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Kurchatov, located approximately 60 km from the Ukrainian-Russian border. The city of Sudzha, the main target of the Ukrainian operation, is located less than 10 km from the border, according to Google Maps. The distance from Sudzha to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is around 90 km via the R-200 highway. Russian propagandist Yuri Kotenok previously suggested that the Ukrainian forces' goal is to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant and exchange it for the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the operation in the Kursk region of Russia as of August 7. Russian propagandists claim that Ukrainian forces have broken through the border in several locations, advancing around 15 km in a day. As of the evening of August 6, Russian forces reported the presence of Ukrainian forces in 11 settlements: Lubimovka, Obukhovka, Pokrovskoye, Zeleny Shlyakh, Tolsty Lug, Nizhny Klin, Nikolaev-Darino, Darino, Sverdlykovo, and Lebedevka. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the events in the Kursk region 'another large-scale provocation by the Kiev regime.'

**Ukrainian Military Plans to Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
The Ukrainian military is reportedly planning to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, located 80 km from the city of Sudja, in the Kursk region. The plant has been a target of Ukrainian military operations, with Russian sources claiming that over 300 Ukrainian soldiers and equipment have been spotted in the area. The region has seen an increase in civilian casualties, with 28 people injured in the Sudja and Korenev regions. Ukrainian social media channels have shared footage of allegedly captured Russian soldiers, while also circulating a deepfake video of the regional governor, Alexei Smirnov, urging men over 18 to take up arms. This comes after reports of three conscripts from the Ural region being killed in the Belgorod region while carrying out orders from their superiors.

**Kursk and Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plants: A Threat to Russia's Economy**
The capture of the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants by Russia has significant economic implications for the country. The Kursk plant, with a capacity of 4 GW, supplies electricity to five Russian regions, including Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Tambov, and Lipetsk. If the plant is destroyed, it would affect the operation of several key industries, including the Oskol Electrometallurgical Plant, which is the only plant in Russia that produces metal without impurities. The plant is also a major supplier of metal to the automotive and defense industries. The Novolipetsk Metallurgical Plant, which is owned by Vladimir Lisin, a close associate of Putin, would also be severely affected. The plant is one of the largest in Russia and produces coking coal, cast iron, and steel. The capture of the Zaporizhzhia plant, with a capacity of 6 GW, has already resulted in significant economic losses for Ukraine, with a loss of over 210 billion hryvnias in revenue since its capture in March 2022. The plant's operation has been severely disrupted, and its restart is planned for May 2024. The capture of either plant poses a significant risk of a nuclear disaster and would have severe economic consequences for Russia.

**Russia Advances on Key Ukrainian Hub, Nuclear Safety Concerns Grow**
Russia has claimed the capture of the village of Svyrydonivka, about 15 kilometers from the city of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub in eastern Ukraine. The city has been a Russian target for months. The Russian army has reportedly taken control of several villages in the region in recent days. The advance is a sign of continued pressure on the eastern front, despite Ukraine's surprise counterattack in the Russian region of Kursk since August 6. While the counterattack has drawn significant attention, most fighting is still taking place in the Ukrainian Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces face a much larger Russian army. If Pokrovsk falls, Ukraine will be in serious trouble in the east. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned that the safety situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has deteriorated. On Saturday morning, a drone attack occurred near the plant. 'An explosive device carried by the drone detonated just outside the protected area of the plant,' the IAEA said. The explosion occurred near essential cooling water reservoirs and about 100 meters from the high-voltage power line. The agency repeated its call for 'maximum restraint' from both warring parties. So far, the call has fallen on deaf ears: fighting in the area has intensified in recent weeks. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, located in Russian-occupied Ukraine near the front line, has been shut down, but the reactors must still be cooled for safety reasons. Meanwhile, the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom has also sounded the alarm over the situation at the Kursk nuclear power plant. Ukraine has launched an offensive in the region, and according to the Russians, rocket components were recently found on the plant's grounds. Rosatom has invited IAEA inspectors to visit the site to assess the situation.

**Alaudinov: Ukraine's Forces Failed to Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
General Alaudinov stated that the Ukrainian military, with over 11,000 troops and a significant amount of equipment, failed to capture the Kursk nuclear power plant in Kursk region by August 11. According to Alaudinov, 'You have 11,600 or 11,900 people, and the number of tanks and equipment you used, and you still didn't accomplish the task.' The general emphasized that Ukraine has 'thrown all its resources into the fire, from which they will not escape.' He added that a significant portion of Ukrainian equipment has been destroyed. Alaudinov also stated that Russian forces are completing the blockade of Ukrainian troops in the region and will soon launch a large-scale attack to eliminate the remaining Ukrainian forces.

**Ukrainian Forces Planned to Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, Says Russian Commander**
According to General-Major Apty Alaudinov, the commander of the 'Akhmat' special forces, the Ukrainian Armed Forces planned to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by August 11 and then issue an ultimatum to Russia. However, this plan failed. Alaudinov stated, '11th, we needed to take the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. Today is the 14th.' He also mentioned that the majority of the Ukrainian military equipment has been destroyed, and they have suffered significant losses in personnel. Alaudinov said, 'The blitzkrieg of Zelensky, which was planned with the capture of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant and already issuing an ultimatum to leave and do something else, did not succeed.' He added that the situation in the region is under control, and Russian troops are completing the blockade of Ukrainian forces that have entered the territory. 'We are gradually closing all the gaps that were there,' Alaudinov said. He also stated that Ukrainian forces are beginning to 'dig in' in the border areas of the region to avoid destruction, and they no longer have the 'desire to rush headlong'.

**Russia digging trenches at nuke plant amid fears Ukraine will seize reactor**
Russia is building trenches around the Kursk nuclear plant, fearing Ukraine could capture its reactors. Ukraine's army has reportedly infiltrated 20km into Russian territory, leaving Putin 'scared and seething'. Satellite images show trenches being built near the plant, and military reinforcements are being sent to the area. If Ukraine were to capture the site, it would be a valuable negotiating chip. However, fighting around the plant would increase the risk of a nuclear incident. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi has warned both sides to show restraint. Meanwhile, desperate Russian mothers are pleading with Putin to honour his promise not to send conscript sons to their deaths. Ukraine has continued its blitz of Kursk, with recent strikes causing power outages and a giant fireball blast on a gas rig in the Black Sea. Putin has faced further humiliation after footage of his men surrendering to Ukraine was released.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance on Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
Ukrainian forces have been increasingly boldly attacking Russian positions, with the latest evidence being the ongoing offensive in the Kursk region. Ukrainian troops have already captured the city of Sudża, and are now advancing towards the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. The plant is a significant facility, and it is unclear whether Ukrainian forces can reach it. The Ukrainian military has been conducting offensive operations in the Russian-occupied Kursk region for several days, despite Russian efforts to halt their advance. The exact goal of the operation is unclear, but some speculate that Ukrainian forces aim to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, which is located approximately 110 km from the Ukrainian border and 40 km from the city of Kursk.

**Ukrainian Military Analyst: Capturing Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Not a Priority**
Military analyst Oleksiy Hetman stated on 'Kyiv24' that it's not worth expecting the capture of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by Ukrainian forces. 'We cannot do this,' he said. However, Hetman suggested that it's possible to try to surround the plant, create a certain zone, and leave it without power, then transfer power from the Kursk plant to Ukraine's own power grid, as they have lost a significant amount of electricity. Hetman estimated that the distance is 22 kilometers, making it a feasible option. When asked how long Ukrainian forces could maintain control, Hetman replied, 'Infinite.' It's worth noting that the mayor of the Russian city of Kurchatov, where the Kursk plant is located, stated that fighting is taking place several dozen kilometers away from the city.

**Ukraine's Kursk Nuclear Power Plant Capture: A Less Likely Scenario**
According to The Economist, it is unlikely that the Ukrainian forces will capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. The publication suggests that a more realistic goal may be to create an 'uncomfortable buffer zone' for the Kremlin, similar to Russia's attempts to create such a zone in the north of Kharkiv Oblast. A source in the Ukrainian General Staff stated, 'Without properly organized forces, you will repeat the mistakes that the Russians made north of Kyiv in 2022. We cut them off from the front line, and they became an easy target.' The Economist notes that Ukraine's decision to deploy mechanized forces, including tanks, will complicate its logistical problem: armored vehicles require a lot of fuel and maintenance. Creating a buffer zone could also become a bargaining chip in future negotiations. Additionally, Ukraine's control of the territory would be a public slap in the face to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

**Russia Fears Ukrainian Forces May Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
Russian forces are trying to 'feel out' the direction of the main Ukrainian attack in the Kursk region. A Russian military correspondent has expressed concern that the Ukrainian forces may capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Kurchatov. According to him, if the Ukrainian forces begin to move in this direction, it will become clear that their intention is to create a direct threat to the city of Kurchatov with the aim of capturing Rylsk and Sudzha. The Russian military correspondent believes that the Ukrainian military is trying to capture the nuclear power plant in Kurchatov in order to later exchange it for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russia. 'It is necessary to calculate the actions of the enemy. I recall that the NPP in g. Kurchatov - this object has long been the subject of the aspirations of the military leadership of the Ukrainian nationalists and their curators. Attention should be paid to the situation in the direction of Glukhov - Rylsk. If the enemy takes active actions precisely in this direction, which cannot be ruled out, then the final goal of the entire operation of the VSU will become clear - the city of Kurchatov, the nuclear power plant. Such an answer for ZAES and previously for ChAES. The logic is as follows - take Kurchatov and conduct a trade with Russia on Energodar with ZAES and anything else,' - he said. The Kursk Nuclear Power Plant is a functioning NPP located in the city of Kurchatov, Kursk Oblast, Russia, on the Seim River, 40 km from Kursk. The station consists of four power blocks with a total capacity of 4 GW. The Kursk NPP became the second station with RBMK-1000 reactors after the Leningrad NPP, launched in 1973. Its design is similar to the Chernobyl NPP. Previously, it was reported that explosions were heard in the city of Kurchatov, Kursk Oblast, near the Kursk NPP. The Russian Ministry of Defense and local authorities have not commented on the situation. According to OBOZ.UA, there are currently battles between Russian occupiers and unknown forces in the Kursk region. They claim that there has been a 'breakthrough in several sections of the state border' by VSV forces. Ukrainian defenders have not officially confirmed this.
