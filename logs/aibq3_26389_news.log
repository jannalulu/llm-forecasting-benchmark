**Fed faces wave of data before deciding on end-of-summer rate cut**
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its July 30-31 meeting, but may change its policy statement to lay the groundwork for a rate cut in September. The Fed is waiting for data to accumulate before making a decision, with the next meeting scheduled for September 17-18. The data will include inflation and labor market reports, which will help the Fed determine if the economy is cooling down and if rate cuts are necessary. New York Fed President John Williams said, 'We're actually going to learn a lot between July and September.' The Fed has held its interest rate steady since last July, and is expected to start lowering rates if inflation continues to slow and the labor market remains in balance.

**US Federal Reserve may cut rates before inflation hits 2% target, Powell hints**
Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell hinted that the US interest rate may be cut before inflation reaches its 2% target. Powell stated that waiting until inflation reaches 2% may be too late, as the tightening of interest rates is still having an impact on inflation. Instead, policymakers are looking for 'greater confidence' that price inflation is trending towards the 2% target, which can be achieved with more good inflation data. Traders are betting on at least two rate cuts before the end of 2024, starting in September, which could result in a drop in the main federal funds rate from its current range of 5.25% to 5.50%.

**Fed Chairman Powell: Aiming to Lower Interest Rates Before the End of the Year**
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said during a speech at the Economic Club in Washington on Monday that the central bank is aiming to lower interest rates before the end of the year, based on recent economic data that has increased confidence. Powell praised the improvement in inflation readings, expressing increased confidence in the sustainability of the slowdown in inflation. He added that the Federal Reserve has not yet decided on the timing of the rate cut, but economists' forecasts indicate a cut in September, with additional cuts in November and December, according to CME data. Powell also emphasized that the labor market is slowing down, removing a major obstacle to monetary easing. The Federal Reserve's next meeting is scheduled for July 30-31, where the possibility of a rate cut will be discussed more extensively.

**Federal Reserve Preview: More Delays**
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5% and signal that September is the earliest opportunity to consider an interest rate cut. The dot plot, which outlines individual members' views on interest rates, is expected to show two rate cuts in 2024 and four in 2025. The Fed is likely to lower its 4Q GDP growth projection and raise its 4Q unemployment projection. The probability of lower GDP growth and higher unemployment is why the Fed is not expected to reduce its rate cut projections to just one 25bp rate cut. The May inflation data will influence the tone of the press conference, and the Fed is expected to take a more dovish stance if inflation remains sticky. The Fed believes monetary policy is restrictive and will consider easing if inflation pressures ease, labor market slack increases, and consumer spending softens. The reverse repo facility is expected to start falling again, which will tighten liquidity conditions. The yield direction is uncertain, and Treasuries need a material fall in inflation to prompt a rate-cutting rally. The dot plots are unlikely to give the dollar a lift, and EUR/USD is expected to trade around the 1.08 area into the French election on 30 June.

**Goldman Sachs: Fed to Keep Interest Rates Unchanged Until September**
Goldman Sachs economists have revised their forecast for the Federal Reserve to not cut interest rates before September, citing the economy's continued resilience. The bank's economists, led by Jan Hatzius, had previously predicted a rate cut in July, but now believe that the Fed will adopt a more cautious approach due to the economy's strong performance. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 4.48%, near its highest level in over a week, as investors became more convinced that the Fed will not cut rates soon. Goldman Sachs still expects two rate cuts by the end of 2024, with the second cut likely to occur in December.

**Fed faces wave of data before deciding on interest rate cut**
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its July 30-31 meeting, but its policy statement may lay the groundwork for a rate cut in September. The Fed's decision will depend on data showing continued progress in lowering inflation towards its 2% target and a labor market staying in balance. The seven-week gap between the July and September meetings allows for more data to accumulate, including the Kansas City Fed's annual research conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. New York Fed President John Williams said, 'We're actually going to learn a lot between July and September.' The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since last July, and officials are hopeful they will finish the inflation fight and start lowering rates without a substantial rise in joblessness.

**Fed Faces Series of Data Before Deciding on Interest Rate Cut**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to make a decision on interest rate cuts in September, with Jerome Powell, the Fed's chair, stating that it will be an 'important' change in monetary policy. The decision will depend on the behavior of economic data, including inflation and employment rates. The Fed has maintained its interest rate at 5.25% to 5.50% since its last meeting in July, but the next meeting may bring changes to the description of the economy and prospects for a rate cut. The seven-week interval between meetings allows for the accumulation of more data, including the annual Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. According to John Williams, the president of the New York Fed, 'we will know a lot between July and September'. The Fed believes that inflation will likely continue to slow down and that rate cuts will be appropriate if this happens. The inflation rate, based on the Fed's preferred price index, the PCE, was 2.6% in May, and many economists expect it to fall to 2.5% or less in June. The Fed will receive the July PCE reading on August 30, as well as two consumer price index reports on August 14 and September 11, covering July and August data. Despite earlier concerns that inflation was reaccelerating, recent data has shown a new slowdown. The labor market is considered to be in 'balance', with the number of available workers aligned with the demand for labor, and the growth of wages aligning with the Fed's inflation target. The current unemployment rate of 4.1% is approximately what the central bank considers sustainable in the long term with inflation at 2%, and the authorities are hopeful of being able to end the fight against inflation and start reducing interest rates without a significant increase in unemployment.

**Fed to Cut Interest Rates in September: What's the Outlook?**
The US Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates in September due to growing confidence in price stability and increased risks to the labor market. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has hinted at the possibility of a rate cut in his recent speeches, and it is expected that he will make a more explicit statement after the monetary policy meeting on July 30-31. However, the Fed still wants to see monthly price data continue to trend downwards towards its 2% annual inflation target before committing to reduce borrowing costs. Powell emphasized that the goal is not just to reduce inflation, but also to be aware of the labor market. The preferred inflation indicator has decreased to 2.6% and the labor market has cooled off to pre-pandemic levels. While officials describe the labor market as strong, they also say it may be approaching a turning point, with a steady decline in job openings and a gradual increase in unemployment. 'I think we're getting close to the moment when the central bank could justify a rate cut', said Fed Governor Christopher Waller. The labor market is at an 'optimal point', but the Fed needs to keep it there. 'There's more risk of an increase in unemployment than we've seen in a long time', he added.

**Fed Prepares for September Cut as Powell Shifts Focus to Jobs**
The Federal Reserve is preparing to cut interest rates in September, shifting its focus from inflation to the labor market. After over two years of prioritizing inflation, the Fed is gaining confidence that price stability is within reach. Chair Jerome Powell is expected to explicitly mention the rate cut after the July 30-31 policy meeting. However, the decision is not yet final, as Fed officials still want to see monthly job growth before making a move.

**IMF recommends waiting until end of 2024 for interest rate cut**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommends that the Federal Reserve wait until the end of 2024 before lowering interest rates. This is because it is expected that clearer signs of a sustainable decline in inflation to a target rate of two percent will become apparent by then. IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas had previously suggested waiting a bit longer before making a decision, but did not specify a timeframe. The IMF's report is based on Article IV of the IMF agreement, which outlines the principles for annual consultations with member countries. The US consumer price index showed a slower increase in June, with a rate of 3.0 percent, compared to May and April. This has led to speculation on financial markets that the Fed may lower interest rates in September. Currently, the Fed is keeping the key interest rate between 5.25 and 5.50 percent and is expected to keep it there until the end of the month.

**Fed Official Sees Potential for Rate Cut by September**
New York Federal Reserve President John Williams stated that the Federal Reserve is close to reducing interest rates, but a decision will not be made before the July 30-31 meeting. Williams emphasized that more data is needed to ensure that inflation is stable at the Fed's 2% target. The Fed has kept the benchmark interest rate between 5.25% and 5.5% since last year. However, with the recent developments showing a deflationary trend, markets are expecting a rate cut in September. According to the Fed's preferred gauge, inflation fell to 2.6% in May, a significant drop from the pandemic-era peak of 7.1%. The June inflation data, to be released on July 26, will provide more information on the direction of inflation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also contributed to the discussion, stating that he has some confidence in the second-quarter inflation data. Williams rejected the possibility of a rate cut in July, emphasizing that the period between July and September is critical for gathering additional inflation data. He also highlighted the widespread decline in inflation across various measures, stating that any area is not showing exceptional resistance to change. Williams remains optimistic about progress and potential policy adjustments in the coming months.

**Fed's John Williams Sees 'Positive' Inflation Data, But Wants More Evidence Before Cutting Rates**
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, John Williams, stated that the recent inflation data has been encouraging, but he wants to see more evidence in the next few months to gain the necessary confidence to reduce interest rates. Williams mentioned that the bank will learn 'a lot' between July and September, a month when interest rates are expected to be reduced. He also emphasized the importance of balancing the risks of keeping interest rates too high for too long, which could harm employment, against premature cuts and stagnation in progress in curbing price pressures. Williams reiterated the importance of achieving the 2% inflation target, saying that 'we will learn a lot between July and September' and that 'both objectives of our dual mandate are very present in my thinking about policy decisions, but it is absolutely essential that we can achieve this goal of making inflation return to 2%'.

**Fed's Waller says timing of rate cut 'drawing closer'**
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller stated that the timing of a potential interest rate cut is drawing closer, but the uncertainty about the economy's path makes it unclear when the rate will be lowered. Waller believes that the current data suggests a 'soft landing' is possible, where inflation declines without triggering a recession. He noted that the job market is in a good spot, with moderate job gains and an unemployment rate close to its long-run value. Waller outlined three scenarios for the economy's future, with the most optimistic scenario seeing continued declines in inflation, making a rate cut possible in the near future. However, he also mentioned that a more likely scenario would see uneven declines in inflation, making a rate cut uncertain. The Fed's next policy meeting is scheduled for July 30-31, and markets expect a rate cut to happen at the September meeting.

**FED Expected to Cut Interest Rates in September: CNBC**
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates in September, with a 100% probability according to CNBC. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 93.3% chance of a quarter-point reduction in the federal funds rate to between 5 and 5.25% in September, and a 6.7% chance of a half-point reduction. The catalyst for the change in probabilities was the June consumer price index, which showed a 0.1% decrease from the previous month, placing the annual inflation rate at 3%, the lowest in three years. The recent comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have also solidified the belief among operators that the central bank will act in September. Powell stated that the Fed would not wait for inflation to reach its 2% target before cutting rates, citing delayed effects of the adjustment. The next Fed decision on interest rates will be on July 31 and again on September 18.

**Markets Expect 100% Chance of Rate Cut in September**
Investors are now 100% certain that the Federal Reserve will start reducing interest rates during its September meeting. According to 'Fed Watch' data, investors expect a 91.4% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut, an 8.4% chance of a 50-basis-point cut, and a very low chance of a 75-basis-point cut. For this month's meeting, the most likely scenario (93.3%) suggests that the interest rate will remain within the range of 5.25% to 5.50% without change, with a weak possibility of a 25-basis-point cut. Consumer Price Index data for June, released last week, showed a 0.1% decrease from the previous month, with an annual inflation rate of 3%, the lowest level in three years. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments yesterday reinforced investors' expectations, as he stated that policymakers will not wait until inflation reaches the target of 2% before cutting interest rates.

**Fed Chief Jerome Powell Signals Potential Rate Cuts Amid Slowing Inflation**
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has hinted at potential interest rate cuts in a context of slowing inflation. The Fed is set to meet on July 30 and 31 to evaluate recent inflation data. Analysts expect a clear message in July, with rate cuts starting in September if the economy progresses as expected. The recent inflation data has led to a high probability of rate cuts in September, with over 90% chance according to the FedWatch tool. Powell has stated that new positive inflation data would open the door to reducing borrowing costs, but has not specified a timeline for such a decision. The Fed officials, including Powell, have expressed their intention to start reducing rates before inflation reaches 2%, to avoid the effects of delayed rate cuts on the economy. This week, several Fed officials will speak, including Adriana Kugler, Chris Waller, and John Williams, and their comments will be closely watched for indications on monetary policy adjustments.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US central bank will make interest rate decisions based on data and evolving outlook, not political factors. He pushed back on the idea that a September rate cut could be seen as a political act ahead of the fall presidential election. Powell emphasized the importance of the Fed's independence and its commitment to meeting its dual goals of price stability and full employment. He also expressed confidence in the economy's growth and low unemployment rate, but noted that inflation remains a concern. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for July 30-31, and further progress on inflation could lead to changes in its policy statement that pave the way for a September rate cut.

The Presidents of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed), Christine Lagarde and Jerome Powell, respectively, have ruled out the possibility of interest rate cuts before September. Lagarde emphasized that the ECB's work is not yet finished and that they will continue to monitor the situation closely. She also stated that the ECB will not stop until inflation returns to its target of 2%. Powell confirmed that inflation will not return to 2% this year, but possibly by the end of next year or in 2026. Both leaders emphasized the importance of being cautious and not making hasty decisions, with Powell stating that the Fed will continue to be 'data-oriented' in its decision-making process.

**Fed Sees Higher Chance of Interest Rate Cut in September**
The financial market sees a higher chance of the Federal Reserve (Fed) starting to cut interest rates in September and increased the probability of a 50-basis-point reduction in 2024 after the release of the US Consumer Price Index (PCE). The indicator is the preferred inflation measure of the US Federal Reserve and came in line with expectations. According to the CME Group's monitoring tool, the probability of a rate cut in September rose to 67.7%, from 64.1% before the data. This represents 61.1% probability of a 25-basis-point cut - for the range of 5.00% to 5.25% - and 6.6% probability of a 50-basis-point cut - for the interval of 4.75% to 5.00%. Until December, the probability of a 50-basis-point reduction advanced from 43% before the data to 45.4%. Meanwhile, the chance of maintaining interest rates in the current range, between 5.25% and 5.50%, fell from 7% to 5.2%.

**What to Expect from the Fed on Interest Rates for the Rest of 2024**
The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to reduce interest rates at least once in the remaining four meetings in 2024, according to the FedWatch tool from the CME, which tracks market-based expectations. The first rate cut could occur in September, with up to three cuts possible in 2024, although two cuts are considered the most likely. The FOMC's next meetings are scheduled for July 31, September 18, November 7, and December 18, with the September and December meetings including an update on economic projections. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, has stated that the economy is strong and that the committee can approach interest rate decisions with caution. The inflation rate has been declining, and the FOMC is expected to reduce interest rates as inflation approaches its 2% target. However, a significant and unexpected weakening of the labor market could also lead to a rate cut. Overall, it is expected that the FOMC will start reducing interest rates in 2024, possibly starting with a cut in September, followed by one or two more cuts in November or December.

**What To Expect From The Fed On Interest Rates For The Rest Of 2024**
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to cut interest rates at least once in 2024, with a possible total of up to three cuts. The first cut may occur in September, with two cuts being viewed as the most likely scenario. The FOMC has taken a cautious approach to rate cuts, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating that they have a strong economy and can approach the question carefully. The committee is focused on inflation, which is currently at 3.5%, and wants to ensure it is on a path to the 2% target before cutting rates. However, a significant weakening of the jobs market could prompt more aggressive rate cuts. As inflation moves closer to the target, rate cuts are likely, but this assumes no unexpected high inflation reports. The current expectation is that the FOMC will start cutting interest rates in 2024, possibly starting with a cut in September and followed by one or two more at the November or December meetings.

**Fed Will Cut Interest Rates — But When? Most Investors Agree It Won't Be July, Bank Of America Says**
According to Bank of America's monthly global fund manager survey, most investors believe the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates at least twice in the next year. The survey found that 84% of investors anticipate a rate cut in 2024, with 39% predicting a cut in September, 16% in November, and 23% in December. Only 6% believe a rate cut will occur as early as July. The Fed has maintained its benchmark policy rate in the 5.25%-5.5% range since July 2023 to counter inflationary pressures, and its projections indicate a median forecast of a single interest rate cut this year. Neel Kashkari, the President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, expects a rate cut 'toward the end of the year.' The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting will be held on July 30-31.

**What's Next for the Federal Reserve as Expectations for Interest Rate Cuts Mount?**
The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate unchanged for the seventh consecutive time, despite expectations of a rate cut due to softer inflation reports. Economists predict the earliest rate cut will be in September, but Fed officials are proceeding with caution. The Fed's median expectations for rate cuts have narrowed to just one cut this year, down from three previously expected. Traders have increased their expectations of a rate cut, with a 70% chance of a cut in September. However, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need for more confidence in inflation being sustainably at 2% before considering rate cuts. Other Fed officials have also reiterated the need for more data before making a decision. Economists believe there is still time for the Fed to regain confidence before September and expect rate cuts to come.

**US Federal Reserve Announces Only One Rate Cut in 2024**
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) has announced that it will only cut interest rates once in 2024, a departure from its previous forecast of three rate cuts. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the decision is based on data and that it may take longer for the Fed to have the confidence to begin easing monetary policy. The Fed also released new economic forecasts and slightly increased its inflation projections. Seven Fed officials expect only one rate cut, eight expect two, and four expect no rate cuts. The median forecast for the year is 5.1% (March: 4.6%), indicating a rate cut of 0.25 percentage points. Powell emphasized that this is a forecast and not a fixed plan. Analysts Paul Ashworth and Elmar Völker believe that the Fed's decision is influenced by the uncertain economic data and that the option of a rate cut in September is still on the table. The Fed's decision is influenced by the inflation rate, which is expected to be 2.6% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025.

**The Fed now expects just one interest rate cut this year — but there's still time for that to change, Powell says**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and projected only one interest rate cut for 2024. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left the door open for a potential rate cut in September, citing the need for more data to confirm inflation is moving sustainably towards the 2% target. Powell emphasized that the Fed's projections are subject to change and that a rate cut could happen if economic data improves. He also acknowledged the financial strains Americans face due to high inflation, but prioritized holding off on cutting rates until more data is available to avoid having to raise rates again later.

**Will the Fed cut rates at some point in 2024? This is what the experts say**
The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged for another month, citing an uncertain economic outlook. Experts had predicted rate cuts this year, but inflation remains elevated, and some Fed officials are hesitant to lower rates too soon. A Reuters poll of 116 economists found that nearly two-thirds expect the first rate cut to occur in September 2024, with 60% predicting two quarter-point rate cuts this year. However, some experts, like Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Bank of America, expect only one cut in December, citing the Fed's inflation forecast and the strong labor market. If the Fed does cut rates, it could provide relief for consumers and potentially lower mortgage rates from their current levels around 7%.

**US interest rate forecast to be cut just once in 2024**
The US Federal Reserve has updated its forecast, predicting only one interest rate cut in 2024, down from three cuts anticipated just three months ago. The decision comes as inflation falls to its lowest level in over three years, but the Fed requires more evidence of falling inflation before making cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that rates could be brought down if unemployment quickly increases. In contrast, the Bank of England is expected to cut rates three times this year, with the first cut expected in September. The US interest rate is currently a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, and the Fed does not set a specific figure.

**Two Interest-Rate Cuts in 2024 Are ‘Very Likely' After CPI, Carlyle's Thomas Says**
Carlyle Group's Jason Thomas believes that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates twice in 2024, citing a softer-than-expected consumer price index reading. Thomas, the head of global research and investment strategy, stated that 'September is in play' for the first rate cut, and that four rate cuts would be needed to bring the neutral rate down to 4.35%. He also expressed skepticism towards those who expect fewer than four cuts, saying that it would indicate an economic shock. The comments come ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and the release of its rate projections for the next two years.

**US Federal Reserve Decision To Be Out Today: Check India Timing, What's Expected?**
The US Federal Reserve is set to announce its interest rate decision today, with investors looking for clues on the timeline for rate cuts. The market is divided on whether the Fed will cut rates once or twice this year. The Fed's decision will be influenced by the May jobs report and upcoming inflation data. The bond market is predicting a 47.6% probability of a rate cut at the September 2024 meeting, with a 36.9% chance of at least two rate cuts by the end of the year. However, this timeline is contingent on continued positive inflation data and economic conditions. The Fed's rate policies have a significant impact on borrowing costs, and a downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer.

**Fed to Maintain Interest Rates, No Certainty on Rate Cuts in September**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to keep its interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, according to economists consulted by Estadão/Broadcast. Despite being widely expected, the decision will be closely watched due to the risks of inflation projections and the removal of rate cuts expected for 2024. Analysts point out that there is no certainty about rate cuts in September and that a stronger economic resilience may trigger a return to the tightening cycle. If confirmed, the Fed's decision will keep interest rates in the US between 5.25% and 5.50% per year. Economists expect little or no change in the monetary policy statement, with Fed officials reiterating their dependence on data for decision-making at each meeting.

**Fed Meeting: Interest Rate Cuts and Inflation Expectations**
The Federal Reserve of the United States (Fed) is holding a two-day meeting to discuss the possibility of reducing interest rates. Although no rate cuts are expected, the Fed may outline its plan for potential cuts later this year. The Fed has indicated that it needs to see several consecutive months of controlled inflation before reducing rates. Economists expect a change in the median forecast to two rate cuts this year, in September and December, rather than the three previously expected. However, there is a risk that the Fed may reduce its rate-cut expectations to only one. The Fed's decision will be closely watched, as it will send a strong message about its willingness to act on inflation. The meeting will also focus on the Fed's forecast and the labor market data, including the unemployment rate, which rose to 4% in May, the highest since January 2022.

**Fed May Cut Interest Rates in September, Experts Say**
Experts believe that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may reduce interest rates in September, with two rate cuts possible this year. Rabobank Senior US Strategist Philip Marey said that the Fed may cut rates in September and December, but there is a risk that rate cuts may be less frequent in the future. Marey noted that the US economy is likely to experience a slowdown in the second half of the year, which could lead to stagflation. He also mentioned that the May employment report may indicate that the economy is still strong, but the average hourly wage growth may slow down, which could lead to a decrease in inflation. Marey believes that the Fed may cut rates in September, but it's too early to say for sure. FWD Bonds Chief Economist Chris Rupkey said that the Fed's decision to cut rates is uncertain and may depend on the May inflation report, which will be released just before the Fed's decision. Berenberg Senior Economist Dr. Felix Schmidt said that the US economy is slowing down, but not showing any signs of decline. He believes that the Fed may not cut rates in the near future and may instead keep rates steady until the end of the year. Schmidt also predicted that the Fed may cut rates four times by the end of 2025, bringing the policy rate to 4.25-4.50%. ING Group International Chief Economist James Knightley said that the Fed may cut rates in 2024 and 2025, but the timing and frequency of the cuts are uncertain.

**Federal Reserve Preview: More Delays**
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5% and signal that September is the earliest opportunity to consider an interest rate cut. The dot plot, which outlines individual members' views on interest rates, is expected to show two rate cuts in 2024 and four in 2025. The Fed is likely to lower its 4Q GDP growth projection and raise its 4Q unemployment projection. The probability of lower GDP growth and higher unemployment is why the Fed is not expected to reduce its rate cut projections to just one 25bp rate cut. The May inflation data will influence the tone of the press conference, and the Fed is expected to take a more dovish stance if inflation remains sticky. The Fed believes monetary policy is restrictive and will consider easing if inflation pressures ease, labor market slack increases, and consumer spending softens. The reverse repo facility is expected to start falling again, which will tighten liquidity conditions. The yield direction is uncertain, and Treasuries need a material fall in inflation to prompt a rate-cutting rally. The dot plots are unlikely to give the dollar a lift, and EUR/USD is expected to trade around the 1.08 area into the French election on 30 June.

The Fed's decision is based on mixed economic data, with stalled progress against inflation and a robust labor market.

**Fed may wait to cut rates as job market stays strong**
The Federal Reserve is less likely to cut interest rates in September as the US job market remains strong. The latest job report showed a significant increase in nonfarm payrolls and higher-than-expected wage growth. The report implies a 53% chance of a rate cut by September, down from 70% before the report. The Fed has said it will wait for inflation to decline to 2% before cutting rates. The data suggests that inflationary pressures are increasing, not decreasing. Although the unemployment rate rose to 4%, the strong job growth defies expectations of a cooling labor market. Rate futures now show traders are less confident in multiple rate cuts by year's end, with a 50/50 chance of two rate cuts by the end of 2024.

**Fed Reduces Bets on Cutting Interest Rates in September**
The Federal Reserve reduced bets on cutting interest rates in September after the US government's employment report showed that employers created more jobs in May than expected. The US central bank is expected to keep its basic interest rate unchanged at 5.25% to 5.50% next week. Before the report, futures contracts indicated a 69% chance of a rate cut by September, compared to a 31% chance of a rate cut later in the year. After the report, which showed that employers created 272,000 jobs last month, futures contracts show only around 52% chance of a rate cut by September. Economists consulted by Reuters predicted the creation of 185,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from 120,000 to 258,000. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the labor market and economic growth to ensure that it does not keep interest rates too high for too long and does not cool the economy too much while trying to bring inflation back to its 2% target.

**Goldman Sachs pushes back predicted timing of possible Fed rate cut to September**
Goldman Sachs analysts have revised their prediction for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut, now expecting it to occur in September instead of July. This decision is based on comments from Fed officials and recent economic data, including stronger-than-expected business activity and lower unemployment benefit filings. The analysts believe that the Fed will wait for more evidence of sustainable cooling inflation before making a rate cut, and that September's consumer price index releases will be a key factor in their decision. They note that even if inflation improves by September, it will still be above the Fed's 2% target, making a rate cut less obvious.

**Goldman Sachs Expects First US Interest Rate Cut in September**
Goldman Sachs expects the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time in September, after previously expecting it to happen in July. The bank stated that recent statements from Fed officials suggest that a rate cut in July may require not only better inflation data but also signs of weakness in the labor market. Goldman Sachs still expects the Fed to cut interest rates twice this year, which means the next cut could be in December. The latest meeting of the Federal Reserve showed that policymakers are discussing whether the current interest rates are high enough to curb inflation. Some officials said they would be prepared to increase borrowing costs again if inflation rises, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and others have ruled out raising interest rates again. According to Jefferies International economist Aliya Mabdi, there will be no interest rate cut in the US before September 2024, expecting a weak US labor market in the summer season.

**Strong Economic Data is Making Interest Rate-Cut Timing Harder to Predict**
The Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates is becoming increasingly uncertain due to strong economic data. Recent reports showed a decline in initial jobless claims, a rise in the Purchasing Managers' Index, and an increase in new orders for durable goods. These numbers suggest that the economy is stronger than expected, which may delay the Fed's decision to cut rates. Traders are now pricing in a 51.3% chance of a rate cut in September, down from 65% a week ago. Some traders are even pricing in a small chance of a rate hike, which is unprecedented. The Fed's decision will depend on inflation data, and the latest numbers may not be enough to prompt a rate cut.

The bank's economists, led by Jan Hatzius, had previously predicted a rate cut in July, but now believe that the Fed will adopt a more cautious approach due to the economy's strong performance. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 4.48%, near its highest level in over a week, as investors became more convinced that the Fed will not cut rates soon. Goldman Sachs still expects two rate cuts by the end of 2024, with the second cut likely to occur in December.
