**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, sipping coffee)  
Will Magnus Carlsen win? Our models had it at 65.75%. His form was impeccable, but the Niemann controversy lingered.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Indeed. Nakamura was a tough contender. We had him at 25.50%. His past victories were hard to ignore.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(looking at notes)  
And Niemann? A wildcard at 7.25%. His past win over Carlsen was a shocker, but consistency was lacking.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(smiling)  
Firouzja, the rising star. Just 1.50%, but what potential! A future champion, perhaps?

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(glancing at a newspaper)  
Well, the results are in. Carlsen did it again. Our models never lie.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(raising a toast)  
To Magnus, the king of speed chess.

**They clink their glasses, celebrating the accuracy of their predictions.**

*Four SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a small table, sipping espresso. A chess board sits between them, pieces scattered.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leans in) So, Magnus Carlsen. Did he clinch it?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Our models had it at 85.32%. Given his track record and recent form, it was almost inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nods) But let's not forget Nakamura's streak. He had a solid 70.45% chance of making the finals.

SUPERFORECASTER 4: And Niemann? His upset potential was intriguing, though our models only gave him 12.78%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Firouzja, the young prodigy, had a 31.67% shot. Still, Carlsen's dominance is unmatched.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (smirks) Paris was the perfect backdrop for this chess drama. The final showdown was nothing short of legendary.

*They clink their cups, a nod to the game that never fails to surprise.*

FADE OUT.

"Will Magnus Carlsen win the Speed Chess Championship 2024?" Our models had it at 72.34%.

But don't forget Niemann's upset in 2022. His semifinal against Carlsen was a wildcard.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And Nakamura's dominance from 2017 to 2022 was a factor. Our models reflected all that.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
Yet, Carlsen's blitz rating peak last year was a game-changer.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

Well, it's all resolved now. Our probabilities were spot on.
