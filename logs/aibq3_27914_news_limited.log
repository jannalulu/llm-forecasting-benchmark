**2024 Emmys: Will 'The Bear' pull a 'Schitt's Creek' and win top 7 comedy categories in same year?**
The FX dramedy 'The Bear' is aiming to become the fourth program in TV history to sweep the top seven Primetime Emmys categories for series, lead actor, lead actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, writing, and directing. The show, about a Chicago beef restaurant, claimed six of the top seven prizes for its first season, but was not eligible for the lead actress category. However, with Ayo Edebiri 'promoted' from supporting to lead actress for Season 2, 'The Bear' now has a shot at winning all top seven categories. The show is currently leading in the Gold Derby predictions for Best Comedy Series, and its Christmas-set episode 'Fishes' is expected to win both Best Comedy Directing and Best Comedy Writing. 'The Bear' is hoping to join the esteemed list of programs that have swept the top seven categories, including 'Angels in America' (2004), 'Schitt's Creek' (2020), and 'The Crown' (2021).

The 2024 Emmys are approaching, with the nomination round of voting taking place from June 13 to June 24. The current frontrunners for Outstanding Comedy Series include 'The Bear', which is likely to win due to its strong second season, and 'Curb Your Enthusiasm', which is tied for most nominations ever in this category. Other contenders include 'Reservation Dogs', 'What We Do in the Shadows', and 'Palm Royale', a freshman show. The nominees are listed in order of their likelihood to win, with 'The Bear' being the top contender. The 76th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards will take place on September 15 and air live on ABC at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT. 'The Bear' is still eligible for the award, having won Outstanding Comedy Series last year.

**2024 Emmys: Will ‘The Bear' pull a ‘Schitt's Creek' and win top 7 comedy categories in same year?**
Only three TV programs have swept the top seven Primetime Emmys categories: 'Angels in America' (2004), 'Schitt's Creek' (2020), and 'The Crown' (2021). 'The Bear' is hoping to join this list at the 2024 Emmys, but it was not eligible for the lead actress category last year, preventing it from completing the sweep. However, with a savvy category switch, 'The Bear' may be able to win all seven categories this year, including comedy series, lead actor Jeremy Allen White, supporting actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach, supporting actress Ayo Edebiri, and both writing and directing for Christopher Storer.
