To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical precedent: There have been no confirmed cases of Clade I mpox in U.S. residents to date, according to the information provided. This suggests a low base rate.

2. Current outbreak: A new, more virulent strain (Clade Ib) is causing a significant outbreak in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

3. Geographical spread: The outbreak has spread to neighboring countries in Africa, but has not been reported outside of central and eastern Africa.

4. Time frame: The question asks about confirmation before August 23, 2024, which is only 9 days from today.

5. Travel patterns: The CDC notes that the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the U.S. is very low due to limited travel and lack of direct commercial flights from affected countries.

6. Surveillance and detection: The U.S. has strong disease surveillance systems and the capability to test for both Clade I and II mpox.

7. Vaccine availability: While vaccines are available in the U.S., they are not widely distributed in affected African countries.

Arguments for a lower probability:
- No historical cases of Clade I in the U.S.
- Very limited time frame (9 days)
- CDC assessment of very low importation risk
- Lack of direct flights from affected areas to the U.S.

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Rapidly spreading outbreak in Africa
- New, more virulent strain causing concern
- Spread to multiple countries in Africa
- WHO considering declaring a public health emergency of international concern

Balancing these factors, I lean towards a low probability but not zero due to the severity of the outbreak and its spread in Africa. The main limiting factor is the short time frame and low travel connectivity between affected areas and the U.S.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, with 1.00% being the most likely. Probability: 1.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the relevant evidence:

1. Historical context:
- Mpox (formerly monkeypox) has been endemic in parts of Africa for decades.
- In 2022, there was a global outbreak of Clade II mpox that affected many countries, including the US.
- The CDC has experience detecting and confirming mpox cases.

2. Current situation:
- A new, more virulent strain (Clade Ib) is causing outbreaks in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
- Cases have increased by 160% in Africa in 2024 compared to 2023.
- The outbreak has spread to neighboring countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.

3. Risk of importation to the US:
- The CDC states the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the US is "very low" due to limited travel and lack of direct flights from affected countries.
- However, international travel does occur, and cases could potentially be imported.

4. Time frame:
- The question asks about confirmation before August 23, 2024, which is only about 9 days from now.
- This is a very short timeframe for a case to be imported, detected, and confirmed.

5. US preparedness:
- The US has experience with mpox from the 2022 outbreak.
- The CDC is alert to the situation and has issued warnings to clinicians.
- The US has testing capabilities for both Clade I and II mpox.

Balancing the evidence:

Factors suggesting a lower probability:
- Very short timeframe (9 days)
- CDC's assessment of "very low" risk of importation
- Lack of direct flights from affected countries to the US

Factors suggesting a higher probability:
- Rapid spread and increased cases in Africa
- Spread to multiple countries in Africa
- US connections to Africa through travel and diaspora communities

Considering these factors, I believe the probability is low, but not negligible. The short timeframe is a significant limiting factor, but the severity and spread of the outbreak in Africa introduce some risk.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, with 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical precedent: There have been no confirmed cases of Clade I mpox in US residents reported by the CDC to date. This suggests a low baseline probability.

2. Current outbreak: A new, more virulent Clade Ib strain is causing a significant outbreak in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This increases the risk of potential spread.

3. Time frame: The question asks about confirmation before August 23, 2024, which is only 9 days from now. This short timeframe reduces the likelihood of a case being imported and confirmed within the period.

4. Travel patterns: The CDC notes that the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the US is very low due to limited travel and lack of direct flights from affected countries. This significantly decreases the probability.

5. Surveillance and detection: The CDC has issued alerts to clinicians, which may increase the likelihood of detecting a case if one does occur. However, the incubation period and time for confirmation could extend beyond the 9-day window.

6. Vaccination: The Jynneos vaccine is effective against both Clade I and II, which could help prevent spread if a case is imported. However, vaccination rates for those at risk in the US are relatively low.

7. WHO and CDC response: Both organizations are taking the outbreak seriously, with the WHO considering declaring a public health emergency of international concern. This heightened awareness could lead to stricter travel measures, potentially further reducing the risk of importation.

Balancing these factors:

- The extremely short timeframe and very low risk of importation are the strongest factors pointing to a low probability.
- The severity of the outbreak in Africa and the increased virulence of the new strain slightly increase the risk, but likely not enough to overcome the other barriers within 9 days.
- The lack of historical precedent for Clade I cases in the US also suggests a very low probability.

Given these considerations, I would estimate a very low probability of a confirmed Clade I mpox case in a US resident before August 23, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.25% being the most likely. Probability: 0.25%.

To approach this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical context: The last major mpox outbreak in the US was in 2022, caused by Clade II. There's no recent history of Clade I in the US.

2. Current situation: A new, more virulent Clade Ib strain is spreading in Africa, particularly in the DRC.

3. Time frame: We have about 9 days until the resolution date.

4. Travel patterns: There are no direct flights between the US and affected African countries, reducing transmission risk.

5. CDC vigilance: The CDC has issued alerts to doctors about the new strain, indicating heightened awareness.

6. Vaccine availability: The Jynneos vaccine is effective against both Clade I and II, potentially limiting spread if a case does arrive.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. The CDC considers the risk of Clade I importation to the US "very low" due to limited travel from affected areas.
2. The short timeframe (9 days) reduces the likelihood of a case being imported and confirmed within that period.
3. Heightened awareness among healthcare providers may lead to quicker isolation of potential cases.

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. The new Clade Ib strain is more transmissible and causing a significant outbreak in Africa.
2. Global travel, while limited, still occurs between affected regions and the US.
3. The WHO is considering declaring a public health emergency, suggesting the situation is serious.

Balancing these factors:

The primary factor limiting the probability is the short timeframe and the CDC's assessment of "very low" risk. However, the increased transmissibility of the new strain and the possibility of undetected cases in travelers slightly increases the risk.

Given the CDC's vigilance and the short timeframe, I believe the probability is low, but not negligible. The base rate for rare disease importation events is very low, typically less than 1% in such a short period. However, given the specific circumstances, I'll adjust this upward slightly.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, with 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

- Cases have increased by 160% in Africa in 2024 compared to 2023.
- The outbreak has spread to neighboring countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.

3. Risk of spread to the US:
- The CDC states that the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the US is "very low" due to limited travel and lack of direct commercial flights from affected countries.
- However, international travel does occur, and the virus has crossed borders within Africa.

4. Time frame:
We have about 9 days until the resolution date (August 23, 2024).

5. Detection and confirmation:
- The CDC has issued alerts to US doctors to watch for this strain.
- The US has testing capabilities for both Clade I and II.

6. Vaccine situation:
- The Jynneos vaccine is effective against both clades.
- However, vaccine availability in Africa is limited, increasing the risk of spread.

Balancing the evidence:

Arguments for a lower probability:
1. The CDC assesses the risk as "very low."
2. There's limited direct travel between affected areas and the US.
3. The time frame is relatively short (9 days).

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. The new strain is more virulent and spreading rapidly in Africa.
2. It has already crossed borders within Africa.
3. International travel, while limited, does occur.
4. The CDC has alerted doctors, increasing the likelihood of detection if a case does occur.

Considering these factors, I believe the probability is low but not negligible. The short time frame and limited travel are significant constraints, but the virulence of the new strain and its ability to cross borders are concerning factors.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, with 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical context:
The 2022 global mpox outbreak was primarily caused by Clade II. There's no mention of Clade I cases in the US during that time.

2. Current situation:
- A new, more virulent Clade Ib strain is spreading in Africa, particularly in the DRC.
- Cases have increased by 160% in Africa in 2024 compared to 2023.
- The outbreak has spread to neighboring countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.

3. Risk of spread to the US:
- The CDC states that the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the US is "very low" due to limited travel and lack of direct commercial flights from affected countries.
- However, international travel does occur, and the virus has crossed borders within Africa.
