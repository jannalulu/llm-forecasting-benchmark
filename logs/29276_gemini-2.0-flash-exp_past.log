Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem and arrive at a probability.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Kalshi:** We need to focus on Kalshi's specific probabilities, as the resolution criteria hinges on their market data. The articles show Kalshi fluctuating between 52% and 61% for Trump in the past few weeks.
*   **Polymarket:** Polymarket consistently shows higher probabilities for Trump than Kalshi, peaking at 64% in the provided data. This indicates that Kalshi's market may be more cautious or less bullish on Trump than Polymarket.
*   **Other Prediction Markets:** PredictIt, BetOnline, and others are mentioned, but their data is not directly relevant to the question as it focuses on Kalshi's specific probabilities.
*   **Polls:** Polls show a tighter race, and a mix of leads between the two candidates.
*   **Nate Silver**: Nate Silver appears to be giving Trump a 60% chance of winning.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question is about whether Kalshi will *ever* reach 70% for Trump before November 5th. This means we're not just forecasting the *current* odds, but how high they might go in the next few days. To make this easier, consider these aspects:

*   **Current Momentum:** Trump's odds have been generally trending upwards across various prediction markets in recent weeks, including Kalshi.
*   **Volatility:** Betting market odds can change rapidly based on new information or events (e.g. debate performance, news events).
*   **Time Remaining:** We have about 7 days until the deadline, which is a fairly short time for such a significant jump in probabilities but it isn't impossible.
*   **Kalshi's Specific Behavior:** Note that Kalshi does not trend higher than other markets. This suggests it may be a more reliable market than others for the purposes of this prediction.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** Base rate of a candidate's probability on prediction markets jumping to 70% in the final week - in past election cycles I've not often seen this occur.
*   **Inside View:** The unique factors driving the current election include: the apparent growing voter interest in Trump, as well as the legalisation of election betting which may be driving up probabilities. Also, there is a lack of events or debates scheduled in the next week which may cause an overall lack of movement in probabilities.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Under-reaction:** Ignoring the clear upward trend of Trump's odds would be a mistake.
*   **Over-reaction:** Extrapolating this trend linearly to 70% in 7 days is not safe. There is a natural ceiling on any candidates probabilities given that they can't surpass 100%, and will become less likely to move upwards the closer they get to 100%.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing Trump Up:**
    *   Positive media coverage.
    *   A perception that Trump is gaining momentum.
    *   The ability to legally bet on election outcomes.
*   **Forces Holding Trump Down:**
    *   The fact that he is not doing as well in national polls.
    *  The possibility of "mean reversion" if the betting markets have overcorrected.
    *   The possibility of a negative news event or poll result impacting his odds.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly (With Caution):**

Based on the provided articles, Kalshi has generally been at 52-61% for Trump, but more recently near 60%. I will not expect the same dramatic jumps that we've seen over the last 2 weeks over this final week, as there is less time for big events to unfold that would shift the market.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

Given the current circumstances, this question has a large degree of doubt, as anything could happen over the next 7 days.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:** To give this question a 0.10% or 99.90% chance would be a mistake.
*   **Overconfidence:** To give this a 50% chance would be to ignore the evidence of Trump's current polling lead on prediction markets.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

The biggest error to consider here is that probabilities may remain volatile throughout the coming week. There is a bias to over-correct from recent events so I will look at that as a possible error.

**Synthesis:**

The base rate of betting markets reaching a probability of 70% in the last week before an election is low, as no candidate has done this to my knowledge. However, the legalisation of betting markets means that higher levels of volume may occur in the coming week. The trend is still for Trump's probability to increase, and the news reports are mostly positive. However, it is important to note that the 70% threshold is significant, and represents a very high likelihood of winning the election which will be hard for even Trump's supporters to push towards. Kalshi is also showing a lower probability for Trump than other markets and has tended to be more reliable in the past. As a result, I will put this at a low probability, but not close to 0%.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 8.00% and 20.00%, but 14.00% being the most likely. Probability: 14.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question step-by-step.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **The Question:** We're focusing on whether Kalshi will *ever* show Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning before November 5, 2024. This is a specific threshold, not a general likelihood of winning.
*   **Reference Class:** We can look at past instances of prediction markets and how probabilities fluctuate, especially in the context of major political events. It's rare for a candidate to reach 70% on these markets, as uncertainty tends to persist.
*   **Current Situation:** The news articles indicate Trump's odds on Kalshi have been rising, reaching 61% at one point. However, there is less than a week until the election, so there is limited time for the odds to increase significantly.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Current Odds:** What are Trump's current odds on Kalshi? They fluctuate quite a bit, but the most recent figures show Trump mostly in the high 50s to low 60s.
*   **Time Remaining:** How much time remains before November 5th? There is less than a week.
*   **Volatility:** How volatile are these markets? Are large swings in probability common? There is some volatility evident from the articles, but it seems to be capped at certain percentage points.
*   **Catalysts:** What could drive a significant jump in Trump's probability? We would need to look for new major positive news for his campaign, or significant negative news for his opponent.

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** Historically, it's relatively rare for a candidate to reach 70% in prediction markets in the last week before an election. This serves as our base rate. Usually, the probabilities are distributed between candidates with some level of uncertainty in the final week.
*   **Inside View:** Trump's odds have been rising recently, and some analysts on the market believe he is likely to win. The large sums of money placed on him suggest there is a good chance the odds move more in his favor, although there may not be enough time to make it to 70%. JD Vance and Nate Silver's prediction could be considered a catalyst, but the market has seemingly accounted for this already, as we can see Trump's odds only reached the low 60s.

**4. Under- and Overreacting:**

*   It's important not to overreact to the recent rise in Trump's odds. While the trend is upward, a 70% threshold is still a significant jump in the last week.
*   On the other hand, we can't completely ignore the increasing momentum and the large sums of money being wagered on Trump. This trend should not be dismissed.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive for Trump:** Increased betting volume on Trump, improved poll numbers (although they vary), Nate Silver and JD Vance predicting he will win, and some analysts being very convinced of a Trump win.
*   **Negative for Trump:** Limited time left, polling is still mixed, and it would take a considerable shift to reach 70%. As more people cast their votes, the market will become less volatile as people know how the outcome will turn out.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*  A linear extrapolation from the highest odds he has seen on Kalshi (61%) would still put him some way below 70% even with linear increases over the next few days.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   Given the factors above, I'm not completely discounting a sudden jump in Trump's probability, but it remains improbable. A jump from 61% to 70% in a matter of days would be a very large move, more so than any of the market fluctuations have shown so far.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   It's important to be prudent but not overly cautious. A low probability is reasonable, given the historical precedents, but I should also acknowledge the unique dynamics of the current situation.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**

*   This question is unique as there is a hard cut-off date. It is important to recognize the potential for volatility, but also not over-adjust to that potential.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

Based on the analysis, the following points are clear:
*  It's rare for prediction markets to reach 70% for a candidate, especially in the final week.
*  Trump has made strong gains, but reaching 70% in the time remaining is a major leap.
*  The market is already pricing in Trump's momentum to some degree.
*   A major shift would require a new catalyst or a major negative event for his opponent.

**Forecast:**

Given the recent upwards movement for Trump, the fact that he was at 61% relatively recently, and the large volume in prediction markets, I will give a probability above 10% for it to happen, but still well below 50%. It is more likely that he doesn't reach 70%, but it's within the realm of possibility before the election.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 17.00% being the most likely. Probability: 17.00%.

Okay, let's tackle this forecasting question.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Kalshi:** The question is specifically about Kalshi's probabilities. The articles show Kalshi frequently reporting Trump's chances, but never close to 70%. The highest I have noted is 61%. 
*   **Polymarket:** Polymarket is mentioned often and has, at times, shown higher probabilities for Trump than Kalshi. The highest I have seen from Polymarket is 64%. So far the 70% mark has not been crossed, and it's key to remember we are only interested in Kalshi's numbers.
*   **FiveThirtyEight:**  FiveThirtyEight is mentioned once, stating Trump had a 53 in 100 chance, which is roughly in line with other poll aggregators but lower than the prediction markets.
*   **Other Betting Markets:** Other betting markets like PredictIt, Betfair, and BetOnline are mentioned, usually with Trump's odds slightly lower than Polymarket's, but again none near 70%.

**2. Break Seemingly Intractable Problems into Tractable Sub-problems:**

*   **Sub-problem 1: What is the current trend?** Trump's odds have been increasing in most prediction markets over the past few weeks, and this is reflected in the Kalshi numbers, though it has not exceeded 61%. 
*   **Sub-problem 2: How volatile are these markets?** The markets do move, sometimes sharply (e.g. after the first debate), but these movements still haven't pushed Kalshi to 70%. There is also the presence of large bets moving the market quickly.
*   **Sub-problem 3: What timeframe is left?** There are approximately 7 days remaining before the November 5 deadline. This is a very limited time for a big jump to 70%.
*   **Sub-problem 4: What would need to happen for Trump's odds to surge to 70% on Kalshi?** There would need to be a significant event (or series of events) that dramatically shifts perceptions and betting patterns. A major scandal for his opponent, an extremely high-profile endorsement, or a polling surge would be possible triggers, but none of these are clearly happening.

**3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**

*   **Outside View:** Base rate - prediction markets rarely see probabilities jump to 70% for a candidate, especially so close to the election, unless there is extremely strong evidence.
*  **Inside View:** The details of this specific election. The news articles show Trump gaining in the betting markets, but a 70% probability on Kalshi feels like an extreme case. Kalshi has consistently been slightly lower than Polymarket, so given that Polymarket has yet to reach 70%, it makes a 70% Kalshi outcome less likely. The key factor here is time; there is very little left.

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**

*   The articles show Trump is gaining, but the shift has been within a range, not a vertical leap. I must avoid extrapolating trends linearly to a 70% probability. While the trend is upwards, it's also necessary to consider the fact that a sharp shift could still happen. I must remain flexible and not be too anchored to the current numbers. 

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**

*   **Force 1: Increased Trump Support:** Trump is gaining momentum in the betting markets and is seen as a strong contender.
*   **Force 2: Limited Time:** There are only a few days left, reducing the opportunities for significant shifts in the betting odds.
*   **Force 3: Kalshi Conservatism:** Kalshi seems to be generally more conservative than Polymarket. 

**6. Extrapolate current trends linearly:**
Linear extrapolation, based on the available data, would not lead to a 70% probability on Kalshi in the timeframe, but I can use this as one input.

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**

*   I can express my uncertainty by providing a range, but I can be more precise by weighting my forecast toward the lower end of that range.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**

*   I should be confident in my assessment based on analysis of the evidence but avoid being overconfident that I am completely certain. 

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**
I should consider if there are ways my information is biased (e.g. I might have a tendency to underestimate large changes, or I might be misinterpreting how betting markets work). The limited information about why some big bets occurred in the past should be considered when making my assessment.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Given all of the above, here’s my reasoning:

*   The highest probability that Kalshi has recorded for Trump was 61%, as of October 28th, with 7 days until resolution. There is no indication of a sudden event that would dramatically shift those odds beyond that. 
*   Kalshi has been consistently lower than Polymarket, which has also not shown Trump at 70%. Therefore, the probability of Kalshi showing 70% is significantly reduced. 
*   The time remaining is limited, so a dramatic shift in such a short time is statistically unlikely.

Therefore, while there is a *small* chance of a rapid, unexpected shift, it is not the most likely outcome, and that chance is reduced by Kalshi's tendencies to be more conservative in probability than Polymarket.

My Prediction: Between 1.10% and 10.10%, but 4.10% being the most likely. Probability: 4.10%.

I should consider if there are ways my information is biased (e.g. I might have a tendency to underestimate large changes, or I might be misinterpreting how betting markets work). The limited information about why some big bets occurred in the past should be considered when making my assessment.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Given all of the above, here’s my reasoning:

*   The highest probability that Kalshi has recorded for Trump was 61%, as of October 28th, with 7 days until resolution. There is no indication of a sudden event that would dramatically shift those odds beyond that. 
*   Kalshi has been consistently lower than Polymarket, which has also not shown Trump at 70%. Therefore, the probability of Kalshi showing 70% is significantly reduced. 
*   The time remaining is limited, so a dramatic shift in such a short time is statistically unlikely.

Therefore, while there is a *small* chance of a rapid, unexpected shift, it is not the most likely outcome, and that chance is reduced by Kalshi's tendencies to be more conservative in probability than Polymarket.

My Prediction: Between 1.10% and 10.10%, but 4.10% being the most likely. Probability: 4.10%.

Okay, let's analyze this question systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Kalshi:** As of today, October 28th, Kalshi is showing Trump with a 61% chance of winning the election.  This is a relevant starting point.
*   **Polymarket:** Polymarket is showing Trump with a higher chance of winning, often around 60-64%, but sometimes 58-61%. 
*   **Other Betting Markets:** Other betting markets seem to be in a similar range, generally showing Trump as a favorite in the low-to-mid 60s.
*   **538/Polls:** Polls seem tighter, with some showing a narrow Harris lead or a tie. However, the articles strongly indicate that betting markets are currently favored over polls by many people as more indicative of the election outcome.
*   **Nate Silver:** Nate Silver has been quoted as predicting a Trump win, citing that pollsters might underestimate Trump’s support. However, the provided articles do not specify by how much he thinks Trump would win.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question is: Before November 5, 2024, will Kalshi ever show Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning? We need to consider the probability of Trump's odds on Kalshi reaching 70% in the next 7 days, from October 28th to November 4th.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** Base rates: How often do betting markets move from the 50-60% range to 70% for a given political candidate in a similar timeframe? This is hard to quantify precisely, but it's unusual for such dramatic shifts in a week. Normally, shifts occur more slowly.
*   **Inside View:** The key is how fast and how high could Trump's odds rise on Kalshi from the present level. We need to examine the factors that may be causing shifts in betting market odds to occur.

**4. Balancing Under/Overreacting:**

We must avoid overreacting to recent movements while still acknowledging potentially significant trends.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing Trump's odds up:**
    *   **Positive News for Trump:** Positive news about Trump (e.g. favorable poll updates, endorsements or speeches, or a negative news story about Harris) could cause a shift. We have seen Trump's odds rising steadily in the past weeks.
     *   **Momentum:** The current trend in the betting markets favors Trump. Once a trend gets going, it can often have its own momentum for a while.
    *   **"Wisdom of the Crowd":** Betting markets aggregate opinions. If more people believe Trump is likely to win, his odds will rise.
*   **Forces Pushing Trump's odds down:**
    *   **Positive News for Harris:** Positive news or campaign momentum for Harris would push Trump's odds down.
    *   **Reversion to Mean:** Large, rapid moves in betting markets can lead to corrections as traders take profit or reassess their bets. While we have observed a clear upward trend in Trump's odds, it is difficult to determine if we are near a limit or a near term high. 
    *   **Event Risks:** There are still a few days left before the election. Unexpected events, such as gaffes by Trump or a sudden political scandal, could negatively impact his odds.
    *   **Polls:** If polls begin to strongly favor Harris, this may lead to some correction in the betting markets.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

Current trends show Trump's odds rising, and he is now firmly favored by betting markets to win.  However, even with this trend, there is only a small chance that the odds will rise another 9 points in only 7 days to reach 70% on Kalshi, as we need to consider whether they would even go beyond the 65% range.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

We can distinguish a few key levels of uncertainty:

*   A low probability (below 20%) for a large jump in odds in such a short timeframe. 
*   A moderate probability (20-40%) for some further rise in Trump's odds, perhaps toward the mid-60s.
*   A lower probability (below 10%) of a significant decline to below 50%.

**8. Balancing Confidence and Decisiveness:**

Given the evidence, a reasonable level of confidence should not stray into overconfidence. There are a few key factors to consider: while it is plausible that Trump's odds will continue to rise in the coming days, it is unlikely that they will jump to 70% due to the inherent nature of the market, which usually rises and falls more gradually. Furthermore, there is still some chance that Harris will regain momentum, which is more likely to make the odds remain stable or decrease rather than have Trump's odds jump to 70%.

**9. Learn From Mistakes (and Beware Hindsight):**

I should focus on calibrating forecasts, recognising that there is always a chance of an unexpected event, but my goal is to make the most reasonable forecast based on the current information.

**Synthesis and Forecast:**

Based on the recent trend of Trump's increasing odds on betting markets, and that Kalshi is currently at 61%, there is a possibility that it will increase slightly. However, it is very unlikely that it would rise a full 9 points in only 7 days, especially as we approach the election date where market movement typically slows down. Therefore, while some upward movement is plausible, it would take a major event for such a rapid rise to 70%.

**My Prediction:** Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 14.00% being the most likely. Probability: 14.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question carefully.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Kalshi:** Currently (Oct 28), Kalshi is showing Trump around 60-61% chance of winning the election, according to the provided articles.
*   **Polymarket:** Polymarket is showing Trump slightly higher, around 60-64%.
*   **Other Betting Markets:**  Most betting markets favor Trump, though odds vary between 53% to 64%.
*   **Polls:** Polls are more mixed, with some showing Harris ahead or a very tight race. Nate Silver stated Trump will win, with pollsters underestimating Trump's support.
*   **Historical Context:** The situation is highly fluid, with significant shifts in betting odds over the past few weeks.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question asks whether Kalshi will *ever* show Trump at a 70% chance before Nov 5. This has several key factors:
*   **Time Remaining:** We are now close to the election date. Less than a week remains for the conditions to be met.
*   **Current Momentum:** Trump's odds have been trending upwards across betting markets for the past month. 
*   **70% Threshold:** This is a significant threshold. It’s not just a matter of gaining a point or two.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   How often do betting markets see such a significant swing in a short period? Normally betting markets are relatively stable.
    *   How frequently does a candidate hit 70% in prediction markets for a US presidential election? A 70% chance of winning is a very strong consensus and is not often seen.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   Trump's recent surge in betting markets suggests continued upward momentum.
    *   The court decision legalizing election betting has brought more attention and volume to the betting markets, which could magnify swings.
    *   The article mentioning $30 million wagers on Trump shows high conviction among some users. This can potentially influence the betting markets.
    *   Polls are tighter, but prediction markets often react to factors beyond just polls.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The upward trend in Trump's odds is significant and should not be ignored.
*   However, it is crucial not to overreact by assuming it will continue unabated to 70%.
*   Betting markets are still not uniform in their assessment of Trump's chances, some still showing him only in the low 50s or high 50s.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing Trump's Odds Higher:** Increased betting volume, potential high-profile endorsements, late breaking news, any issues that hamper Harris.
*  **Forces Pushing Trump's Odds Lower:** Any missteps by Trump, polls showing Harris gaining ground, other market correction towards less extreme odds.

**6. Extrapolating Trends:**

*   A linear extrapolation of the past few weeks could push Trump's odds higher. However, linear extrapolation can be misleading, as these trends often show diminishing returns or find resistance. The closer we get to the election the less likely we are to see large shifts.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's some likelihood of Trump hitting 70% on Kalshi, but also a strong possibility it won't.
*   The question of a 70% probability is a difficult one to quantify. I'm not overly confident that this will happen, but it is more likely than not.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I need to balance the recent strong trends toward Trump with the general stability of betting markets as elections get closer.
*   It's important to avoid overconfidence in the continuation of the recent Trump surge and also to avoid underestimating the volatility of these markets.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

*   If I am wrong, it could be because I overweighted the recent momentum or underweighted how unlikely a 70% level is.
*   It's also possible that a single high-impact event could cause a major shift I'm not anticipating.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The strongest evidence is that Trump’s betting odds have been climbing across multiple platforms in recent weeks. There is a clear upward trend. However, 70% is a high threshold and requires a large shift from current levels. With less than a week left until the election, I think the chances are not negligible, but also not that high. Given the current momentum, the legal betting markets, and the inherent uncertainty, it is still not very likely.

**Final Prediction:**

Based on this analysis, while Trump's odds are trending up, hitting 70% on Kalshi before November 5th is not the most likely outcome. I think that it is more likely than it was a few weeks ago, but still a long shot.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

*   **Inside View:**
    *   Trump's recent surge in betting markets suggests continued upward momentum.
    *   The court decision legalizing election betting has brought more attention and volume to the betting markets, which could magnify swings.
    *   The article mentioning $30 million wagers on Trump shows high conviction among some users. This can potentially influence the betting markets.
    *   Polls are tighter, but prediction markets often react to factors beyond just polls.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The upward trend in Trump's odds is significant and should not be ignored.
*   However, it is crucial not to overreact by assuming it will continue unabated to 70%.
*   Betting markets are still not uniform in their assessment of Trump's chances, some still showing him only in the low 50s or high 50s.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing Trump's Odds Higher:** Increased betting volume, potential high-profile endorsements, late breaking news, any issues that hamper Harris.
*  **Forces Pushing Trump's Odds Lower:** Any missteps by Trump, polls showing Harris gaining ground, other market correction towards less extreme odds.

**6. Extrapolating Trends:**

*   A linear extrapolation of the past few weeks could push Trump's odds higher. However, linear extrapolation can be misleading, as these trends often show diminishing returns or find resistance. The closer we get to the election the less likely we are to see large shifts.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's some likelihood of Trump hitting 70% on Kalshi, but also a strong possibility it won't.
*   The question of a 70% probability is a difficult one to quantify. I'm not overly confident that this will happen, but it is more likely than not.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I need to balance the recent strong trends toward Trump with the general stability of betting markets as elections get closer.
*   It's important to avoid overconfidence in the continuation of the recent Trump surge and also to avoid underestimating the volatility of these markets.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

*   If I am wrong, it could be because I overweighted the recent momentum or underweighted how unlikely a 70% level is.
*   It's also possible that a single high-impact event could cause a major shift I'm not anticipating.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The strongest evidence is that Trump’s betting odds have been climbing across multiple platforms in recent weeks. There is a clear upward trend. However, 70% is a high threshold and requires a large shift from current levels. With less than a week left until the election, I think the chances are not negligible, but also not that high. Given the current momentum, the legal betting markets, and the inherent uncertainty, it is still not very likely.

**Final Prediction:**

Based on this analysis, while Trump's odds are trending up, hitting 70% on Kalshi before November 5th is not the most likely outcome. I think that it is more likely than it was a few weeks ago, but still a long shot.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question carefully.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Kalshi:** Currently (Oct 28), Kalshi is showing Trump around 60-61% chance of winning the election, according to the provided articles.
*   **Polymarket:** Polymarket is showing Trump slightly higher, around 60-64%.
*   **Other Betting Markets:**  Most betting markets favor Trump, though odds vary between 53% to 64%.
*   **Polls:** Polls are more mixed, with some showing Harris ahead or a very tight race. Nate Silver stated Trump will win, with pollsters underestimating Trump's support.
*   **Historical Context:** The situation is highly fluid, with significant shifts in betting odds over the past few weeks.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question asks whether Kalshi will *ever* show Trump at a 70% chance before Nov 5. This has several key factors:
*   **Time Remaining:** We are now close to the election date. Less than a week remains for the conditions to be met.
*   **Current Momentum:** Trump's odds have been trending upwards across betting markets for the past month. 
*   **70% Threshold:** This is a significant threshold. It’s not just a matter of gaining a point or two.
