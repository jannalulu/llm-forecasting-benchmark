Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Assessment:
- Question resolves by September 30, 2024 (about 2 months from now)
- Revolut has been waiting for over 3 years for the license
- Most recent updates are from July 2024

2. Positive Indicators:
- Clean bill of health from auditor BDO in July 2024
- Strong financial performance: £438m profit in 2023
- Published financial results ahead of schedule
- Reduced cryptocurrency focus (mentioned 22 times in 2023 vs 88 times in 2020)
- CEO expressed optimism about license approval in recent statements
- Moving to new headquarters in Canary Wharf shows commitment to UK market

3. Negative Indicators:
- ECB pushing for improved financial crime controls (July 19, 2024)
- Still facing regulatory hurdles after 3+ years
- Previous competitors (Monzo, Starling) got licenses faster
- History of internal chaos and governance issues
- No concrete timeline provided by regulators

4. Critical Factors:
- Only about 2 months left until resolution date
- Regulatory processes typically take longer
- Recent improvements in controls and audit may not be enough time for regulators to complete their review

5. Comparative Analysis:
- Other digital banks typically took 18-24 months for approval
- Revolut's case has already taken longer, suggesting deeper issues

The short timeframe remaining is the most significant constraint, despite recent positive developments. While improvements have been made, regulatory reviews typically require several months of observation after improvements are implemented.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.50%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Revolut has shown strong financial performance in 2023:
- Record pre-tax profit of £438m
- Revenue nearly doubled to £1.8bn
- Customer base grew to 45 million globally
2. Recent improvements in governance:
- Clean bill of health from auditor BDO for first time
- Published financial results ahead of statutory deadline
- Reduced crypto focus (mentioned only 22 times in 2023 report vs 88 in 2020)
3. Commitment to UK market:
- Signed 10-year lease for new Canary Wharf HQ
- UK CEO states application is "progressing well"

Key Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Long-standing delays and issues:
- Already waiting 3+ years since 2021 application
- Previous audit issues and control concerns
- ECB recently pushing for improved financial crime controls
2. Regulatory concerns:
- Complex ownership structure
- Previous money laundering allegations
- Competitors (Monzo, Starling) already have licenses
3. Time constraint:
- Only 2 months remaining until deadline
- No clear signals from regulators about imminent approval

Analyzing trends and timing:
- Despite positive financial results, regulatory hurdles remain
- Recent ECB concerns about controls suggest continued scrutiny
- Short timeframe until September 30 deadline
- No concrete indicators of imminent approval

Balance of evidence suggests:
- While Revolut has made progress on governance and financials
- Regulatory concerns and short timeline create significant hurdles
- Historical patterns suggest regulatory approval processes take longer
- Recent ECB concerns may further delay UK approval

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.80%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.

- Strong revenue growth (95% increase to $2.2B)
- Moved global HQ to Canary Wharf showing UK commitment
- CEO expressed optimism about license approval
- Published financial results ahead of deadline for first time
- Reduced cryptocurrency focus (mentioned only 22 times vs 88 previously)

3. Negative Indicators:
