Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of June 2024, hospitalization rates were around 2 per 100,000
- By July 2024, rates had increased but remained below winter peak of 7.7 per 100,000
- Multiple sources confirm a summer wave is occurring

2. Historical Patterns:
- Summer waves typically occur but are less severe than winter waves
- Previous summer peaks have been lower than winter peaks
- 2023 summer wave didn't exceed 3.5 per 100,000

3. Positive Factors (Supporting >3.5):
- New variants (FLiRT, KP.3) are more transmissible
- Cases are increasing in multiple states
- Wastewater levels showing increases
- Hospital visits up 23% in recent reports
- Lower vaccination rates than previous years

4. Negative Factors (Supporting <3.5):
- Population immunity remains high
- New variants not showing increased severity
- Current hospitalization rates still well below threshold
- Experts consistently saying current wave isn't cause for alarm
- Healthcare capacity not stressed
- Deaths remain at pandemic lows

5. Critical Analysis:
- Would need significant acceleration to reach 3.5 by August
- Summer waves historically don't reach winter levels
- Most reports indicate milder disease profile
- Current trajectory doesn't suggest dramatic spike

Given these factors, while there's clear evidence of a summer wave, the combination of high population immunity and less severe variants makes exceeding 3.5 per 100,000 unlikely, though not impossible.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Context:
- Winter peak in December 2023 was 7.7 per 100,000
- End of June 2024 rate was around 2 per 100,000
- Mid-May 2024 rate was 1.1 per 100,000
- End of June 2024 hospitalization rate increased to 2 per 100,000

2. Current Trends:
- Cases are increasing across 39 states
- Summer wave is occurring with FLiRT variants
- Hospitalization rates increased 25% from May to June
- Wastewater levels show increases, particularly in the West

3. Mitigating Factors:
- Population immunity remains high
- Current variants are "very contagious but not more severe"
- Virus is generally weakening over time
- Previous summer peaks were typically lower than winter peaks

4. Risk Factors:
- New variants (KP.3, FLiRT) are more immune-evasive
- Low vaccination rates (less than 25% of adults have latest shot)
- Summer indoor gatherings due to heat
- Travel season could increase transmission

5. Mathematical Projection:
- Starting at 2 per 100,000 in late June
- 25% monthly increase trend would suggest ~3.1 per 100,000 by end of August
- Historical summer peaks typically reached 40-50% of winter peaks
- Current winter peak (7.7) × 45% = 3.47 per 100,000

Given these factors, while cases are rising, the combination of high population immunity and less severe variants makes exceeding 3.5 per 100,000 less likely than not. The most likely peak would be around 3.1-3.2 per 100,000.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 40.00%, with 32.50% being the most likely. Probability: 32.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Base Rate:
- Winter peak in December 2023 was 7.7 per 100,000
- By end of June 2024, rate was around 2 per 100,000
- Summer 2023 rates were lower than current rates

2. Current Trends:
- Cases and hospitalizations are increasing as of July 2024
- Hospitalization rate increased from 1.5 to 2.0 per 100,000 in recent weeks
- Wastewater data shows increased viral activity

3. Key Factors Supporting Higher Rates:
- New variants (FLiRT, KP.3) are more transmissible
- Summer indoor gatherings due to heat
- Waning immunity from previous vaccinations
- Current upward trend in hospitalizations

4. Key Factors Supporting Lower Rates:
- Population immunity remains high
- Variants not showing increased severity
- Current rate (2.0) would need to increase 75% to exceed threshold
- Healthcare system better prepared
- Summer typically sees lower rates than winter

5. Analysis:
- Starting from current 2.0 per 100,000
- Linear trend suggests possible increase to 2.5-3.0
- Would need significant acceleration to exceed 3.5
- Previous summer peaks were lower than winter peaks
- Most experts expect milder summer wave

6. Risk Factors:
- New variants could emerge
- Immunity could wane faster than expected

- December 2023 peak: 7.7 per 100,000
- End of June 2024: ~2 per 100,000

2. Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:

- Current variants are "very contagious but not more severe"
- Summer hospitalization rates historically lower than winter
- Recent trends show hospitalization rates remaining relatively low
- Current rate (~2 per 100,000) would need to increase 75% to exceed threshold

3. Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
- Some increase in cases and hospitalizations already observed
- New variants (FLiRT, KP.3) are becoming dominant
- Wastewater data shows increasing viral levels
- Summer indoor gatherings due to heat could increase transmission
- Waning vaccine protection as time passes

4. Current Situation Analysis:

- Current trajectory suggests modest increases

5. Time Period Consideration:

- Recent data shows hospitalization rates around 2 per 100,000 in late June 2024
- Winter peak was 7.7 per 100,000 in December 2023
- Current rates are increasing but remain relatively low

2. Historical Patterns:
- Summer waves typically occur but are less severe than winter waves
- Last summer's peaks were lower than winter peaks
- Population immunity remains high from previous infections and vaccinations

3. Key Evidence For Higher Rates:
- Cases are increasing in 39 states
- Wastewater data shows increasing viral levels
- New variants (FLiRT, KP.3) are more transmissible
- Summer indoor gatherings due to heat
- Hospital visits up 23% recently

4. Key Evidence For Lower Rates:
- Current variants not showing increased severity
- High population immunity
- Current hospitalization rate (2 per 100,000) would need to nearly double
- Deaths remain at pandemic lows
- Experts saying current increase not cause for alarm

5. Analysis:
- Starting from current 2 per 100,000, reaching 3.5 would require a 75% increase
- Summer peaks typically don't reach winter levels
- New variants are more transmissible but not more severe
- Most experts expect continued cases but manageable hospitalization levels

Given the evidence, while cases are increasing, reaching 3.5 per 100,000 hospitalizations seems unlikely but not impossible. The strongest scenario for exceeding 3.5 would be if new variants prove more severe than currently believed.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.
