Here's a short script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the US-India nuclear submarine deal."

Philip: "No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.5%. The deep ties between India and Russian military hardware, combined with America's historical reluctance to share nuclear propulsion technology, made this highly unlikely."

Nate: "Right. Even after AUKUS, the US maintained its restrictive stance. Remember that quote from former Indian naval chief Arun Prakash about American laws?"

Philip: [nodding] "The geopolitical indicators never shifted significantly. India's 60% Russian military inventory and their existing submarine relationships were too entrenched. Even with tensions rising, a US nuclear submarine deal was always a long shot."

Nate: "Another win for systematic forecasting."

[Scene: A dimly lit conference room at FiveThirtyEight offices. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction window closed. The US-India nuclear submarine deal..."

Tetlock: [interrupting] "No, our models had it at 12.5%. Not surprising given the historical context."

Nate: "Right. The Russian influence on India's military hardware was just too entrenched. Even with AUKUS setting a precedent, our models showed the US wouldn't extend similar technology sharing to India."

Tetlock: "The data was clear. US legislative barriers, combined with India's deep military ties with Russia, made this highly improbable. Even after analyzing the September 2021 AUKUS deal, our models suggested this wouldn't create a domino effect for India."

Nate: "Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the ones that recognize historical patterns don't change overnight."

[Both nod in agreement as they turn to their next forecast]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. They gave it a 12.5% probability, and sure enough, no US-India nuclear submarine deal materialized.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The historical context was crucial here. With India's deep military ties to Russia and their existing submarine capabilities, the barriers were significant. Our models factored in the US's historical reluctance to share nuclear propulsion technology.

Nate: Even after AUKUS, the US maintained its restrictive stance. The geopolitical dynamics just weren't there.

Philip: [checking his notes] Right. The September 2021 comments from former Indian naval chief Arun Prakash were telling. The US laws on nuclear technology sharing remained a major obstacle.

Nate: Sometimes the most accurate predictions come from understanding institutional inertia. In this case, the status quo prevailed.

Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 2, 2024]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The US-India nuclear submarine deal...

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] No surprise here. Our models had it at 12.5%. The historical Russian-Indian military relationship was just too strong to overcome.

Nate: The September 2021 AUKUS deal really highlighted the exclusivity of US nuclear tech sharing. Even with India's strategic importance...

Philip: [interrupting] Remember that quote from Arun Prakash about American laws? That was telling. Plus, with 60% of India's military hardware being Russian...

Nate: [checking his computer] Based on our data cutoff in July, there wasn't any significant diplomatic movement. The US stance on nuclear propulsion technology remained rigid.

Philip: Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the ones that recognize institutional inertia.
