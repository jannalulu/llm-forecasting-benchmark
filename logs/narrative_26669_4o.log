INT. A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM - SEPTEMBER 1, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, data scrolling across their screens. They sip coffee, eyes focused on the task at hand.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the Prime Minister isn't from France Unbowed.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 12.34%. The snap elections really shook things up.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to the screen)  
The New Popular Front's coalition was always a gamble. Together's centrist appeal seemed to sway more votes.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
And the National Rally's unexpected gains in July made it even more unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Well, the models never lie. We called it.

They share a knowing glance, satisfied with their prediction accuracy.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(typing)  
Let's update the report. Another win for data-driven forecasting.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping espresso. The room buzzes with the chatter of post-election France.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning in)  
So, the Prime Minister isn't from France Unbowed. Our models had it at 5.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Right. The NFP coalition was shaky at best. The centrists held more sway.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The snap elections were pivotal. Remember the articles from July? They hinted at Together gaining ground.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And the National Rally's influence was underestimated. It shifted dynamics.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

Indeed. Until the next prediction.

The National Assembly's balance kept shifting. Even with the far-right as a wildcard, it was a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The chance of the Prime Minister coming from France Unbowed was always slim.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. With the National Assembly split among the New Popular Front, Together, and National Rally, a coalition was inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The snap elections reshuffled everything. But LFI lacked the momentum to secure the top spot.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And yet, here we are. The unexpected coalition with Together changed the game.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's fascinating how political dynamics can shift. Our models are precise, but politics is an art, not just a science.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but our Brier scores remain impeccable. We predicted the likelihood accurately.
