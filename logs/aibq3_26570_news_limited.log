**Poland's Chances at the 2024 European Championship**
Poland's chances at the 2024 European Championship are being analyzed. The team is in Group D with France, the Netherlands, and Austria. According to bookmakers, Poland is not considered a favorite to win the tournament. They will face tough opponents in the group stage, including France and the Netherlands, who are among the top contenders for the title. Even a third-place finish might not be enough for Poland to advance to the knockout phase.
