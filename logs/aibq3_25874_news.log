**Tour de France: Evenepoel Wins Time Trial, Pogacar Remains Leader**
Remco Evenepoel won the time trial stage of the 2024 Tour de France, covering the 25 km distance from Nuits-Saint-Georges to Gevrey-Chambertin. Despite a technical issue in the last 2.5 km, where he noticed a loss of pressure in one of his tires, he was advised to continue by his team and managed to win with a 12-second advantage over the yellow jersey holder, Tadej Pogacar. Evenepoel completed the course in 28 minutes and 52 seconds, with an average speed of 52.5 km/h, while Pogacar recorded an average speed of 52.2 km/h.

**7th Stage: Favorites and Danish Chances**
The first individual time trial of the year will take place in the 7th stage of the Tour de France. Riders will face a challenging course over hills and vineyards before reaching the finish line in Gevrey-Chambertin. This stage will likely create time gaps between riders who aim to win the overall general classification. World champion Remco Evenepoel is the top favorite, while Primoz Roglic, Tadej Pogacar, and Jonas Vingegaard will compete for the stage win with specialists like Stefan Küng and Wout van Aert. Jonas Vingegaard has generally performed well in individual time trials in the Tour de France, but has yet to win one in the first week of the race, with his best results being a third place in 2021 and a seventh place in 2022. This stage will give an indication of how the double Tour winner has adapted to the discipline after his spring crash, and with the second individual time trial on stage 21, it's essential to know.

**Tour de France 2024: Profile and Route of Stage 3 between Piacenza and Turin (230.8 km)**
The third stage of the 2024 Tour de France is the longest day of the race, with a distance of 230.8 km. The stage is marked by three fourth-category climbs, with the last one 50 km from the finish line. It seems unlikely that a breakaway will succeed. The peloton will pay tribute to Fausto Coppi as they pass through Tortone, where he died. Kévin Vauquelin (Arkéa-B&B Hotels) won the second stage of the 111th edition of the Tour de France, a 199.2 km stage between Cesenatico and Bologna, while Tadej Pogacar (UAE Team Emirates) has already worn the yellow jersey as leader. After the victory of his compatriot Romain Bardet (Team dsm-firmenich PostNL), the first leader of the edition, Vauquelin emerged as the strongest of the ten riders who made up the day's escape. The Frenchman entered the finish with a 36-second advantage over Norwegian Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility) and 49 seconds over the trio formed by Frenchman Quentin Pacher (Groupama-FDJ), Spanish Cristian Rodríguez (Arkéa-B&B Hotels) and Colombian Harold Tejada (Astana-Qazaqstan). Four countries The 111th edition of the Tour de France has started on Saturday, June 29, with a total of 21 stages and 3,492 km, passing through four countries (Italy, San Marino, France, and Monaco) and with up to four high-altitude finishes. The 'Grande Boucle' will end in Niza for the first time in its history, instead of Paris, where the previous 110 editions ended. The celebration of the Olympic Games has caused this historic change in the final stage, a 33.7 km individual time trial between Monaco and Niza. The 2024 Tour de France will feature two time trials, the 21st stage between Monaco and Niza and the seventh stage between Nuits-Saint Georges - Gevrey-Chambertini (25.3 km). The French round will pass through four mountain ranges: the Apennines, the Italian and French Alps, the Central Massif, and the Pyrenees. There will be eight flat stages, four medium-mountain stages, seven mountain stages (four high-altitude finishes - Saint-Lary-Soulan Pla d'Adet, Plateau de Beille, Isola 2000, col de la Couillole), two time trials, and two rest days (July 8 and 15).

The third stage of the 2024 Tour de France will take place on Monday, covering 230 kilometers from Plaisance to Turin. Unlike Sunday, the favorites are unlikely to make a breakaway and will likely stay in the peloton due to the flat profile of the stage. Pogacar, who is currently wearing the yellow jersey, is expected to be cautious and save his energy for the upcoming mountain stages. The riders will start at 11:15 am and the finish is scheduled for 4:57 pm. Despite being the longest stage of the Tour, the pace is expected to be intense, with sprinters setting the tempo, especially on the final straight. The côte de Sommariva Perno (2.4 km at 5%) will need to be navigated before focusing on the final sprints. Turin will host the Tour de France for the second time, paying homage to Fausto Coppi, a two-time winner of the competition and five-time winner of the Giro. A point will be awarded for the mountain classification on the côte de Tortona, where he died.

**Tour de France: Vauquelin wins stage 2, Pogacar becomes new yellow jersey holder**
In the second stage of the 2024 Tour de France, from Cesenatico to Bologna, Kevin Vauquelin of the Arkea-B&B Hotels team won the stage, ahead of Abrahamsen with the polka dot jersey and Pacher. The battle for the general classification offered a thrilling spectacle, with Vingegaard and Evenepoel responding to Pogacar's attack, which ultimately made him the new yellow jersey holder. Roglic, on the other hand, struggled and lost 20 seconds to the main contenders. Eleven riders escaped early on, including Quentin Pacher, Axel Laurance, Hugo Houle, Nelson Oliveira, Kevin Vauquelin, Cristian Rodriguez, Mike Teunissen, Bram Welten, Jordan Jegat, Harold Tejada, and Jonas Abrahamsen. Abrahamsen, the polka dot jersey holder, strengthened his lead in the first GPM. Meanwhile, Welten, a gregario for the first yellow jersey holder Bardet, dropped out after a few kilometers. The breakaway riders gained over nine minutes on the main group, with the top riders limiting themselves to marking each other. The gap oscillated between five and seven minutes before returning to nine at 70 km from the finish. Before the two passes on San Luca, Lotto-Dstny began to reduce the gap, bringing it to three minutes at around 30 km from the finish. At 10 km from the finish, during the second pass on San Luca, Pogacar attacked, followed by Jonas Vingegaard. The two created a gap, while Roglic and Evenepoel were unable to respond. At the finish, Kevin Vauquelin triumphed after dropping the other breakaway riders on the climb, followed by Abrahamsen and Pacher. Meanwhile, Remco Evenepoel recovered the gap on Pogacar and Vingegaard in the final kilometer, arriving with them, but it was Tadej Pogacar who became the new yellow jersey holder of the Tour de France.
