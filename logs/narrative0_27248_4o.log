**NATE SILVER:** So, did HHS declare a public health emergency for mpox?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. The outbreak in the Congo was alarming, but the containment measures here were effective. 

**NATE SILVER:** Right, and given the data cutoff, we anticipated heightened vigilance but not a full-blown emergency declaration.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The African CDC's actions were pivotal, but the transmission rates didn't spike here as feared.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how our models consistently capture these nuances. Even with the Clade I severity, the U.S. response was robust.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. It underscores the importance of global monitoring and timely interventions.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the newsroom buzzes around them.*

(leaning back, thoughtful)  
So, the question was: Would the Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services declare a public health emergency for mpox before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(nodding)  
Yes, and given the data we had until August 15, our models gave it a 42.75% probability. 

**NATE SILVER**  
(smiling)  
Right, and as we now know, it didn't happen. The outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo was severe, but it didn't spill over into the U.S. as expected.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The containment efforts and international response were more effective than anticipated. 

**NATE SILVER**  
So, no declaration. Our models held up once again.

Well, Phil, the question on everyone's mind: Did HHS declare a public health emergency for mpox?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the Clade I outbreak in Congo, HHS saw no immediate threat to the US within the timeframe.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The African CDC's response was critical, but HHS likely assessed the risk of domestic spread as low.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The models factored in containment efforts and international coordination. The probability simply didn't tip past 50%.
