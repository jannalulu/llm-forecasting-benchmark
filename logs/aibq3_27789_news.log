**Experts warn AI bubble may soon burst**
The AI bubble may be bursting, according to experts, after a substantial one-day crash on the stock exchange on August 5, with AI-related businesses heavily impacted. The 'Magnificent Seven' - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - saw a combined loss of over $650 billion in market cap. Experts, such as Richard de Chazal of William Blair, believe that the AI hype bubble is popping, while others see it as a natural correction. Brook Dane of Goldman Sachs described the situation as 'a little bit of a leap of faith' and stated that AI businesses need to show more in the future, particularly in applications that use the technology in a more profound way than coding and customer service chatbots. 'You get these waves of both investment digestion and hype-reality,' Dane said. 'And the two of them play out across a multi-year horizon.'

Experts are warning of a potential bubble burst in the market, driven by the massive rally of KI-related stocks.

The article highlights the concerns of some strategists on Wall Street, who believe that the KI boom is unsustainable and will eventually lead to a crash.

**The End of the Golden Stock Market Era?**
The US presidential election is causing uncertainty in the financial markets, with the Vix index, a measure of market volatility, reaching its highest level since the US regional bank crisis in the spring of 2023. The uncertainty is fueled by the withdrawal of Joe Biden and his endorsement of Kamala Harris, leaving the outcome of the election open. Additionally, investors are concerned about the potential bursting of the 'Magnificent Seven' bubble, a group of tech companies that have driven market gains in the first half of the year. The Deutsche Bank analysts believe that the current market situation is reminiscent of historical patterns, with the S&P 500 often experiencing a sharp decline after a prolonged period of growth. They also point out that September has historically been a month of high market losses in recent years.

**Billionaire Paul Singer Says Magnificent 7 Stocks Are in a Bubble; Buys This Under-The-Radar Tech Stock**
Billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management has expressed skepticism about the AI bubble, calling it 'bubble land' and stating that AI is 'overhyped' with many applications not ready for prime time. The fund has reportedly said that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver 'value commensurate with the hype'. Elliott Management has also stated that it stayed away from 'bubble' stocks included in the Magnificent Seven group. In contrast, Insider Monkey's founder and Research Director Inan Dogan believes that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) is one of the stocks that Elliott Management owns a $1.2 billion stake in, and its biggest strength is its unique niche audience and the fact that it's playing on its own turf instead of competing with giants like TikTok or Facebook. Analysts believe that Pinterest's partnership with Amazon will also boost Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) revenue.

**Market Valuations in 2024: Bubble Concerns and Opportunities**
The current stock market rally, led by the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, has raised concerns about a potential bubble. However, analysis suggests that stocks are not as overpriced as they may seem. Traditional market indicators, such as the Buffett Indicator and the Shiller P/E, are flashing warning signs, but a closer look reveals that stocks are significantly less expensive compared to the dot-com bubble era. Tom Hancock, Ty Cobb, and Anthony Hene, portfolio managers at GMO Capital, believe that stocks are cheaper today despite rising fears among investors. The current market rally is centered on the promising prospects for artificial intelligence technology, and AI giants are more mature companies with proven business models. Peter Lynch once said, 'I can't recall ever once having seen the name of a market timer on Forbes' annual list of the richest people in the world.' Staying invested in stocks has proven to be the right long-term strategy, and there are opportunities for investors who look for them in undervalued, under-covered sectors, such as small-cap value stocks and the utility sector. 'Small-cap value was the most undervalued style box category in U.S. markets as of July,' according to Morningstar. 'Investors will have to monitor recession risks more carefully in the coming months to identify potential inflection points in the market,' said Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer. 'Stocks are not cheap by historical standards today, but there are opportunities for investors who look for them in undervalued, under-covered sectors.'

**Now's the Time to Diversify Beyond the ‘Magnificent Seven' Stocks**
The stock market has experienced a wild swing, with a sharp selloff on Monday, August 5. The cause of the market madness is attributed to a weaker-than-expected June jobs report, which fueled worries among investors that the Federal Reserve has left interest rates too high for too long, damaging the labor market and potentially leading to a recession. Additionally, the Bank of Japan's recent interest-rate hike accelerated the unwinding of the carry trade, a strategy where investors borrow cheap yen to fund the purchase of higher-yielding assets. This led to a ripple effect across global markets, causing losses to accelerate. The global selloff bruised Big Tech, with some market watchers warning that this was coming for a while. Strategists have noted that the concentration of stocks in the Magnificent Seven has led to a concentrated market, with just a handful of stocks driving a large portion of the entire stock market's returns. This has made the market vulnerable to a reset, which has occurred in recent weeks. To diversify beyond the Magnificent Seven stocks, investors can consider shifting their portfolio to small-value stocks, international stocks, or making small tweaks to their existing portfolio. Top ETF picks for portfolio diversification include Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF, Dimensional US Targeted Value ETF, and Avantis International Equity ETF. The Federal Reserve has signaled a rate cut could happen at its September meeting, but some market watchers believe that's not soon enough and want an emergency rate cut before then. Morningstar's senior US economist, Preston Caldwell, expects the Fed to start cutting rates in September, but not as aggressively as the market is pricing in, with three rate cuts of 25 basis points each or 75 basis points of total rate-cutting by the end of the year.

**AI Bubble on the Brink of Bursting?**
The stock market experienced a difficult week, with a mass sell-off of stocks driven by concerns of a recession on Wall Street and high interest rates. The tech industry, particularly the field of artificial intelligence (AI), was severely affected, with the stock prices of major tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, and Meta plummeting. The 'Magnificent Seven' list, which includes Amazon, Apple, and Tesla, lost a total of $650 billion as of Monday. Some experts believe that this may be a sign that the AI bubble is about to burst. The reaction of the AI industry to the market downturn is significant, given the large amount of money invested in this technology. According to Vox, the AI industry is valued at $1 trillion. However, despite this massive investment, the industry has not been able to withstand the market downturn, causing experts to sound the alarm. Richard de Chazal, a stock researcher, notes that the continuous success of the 'Magnificent Seven' over the past year or so has justified high valuations, but now things have slowed down. Although new products are still being released, people are becoming accustomed to them and even questioning the need for AI. As a result, large tech companies are starting to slow down and decline. In other words, if a $1 trillion industry that is experiencing a golden age can easily collapse due to a slight unpredictability, how much is this industry really worth? Even Goldman Sachs analysts seem to agree that there is some blame to be placed on AI for the recent downturn. This does not mean that products like ChatGPT from OpenAI or AI Overview from Google will suddenly disappear. However, companies developing AI are currently burning through cash, but have not yet created a product that can be easily monetized and is also free from significant errors, sometimes extremely silly. This is not a business model that inspires confidence. Proponents of technology argue that AI is the future, and in general, this may be true. However, recent events suggest that this market, which is still in its infancy, is more like a cardboard house than something solid.

**Has the AI bubble finally popped?**
The AI bubble has deflated, and the question is whether it has popped irrevocably, bringing the short-lived AI bull market to an end. The Nasdaq Composite closed 10% below its July peak, and Japan's Nikkei entered bear-market territory. The Magnificent Seven mega-cap tech stocks, which had captured the lion's share of the bull-market gains, hit a wall during earnings season as investors grew tired of the hype about AI's potential and demanded to see its financial impact. Some economists have rejected the dotcom comparisons with the recent AI boom, citing the relatively low valuations of major stock-market sectors. However, the economic and stock-market impact of generative AI has a lot in common with other famous bubbles related to emerging technology. Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at brokerage LPL Financial, said, 'It's not necessarily a bubble (like) the dotcom bubble. After all, these companies do make money, and they have got strong balance sheets.' However, the pace of revenue growth has not kept up with the pace of stock-price growth, and it's unlikely that renewed AI optimism can stave off a bear market. The US Federal Reserve's chairman Jerome Powell seemed confident that he had saved the economy, but the grim jobs data and the possibility of a 50-basis-point cut in interest rates suggest that the Fed may be thinking hard about this expediency.

**Georges Ugeux: The AI Bubble Has Burst**
Georges Ugeux, former vice-president of Wall Street, believes that the AI bubble has burst. The global stock markets plummeted on Monday, only to rebound. Was the market a victim of investor manipulation? This is partly what explains the unexpected shock, according to Georges Ugeux, CEO of Galileo Global Advisors and former vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange from 1996 to 2003. The markets stabilized on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, after two sessions of panic that saw indices plummet. The cause of the shock was a report published on Friday on US employment. It revived fears of a US recession, as unemployment growth was higher than expected. However, after the interest rate hikes implemented by the US Federal Reserve to combat inflation, a slowdown in the economy was expected. So, why the panic? And is it not the AI bubble that has just burst? Below, an interview with the CEO of Galileo Global Advisors, Georges Ugeux, to make sense of the situation. According to Ugeux, the correction is due to the overvaluation of the technology sector, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), which have driven the market's rise over the past two years. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady in September was also a factor, as investors were trying to pressure the central bank to lower rates to boost economic growth. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve understood the game and explained that there was no recession and no reason to adjust its policy. Ugeux believes that the 'rumor-mongers' in the financial communication world, including some media outlets, contributed to the panic. He also thinks that the AI bubble has burst, and that investors are starting to be more cautious. Ugeux was vice-president international at the New York Stock Exchange when the internet bubble burst, and he believes that the current situation is similar, but with different factors at play. He thinks that the AI bubble has crested, and that it's time to focus on the real value of AI, rather than its hype.

**US stock plunge: Could the AI bubble burst?**
The US stock market has seen a significant plunge, with the 'Magnificent Seven' – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – experiencing a decline in value due to fears of a potential recession and concerns over the heavy financing of AI technology. Recent earnings reports from companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet have sparked worries among investors that the massive funding put into data centres and AI is not paying off. Additionally, reports suggest that Nvidia may face months of delays for its new AI processors due to design flaws and production issues, which could impact its major customers. Activist investor group Elliot Management has described AI as 'overrated' and claimed Nvidia is 'in bubble land.' The future of OpenAI, a key player in the generative AI hype, is also a concern, as it is reportedly burning through billions of dollars to stay afloat.

**Apple and Nvidia tank in pre-market trading as 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks take a battering | Business Insider India**
The 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants, including Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla, saw significant declines in pre-market trading due to fears of a US recession and disappointing quarterly earnings reports. Apple shares dropped 9%, Nvidia declined by 14.5%, and Tesla was down 9.8%. The remaining four mega-cap tech companies, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, also saw declines between 5% and 8%. The declines were compounded by concerns over an AI bubble, particularly with Nvidia, which is at the center of fears due to its monopoly over critical semiconductor production. As a result, the combined value of the 'Magnificent Seven' has dropped to $14.7 trillion, down from a peak of $17 trillion in July.

**Magnificent seven tumble amid 'epic' rotation**
Analysts are divided over whether the recent market turbulence is a temporary blip or a sign of a return to value investing. Creative Planning strategist Charlie Bilello describes the recent rotation as 'one of the most epic rotations in market history', where cheaper stocks soared while the 'magnificent seven' and growth stocks plummeted. Bilello notes that growth stocks' outperformance over value had widened to levels unseen since the dotcom bubble in March 2000, setting the stage for value stocks to outperform their growth counterparts by near-record levels. Most agree that July's rotation was long overdue, but value investors think this is just the start, while growth-minded enthusiasts see it as a mere intermission before the Big Tech show resumes. 'This is just the start,' said value investors, in contrast to growth-minded enthusiasts who see July's performance as a 'mere intermission' before the Big Tech show resumes.

**Experts Warn of Bursting 'AI Bubble' as US Tech Market Experiences Downturn**
Experts warn of a bursting 'AI bubble' as the US tech market experiences a downturn. The Nasdaq has seen its worst losses in two years, with the 'Magnificent 7' - Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla - being the main drivers of the decline. The 'Glorreichen Sieben' have lost over $1 trillion in value since mid-July, with the S&P 500 index experiencing its worst losses since 2022. The decline is attributed to weak US economic data, rising recession fears, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Jochen Stanzl, chief analyst at CMC Markets, says, 'The expectations for the 'Glorreichen Sieben' are simply too high.' Arne Rautenberg, fund manager at Union Asset Management, adds, 'The price movements were sometimes extreme and may have gone too far down - especially since there were often no fundamental reasons on the company side.' Investors are shifting their portfolios to focus on smaller companies and 'standard' values, as they worry that the high investments in AI may not pay off in the short term. 'The necessary and extremely high investments in data centers will not quickly pay off,' says Mirko Maier, technology analyst at Landesbank Baden-Württemberg. 'There are simply not enough AI applications that generate revenue.' Goldman Sachs and Sequoia have also warned of a bubble, with Elliot stating that AI is overvalued and many applications are not yet mature.

**Is it the end of the road for the 'Magnificent Seven'?**
The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia, have seen a significant decline in their share prices in recent weeks. The rally that began in 2022, fueled by the buzz around Artificial Intelligence, has come to an abrupt halt. The stocks have fallen more than 10% in two weeks, with over $1.7 trillion wiped off their collective market capitalisation. Analysts point to the high expectations set by investors, who are now demanding quantitative returns for the billions of dollars pumped into AI. Aidan Donnelly, Head of Equities with Davy, suggests that the focus has shifted to the overall market, with the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions taking on increasing importance. He notes that a rate cut is expected in September, which may see money flowing back into the wider market. 'The future path of interest rates takes on an ever-increasing level of importance and, as a consequence, is and will continue to be an influence on equity market behaviour,' he said. 'The relief for both consumers and smaller companies of lower interest rates may take time to filter through to day-to-day activity, but the hope that this relief is forthcoming will be enough to change investor sentiment towards [some] cohorts of the market,' he concluded.

**Magnificent 7 Lose Over $300B As Volatility Index Surges, Traders Question Fed's Timing: What's Driving Markets Friday? - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)**
The US stock market experienced a sharp decline on the last trading day of the week, with all indices in the red at noon in New York. The decline was triggered by a cooler-than-expected July jobs report, which rattled risk sentiment and sparked concerns that the Federal Reserve may have erred in delaying a rate cut until September. The Magnificent Seven tech giants, including Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia, collectively lost over $300 billion in market value on Friday alone. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged over 30% to reach the high-20 levels, indicating a significant increase in market fear. Treasury bonds rallied, and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF surged 2.9%, while the Japanese yen also gained significantly. Gold edged down slightly, and oil prices fell more than 4% for the day. Bitcoin BTC/USD fell over 3%.

**Hedge fund Elliott says AI is 'overhyped', Nvidia stock 'a bubble' By Investing.com**
Hedge fund Elliott Management has expressed skepticism about the AI technology driving Nvidia's stock rally, calling it 'overhyped' and stating that many touted AI applications are 'never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.' The fund believes that Nvidia's stock is in a 'bubble' and that the high-volume purchases of its graphics processing units by Big Tech companies will not continue. Elliott Management has also noted that AI has yet to deliver the significant productivity boost that was promised, with 'few real uses' beyond 'summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding.' The fund has a small position in Nvidia, valued at approximately $4.5 million, but has largely avoided what it describes as bubble stocks, including those in the Magnificent Seven.

**Will the stock market crash in August?**
Despite the FTSE 100 being up 1.36% to 8,386.54, many investors believe a stock market crash is imminent, particularly in the US. Economist Harry Dent warned that the market is in a 'bubble of all bubbles', while Paul Dietrich, chief investment strategist at B. Riley, predicts a 48% crash. The Magnificent Seven mega-cap US tech stocks, including Nvidia, have seen significant gains but are now facing increased competition and scrutiny. Investors are waiting for earnings reports from Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Meta, and are nervous about the high-stakes US presidential election and global events. The author suggests that August will be a good time to buy shares, particularly in the FTSE 100, as there are great value UK stocks available. 'I think August will be a brilliant time to buy shares. I'm certainly not selling,' the author says.

**Yardeni: Rotating market betting on pivoting Powell**
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to acknowledge a stronger-than-expected economy and robust labor market, and hint at a potential rate cut in September if upcoming CPI reports show further progress towards the inflation goal, according to Yardeni Research. This could lead to a continued rotation out of the 'Magnificent-7' stocks into other stocks that will benefit from lower interest rates, as investors bet on a potential rate cut. Yardeni analysts predict that the S&P 500 will remain below its July 16 record high until the November elections, followed by a year-end rally. 'If that's right, then the S&P 500 might continue to churn below its July 16 record high as investors continue to rotate out of the Magnificent-7 into everything else,' Yardeni analysts said. 'Then again, he might push back on the widespread belief that there might be more than one rate cut over the rest of this year.'

**US stock market: Big tech slump drags Wall Street, overshadows broad market gains ahead of interest rate decision**
The US stock market saw a divergence in performance on Tuesday, July 30, ahead of crucial interest rate decisions and earnings reports. The S&P 500 dropped 0.5%, while the Dow Jones rose 0.5% and the Nasdaq fell 1.3%. Big Tech stocks, including Microsoft, Nvidia, and the 'Magnificent Seven,' weighed on the market, while JetBlue Airways and PayPal saw significant gains after reporting profits and exceeding expectations. Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday and are expecting a potential cut in September due to easing inflation and a weakening job market, as stated by Joe Mazzola, strategist at Charles Schwab, 'Investors don't expect a rate change when the meeting concludes tomorrow, but after June's inflation metrics were softer than expected and with a job market that's weakening, they have high expectations for a cut during September's meeting'.

**Neve Campbell Confirms 'Scream 7' Will Focus on Sidney Prescott**
Neve Campbell has confirmed that the seventh installment of the 'Scream' franchise will focus on her iconic character, Sidney Prescott. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Campbell stated, 'We're going to follow Sidney [in 'Scream 7']. They told me the concept for the next film, and that's why I agreed to return to the franchise.' She added, 'I love these movies, and they're a lot of fun to make. I'm very grateful to be a part of this franchise, and I never would have imagined being part of a saga that has lasted for so many decades. The fans are incredible! They really love this franchise, and I'm excited to deliver a new chapter.' The production of 'Scream 7' was initially set to begin in September 2024, but due to scheduling conflicts, the start date has been pushed back to December. Campbell explained, 'We were supposed to start filming in September, but now it will be in December due to some scheduling conflicts with Kevin and me. We're aligning everything. And actually, I think this is good, because we'll have time to do everything right.' The film is expected to be released in March 2025 and will feature the return of Campbell as Sidney Prescott and Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers. Patrick Dempsey is in negotiations to reprise his role as Mark Kincaid from the third film. The plot is allegedly centered around Sidney's family, with the four of them being the main protagonists: Sid, her husband, and their two daughters.

**Veteran Investor Boosts S&P 500 Price Targets: 'Magnificent 7 Stocks Will Remain Magnificent' - SPDR S&P 500 (ARCA:SPY)**
Veteran investor Ed Yardeni has increased his year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,800 points, a 6% surge from current levels, and projects the index to reach 8,400 points by 2029 with forward earnings of $400 per share. He expects the 'Magnificent 7 Stocks' to remain strong and drive the S&P 500 forward. Yardeni also forecasts a 10%-12% year-over-year EPS growth and a 5.7% year-over-year increase in forward revenues per share. However, he expects some near-term volatility due to the election period and predicts the Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in September. 'We don't see a recession looming,' Yardeni said. 'That's a solid increase considering that inflation has moderated significantly over the past year,' he added. 'We think that the very highly valued Magnificent-7 stocks will remain magnificent and continue to sport a high collective forward P/E, providing support to the S&P 500,' Yardeni stated. 'While we expect the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cut interest rates at its September meeting, we do not think it needs to because we don't see a recession looming,' he explained.

**Stocks Edge Up as 'Big-to-Small' Rotation Pauses: Markets Wrap**
Stocks rose ahead of major central bank decisions, key economic data, and earnings from four megacaps worth nearly $10 trillion. The S&P 500 hovered near 5,465, with the 'Magnificent Seven' megacaps gaining 1%. The Russell 2000 of smaller firms fell 1.1%. Experts believe the Fed's decision on Wednesday will have a significant impact on the market, with some predicting a rate cut in September. The rotation from big tech to small caps may be pausing, but experts still believe the equity market backdrop is favorable due to resilient growth, falling inflation, likely Fed rate cuts, and AI spending.

**Silicon Valley Gears Up for Crucial Earnings Week**
The tech industry is gearing up for a crucial earnings week, with Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Apple set to report their quarterly earnings. The market has been rotating out of Big Tech, with investors seeking returns in other sectors. The so-called Magnificent Seven, which includes the aforementioned four tech firms, plus Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla, have been driving the market's growth, but their share prices have been falling. The AI bubble has been compared to the 1990s tech bubble, and investors are waiting to see if the heavy investment in AI will pay off. The rotation to other sectors is likely to continue, with Goldman Sachs projecting a narrowing gap between Big Tech's earnings-per-share growth and the S&P 500's median annual EPS growth. The week will also see a jobs report and a Fed meeting, which may bring about an interest rate cut.

**Expert Warns of KI Bubble Burst: 'People Will Lose Money if They Don't Exit'**
Experts are warning of a potential bubble burst in the market, driven by the massive rally of KI-related stocks. The Magnificent Seven, a group of megacap companies, have seen their stock prices surge, with some experts predicting a further 22% increase in 2024. However, others are skeptical, warning that the bubble could burst and cause investors to lose money if they don't exit the market. The article highlights the concerns of some strategists on Wall Street, who believe that the KI boom is unsustainable and will eventually lead to a crash.

**MARKT USA/Wall Street expected to recover with interest rate debate**
The US stock market, particularly Wall Street, is expected to recover from its recent decline due to the upcoming debate on interest rates. The shift from technology stocks to other sectors could reverse by the end of the week, as futures on the technology-heavy Nasdaq suggest a strong opening on the cash market. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which will be released before the market opens, will be closely watched. According to Derren Nathan, Head of Equity Analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, 'hopes for a rate cut in September remain high, and today's PCE inflation data will be closely watched.' Technology stocks are considered highly sensitive to interest rates and may react to changes in speculation. The 'Magnificent 7', the seven most capitalized technology titles, are all trading higher before the market opens. However, Nathan notes that the recent decline in these seven stocks is not comparable to the dot-com bubble, as these are financially strong companies that dominate their category.

**Big Decline But No Bad Breadth?**
The S&P 500 fell 2.3% on Wednesday, snapping a 356-trading day streak without a 2% decline. The Magnificent 7, including Tesla and Alphabet, had a historically bad session due to poor earnings reactions. This weakness was exacerbated by the concentration of large stocks in the S&P 500. However, despite the decline, nearly a third of the S&P 500's members finished the day with a gain, making it a five times stronger daily breadth reading than the norm. This is a rare occurrence, with the last similar instances dating back to 2000 during the Dot Com Bubble.

**Not so magnificent - The Magnificent 7's stock values plummet**
The stock values of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla, have plummeted by 7,000 billion kronor in the past week, equivalent to Sweden's GDP. The companies' stock prices have fallen sharply after their Q2 reports, with an average decline of 4.7%. Inge Heydorn, a fund manager at GP Bullhound, says that the reaction to the reports has been intense, citing Tesla's 13% drop as an example. However, he remains optimistic, stating that the companies are delivering profits and will continue to do so in the future. Other observers have warned that the US market is overvalued and a correction is needed. Christer Gardell, founder of Cevian, says that there is still a lot of air to come out before the bubble bursts.

**Magnificent 7 Still Comprise Over 30% Of S&P 500 Despite Tech Correction**
Despite a recent correction in the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, the seven largest U.S. technology companies, known as the 'Magnificent 7', still make up over 30% of the S&P 500. The companies, which include Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla, have been in the red over the past 10 market sessions, but their collective weight in the S&P 500 remains significant. The data reflects a persistent market bullishness in artificial intelligence and Big Tech, with the Roundhill ETF up over 35% in 2024. Some experts have predicted a larger market correction, citing 'bubble-ish' valuations for NVIDIA and other heavily weighted stocks.

This has put the price of Bitcoin on track to reach $88,000 by September, according to Ichimoku analysis by Titan of Crypto.

**Could Earnings Stop the Small-Cap Stocks Rotation in Its Tracks?**
The stock market has seen a rotation from big tech to small caps, with tech mega-caps like Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, and Alphabet leading the way on Monday. This rotation is expected to be tested by upcoming earnings reports from the Magnificent Seven, a group of large-cap tech companies. Analysts expect these companies to report slower earnings growth, while small caps are expected to report a decline in profit. The rotation is driven by expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, which would benefit smaller companies that rely more on floating-rate debt. The S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated, and the mega-cap to small-cap rotation could be a turning point for the market.

**The End of the Golden Stock Market Era?**
The US presidential election is causing uncertainty in the financial markets, with the Vix index, a measure of market volatility, reaching its highest level since the US regional bank crisis in the spring of 2023. The uncertainty is fueled by the withdrawal of Joe Biden and his endorsement of Kamala Harris, leaving the outcome of the election open. Additionally, investors are concerned about the potential bursting of the 'Magnificent Seven' bubble, a group of tech companies that have driven market gains in the first half of the year. The Deutsche Bank analysts believe that the current market situation is reminiscent of historical patterns, with the S&P 500 often experiencing a sharp decline after a prolonged period of growth. They also point out that September has historically been a month of high market losses in recent years.

**Magnificent seven stocks take a pounding as investors rotate into cheaper companies**
Investors are rotating out of expensive tech stocks and into cheaper names, leading to a sell-off in the 'magnificent seven' stocks, including Nvidia, which lost over $200 billion in market value.

The 'Magnificent Seven' megacaps, including Tesla and Alphabet, are expected to report earnings next week. Analysts are looking for strong earnings and softening inflation to reverse the market's recent weakness and spark a new leg higher. However, there is a risk of a setback for the equities this summer due to weaker growth data, dovish central bank expectations, and rising policy uncertainty. Investors are flocking to US equities, expecting a September rate cut and a Trump presidency, but some strategists warn of a 'buy rumor, sell fact' opportunity after the rate cut.

**‘Magnificent Seven' Extend This Week's Rout to 5%: Markets Wrap**
The stock market ended the week with a decline, with the S&P 500 falling to around 5,500. Tech stocks led the losses, with the 'Magnificent Seven' megacaps dropping 5%. The decline was attributed to a rotation trade, where investors sold winners and bought laggards, and bets on a broadening rally. Glen Smith at GDS Wealth Management said that strong tech earnings and softening inflation could reverse the market's weakness and spark a new leg higher. The 'Magnificent Seven' megacaps, including Tesla and Alphabet, will report earnings next week, with analysts expecting to press Elon Musk on the progress of his electric-vehicle plans and Google's revenue boost from artificial intelligence.

**Stocks have been up but will they stay there for the rest of 2024?**
The US economy has performed well in the first half of 2024, with inflation moderating, jobs plentiful, and no recession risks. The stock market has also risen 15% over the first six months. However, there are questions about the second half of the year, including whether inflation will continue to decline, whether the 'Magnificent 7' tech stocks will maintain their momentum, and whether the presidential election will have an impact on the market. Economists at Northern Trust expect a rate cut in September if inflation data remains 'well-behaved'. The 'Magnificent 7' stocks, which include Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla, have been hot, but may not be able to sustain their pace. Rebalancing a portfolio may be necessary to maintain a targeted mix. The presidential election is unlikely to trigger a stock market selloff, and presidential re-election years tend to be favorable for stocks.

**Will the KI-Hype Burst Like the Dotcom Bubble?**
The hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a surge in investments, with many companies investing billions of dollars in the field. However, experts at Goldman Sachs warn of a potential bubble, citing similarities to the dot-com bubble at the beginning of the century. The 'magnificent seven' tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, saw a record loss of $623 billion in a single day, while the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, rose by over 4%. Experts believe that the recent decline in the 'Glorreichen Sieben' is due to investors shifting their focus to smaller companies that are more likely to benefit from the AI trend. The development of AI is considered more solid than the dot-com bubble, with companies actually generating profits. The future of the AI hype is uncertain, and it is unclear whether large or smaller tech companies will benefit the most.

**What the 2000's Tech bubble says about today's suspected rotation**
Deutsche Bank Research's Jim Reid suggests that the current suspected rotation in the stock market may be similar to the 2000 tech bubble burst. He notes that the S&P 500 equal weight index (RSP) was up 1.17% while the S&P 500 (SP500) was down 0.88%, with the Magnificent Seven stocks (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, AMZN, META, TSLA) down 4.26%. Reid believes that this could be the start of a great rotation, but only a brave or foolish person would be confident in such a statement. He notes that in the lead-up to the tech peak in 2000, defensive sectors (consumer staples, health care, utilities) were falling sharply, suggesting a rotation out of steady stocks into high-octane ones. However, when the tech bubble burst, money came back into defensive sectors, and by the end of the year, tech stocks were up 35-45% higher than before the burst. Reid concludes that the ultimate rotation was significant, with defensive sectors climbing 25% higher since March 2000.

**Tech Giants 'Magnificent 7' Lose $623 Billion as Inflation Cools Down**
The US inflation rate has cooled down stronger than expected, making a first interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in September more realistic. This has led to a significant decline in the stock prices of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' - Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. The 'Magnificent Seven' have lost $623 billion in a single day, with Nvidia alone losing $180 billion. The decline is attributed to the hype around new AI technologies and stable business prospects, making the stocks attractive to investors. However, with interest rates expected to fall, smaller companies will also become more attractive, and investors can expect a normalization of the market. The current correction is seen as a precursor to a time when inflation will continue to decline and the Fed will send clearer signals.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has welcomed the recent slowdown in price rises but is awaiting further progress.

**Mag. 7 rotation, earnings, Sahm Rule: Market Takeaways**
The Magnificent Seven, a group of tech stocks, is experiencing a rotation, with Apple closing higher while Nvidia and Amazon slump. S&P 500 earnings expectations are at an all-time high, and the 'Sahm Rule', a recession indicator, could be triggered. Yahoo Finance Senior Markets Reporter Jared Blikre discusses the latest market trends and what they could mean for markets moving forward. The rotation is not limited to tech, with financials and industrials also showing signs of improvement. Earnings expectations are at a record high, with 80% of S&P 500 components experiencing earnings revisions to the upside over the last three months. The Sahm Rule, which tracks the three-month moving average of the jobless rate, could be triggered if unemployment rises to 4.2% in the next month or two, which could lead to the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September.

**Avoid this Crowded Trade (But Don't Ignore the Sector)**
The article discusses the concept of a crowded trade, where investors are flocking to the same successful stocks, such as the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, and how this can lead to missed opportunities. The author, Ryan Dinse, argues that while AI is a promising technology, the hype around the 'Mag 7' may be overdone and that investors should be cautious and look beyond these stocks for potential winners. He also notes that the path to AI adoption is unpredictable and that mistakes can be made, citing the dot-com bubble as an example. The article concludes by encouraging readers to keep an eye out for companies that can produce 'killer apps' and to be cautious of overcrowded trades.
