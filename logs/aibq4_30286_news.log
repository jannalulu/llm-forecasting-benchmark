**The Game Awards: Astro Bot a Strong Contender for GOTY**
The Game Awards are approaching, and with it, the highly anticipated 'Game of the Year' (GOTY) award. The ceremony will also cover other categories, such as best game, best narrative, and best vocal performance. The nominees are numerous, including Astro Bot, a PS5 exclusive that has sold 1.5 million copies in just two months, with a score of 18/20 from JV. However, as noted by Polygon, Astro Bot is likely to be nominated in the 'Best Family Game' category, which often struggles to make an impact during the ceremony and win the GOTY award. Other contenders include Metaphor: ReFantazio, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Balatro, Silent Hill 2 (2024), and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
