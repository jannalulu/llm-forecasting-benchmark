*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, analyzing the recent political outcome.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big questionâ€”did the Prime Minister of France on August 31 belong to the New Popular Front but not LFI?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 43.25%. The likelihood was always slim given the coalition dynamics after the snap elections.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The New Popular Front was strong, but the internal divisions, especially with LFI, made it unlikely for a non-LFI member to clinch the position.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The centrist Together party had a more strategic play, and the National Rally's influence can't be ignored.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the models held up again. It's fascinating how these probabilities play out in real-time politics.

*They nod in agreement, turning to discuss the next potential forecast.*
