**NATE:** So, did it happen? Did the UN finally get a new member?

**PHILIP:** No, our models had it at 12.34%. The hurdles were just too high.

**NATE:** Right, especially with the Security Council's veto power and the geopolitical tensions.

**PHILIP:** Exactly. The process is slow. Last one was South Sudan in 2011.

**NATE:** And with Taiwan, Palestine, Kosovo... none made the cut.

**PHILIP:** Our models were spot on. The diplomatic landscape hasn't shifted enough.

**NATE:** Well, maybe next year. But for now, the UN stays at 193.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Will the UN have over 193 member states?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 65.80%. Palestine's diplomatic push was strong, and geopolitical shifts favored their membership.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. Despite the Security Council's complexities and China's stance on Taiwan, your models were spot on.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Historical trends and emerging independence movements played a crucial role in our forecast. 

**NATE SILVER:** It's remarkable how the intricate dance of diplomacy and politics can be so accurately predicted.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. The models never lie, especially with probabilities like these.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by newspapers and laptops.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question was whether the UN would have more than 193 member states by October 1, 2024. Did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.25%. The geopolitical landscape was just too complex. 

**NATE SILVER:** Right, with all the factors—Palestine, Kosovo, Taiwan, and others—none made it through the Security Council. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The veto power and geopolitical tensions were significant barriers.

**NATE SILVER:** And no new states emerged in that time frame either. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The historical rate of new admissions was a clear indicator. 

**NATE SILVER:** Our models were spot on, as always.

No, our models had it at 15.67%. Despite some diplomatic pushes, the geopolitical hurdles were too significant.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The Security Council's dynamics and the complexity of state recognition played major roles.

Palestine and Kosovo made some strides, but the veto power and existing tensions kept them from crossing the finish line.
