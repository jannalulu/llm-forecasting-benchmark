Let me systematically analyze this:

1. Specific Nomination Details:
- Green Day is nominated for Best Rock for their song "Dilemma"
- Other nominees in Best Rock category: Bon Jovi, Coldplay, Kings of Leon, Lenny Kravitz, U2

2. Comparative Analysis:
- Green Day is a well-established rock band with significant historical credibility
- No clear front-runner emerges from the nominee list
- No additional information suggests a strong inherent advantage for "Dilemma"

3. Voting Mechanism:
- MTV VMAs use public voting across 15 categories
- Fans can vote online until August 30th
- This introduces an element of popularity contest beyond pure artistic merit

4. Base Rate Consideration:
- Historical VMA voting often rewards current popularity and momentum
- No clear evidence of overwhelming fan support for "Dilemma"

5. Uncertainty Factors:
- Public voting introduces significant randomness
- Relatively even playing field among rock nominees

6. Probability Calibration:
- No strong indicators suggesting a high probability of winning
- Reasonable to expect a relatively even distribution of potential outcomes

Balancing these factors carefully, I'm inclined to a probabilistic approach that reflects the inherent uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 27.50%, but 18.75% being the most likely. Probability: 18.75%.
