**Nuclear Powers Increase Arsenals, Modernize and Deploy New Weapons**
The report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) reveals that nuclear powers have increased their nuclear arsenals in 2023, modernizing and deploying new weapons to rely more on deterrence. The global total of approximately 12,121 nuclear warheads in January 2024 includes 9,585 in military stockpiles, with 3,904 deployed on missiles and aircraft, 60 more than in January 2023. China is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country, with India, Pakistan, and North Korea also seeking to deploy more warheads on ballistic missiles. The US and Russia together possess nearly 90% of all nuclear weapons, with the US having deployed 36 more warheads in 2023. The transparency of nuclear forces has decreased in both countries since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Sipri report also notes that the UK has not increased its nuclear arsenal in 2023, but is expected to do so in the future, while France has continued to develop a third-generation nuclear-powered submarine and a new air-launched cruise missile. India and Pakistan have also expanded their nuclear arsenals, with India focusing on long-range weapons, including those capable of reaching targets across China. North Korea continues to prioritize its military nuclear program as a central element of its national security strategy, with the Sipri estimating that the country has assembled around 50 warheads and has sufficient fissile material to reach a total of 90 warheads, both significant increases from January 2023. Israel, which does not publicly acknowledge possessing nuclear weapons, is reportedly modernizing its nuclear arsenal and appears to be upgrading its plutonium production site at Dimona.

**Kushal Kumar Predicts the Start of the Third World War on June 18, 2024**
Kushal Kumar, an Indian astrologer known as 'New Nostradamus', predicts that the Third World War is 'very close' and sets a specific date for the start of the 'large-scale conflict'. Kumar uses the 'Vedic astrological chart', a method of predicting the future based on Hindu culture, which supposes 'a map of our karma', using planetary and stellar alignment. He mentions recent events such as the launch of Hezbollah forces in Lebanon after the death of a commander, Russia's deployment of warships to Cuba, including a nuclear submarine, and the recent terrorist attack in the Himalayas. He believes that the scenario of war in critical points around the world is unfolding and that the Tuesday, June 18, 2024, has the strongest planetary stimulation to trigger the Third World War. He also mentions that June 29 could be the day of judgment.

**Indian Navy's 'Stealthy' Nuclear Submarine Base In World's Largest Bay Set To Puncture Chinese PLAN**
India is building a $3.75 billion nuclear submarine base, INS Varsha, in the Bay of Bengal, which will be the world's largest bay. The base will accommodate at least 10 nuclear submarines and will be operational by 2025-2026. The base is designed to be stealthy, with tunnels bored into a mountain to allow submarines to enter and exit without surfacing and being detected by enemy spy satellites. The base will also have repair and maintenance facilities, amenities for crew rest, and advanced command and control systems. The base is seen as a counterbalance to China's growing naval assertiveness in the region and will bolster India's credible deterrence capabilities and strategic interests.

**Kushal Kumar's Prediction of World War III: A 'Second Call' on June 29?**
Kushal Kumar, known as the 'Indian Nostradamus', predicted the start of World War III on June 18, but it did not happen. However, he claims that the 'second call' for the start of the conflict will be on June 29. Kumar's predictions are based on Vedic astrology, a practice linked to Hindu culture. He sees the Vedic astrological map as a 'map of our karma', using planetary alignments to identify significant events. Kumar emphasizes the need for meticulous interpretation of these planetary impacts, recognizing the potential for human error in such predictions. He himself considered the error in making the prediction about World War III. Kumar highlights the recent global events, such as the escalation of tensions between Israel and Lebanon, North Korea's provocative actions on the South Korean border, and Russia's sending of warships, including a nuclear submarine, to Havana, as well as China's military exercises near Taiwan, which have alarmed American authorities.

**Indian Astrologer Predicts Third World War to Start on June 18, 2024**
Indian astrologer Kushal Kumar, known as the 'new Nostradamus', believes that the third world war may start this year. He shared details with journalists about when to expect this day. According to Kumar, June 18, 2024, has the strongest planetary stimulus that can trigger a third world war. He advises people to observe the development of the war scenario in hotspots around the world over time. Kumar believes that these events can trigger a large-scale conflict, including a terrorist attack in the Himalayas, shooting in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, escalation of the conflict in Israel, sending Russian warships, including an atomic submarine, to Cuba, Chinese military exercises off the coast of Taiwan, which cause concern among American officials. He predicts that events will unfold closer to midnight. Additionally, according to the predictor, planetary events indicate the proximity of the planet to a nuclear war, reports The Daily Star. It is worth noting that in the fall of 2024, Russian forces may occupy Kharkiv. This prophecy was given by medium Inna Misha.

**Modi 3.0 must bite the bullet to make military future-ready**
India's defence establishment must prepare for an aggressive China and its expanding military collusiveness with Pakistan in the maritime domain. To achieve this, the government must implement several reforms, including the rollout of tri-service theatre commands, a national security strategy, and a stronger defence-industrial base. India needs a more robust nuclear triad, including ballistic missiles and nuclear-powered submarines. The government should also prioritize the development of military capabilities in space, cyberspace, and other areas. Additionally, India should focus on indigenously manufacturing advanced weapon systems and platforms, and revamp the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to concentrate on fundamental and applied R&D.

**India's Submarine Base in the Bay of Bengal: A Strategic Move to Counter Pakistan and China**
India is building a submarine base in the Bay of Bengal, which will provide a refuge for its maritime nuclear deterrent against Pakistan and China. The Indian Defense Research Wing has reported that the ambitious project, called Varsha, is rapidly taking shape on the eastern coast at Rambilli. Recent satellite images indicate a rapid expansion, suggesting that the project is on track to be completed within the expected timeframe. The Varsha project is a strategic naval base designed to host a fleet of over 12 submarines with nuclear-powered ballistic missiles. Its most striking feature is a vast underground complex, revealed by satellite images, which includes probable submarine pens. The underground base aims to protect Indian submarines, SSBN, from aerial and satellite threats, while providing essential support structures for nuclear engineering. On the surface, the construction of piers suggests the ability to accommodate a variety of surface ships, improving the operational flexibility of the base. The Varsha project is designed to significantly improve India's naval deterrence, allowing the deployment of nuclear-armed submarines from a secure underground base. This signals India's commitment to maintaining a formidable presence in the Indian Ocean, ensuring national security and strengthening its position as a major maritime power.

**US may expand nuclear arsenal – Biden aide**
The US is considering increasing its nuclear warheads in the coming years due to the international situation, according to a senior official on the National Security Council. Pranay Vaddi, senior director for arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation, stated that the US may need to increase its deployed numbers to deter adversaries and protect the American people and allies. This comes as the New START treaty with Russia is set to expire in 2026 and China has shown no interest in negotiating a nuclear treaty with the US. The US has already announced plans to update its nuclear triad, including new bombers, submarines, and gravity bombs, but these projects are over budget and behind schedule.

**US Considers Alternative Agreements with Russia Instead of START**
The US is considering alternative agreements with Russia instead of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). According to Pranay Vaddi, the senior director of the National Security Council for non-proliferation, the US has a specific approach and wants Russia and China to adopt it as well. Vaddi stated, 'For us, it looks like the beginning of negotiations with Russia on a subsequent agreement or a complex of agreements to ensure at least the preservation of restrictions between the US and our largest nuclear opponent.' He also expressed hope that the US can start negotiations with Russia on arms control and strategic stability before the expiration of the treaty. The START was signed in 2010 and aimed to reduce the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and their launchers, as well as heavy bombers and their nuclear weapons. The treaty was set to expire in February 2026, but Russia suspended its participation in February 2023. The US has been urging Russia to return to compliance with the treaty.

**Pokhran anniversary: Why May 11, 1998 is Bharat's pivotal moment**
May 11, 1998, marked a pivotal moment in India's nuclear history when the country conducted the Shakti series of nuclear tests under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. This led to India's nuclear capability growing significantly, with a complete nuclear triad and robust second strike capability. The tests also marked a shift in India's stance, with Vajpayee naming China as the key reason for going nuclear. Today, India has a 5000 km range land-based Agni ballistic missile and a 3000 km range K-4 submarine-based ballistic missile, which can cover India from threats posed by China, Pakistan, and beyond. The article highlights how India's nuclear deterrence has helped the country stand up to military and diplomatic coercion from global powers, and how the country has utilized its nuclear capability to produce clean energy and respond to climate change.
