Let me analyze this carefully:

1. This is about a USDA recall of Boar's Head deli meat which needs to be changed from Active to Closed status before October 1, 2024.

2. Key considerations:
- Most FSIS recalls are typically resolved within 2-3 months
- This is an expansion of a previous recall, which suggests more complexity
- The recall involves ready-to-eat meat products, which are high-risk items
- Given it's a major brand (Boar's Head), there's likely significant pressure to resolve quickly
- However, expanded recalls often take longer to resolve as they require more extensive verification
- We still have about 2.5 weeks until the deadline
- The USDA needs to verify that all affected products have been removed from the market
- The company needs to demonstrate corrective actions have been implemented

3. Looking at historical FSIS recall patterns:
- Simple recalls often close within 30-60 days
- Complex or expanded recalls can take 3-6 months
- Given the short timeframe remaining, probability is reduced

4. This suggests a moderate-to-low probability of resolution by October 1st, given the expanded nature of the recall and the short remaining timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%.
