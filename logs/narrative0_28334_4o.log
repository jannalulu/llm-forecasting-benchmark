**NATE SILVER:** So, the question—did it happen? Our models had it at 45.25%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right, no significant attack within Israel's borders. Given the ongoing conflicts, it was a tense year, but the Iron Dome held strong.

**NATE SILVER:** The Iranian and Houthi attempts were close calls, but they didn’t meet the deadly threshold.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And the Hezbollah escalation on September 17 was outside the specified area. 

**NATE SILVER:** It's a testament to Israel's defense capabilities. The models predicted a low probability, and they were spot on.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, a relief for many, but the tensions remain. We’ll continue to monitor the situation closely. 

*They nod in agreement, the weight of accuracy evident.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it's October 2nd, and the question on everyone's mind is: Did a deadly attack occur within Israel causing at least five deaths before yesterday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 45.23%. Despite the high tensions and increased rocket attacks, Israel's defense systems have held strong.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the escalation with Hezbollah and the recent incidents were worrying, but none crossed the tragic threshold we feared.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yet, with over 10,000 rockets fired since early 2024, the risk remains. Our models will keep adjusting as the situation evolves.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. Let's hope for continued resilience and peace in the region.

**NATE SILVER:** So, did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 42.75%. Despite the heightened tensions and frequent exchanges, Israel's defenses held strong.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. The constant barrage and isolated incidents were concerning, but none breached that critical threshold.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The escalation, especially after the Hezbollah pager incident, was intense. Yet, the lack of a large-scale attack within Israel proper was telling.

**NATE SILVER:** The models were spot on again. Israel's strategic responses likely played a role in deterrence.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Though the situation remains volatile, the probability of a deadly attack within those parameters didn't materialize.

*They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**NATE SILVER:** Let's keep an eye on the developments. The region's future remains uncertain.
