Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Competition Analysis:
- Lisa's "Rockstar" is nominated alongside:
- Jungkook ft. Latto "Seven"
- NCT Dream "Smoothie"
- NewJeans "Super Shy"
- Stray Kids "LALALALA"
- TXT "Deja Vu"

2. Positive Factors for Lisa:
- Most nominated K-pop artist with 4 nominations total
- Making history as first K-pop soloist to perform at VMAs
- Previous VMA winner (first female K-pop soloist to win in 2022)
- "Rockstar" became most-viewed video by female solo artist in 2024
- Strong performance metrics including streaming records
- High-profile solo performance scheduled at the ceremony

3. Negative Factors:
- Strong competition, especially from Jungkook's "Seven" which has been commercially successful
- NewJeans "Super Shy" was also a massive global hit
- Being nominated in multiple categories doesn't guarantee winning specific categories

4. Historical Context:
- Lisa has previously won at VMAs, showing voter support
- BLACKPINK members have strong track record at VMAs
- Performance slot often correlates with wins

5. Current Momentum:
- Lisa has significant media attention around her performance
- Multiple nominations suggest strong industry support
- Recent announcement of new single "New Woman" maintains relevance

6. Balance of Factors:
- Strong historical precedent
- Current momentum and visibility
- Multiple nominations showing broad support
- But facing serious competition from other successful acts

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 65.50%, with 55.25% being the most likely. Probability: 55.25%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key factors supporting a higher probability:
1. Lisa has received 4 nominations total, the most of any K-pop artist this year, suggesting strong industry support
2. "Rockstar" has performed well commercially, becoming the most-viewed video by a female solo artist in 2024
3. Lisa has previously won at VMAs (2022), showing she can succeed in this arena
4. She is performing at the ceremony, which often correlates with winning
5. She's making history as the first K-pop soloist to perform at VMAs, indicating special recognition

Factors suggesting a lower probability:
1. Strong competition in the category from established artists like Jungkook (BTS), who has two nominations
2. Other nominees include popular groups NCT Dream, NewJeans, and Stray Kids
3. Being nominated in multiple categories could split votes
4. Historical precedent shows repeat wins are relatively rare

Additional considerations:
1. Lisa is now independent from YG Entertainment, which could affect industry support
2. The song "Rockstar" has garnered significant attention and critical acclaim
3. Her upcoming collaboration with Rosalía ("New Woman") keeps her relevant
4. She's positioned as a pioneering solo K-pop artist

Breaking down probabilities:
- Base rate for previous winners repeating: ~30%
- Adjustment for multiple nominations: +10%
- Adjustment for live performance: +15%
- Adjustment for commercial success: +10%
- Adjustment for competition strength: -15%
