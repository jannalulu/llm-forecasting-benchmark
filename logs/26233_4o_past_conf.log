To forecast whether "Deadpool & Wolverine" will have a higher opening domestic box office than the combined $185,548,391 of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine," we need to consider several steps and evidence.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**:
   - The original "Deadpool" (2016) set an R-rated opening record with $132.4 million. "The Wolverine" (2013) opened with $53.1 million. This historical context shows that "Deadpool" has a much stronger box office draw compared to "The Wolverine."
   - Recent strong performances of R-rated superhero movies, such as "Joker" with a significant opening, suggest a favorable audience reception for such films.

2. **Current Box Office Projections**:
   - Recent reports mostly project "Deadpool & Wolverine" to open between $160 million and $165 million. However, earlier projections indicated potential earnings of $200 to $239 million.
   - Despite varying projections, the range typically falls short of the required $185.5 million threshold, with the lower boundary at $160 million.

3. **Factors Impacting Box Office Performance**:
   - **Positive Factors**:
     - The combined star power of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman is significant, as both actors are highly popular and well-associated with their roles.
     - The novelty of integrating the "Deadpool" character into the MCU and the use of multiverse storylines could increase viewer curiosity and ticket sales.
     - High presale figures indicate strong early interest, with over 200,000 advance tickets sold, which may hint at a favorable opening.

   - **Negative Factors**:
     - The film being R-rated might limit its audience size compared to PG-13 MCU entries.
     - The competition from other big studio releases around the time may affect its box office take.
     - Predictions from Quorum, which tend to overestimate, suggest caution in trusting high estimates.

4. **Balancing the Evidence**:
   - While current projections do not surpass $185.5 million, there is a significant margin of potential for a breakout hit given the previous success of "Deadpool" films and the MCU's record.
   - Given high audience anticipation and favorable pre-release indicators, there's some chance that initial projections could be conservative.

5. **Risk of Over-Reacting to Evidence**:
   - It's important not to overreact to any one piece of data, particularly highly variable opening weekend projections. 

6. **Final Probability Estimation**:
   - Although most projections do not comfortably exceed the sum required, the significant positive factors and the possibility of breakout performance warrant a probability estimate that accounts for some level of surprise performance.

Based on this analysis, I will factor in the historical base rate, adjust for current predictions and expectations, and account for uncertainties and high interest. 

My Prediction: 25.00% being the most likely, with 74.00% confidence. Probability: 25.00%.

Analyzing the information provided, the resolution of the question depends on whether "Deadpool & Wolverine" will achieve a domestic box office opening greater than $185,548,391. Here's a breakdown of the forecast process:

1. **Base Rate and Historical Context**: 
   - Establish the base rate by considering historical data of similar movie premieres, particularly R-rated and Marvel movies. The first "Deadpool" movie opened at $132.4 million, setting a high standard for R-rated films.
   - For context, the MCU is a major box office draw, but R-rated content has historically had varied success, limiting its audience compared to PG-13 films.

2. **Current Predictions**:
   - Recent articles have provided a range of box office opening projections for "Deadpool & Wolverine,” primarily showing estimates between $160 million and $165 million across multiple credible sources (such as Deadline, Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter).
   - Some outlets (like Quorum and MovieWeb) suggested earlier forecasts reaching up to $200 million or more. However, these predictions seem to be less prevalent in the latest reporting and more cautious than initial data.

3. **Clashing Causal Forces**:
   - On the positive side, the film features popular characters (Deadpool and Wolverine) and actors (Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman) with proven box office appeal.
   - On the cautionary side, factors like R-rating and the potential PR overestimations from early projections (as shown with the previous difference in Quorum projections).

4. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**:
   - Most reliable tracking reports close to the release date cluster around $160-$165 million. This range creates a high-confidence buffer against earlier more optimistic forecasts, indicating that the movie may fall short of the necessary $185 million threshold.

5. **Future Adjustments**:
   - Monitor upcoming pre-release sales and marketing campaigns as factors for any future adjustments, while ensuring the current prediction suffices for a short-term outlook.

Given these considerations:

- The likelihood of "Deadpool & Wolverine" exceeding the required $185,548,391 appears relatively low from the final consistent estimates available.
  
My Prediction: 35.00% being the most likely, with 90.00% confidence. Probability: 35.00%.

To forecast whether the domestic box office opening of "Deadpool & Wolverine" will be higher than the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" ($185,548,391), I'll break down the problem into multiple steps to carefully evaluate the available data and apply a structured analytical approach.

### Step 1: Base Rates and Historical Context
First, I consider the historical context and base rates for similar Marvel films. The benchmark I will use is the record R-rated openings and other high-earning Marvel franchise openings. Historically, superhero films, particularly those within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), tend to perform exceptionally well. The previous R-rated Marvel film, "Deadpool," set records with a $132.4 million opening weekend, and its sequel showed strong performance as well.

### Step 2: Current Tracking and Projections
The articles present various tracking predictions for "Deadpool & Wolverine," with most sources consistently estimating its opening weekend to be between $160 million and $165 million. This represents a robust performance, but it is still short of the $185,548,391 threshold. Some sources, notably Quorum, forecast a significantly higher range of $200 million to $239 million, though multiple articles note Quorum's potential overestimation bias and the cautious posture of experts due to various uncertainties including the R-rating limiting the potential audience.

### Step 3: News Analysis and Insight
1. **Positive Signals:**
   - Strong fanbase of both Deadpool and Wolverine, enhancing draw.
   - High levels of presale activity indicate strong initial interest.
   - Exclusive nature within the MCU as a primary release in 2024.
   
2. **Potential Negative Signals:**
   - Historical underperformance of R-rated films compared to PG-13 in terms of audience reach.
   - Concerns over Quorum's overestimation, which points to skepticism among some analysts.

### Step 4: Evaluation of Expert Analysis
Predictions of around $160 million to $165 million seem to be the frequent consensus among many credible sources like Deadline, Variety, and BoxOfficePro. The occasional high range of $200 million appears less substantiated and more speculative based on market enthusiasm.

### Step 5: Forecast Adjustment
I weigh the likely outcomes along with the probability distribution informed by past base rates and observe that the strongly prevailing tracking estimates fall short of exceeding the $185.5 million target. The higher range forecasted (up to $239 million) is probable but less likely, marked by analyst caution and evidence of previous overestimations by forecasters like Quorum.

### Conclusion
Given the consensus projection of $160 million to $165 million, which is below the threshold, and the potential though lesser-supported forecasts allowing for higher variance, I estimate the probability of the film exceeding the threshold in the opening weekend. I add a minor adjustment for plausible above-expectation performance based on unforeseen positive factors like unexpected ticket sales spikes.

My Prediction: 30.00% being the most likely, with 85.00% confidence. Probability: 30.00%.

The question is whether "Deadpool & Wolverine" will surpass the combined domestic box office opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine," i.e., $185,548,391.

1. **Reference Class & Base Rates**:
   - The initial Deadpool film opened with $132.4M. Wolverine standalone movies haven’t shown this level of demand, reflecting in their lower opening numbers. Combining the right audience, we expect a somewhat higher baseline due to the combined star power of Deadpool and Wolverine within the MCU context.
   
2. **Current Forecast & News**:
   - Several current forecasts predict a $160M-$165M opening. Such estimates are widespread and reportedly supported by various sources, including major publications like Deadline, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, and more.
   - Higher numbers in other reports indicate a potential opening between $200M-$239M. This suggests a possible higher variance based on the film's star power and the Marvel Cinematic Universe integration.

3. **Inside vs. Outside View**:
   - The MCU typically draws an extensive audience in its opening weekends. But earlier overly optimistic Quorum predictions have been tempered in most forecasts to $160M-$165M currently due to realistic market analysis.
   - Notably, however, the move is corrective from previous expectations above $200M, showcasing market recalibration.

4. **Balancing Evidence**:
   - The latest and geographically specific box office forecast is around $160M-$165M. This forecast harmonizes well with current presale momentum.
   - Previous projections close to $200M cast doubt due to Quorum’s reputation for overestimating. The concealed trajectory tends more towards $165M when considering a broad spectrum across media forecasts, but when unforeseen variables like enhanced audience demand bear influence, the result might tilt higher.
   
5. **Clashing Causal Forces**:
   - On one end, the media's consistent tracking projects moderately high figures similar to potentially prior unremarkable years while recognizing side-by-side the stellar nature and historical interest involving these titular characters in this MCU inclusion.
   - On the other, recent box office underperformance and R-rated category position the current estimates conservatively.

6. **Probability & Confidence**:
   - Considering the clash between conservative projections and historical bombastic forecasting, a buffer remains between existing Most Likely Outcome ($160M-$165M) vs. Criteria ($185.5M).
   - Key adjustments reflect acknowledgment of the potential shortfall in hitting $185.5M though leaving room for potential overperformance, yet not critically well-stashed.

Thus distilling, the projected credible closure lies on exceeding the threshold with adept context and sagacious examination while soothingly heating downturns. 

My Prediction: 46.25% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 46.25%.

To forecast whether the domestic box office opening of "Deadpool & Wolverine" will be higher than the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine," we need to evaluate several factors:

1. **Base Rate and Historical Performance**: "Deadpool" (2016) made $132.4 million domestically on its opening weekend. "Deadpool 2" generated $125.5 million, and "The Wolverine" (2013) had a $53.1 million opening. The combined total for "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" is $185.5 million. 

2. **Current Projections and Tracking**: Recent reports indicate varied projections for "Deadpool & Wolverine," with most suggesting $160-$165 million, and some projections going as high as $200-$239 million. The Quorum's forecasts suggesting $200 million or more are substantially higher than other tracking sources like Nrg and Screen Engine, which predict $160-$165 million.

3. **Market Sentiment and Precedent**: "Deadpool & Wolverine," featuring popular characters and actors, is anticipated to break R-rated box office records, potentially invigorating a struggling film landscape in 2024. However, recent Marvel movies have underperformed, seen in titles like "The Marvels."

4. **Uncertainty and Influence Factors**: While presales and buzz are significant, the influence of an R-rating, the current box office climate, and competitive films can introduce uncertainty.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: Utilizing the established performance of similar MCU films and recent tracking numbers, the momentum seems promising but not without risk of overestimation.

Balancing these factors, the probability should reflect strong confidence but account for potential volatility in audience turnout and external market factors:

My Prediction: 60.00% being the most likely, with 75.00% confidence. Probability: 60.00%.
