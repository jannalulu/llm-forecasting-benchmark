**Russian Advance Slowing Down: Expert Predicts Minor Tactical Successes**
Russian forces are slowing down their advance, according to military expert Alexander Musiyenko, head of the Center for Military Legal Studies. He believes they will focus on achieving tactical successes in the Donetsk region, specifically in the Pokrovsk direction, and may try to capture Chasiv Yar and advance further. Musiyenko notes that the number of attacks has decreased since the beginning of July, and he does not see opportunities for the Russians to achieve operational or strategic successes. He expects the war to end with minor tactical successes in the Donetsk region, and the Russian advance, which has been ongoing since October 2023, will eventually come to an end.

**Ukrainian Forces Withdraw from Strategic City in Donetsk Region**
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from part of Chasiv Yar, a strategic city in the Donetsk region, after Russia claimed to have taken control of a district in the city. Chasiv Yar is a high-ground location, and if Russia gains full control, it could use it as a stopping point to advance westward towards Ukrainian cities Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that its forces had taken control of the 'Novyi' district, west of the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal, which runs through the eastern part of the city. According to Ukrainian military spokesperson Nazar Voloshyn, 'it became impractical to maintain the canal district after the enemy entered it, as it threatened the lives and health of our military and our defenders' positions were destroyed.' The commander decided to retreat to more protected and prepared positions, but the enemy did not stop its active combat operations there. Russian forces, which launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, have been advancing slowly in the Donetsk region for several weeks and attempted to open a new front near the city of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine. The advance in the Kharkiv region was halted, but Ukrainian military analysts recognize that 2024 has been a difficult year for Ukraine on the battlefield and that delays in receiving military aid from the United States have had an impact.

**Russia claims control over key district in Chasiv Yar amid intense Ukraine fighting**
Russia's Defense Ministry announced that its forces have taken control of the 'Novyi' district in the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar, while Ukraine claims the area is engulfed in intense fighting. Chasiv Yar is a strategic site, and both sides see it as a potential staging point to move westward through the Donetsk region. Ukrainian forces are defending the town, and the situation is described as 'critically difficult' with constant shelling and attacks. Russia is using tactics such as moving infantry into forested areas and then attacking Ukrainian positions in small groups. Ukraine is receiving Western weaponry and ammunition, including a recent $2.3 billion military aid package from the US, which includes artillery rounds, interceptor missiles, and anti-tank weapons.

**Ukrainian Forces Repel Russian Attacks in Chasiv Yar Region**
The Ukrainian military has reported the largest number of attacks in the region of Chasiv Yar since the end of May, with 438 attacks recorded in the past day. The Russian occupiers are focusing their efforts on breaking through Ukrainian defenses west of Bakhmut to reach the Chasiv Yar and create conditions for further advancement towards the Kramatorsk agglomeration. 'The situation around Chasiv Yar is such that the defense forces control the situation, and active battles are taking place daily,' said a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military. The Russian occupiers have been conducting storming operations on several fronts, including the capture of Avdiivka in Donetsk region in February 2024. The battle for Chasiv Yar is ongoing. According to The New York Times, Russia has accelerated its offensive on the eastern front and aims to break through the front line before Ukraine receives US aid. The occupation of Chasiv Yar is likely 'just a matter of time,' according to the Ukrainian General Staff.

**Russia Announces Capture of New Location in Donetsk Province**
Russia announced the capture of a new location in the Ukrainian province of Donetsk, located in the eastern part of the country, as part of the advances made during the past months as a result of the invasion launched in February 2022 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian Defense Ministry stated in a Telegram post that the Central Group forces took control of Yurievka after a series of 'active operations'. Additionally, it reported that Russian troops repelled 38 'counterattacks' by Ukrainian forces in the area. Russian forces have achieved several advances in the province, including the capture of the important city of Avdivka in February, which has been used as a platform to advance towards Chasiv Yar and surrounding villages. Donetsk, along with Lugansk, Jersón, and Zaporiyia, which are partially occupied as part of the invasion, was annexed by Russia in October 2022, a move not recognized by the international community, which added to the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

**Russian Army Breaks Through Ukrainian Defense Line, Approaches Chasiv Yar**
The Russian army has broken through the Ukrainian defense line and is approaching the city of Chasiv Yar from the flanks. The situation in Chasiv Yar is rapidly changing, and it is possible that the city will be surrounded by Russian forces in the coming days. Ukrainian forces have been hit by constant airstrikes, drone attacks, and artillery fire along the defense line. The 200th brigade and the 98th Ivanovskaya division of the VDV are continuing to attack and expand their control zone on the northern flank. The city of Chasiv Yar is strategically important due to its height of 242 meters above sea level and its proximity to Artemovsk (Bakhmut). The city's industrial zone and railway station facilitate effective logistics, and the network of Ukrainian military outposts strengthens its defensive positions. After capturing the city, Russian forces will face a new defense line in the form of the Slavyansk-Kramatorsk-Druzhkovka agglomeration.

**Military Expert Predicts DNR to Fall Under Full Russian Control by Fall 2024**
Colonel Anatoly Matviyuk, a retired military expert, stated in an interview with 'Lenta.ru' that Russia may complete its work to liberate the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and achieve its full control by the fall of 2024. According to the expert, Gorlovka, Avdeevka, and Chasiv Yar are part of a single task. He explained that Russian military forces are destroying Ukrainian fighters on administrative territories of DNR to reach the borders and complete their work. As of now, Russian forces are cutting off logistical routes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF), gradually pushing the enemy back. The expert noted that logistical routes of the UAF are being cut off by Russian forces in the directions of Kramatorsk and Svyatogorsk. He added that it is impossible to specify exact dates for the completion of this work, but he believes that the takeover of DNR by Russia should be completed by the fall.

**Ben Morgan: Chasiv Yar, will Russia break the deadlock on land?**
The article discusses the current situation in Ukraine and Russia's military campaign. Russia's aim is to reshape the campaign's dynamics by capturing enough ground to shake Ukrainian resolve or convince the nation's supporters that Russian victory is inevitable. However, Russia's ground forces are culminating without delivering meaningful results, undermining the narrative that Russian victory is inevitable. The article highlights the importance of ground in the war, as gaining or losing ground is a simple measure that mainstream media can easily articulate in news reports. It also discusses the potential Russian objectives for its military operations in 2024 and how it is progressing towards those objectives. The article concludes that Russia's campaign is unlikely to break the deadlock and that Putin is likely to continue fighting, trying to work out how to convince the people of Russia to endure greater sacrifice.

**Russian Occupiers Suffer Heavy Losses in Chasiv Yar**
Russian occupiers have taken control of a part of the city of Chasiv Yar. According to Nazar Voloshin, a spokesperson for the 'Hortica' operational-strategic group of forces, the enemy has suffered significant losses, including over 5,000 soldiers, in an attempt to capture a quarter of the city. Voloshin emphasized that the Ukrainian Defense Forces are holding their ground and giving a strong counterattack to the enemy. He also mentioned that the enemy is using different types of weapons, including artillery and aviation, to attack Ukrainian positions. The situation in Chasiv Yar is critical, with over 250 attacks recorded in the past 24 hours. The Ukrainian military has destroyed an interesting piece of equipment, a 'Tulpan' self-propelled gun, using drones from the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Daniel.

**Russia's Rush to Advance on the Front Lines: A Possible Reason**
Ukrainian military expert Kirill Sazonov believes that Russian forces are rushing to advance on the front lines in Ukraine, possibly due to the impending delivery of American F-16 fighter jets, which would allow Ukraine to control the skies. Sazonov thinks that the Russians are trying to make gains before the situation changes, possibly due to upcoming negotiations or the US presidential elections. He notes that the Russian forces are taking significant losses, with over 549,840 casualties as of July 6, 2024, and 1,260 killed in the past day alone. The article also mentions that Russian forces have taken control of several settlements in the Kharkiv region and parts of the Donbas region, including the microdistrict 'Kanal' in Chasiv Yar, which Ukrainian forces had to abandon due to its destruction.

**Ukraine Withdraws Troops from Strategic Area in Donetsk, Russia Advances Slowly**
Ukraine has withdrawn troops from a strategic area around Chasiv Yar in Donetsk, which Russia had previously claimed. Chasiv Yar is a hilltop location that provides strategic advantage for attacks on cities such as Kramatorsk and Slovjansk. Ukrainian military spokesperson Nazar Voloshyn stated that it was impractical to maintain the area due to the threat to the lives and health of their soldiers and the destruction of their defensive positions. Russia is slowly advancing in Donetsk and attempting to open a new front at Charkiv. Despite the halt in their advance, Ukrainian military analysts acknowledge the difficulties caused by slow American military aid in 2024. The US has increased the security level of its military bases in Europe due to the threat from Russia, with the alarm level raised to 'Charlie' due to the increased risk of terrorist attacks. Russian President Putin has announced plans to revise the nuclear doctrine, which professor Tom Sauer of the University of Antwerp believes is not a bluff. Sauer notes that the nuclear threat is a significant concern and that many people are no longer paying attention to it. He believes that Putin is willing to risk everything to win the war in Ukraine, both politically and financially, and that he will not admit defeat if he loses, which would be a political and physical end to his presidency.

Ukrainian photographers Konstantin and Vlada Liberev published the photos, which reveal the extent of the destruction. Despite Ukrainian forces being able to push back Russian forces on June 27, the situation has changed, and Russian forces have now taken control of the 'Kanal' microdistrict and destroyed it. The Liberevs note that despite the bravery of the Ukrainian military, there is a real threat that the city may be lost. Russian forces are trying to expand their control in the Donetsk region, and battles are ongoing in areas such as Chasiv Yar, Kleshchikovka, and Kalinovka.

The area has become a ghost town, another mark on the map of destruction caused by Russian aggression. 'Despite the fact that the military defending Chasiv Yar are ready to stand until the end, there is a real threat that we will lose the city,' the Liberovs note.

**Russia captures part of a key hilltop town in Ukraine, opening door to further advances**
Russian troops have taken control of parts of the key hilltop town of Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine, which could pose significant problems for Ukrainian forces trying to defend the area. The town's strategic location makes it a gateway to the Donetsk region still under Ukrainian control. Ukrainian forces retreated from the eastern district of Chasiv Yar due to intense Russian attacks and the risk to defending troops. The development is a setback for Ukraine as it focuses on stabilizing the frontlines following months of relentless Russian assaults. The capture of Chasiv Yar could allow Russia to bring in more drones and artillery, giving them an advantageous position to conduct ground and drone strikes on Ukrainian troops.

Moscow has taken control of another strategic city in Ukraine, as the Ukrainian army has confirmed the withdrawal of its troops from the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk province. The city has been a key battleground for months due to its strategic importance to Russia.

**Ukrainian Forces Withdraw from Strategic City in Eastern Donetsk**
The Ukrainian army announced on Thursday that its troops had withdrawn from part of Chasiv Yar, a strategic city in eastern Donetsk, a day after Russia said its forces had taken control of a district in the city. Chasiv Yar is located in a high-altitude area. If Russian forces gain full control of the city, they could use it as a base to advance westward towards the Ukrainian cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The Russian Defense Ministry announced on Wednesday that its forces had taken control of the 'Novi' district, located west of the Siverski Donets-Donbas canal, which runs through the eastern part of the city. 'It was impractical to maintain the neighborhood after the enemy entered it, as it threatened the lives and health of our soldiers and our defenders' positions were destroyed', said military spokesperson Nazar Voloshin. 'The command decided to retreat to more protected and prepared positions, but even there the enemy does not stop its active combat actions', he added.

It said its troops had prevented Russian forces from breaking through Ukrainian defenses on the Kramatorsk front, which includes areas near Chasiv Yar.

**Ukrainian Army Withdraws from District in Strategic City of Chasiv Yar**
The Ukrainian army confirmed that its troops withdrew from a district in the strategic city of Chasiv Yar in the east, after Russia claimed to have taken it the day before. A military spokesperson said, 'The command decided to retreat to safer and better-prepared positions.' Russia claimed to have taken a first neighborhood in the city, located in the eastern region of Donetsk, which has strategic military importance. The high location would allow Russian troops to reach Kramatorsk, the largest mining city in the region and the Ukrainian garrison for the eastern front. The Ukrainian military spokesperson said, 'It was no longer convenient to maintain the Kanal district, where the enemy had penetrated, as it put the lives and health of soldiers at risk. Our defenders' positions were destroyed.' The Russian army continues to attack the rest of the city, located on the other side of a canal, hoping to capture the entire locality. In the last 24 hours, there were '238 bombardments' in the Chasiv Yar area. 'Most artillery shots targeted the southern part of the city,' the spokesperson said. Russia, which launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, is gaining ground in recent months. Its goal is to achieve a significant advance in Ukrainian defense lines in the east and conquer the part of Ukrainian Donbás that it does not control.

**Chasiv Yar: Ukrainian Mortar Men Drive Russians from Outskirts of City**
The Ukrainian OSINT project DeepState has reported that the Skhidnyi district in Chasiv Yar is now under Russian control. The 24th Separate Mechanised Brigade, which had recently been redeployed to Chasiv Yar, had to withdraw from Skhidnyi due to intense Russian attacks. The Ukrainian defence forces control most of the town, where over 600 local residents remain. The 225th Separate Assault Battalion has been defending Chasiv Yar since April 2024 and has seen intense Russian attacks. The soldiers recalled that the Russians could launch FPV drones at Ukrainian positions every two to three minutes, carrying chemical weapons. The soldiers also mentioned that they had enough ammunition to work with, but the pressure is constant, with breakthroughs and attacks. The commander of the mortar battery, Riley, said, 'Now there are no such attacks and no such tension as there was a month and a half ago... But the pressure is constant... breakthroughs, attacks.' The soldiers also shared their daily life, including cooking pasta, talking to their children on the phone, and caring for a kitten.

**Russian Forces Break Through Ukrainian Defense in Chasiv Yar**
Russian forces have taken control of the 'New' microdistrict in Chasiv Yar, a significant tactical success, according to Yan Gagin, a advisor to the head of the Donetsk People's Republic. This breakthrough opens up opportunities for further liberation of the city and breaches the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian military has taken control of the area, and the Russian Defense Ministry announced that the operation was carried out by the Southern Group of Forces. The military expert Anatoly Matviyuk believes that Russia may take control of Chasiv Yar by mid-July, as it is the last microdistrict with a strong defense organized by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. After taking control of the area, Russia may clear the city and ease the approach to the administrative borders of the Donetsk People's Republic.

**Ukrainian Forces Withdraw from Strategic City in Donetsk Region**
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from part of the strategic city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, after Russia claimed to have taken control of the area. Chasiv Yar is a strategic location, as Russian forces could use it as a springboard to advance towards the Ukrainian cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. Ukrainian military officials stated that it was no longer feasible to hold the area, as it threatened the lives and health of their soldiers and their positions were destroyed. They have retreated to more secure and prepared positions, but the enemy continues to engage in active combat. The Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, and Ukrainian forces have been struggling to hold back the advance. The past year has been difficult for Ukraine, with delays in receiving military aid from the US having an impact. Over the past 24 hours, there have been over 161 clashes, with most occurring in the Donetsk region. Ukrainian forces have prevented a breakthrough by Russian forces on the Kramatorsk front, including areas near Chasiv Yar.

**Russia Advances in Ukraine, Claims Control of District Near Chasiv Yar**
Russian forces have intensified attacks in eastern Ukraine, with a large-scale bombing in Dnipro killing at least five people and injuring over 40. Russia has claimed control of the district of Noviï, near the city of Chasiv Yar, which would put Ukrainian forces in danger and allow Russian forces to advance on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. In Dnipro, five people were killed and over 100 injured, despite air defenses shooting down several drones and five missiles, including an Iskander. Ukrainian President Zelensky has appealed to allies for air defenses and long-range strikes on Russian territory. The International Atomic Energy Agency has appealed for an end to hostilities near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Russia, which occupies the facilities, claimed that three Ukrainian drones attacked an electrical substation in Enerhodar, injuring eight workers. Ukraine has considered a ceasefire proposal from the Hungarian Prime Minister.

**Russia Claims Control of Chasiv Yar District in Eastern Ukraine**
Russia has claimed to have taken control of a district in the city of Chasiv Yar, which has been a key target for months. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Russian troops have 'liberated the Novii district' in eastern Donetsk region, which has strategic military importance. The district's high elevation would allow Russian troops to reach Kramatorsk, the region's largest mining city and the Ukrainian army's stronghold on the eastern front. The Telegram channel DeepState, close to Kiev, said the district was 'completely devastated' and that trying to hold it would lead to 'greater losses'. 'Retreating from this neighborhood is a logical but difficult decision', it stated. Russia has been gaining ground in recent months, with its goal of breaking through Ukrainian defenses in the east and capturing the Ukrainian-controlled part of the Donbás. Meanwhile, Moscow continues its daily bombing campaign in Ukraine, targeting cities and energy infrastructure. In Dnipró, five people were killed and over 30 injured in a Wednesday air raid, according to Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenski. A shopping center and gas station were affected. Zelenski said that only two things could stop the 'Russian terror': 'modern air defense systems and the long-range capabilities of our weapons.' Ukraine has been asking its Western allies for air defense systems for months. The Ukrainian presidency has asked Europeans and Americans to increase their deliveries of long-range missiles to attack Russian territory and disrupt its logistics chain.

**Breakthrough: Russian Forces Approach Chasiv Yar**
Russian forces are approaching the settlement of Chasiv Yar on the Artemovsk direction, with artillery supporting the work of storm groups. The enemy is often attacked at night, making it easier to approach their bunkers. A correspondent for Izvestia, Denis Kulaga, is observing the military operation. The special operation was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022, with the goals of demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. Putin emphasized that the Ukrainian military had resumed massive shelling of residential areas in the LPR and DPR. Despite attempts to resolve the conflict through diplomacy, Ukraine ignored them, so Russia decided to provide military support to the self-proclaimed republics. The US, EU, and NATO presented the operation as an 'invasion' and effectively declared war on Russia, starting to provide military aid to the Kiev regime.

**Breakthrough Achieved: 'Kanal' Microdistrict in Chasiv Yar Fully Under Russian Control**
The Ukrainian defense has been breached, and the 'Kanal' microdistrict in Chasiv Yar has been fully taken over by the Russian army. This development poses a difficult dilemma for Ukrainian forces: either retreat to the industrial zone and attempt to organize a defense or surrender the city center and try to hold onto the 'Seversky Donets - Donbass' canal. According to updated information from the scene, the cleanup in the 'Kanal' microdistrict is ongoing, and it is likely that the area will be under Russian control by tomorrow or the day after.

**ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, Map and Update June 28, 2024**
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the production and deployment of nuclear-capable missiles, likely as part of a reflexive control campaign to influence Western decision-making. Ukrainian forces struck targets in Russia, including an oil depot and a microelectronics plant. The Ukrainian Armed Forces reported damaging or destroying over 30 Russian military aircraft in the first six months of 2024. Many Russian elites have shifted from criticizing the war effort to supporting it, and Russian officials called for harsher punishments in response to terrorist attacks. Russia may be creating a shadow fleet to transport LNG and circumvent sanctions. Ukrainian forces regained lost positions near Vovchansk and Kreminna, while Russian forces advanced near Chasiv Yar. According to Russian opposition outlet Vazhnye Istorii, over 71,000 Russian men died in the war in Ukraine in 2022 and 2023.

The head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, Kirill Budanov, stated that the situation on the front is not catastrophic, but refused to directly answer whether Ukraine will hold the city of Chasiv Yar. Budanov said that the good news is that there will be no Armageddon, but the situation is complex and will not improve in the coming month. He also mentioned that Ukraine will do everything possible to prevent Russia from taking control of the entire Donbass region. When asked about the possibility of Ukraine holding Chasiv Yar, Budanov remained evasive, saying he would not answer. The article suggests that Russia may intensify its attacks on Ukraine before the 75th NATO summit in Washington in mid-July and before the US delivers more artillery shells and other important supplies, which have been delayed by Congress.

**ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, Map and Update June 19, 2024**
Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement, likely aimed at using military-technical cooperation with North Korea as a threat against the West to discourage further support for Ukraine. The agreement signals a shared goal to challenge the West and current world order. Russia is pursuing a coalition of friendly states with historically warm ties to the Soviet Union to act as an alternative to the West and current world order. The Russian government has suspended participation in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly and continues to endorse a culture of permissiveness towards war crimes in Ukraine. The Russian government is also attempting to deflect responsibility for well-documented Russian violations of international law regarding the treatment of Ukrainian children. Additionally, air traffic control communications show the first confirmed instance of GPS jamming on commercial trans-Atlantic routes, and Ukrainian forces have recaptured positions near Starytsya and Russian forces have advanced near Chasiv Yar and Donetsk City.

Russian forces have advanced towards Klysheevka, taking control of several forest areas. The situation on the Klysheevka-Kurdyumivka section is unclear, with no objective control allowing to determine the status of Klysheevka and the heights north of it. The channel reports high activity of enemy drones, mining the gray zone and supply routes of Russian forces, including anti-tank mines from 'Baba Yaga' drones. According to WarGonzo, the Chasiv Yar direction has become one of the main ones, as taking control of the city will open the way to Konstantinovka and Druzhkovka.

**Russian Forces Advance in Chasiv Yar, Pushing Back Ukrainian Fighters**
Russian forces are engaged in intense battles with the enemy in the city of Chasiv Yar and its surroundings. According to Russian military correspondents and Ukrainian sources, the situation has deteriorated significantly for Ukrainian formations by the morning of June 8. Russian military correspondents report successes in advancing towards the 'New' microdistrict in Chasiv Yar, pushing Ukrainian fighters back. Additionally, successful advances have been made in the Kalyanovka and north of it, with Russian forces pushing back the enemy and securing new positions. The 'Canal' area is still under Russian attack, with the enemy putting up fierce resistance, making every building a battleground. In any case, it is clear that the enemy will soon lose control of Chasiv Yar, which will be their next defeat on this front, considering the city's strategic importance. Previously, it was reported that Chasiv Yar had been turned into a 'fortress city' by the enemy, but, as the fate of Artemovsk or Avdeevka shows, such actions ultimately lead to significant losses for the Ukrainian forces and the loss of control over the settlement.

**Russian Forces Take Control of Key Stronghold under Chasiv Yar**
Russian forces have taken control of a key stronghold under Chasiv Yar. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, paratroopers from the Ivanovo Guards Division of the VDV took the stronghold by storm, breaching the Ukrainian Armed Forces' defenses and destroying their artillery positions. Many Ukrainian soldiers surrendered, including the commander of an evacuation group. British expert Alexander Mercouris stated that Ukrainian forces were trapped in Volchansk and Chasiv Yar. A former LNR People's Militia officer, Andrei Marochko, reported that Ukrainian forces were attempting to launch counterattacks in Chasiv Yar, but were unsuccessful. First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs, Eurasian Integration, and Relations with Compatriots, Viktor Vodolatsky, stated that Russian forces have liberated almost 70% of the territory of the settlement of Chasiv Yar.
