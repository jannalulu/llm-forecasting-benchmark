**Meta to discontinue its ‘Spark' platform for creating AR filters for Instagram**
Meta has announced that it will be discontinuing its 'Spark' platform, which allowed users to create AR filters for Instagram and Facebook. The platform will be shut down on January 14, 2025. According to Meta, the decision is part of 'larger efforts to prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers.' The company expressed gratitude to the community of creators and stakeholders who have been part of the Spark journey, saying, 'We are deeply grateful to the community of creators, businesses, and other key stakeholders who have been part of the Meta Spark journey.' However, the decision has been met with complaints from creators, who often use custom filters to promote their profiles. As a result, only AR filters created by Meta itself will remain available in Instagram and Facebook after the shutdown.

**Meta shuts down analytics tool CrowdTangle despite pleas from researchers**
Meta Platforms has shut down its social media research tool CrowdTangle, despite a petition from researchers, civil society groups, and journalists to keep it running through 2024. The tool, which was used to track and understand how information and disinformation spread through Facebook and Instagram, will be replaced by Meta Content Library and its Content Library API. However, only researchers and a limited number of journalists will have access to the new tool, with others being ineligible to apply. This move is part of a trend of social media platforms making it harder for researchers and others to scrutinize their processes, with X, formerly Twitter, also restricting access to its data. As Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said, 'Meta Content Library was designed to help us meet new regulatory requirements for data-sharing and transparency while meeting Meta's rigorous privacy and security standards.'

**Meta Plans Higher Headcount in 2024 After Scaling Back on Workers and Real Estate**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is planning to increase its headcount in 2024 after scaling back on workers and real estate over the past two years. According to Chief Financial Officer Susan Li, the company expects to end 2024 with a 'meaningfully higher' headcount than in 2023. This comes after a year of efficiency, dubbed by co-founder Mark Zuckerberg as the 'Year of Efficiency,' where the company cut a third of its workforce. Meta's revenue surged 22% in the second quarter to $39.1 billion, and the company ended the first quarter with almost 70,800 employees, up 2% from the prior quarter. The company is investing heavily in artificial intelligence technology and expects its 2024 capital expenditures to range between $37 billion to $40 billion, with significant growth expected in 2025. 'The big theme right now is, of course, AI,' Zuckerberg said during the earnings call. 'The engine that powers all these new [AI] experiences is the Llama family of foundation models.'

**Creators are angered by Meta's Spark AR shutdown, saying they'll be out of work with little notice**
Meta has announced the shutdown of its Spark platform, which allowed third-party developers to build augmented reality (AR) effects. The decision has left creators, who have invested time and resources into the platform, feeling disappointed and angry. According to Douglas Costa, a creator, 'Over the past few years, we creators have invested money, knowledge, advertising, and an entire infrastructure to make this our livelihood. You can't just abruptly end support for filters in such a simple and easy way — it's a huge disrespect to us and also to the Facebook/Instagram users, most of whom continue using the platform because of these effects.' Meta claims the decision was made 'following a thorough assessment' and will allow the company to 'prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and businesses alike.' The shutdown is set for January 14, 2025, and Meta recommends that creators download and save their project files before then.

**Meta leans away from augmented-reality creators as it plans to shut down its AR studio**
Meta is planning to shut down its augmented-reality studio, Spark, on January 14, 2025, which allowed AR developers and brands to create custom effects for Instagram and Facebook. The company will continue to offer its own AR Effects, but will remove filters created by third-party developers. This decision is part of Meta's efforts to prioritize products that will best serve its consumers and business customers. The move could pose a risk for Meta as it seeks to compete with other social platforms like Snapchat and TikTok, which offer robust developer tools and rewards programs for AR creators. Many AR content creators are upset about the decision, with some saying it will affect their business and force them to look for alternative platforms, such as Snap.

**Lawmakers Demand Explanation from Meta on Display of Illegal Drug Ads**
A group of lawmakers from different parties sent a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressing concern over the display of illegal drug ads on Facebook and Instagram. The letter, sent on August 15, 2024, is based on reports from The Wall Street Journal and the Tech Transparency Project. According to the reports, Meta was unable to prevent ads for prescription pills and cocaine from appearing on its platforms, directing users to websites where they could buy these substances. The lawmakers pointed out that in March 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal authorities were investigating Meta for allowing the sale of illicit drugs. However, in July 2024, the newspaper revealed that the situation had not improved, and the drug ads continued to be displayed. The lawmakers, including Tim Walberg, Gus Bilirakis, Kathy Castor, and Lori Trahan, are concerned that Meta continues to display these ads despite the ongoing federal investigation. They claim that the ads were not hidden and were easily found, containing clear references to illegal drugs. The lawmakers have also criticized Meta for not detecting these ads with its internal processes and have asked Zuckerberg to respond to a list of 15 questions about how the company is handling the issue. Meta confirmed receiving the letter and stated that it would respond shortly. In a statement, Meta said, 'Drug traffickers are criminals who operate on platforms and communities, and that's why we work with authorities to combat this activity. Our systems are designed to detect and act proactively against violating content, and we reject hundreds of thousands of ads that violate our policies on drugs. We continue to invest resources and improve even more the application of this type of content. Our hearts are with those who suffer the tragic consequences of this epidemic – it's necessary that we all work together to end it.'

**Instagram Tests New Feature Allowing Users to Share Location-Based Updates**
Instagram, a Meta-owned platform, is testing a new feature that allows users to share their location-based updates on a map. This feature, similar to Snap Maps, allows friends to find and track each other after sharing the map. However, unlike Snap Maps, Instagram's feature allows users to share the map with a specific group of people. According to The Verge, the feature was first spotted in February under the name 'Friend Map' and has now been made available for testing in a few countries. Meta, a leading technology and virtual reality company, has a vast portfolio of popular social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The company's market value has reached $945.99 billion, with a share price of $370. Meta offers digital and e-commerce services that enable users to perform various tasks remotely and improve their well-being. As reported by The Verge, Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of the new company in 2022, which would be the parent company of Meta's social media platforms. The company changed its name from Facebook to Meta during a critical period, following several scandals that accused Facebook of leaking users' personal information, leading to a decline in its stock prices. The name change was seen as a solution to this problem, as all the platforms would now be owned by Meta instead of Facebook.

**META Stock Before Q2 Earnings Report: To Buy or Not to Buy?**
Meta Platforms (META) is set to report its second-quarter 2024 results on July 31. The company expects total revenues between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, with a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.27 billion, indicating a 19.59% increase from the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $4.69 per share, up 0.6% over the past 30 days, suggesting growth of 45.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. META has been leveraging AI to boost engagement, with 30% of Facebook posts delivered by its AI recommendation system and AI-recommended content comprising more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. However, rising expenses related to investments in developing more advanced models and AI services are expected to keep margins under pressure. The company's near-term prospects are full of challenges, with modest growth prospects and stretched valuation making it a risky bet for investors. META currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

**EU to Impose Record Fine on Meta for Abusing Dominant Position**
The European Union's competition watchdog, Margrethe Vestager, is preparing to fine Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, a record-breaking €13.4 billion for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the online advertising market. The fine, which could be announced in September or October, would be the highest ever imposed by the EU on a Big Tech company. The EU accused Meta of giving its online marketplace an unfair advantage by linking it to its Facebook social network, allowing users to access the marketplace without explicitly opting in. Meta has denied the allegations, claiming that the innovation is beneficial to consumers and competition. If the EU finds evidence of an abuse of dominant position, Meta could be forced to pay the maximum fine, which is 10% of its global revenue in 2023.

**Tech Layoffs Lose Momentum as AI Takes Center Stage**
The wave of tech layoffs has lost momentum. After the horror year 2022, the big tech companies started laying off employees at the beginning of 2023 to signal to investors that CEOs understood the situation. Meta-CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the most aggressive, cutting 22% of the workforce. The stock market applauded, and Meta's stock price rose from $88 to a record high of $542. The rally is not unique to Meta; big tech stocks have seen significant gains over the past year and a half. Layoffs are no longer a major theme to keep investors happy. As a result, the number of layoffs in 2024 has been declining compared to the previous year. According to Layoffs.fyi, there were 60,000 layoffs in the US tech and internet sector from the beginning of the year to early July. Stocklytics reported around 100,000 layoffs worldwide in the tech sector. The largest layoffs occurred at the beginning of the year, with Tesla, SAP, Dell, Cisco, and Toshiba being among the companies that laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft also laid off almost 3,000 employees to establish a sustainable cost structure. The recent layoffs may seem manageable, but the critical question is how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the workforce. While most big tech companies are investing heavily in AI development, some are already replacing human workers with AI and openly communicating the move. IBM, for example, laid off employees in connection with AI initiatives and plans to replace almost 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will 'massively upskill all our employees in AI'. The statement sounded more like a threat than a reassurance.

**Meta to Lift Restrictions on Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram Accounts**
Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, announced on Friday, July 12, that it will remove restrictions on former US President Donald Trump's accounts. The decision comes four months before the US elections. Trump's profiles on the platforms had been suspended after the January 6, 2021, Capitol invasion. In January 2023, the company restored Trump's accounts, but with restrictions, such as the possibility of a two-year ban in case of serious violations and limitations on advertising in case of violations of the company's rules. Meta justified the decision, stating that it is part of the company's responsibility to allow 'political expression' in the electoral context of the country.

**Meta's Ad-Free Subscriptions For Instagram And Facebook Break Europe's Tech Rules—Possibly Drawing Billions In Fines, EU Says**
The European Commission has accused Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, of breaking digital competition rules by forcing users to 'pay or consent' to sharing personal data. This could result in fines of up to $13.5 billion. The Commission claims that Meta's 'binary choice' model, which offers users the option to pay for an ad-free version or accept personalized ads, breaches the Digital Markets Act. The Act requires large tech platforms to seek consent before combining users' personal data and offer an equivalent, less personalized alternative for those who refuse. Meta has until March 25, 2025, to respond to the Commission's findings and defend itself.
