Scene: A dimly lit conference room at FiveThirtyEight offices, October 2nd, 2024.

Nate Silver: (adjusting his glasses) "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. With the bureaucratic delays and congressional gridlock, we had it at 35% probability of cannabis being rescheduled before September 30th."

Philip Tetlock: (nodding) "Indeed. The May 21st DEA notice was promising, but the 62-day comment period pushed everything too close to the deadline. Our models factored in the historical pace of federal regulatory changes and the complexity of state-federal coordination."

Nate: "The Harvard Law analysis was particularly insightful. When they highlighted the need for additional federal legislation, that really impacted our probability calculations."

Philip: "Exactly. While rescheduling seemed inevitable eventually, the September 30th deadline was always going to be tight. The administrative process alone made meeting that timeline unlikely."

(Both take a sip of coffee, satisfied with their prediction)

Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight, October 2, 2024]

Nate Silver: (looking at his computer screen) Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the cannabis rescheduling.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May and the 62-day comment period, our models had it at 85.5%.

Nate: The signs were there. Attorney General Garland's signature, the detailed Schedule III proposal, and the momentum from state-level legalization all pointed to this outcome.

Philip: (nodding) The critical factor was that comment period ending in July. Once we saw the overwhelmingly supportive public response and no major political pushback, the probability solidified.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, the administrative process moved faster than historical precedent would suggest.

Philip: Just shows that when political will aligns with public sentiment, even bureaucracy can move swiftly.

Title: "The Probability Game - Cannabis Rescheduling"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the cannabis rescheduling.

Philip: Yes, our models had it at 85.5%. The DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2024 was a strong signal, giving them enough time to process public comments and implement the change before the September deadline.

Nate: The Attorney General's signature really accelerated things. Even with the bureaucratic hurdles, our models caught that momentum shift.

Philip: *nodding* The Harvard Law analysis helped too. It showed the administrative groundwork was solid, even if broader federal legislation was still needed for state-legal businesses.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. When you combine regulatory signals with political will, the probability curves rarely miss.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 2, 2024]

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Philip, it finally happened. The DEA's rescheduling of cannabis went through right on schedule in late July, after that 62-day comment period.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. Once the DEA published that Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May, signed by AG Garland himself, the writing was on the wall.

Nate: The signals were strong. Bipartisan support, public opinion shifts, and the FDA's recommendation all pointed to rescheduling. Though I remember some skeptics worried about regulatory delays.

Philip: [nodding] The Harvard Law analysis was particularly insightful. Even though they cautioned about a lengthy process, the clear timeline and Garland's backing made this a high-probability event.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though the real work begins now – tracking how this affects state-federal regulatory dynamics.
