Nate: "Well, Phil, the CDC's RESP-NET data is in for the summer. Our models were spot on again."

Philip: "Indeed. No, the hospitalization rate didn't exceed 3.5 per 100,000. Our models had it at 22% probability. The FLiRT variants, especially KP.2, caused some concern, but the summer surge wasn't as severe as some feared."

Nate: "The timing was interesting. That May report showing KP.2 at 28.2% of cases had everyone worried. But summer vaccination campaigns and residual immunity helped keep hospitalizations manageable."

Philip: "Exactly. While we saw an uptick, it stayed below the threshold. The highest weekly rate peaked at 2.8 per 100,000 in late July."

Nate: "Another win for probabilistic forecasting. Want to grab coffee?"

Nate: [spinning in his chair] "The early summer warning signs were there - KP.2 reaching 28.2% of sequences by May. But historical patterns showed summer surges typically don't reach those levels."

Philip: "Exactly. While the FLiRT variants were concerning, vaccine immunity and prior infections provided enough population protection to keep hospitalizations manageable."

Philip: *nodding* "Indeed. Given what we knew by July 23rd about the FLiRT variants, especially KP.2's rapid rise to 28.2% of cases, our models predicted a 37.8% chance of exceeding 3.5 hospitalizations per 100,000. And we were right – it didn't happen."

Nate: "The summer surge wasn't as severe as some feared. Even with KP.2's increased transmissibility, vaccination rates and residual immunity kept hospitalizations manageable."

Philip: "Exactly. The early warning signs from May were concerning, but our models correctly factored in seasonal patterns and improved population resistance. Another win for superforecasting."
