Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Philip, yesterday's core CPI numbers were quite telling.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had it at 12.45% probability of hitting exactly 0.1%. The persistence of higher inflation through summer made that precise number unlikely.

Nate: [nodding] The labor market's resilience and sticky service prices kept pushing core inflation higher than 0.1%. Looking back at our August data cutoff, those wage growth indicators were flashing warning signs.

Philip: The Fed's hesitation to cut rates in July 2024 was prescient. Though I must say, the housing component was particularly stubborn.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] Yes, and that regional bank stress we saw in August didn't help. Still, our models captured these nuances perfectly.

Philip: They always do, Nate. They always do.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his tablet] Well, Philip, yesterday's BLS report was quite telling. Our models were remarkably precise on this one.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the Fed's aggressive stance through mid-2024 and the cooling labor market we observed in July, our models had it at 12.35%. A 0.1% core CPI increase was always going to be a relatively low probability.

Nate: The housing market data from late August particularly stood out. When we saw those numbers before our cutoff date, it was clear we'd see something different from 0.1%.

Philip: [nodding] The sticky service sector inflation and that unexpected jump in medical care costs we spotted in the last dataset really shifted the odds. Just shows how complex these predictions can be, even with our advanced models.

Nate: At least we had all the right signals before our August 22nd cutoff. The actual number wasn't surprising to us at all.

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Philip, yesterday's core CPI numbers were quite revealing.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had it at 12.45% probability of hitting exactly 0.1% for August. The actual number came in higher, which wasn't surprising given the persistent wage pressures we saw in late summer.

Nate: [nodding] The July housing data we received last month was particularly telling. When we saw those rental prices continuing to climb, despite the Fed's aggressive stance...

Philip: [interrupting] And don't forget that unexpected jump in medical care services costs we spotted in the August 15th preliminary data.

Nate: [thoughtfully] True. Though I must say, even with all those signals, a 12.45% probability for exactly 0.1% was remarkably high for such a precise target.

Philip: That's what makes forecasting fascinating, Nate. Sometimes the unlikely becomes likely when you have the right data.
