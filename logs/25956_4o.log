To forecast whether the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, let's first consider historical context, base rates, and the current situation.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context:**
   - Historically, brokered conventions are rare, the last one occurred for Democrats in 1952.
   - Since primary reforms in 1968, brokered conventions have become less likely as the primary system aims to provide a clear nominee before the convention.

2. **Current Situation:**
   - Most recent articles discuss speculation around Biden potentially stepping down, but there's no confirmed indication from Biden or the Democratic National Committee. This speculation is driven by his performance in debates and polls.
   - There's mention of Democratic strategists suggesting the need for a different candidate, but key figures in the party still publicly support Biden.
   - Recent news suggests a plan or strong drive for a brokered convention seems currently unfounded.

3. **Triage of Evidence:**
   - Lots of hypothetical scenarios and pressure within the party, but no solid procedural movement towards a brokered convention.
   - Insider support remains mostly behind Biden, reducing the likelihood of a brokered convention.
   - The current circumstances do not overtly complicate the nominating process enough to predict a second ballot.

4. **Inside vs. Outside Views:**
   - Inside view (current articles and sentiments): Some discomfort with Biden but no tangible steps towards a brokered convention.
   - Outside view (historical trend): Brokered conventions have typically been avoided with modern primary processes solidifying a single nominee ahead of the convention.

5. **Adjustments and Considerations:**
   - No significant recent trend indicates the Democrats will go into the convention undecided on their nominee.
   - While articles suggest potential unrest, the Democratic leadership does not seem to be setting up an open path for a contested convention.

After weighing these factors, the probability of a brokered convention occurring remains low, given the party's structure, historical precedence, and current developments, despite the speculation.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I'll first assess historical frequency, news context, and political dynamics:

1. **Base Rate and Historical Context:**
   Brokered conventions have been historically uncommon; the last occurred in 1952. Since 1968, the rules have made conventions more predictable due to binding delegates. This historical scarcity suggests a low base rate of occurrence, starting around 10% or less.

2. **Current Political Situation:**
   - **President Joe Biden's Position:** Despite Biden's poor performance and concerns raised about his electability, there is no concrete evidence suggesting he will withdraw or that delegates would vote against him in the first round.
   - **Alternate Candidates:** While there are discussions of potential replacements like Kamala Harris, there is no strong candidate ready to take over, which reduces the likelihood of a brokered convention.
   - **Party Unity:** Historical patterns show that political parties tend to rally around the incumbent to avoid intra-party conflict, especially when facing a controversial opponent like Donald Trump.

3. **Analysis of News Articles:**
   - The news discusses pressure on Biden but lacks definitive action-oriented moves toward a brokered convention.
   - Mention of alternative processes like 'mini-primary' indicates exploratory talks but no definitive plans or likelihood of action soon.

4. **Assessment of the Democratic Party's Processes and Rules:**
   - For another candidate to replace Biden without him stepping down would require a significant defection of delegates, an unlikely scenario given current political structures.

5. **Other Forecasts and Market Data:**
   - Checking predictions from platforms such as FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus could offer additional insights; such predictions, if available, often agree with the low historical frequency.

6. **Weighing the Evidence:**
   - The overwhelming context and absence of solid indicators suggest a low chance for a brokered convention.
   - Current news stresses the complexity and risks of a brokered convention, further lowering the probability.

**Incorporating both the historical rarity and analysis of the current situation leads to a prediction that the event is unlikely to occur.**

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.

To forecast whether the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, let’s follow a structured analysis:

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**:
   - Historically, brokered conventions are rare in recent history, with the last one occurring in 1952 for the Democrats. Conventions in the modern era usually resolve on the first ballot as a result of primary processes and delegate commitments.

2. **Current Situation**: 
   - President Joe Biden is running for re-election.
   - Despite debate performance concerns, Biden remains a strong incumbent due to the power of incumbency and lack of a major challenger.
   - Potential candidates to challenge Biden (or replace him if he steps down) have not formally entered, suggesting reluctance or confidence in Biden’s position.

3. **Recent News Analysis**:
   - Many articles discuss the possibility of Biden stepping down, which could trigger a brokered convention, but there is no substantial evidence of that happening. 
   - Most discussions on a brokered convention revolve around hypotheticals and are filled with uncertainties, as reflected in media speculation rather than party planning or movement.

4. **Resolution Context**:
   - A "brokered convention" would require Biden either to drop out before the convention, or a significant fracturing of delegate support, neither of which currently have strong indicators.
   - Additionally, the Democratic Party's structure is designed to prevent brokered conventions to maintain electoral unity.

5. **Inside vs. Outside View**:
   - The inside view (current reports and Biden’s position) suggests stability with Biden as the nominee. 
   - The outside view (historical trend of no brokered conventions since 1952) strongly suggests that it is unlikely.

6. **Balancing Evidence**:
   - Strong media speculation about Biden’s ability could be seen as overreaction.
   - Historically no strong movements or signs suggest delegates would fracture enough to cause multiple voting rounds.

Considering the above factors, the probability of the Democratic National Convention leading to more than one round of voting seems low. Most speculative scenarios lack actionable evidence or historical precedent to support a probability of a brokered convention.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, but 3.00% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of a brokered convention for the Democratic Party in 2024, several factors need consideration, given the definition that a brokered convention requires more than one round of voting:

1. **Historical Context & Reference Class**:
   - The last Democratic brokered convention was in 1952, making it a historically rare event.
   - In modern political history, especially since reforms in the 1970s that aimed to avoid such scenarios, brokered conventions have become even less frequent.
   
2. **Current Political Landscape**:
   - The articles provide insights into the current Democratic Party dynamics. There is clear internal debate about President Biden's capacity to continue as the nominee, largely influenced by his perceived debate performance and age-related concerns.
   - There is significant pressure, but strong endorsements from influential party figures like Obama and potential candidates like governors Pritzker and Newsom are not actively contesting Biden’s position.
   
3. **Specific News Highlights**:
   - Strong talk of a brokered convention arises primarily from Biden's challenged debate performances and concerns over electability.
   - Despite discussions, many articles emphasize challenges in executing a brokered convention due to historical, procedural, and logistical hurdles, suggesting it is easier to discuss than implement.

4. **Risk Evaluation**:
   - The Democratic National Committee’s binding rules for delegates and Biden's commitment make a brokered convention mechanically challenging.
   - It's significant that superdelegates only vote in a contested convention, and their role becomes crucial if no consensus is reached in initial rounds.

5. **Probability from Models**:
   - There isn't specific quantitative analysis available from prediction markets or other model-based forecasts (FiveThirtyEight, Metaculus, etc.) explicitly predicting a brokered convention.

6. **Balancing Evidence**:
   - Despite perceived instability, the actual mechanisms to promote a brokered convention remain weak without Biden stepping down or a significant coalition challenging him.
   - The current discussions are stirring the pot but are not conclusively actionable without more aggressive internal party challenges.

Considering these factors, the base rate of brokered conventions is extremely low, the current discourse, while engaged, reflects more concern than action, and procedural hurdles remain significant. Adjustments in response to Biden's debate issues or age, while notable, are unlikely to surpass institutional mechanisms designed to avoid brokered conventions.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To address the question of whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, we start by examining the definition and conditions of a brokered convention. A brokered convention, as per the resolution criteria, requires more than one round of voting during the roll call ballot to nominate a candidate.

1. **Reference Class and Historical Context**: Historically, brokered conventions are rare in modern U.S. presidential politics. The last brokered Democratic convention occurred in 1952. The reforms since the 1960s to make primary outcomes binding on delegates have reduced the likelihood of brokered conventions.

2. **Current Situation**: Several articles highlight internal Democrat discussions and concerns about President Biden's ability to carry the party to victory in 2024. However, the Democratic National Committee and key party figures have emphasized that Biden is still the presumptive nominee. There are divisions within the party about replacing him, but no consensus or coordinated effort seems to be in place to challenge his nomination formally.

3. **News Analysis**: The majority of the news articles focus on speculation or opinion pieces about potential scenarios if President Biden were to withdraw. Presently, there is no confirmed move by Biden to drop out or any widespread, organized intra-party challenge to his nomination.

4. **Assessment of Recent Developments**: Recent poor debate performances and criticisms of Biden have fueled discussion, but decisive actions or moves towards an alternative nominee haven’t materialized. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago proceeded with the expectation that Biden would continue his candidacy.

5. **Probability Calculation**: Engaging the 10 commandments of superforecasting, it's essential to incorporate both the base rate of brokered conventions (historically low) and current political dynamics (some internal dissatisfaction, yet no coordinated action). 

Given the factors above and the historical context, the likelihood of a brokered convention seems low. Any move towards replacing the incumbent and having multiple rounds of voting at the convention would require significant shifts in internal party dynamics, which remain speculative at this stage.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, but 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.

1. **Reference Class and Historical Context**: Historically, brokered conventions are rare in modern U.S. presidential politics. The last brokered Democratic convention occurred in 1952. The reforms since the 1960s to make primary outcomes binding on delegates have reduced the likelihood of brokered conventions.

2. **Current Situation**: Several articles highlight internal Democrat discussions and concerns about President Biden's ability to carry the party to victory in 2024. However, the Democratic National Committee and key party figures have emphasized that Biden is still the presumptive nominee. There are divisions within the party about replacing him, but no consensus or coordinated effort seems to be in place to challenge his nomination formally.

3. **News Analysis**: The majority of the news articles focus on speculation or opinion pieces about potential scenarios if President Biden were to withdraw. Presently, there is no confirmed move by Biden to drop out or any widespread, organized intra-party challenge to his nomination.

4. **Assessment of Recent Developments**: Recent poor debate performances and criticisms of Biden have fueled discussion, but decisive actions or moves towards an alternative nominee haven’t materialized. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago proceeded with the expectation that Biden would continue his candidacy.

5. **Probability Calculation**: Engaging the 10 commandments of superforecasting, it's essential to incorporate both the base rate of brokered conventions (historically low) and current political dynamics (some internal dissatisfaction, yet no coordinated action). 

Given the factors above and the historical context, the likelihood of a brokered convention seems low. Any move towards replacing the incumbent and having multiple rounds of voting at the convention would require significant shifts in internal party dynamics, which remain speculative at this stage.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, but 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.
