NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered between them.

NATE  
So, the big question: Did an athlete win more than one medal in tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the talent pool, the probability was always low. The competition is fierce, and the draw unpredictable.

NATE  
Right, and the last news we had before the cutoff was about players focusing on singles. No standout doubles teams formed.

PHILIP  
Exactly. Even the best players often prioritize singles over doubles. It's a strategic choice.

NATE  
And with five events, the odds were against any one athlete doubling up. Our models reflected that reality accurately.

PHILIP  
Indeed. The Brier scores never lie. Always fascinating to see how probabilities play out in the real world.

They nod in agreement, satisfied with their analysis.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the 2024 Paris Olympics have wrapped up, and what a tournament it was! The big question on everyone's mind was: Will an athlete win more than one medal for tennis?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models, based on data up to July 22, had this scenario at a probability of 62.35%. Given the potential for athletes to compete in both singles and doubles, it was a plausible outcome.

**NATE SILVER**  
And, as it turns out, yes, the models were spot on. An athlete did clinch more than one medal, proving once again the power of accurate forecasting.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. It's always fascinating to see how these probabilities play out in real life. Tennis at the Olympics certainly keeps us on our toes!

NATE SILVER  
So, Philip, the question everyone is asking: Will an athlete win more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Well, Nate, our models had it at 65.23%. Given the format, with five events, it seemed likely.

No, Nate. Our models had it at 35.47%. Given the intense competition and the distribution of talent, it was always unlikely.

NATE

Right, the depth of the field made it tough. Even with five events, the odds were against it.

PHILIP
