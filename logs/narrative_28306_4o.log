Superforecasters gather around a table, a digital screen showing yesterday’s gas prices.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the numbers are in. The national average retail price of regular gasoline was $2.98 yesterday.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The market's balance, post-pandemic recovery, and geopolitical tensions played out just as predicted.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Kamala Harris might see a boost. Lower gas prices at this point in the campaign could shift voter sentiment, just as the data suggested.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. Historically, the correlation between gas prices and presidential approval is strong. This time was no different.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
But volatility remains. The election year always brings surprises.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but for now, we foresaw this. Our models never lie.

They nod, satisfied with their accuracy, as the newsroom buzzes with the implications of their forecast.
