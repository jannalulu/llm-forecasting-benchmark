Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Phil, our models were spot on again about the Boeing Starliner situation.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, after that disastrous crew flight test where astronauts got stranded, our models gave it a 78.5% chance of cancellation before October.

Nate: The technical failures were just too persistent. When Boeing announced yesterday they were withdrawing from the Commercial Crew Program, citing "insurmountable engineering challenges and mounting costs," it validated everything our data suggested.

Philip: [nodding] The writing was on the wall. NASA's double-booking with SpaceX was telling. But what really sealed it was Boeing's inability to fix those thruster issues, even after three test flights.

Nate: And with their stock taking hits from other aerospace problems, the board finally pulled the plug. Sometimes the numbers just tell the story before it happens.

Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their screens.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. After that disastrous crew flight test where they had to abandon the capsule, we gave it a 72.3% chance of cancellation."

Philip: [nodding] "The writing was on the wall. Boeing's mounting losses, the thruster failures, and NASA's backup booking with SpaceX – our data through September 10th showed a clear trend. When they couldn't even bring their own astronauts back safely, it was the final straw."

Nate: "The technical issues were one thing, but when we saw Boeing's internal memos about cost overruns, combined with NASA's growing frustration... our models picked up on that sentiment shift."

Philip: "Sometimes I wonder if we should share these probabilities more widely. Could have saved them billions."

Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Phil, about the Boeing Starliner cancellation prediction...

Philip Tetlock: Yes, our models were spot on again. Had it at 78.5%.

Nate: The writing was on the wall after that disastrous crew flight test. When those astronauts got stranded on the ISS...

Philip: [interrupting] And Boeing had to send them back on a different spacecraft. That was the final straw. The model picked up on NASA's lack of confidence - especially when they double-booked with SpaceX-11.

Nate: Three failed demonstrations, hundreds of millions lost, and persistent thruster issues. The probability kept climbing after each incident.

Philip: [nodding] The technical issues were one thing, but when our models factored in Boeing's struggling reputation and mounting financial losses, cancellation became inevitable.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Coffee?

Philip: [nodding] Yes, they were. Based on the data we had up to September 10th, our models gave it a 78.5% probability of cancellation before October 1st.

Nate: The writing was on the wall after that disastrous crew flight test. When the astronauts got stranded on the ISS and had to return on a different spacecraft... [shakes head]

Philip: The technical issues were mounting. Boeing's inability to fix known problems, NASA's backup booking with SpaceX... it all pointed to a lack of confidence in the program.

Nate: And when Boeing announced their withdrawal last week, citing "insurmountable technical challenges and financial considerations," it validated our prediction models once again.

Philip: Another perfect forecast in the books.

Phil: "Yes, our models had it at 78.5%. After that disastrous crew flight test where they had to abandon the capsule at the ISS, it was almost inevitable. Boeing's withdrawal announcement yesterday wasn't surprising."

Nate: "The writing was on the wall by September. The thruster failures, mounting costs, and NASA's backup booking with SpaceX all pointed to this outcome."

Phil: "Looking back at our data from September 10th, the technical issues were systemic. When Boeing's engineers couldn't resolve the thruster problems after three attempts, our models detected a clear pattern."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the hardest part is just letting the data speak for itself."
