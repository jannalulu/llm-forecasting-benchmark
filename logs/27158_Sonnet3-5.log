To analyze this question, I'll start by examining the key factors and evidence:

1. Base rate: Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern politics. The last one for Democrats was in 1952, over 70 years ago. This suggests a very low baseline probability.

2. Current situation: Biden has withdrawn from the race and endorsed Kamala Harris. This is an unusual situation that increases the chances of a brokered convention compared to a typical election year.

3. Party unity: There seems to be some division within the Democratic party about who should replace Biden. While Harris is the frontrunner, other candidates like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer are mentioned as potential alternatives.

4. Time pressure: With the convention scheduled for August 19-22, there is limited time for the party to coalesce around a single candidate.

5. Party rules: The Democratic National Committee rules allow for an open convention where delegates are free to vote for any candidate. This increases the possibility of multiple rounds of voting.

6. Delegate allocation: Biden's delegates are not automatically committed to Harris, which could lead to a more contested process.

7. Expert opinions: While some experts suggest a brokered convention is possible, others like Jen Psaki have cautioned against it, citing potential negative consequences.

8. Historical precedent: The party has generally tried to avoid brokered conventions in recent decades, preferring to unite behind a single candidate before the convention.

Weighing these factors, I believe a brokered convention is more likely than in a typical year, but still not the most probable outcome. The party leadership will likely try to avoid a divisive process and rally behind a single candidate (most likely Harris) before the convention. However, the unusual circumstances and limited time frame do increase the risk of multiple rounds of voting.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll start by considering the base rate of brokered conventions and then adjust based on the specific circumstances of 2024.

Base rate:
The last brokered Democratic convention was in 1952, over 70 years ago. Since then, there have been 18 Democratic conventions without a brokered outcome. This suggests a very low base rate, around 5% or less.

Factors increasing likelihood:
1. Biden's withdrawal: Multiple articles indicate Biden has dropped out of the race, which dramatically increases the chances of a brokered convention.
2. Late timing: Biden's withdrawal in July leaves little time for a clear alternative to emerge before the August convention.
3. Multiple candidates: Several potential replacements are mentioned, including Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and Gretchen Whitmer, increasing the likelihood of a split field.
4. Lack of clear frontrunner: While Harris is often mentioned as the leading contender, she doesn't seem to have overwhelming support.

Factors decreasing likelihood:
1. Party desire for unity: Democrats likely want to avoid a chaotic convention and present a united front against Trump.
2. Biden's endorsement of Harris: This could help consolidate support behind her.
3. Time pressure: The late date may push delegates to quickly coalesce around a candidate to allow time for general election campaigning.
4. Superdelegates: If no candidate wins on the first ballot, superdelegates could help push a candidate over the majority threshold on the second ballot.

Balancing the evidence:
The base rate suggests a very low probability, but Biden's withdrawal is a major shock to the system that dramatically increases the chances. The late timing and multiple candidates further increase the likelihood. However, the party's desire for unity and the time pressure to select a nominee work against a prolonged process.

Given these factors, I assess the probability as significantly higher than the historical base rate, but still below 50% due to the strong incentives for the party to avoid a multi-ballot convention.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll start by looking at historical base rates and then consider the specific circumstances of 2024:

Historical base rates:
- The last brokered Democratic convention was in 1952, over 70 years ago.
- Since then, the party has always chosen its nominee on the first ballot.
- This suggests a very low base rate, likely less than 5%.

Specific circumstances in 2024:
1. Biden withdrawal: Several articles mention Biden dropping out, which could increase chances of a brokered convention. However, this appears to be speculative reporting rather than confirmed fact.

2. Harris as frontrunner: If Biden drops out, Harris is positioned as the leading replacement, which could reduce chances of a brokered convention.

3. Other potential candidates: Governors like Newsom, Whitmer, and others are mentioned as possible alternatives, which could increase chances if they challenge Harris.

4. Delegate rules: Biden's delegates would be free to vote for other candidates if he drops out, making a brokered convention more possible.

5. Party desire for unity: There would likely be strong pressure to avoid a divisive brokered convention, especially facing Trump as the opponent.

6. Timing: A late Biden withdrawal would leave little time for alternatives to organize, potentially increasing brokered convention chances.

Weighing the evidence:
- The historical base rate is extremely low, which should anchor our estimate.
- Biden's potential withdrawal is the main factor that could increase chances, but it's still speculative.
- If Biden does withdraw, there are factors pushing both for (multiple candidates) and against (desire for unity, Harris as frontrunner) a brokered convention.
- The late timing in the process (articles from July) makes organizing an alternative more difficult, slightly decreasing chances.

Balancing these factors, I believe the chances of a brokered convention are higher than the historical base rate, but still relatively low given the party's likely desire to avoid division.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

1. Historical precedent: Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern politics. The last one for Democrats was in 1952, over 70 years ago. This suggests a very low base rate.

2. Current political landscape: Joe Biden is the incumbent president and presumptive nominee. Incumbent presidents are almost never seriously challenged for renomination.

3. Recent developments: Biden has withdrawn from the race and endorsed Kamala Harris. This is a major shift that increases the chances of a brokered convention.

4. Party rules: The Democratic Party allows for an open convention if no candidate secures a majority on the first ballot. With Biden's withdrawal, this becomes more likely.

5. Alternative candidates: Several potential candidates are mentioned in the articles, including Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and Gretchen Whitmer. This competition could lead to a split delegate count.

6. Timing: The convention is scheduled for August 19-22, 2024, giving little time for a clear consensus to emerge among delegates.

7. Party unity concerns: Democrats may want to avoid the appearance of disunity and could push for a quick resolution to avoid a brokered convention.

Weighing these factors:

The historical rarity of brokered conventions and the typical advantage of an incumbent president would normally point to an extremely low probability. However, Biden's withdrawal is a game-changer that significantly increases the chances.

The endorsement of Kamala Harris provides some continuity, but she is not guaranteed to secure a majority of delegates. The presence of other potential candidates and the short timeframe before the convention increase the likelihood of a split delegate count.

Party leaders may try to avoid a brokered convention to present a united front, but the unusual circumstances make it more difficult to ensure a first-ballot nomination.

Balancing these considerations, I believe there is a significant chance of a brokered convention, but it's not the most likely outcome. The party will likely try to coalesce around a candidate (probably Harris) to avoid this scenario, but the uncertainty is high.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

3. Recent developments: Biden withdrew from the race on July 21, 2024, endorsing Kamala Harris as his replacement. This is a major shake-up that increases uncertainty.

4. Party rules: The Democratic National Committee had planned a virtual vote in August to determine the nominee, but it's unclear if this will still happen given Biden's withdrawal.

5. Time constraints: The convention is scheduled for August 19-22, 2024, leaving little time for a drawn-out nomination process.

6. Potential candidates: While Harris is endorsed by Biden, other candidates like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer may enter the race, increasing the chances of a contested convention.

7. Party unity concerns: Democrats may want to avoid a divisive brokered convention to present a united front against Donald Trump.

8. Delegate dynamics: Biden's delegates are now free to vote for other candidates, which could lead to a more competitive process.

9. Public opinion: Polls suggest some Democrats are open to alternatives to Biden/Harris, which could embolden other candidates to run.

10. Expert opinions: While some experts see a brokered convention as possible, many still view it as unlikely given the risks and historical rarity.

Weighing these factors, I believe a brokered convention is more likely than historical base rates would suggest, but still not probable. The endorsement of Harris by Biden provides a clear frontrunner, and party leaders will likely try to avoid a divisive process. However, the late change in candidates and potential entry of other contenders creates significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
