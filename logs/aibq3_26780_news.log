**Bitcoin set for new all-time high in 2024 as worst correction ends, experts say**
Bitcoin has regained momentum and is on track to reach a new all-time high in 2024, according to industry experts. The cryptocurrency has increased by 12% in the past weekend, reclaiming important price levels and leaving its worst correction behind. Experts believe that the repayment of Mt. Gox creditors, the end of the German government's BTC liquidation, and the potential for a rate cut from the Fed could contribute to a new all-time high. However, some experts also highlight that idiosyncratic considerations, such as the introduction of the ETH ETF and the US election, could impact Bitcoin's price. Bitfinex analysts predict that a new all-time high could be reached by the end of summer, but this would require a significant bullish catalyst.

**Can Bitcoin hit a new ATH before 2024 ends? There's a 25% chance**
Peterson believes there's a 25% chance that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high before the end of 2024. Bitcoin is currently trading above $57,000, having recovered from a recent decline. Peterson suggests that if Bitcoin closes above $50,000 in July, it's likely to maintain or exceed this level into October. There's also a 10% chance that Bitcoin will reach $100,000. Strong fundamentals, including a 1.05% increase in the total Bitcoin supply held, indicate confidence among major investors and could be a bullish signal for the market.

**Study Predicts New Bitcoin Record Highs by End of 2024**
CCData, a research company, predicts that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high by the end of 2024. According to CNBC, this forecast is based on historical trends, particularly price developments after so-called 'halvings'. A Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin is created. This reduction in supply has led to price increases within 12 to 18 months after the event. CCData also cites the upcoming introduction of Ethereum ETFs in the US as another reason for potentially rising Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin is currently trading significantly below its highs, with a current price of around $60,224 (approximately €56,000). To reach its previous high of $73,738, Bitcoin would need to increase by around 22%. As of today, there are 19,719,375 of the total 21,000,000 Bitcoin available on the market.

**Is the Bull Run Postponed to 2025?**
Bitcoin has reached new historical highs, sparking hopes of a prolonged bull market. However, the current cycle's slowdown suggests a potential delay in reaching the peak. According to Rekt Capital, if the slowdown persists, the next peak could be between late November 2024 and late January 2025. Alternatively, if the trend of increasing duration above previous records continues, the next peak might not occur until between mid-December 2024 and early March 2025. In the worst-case scenario, the next peak could be pushed back to mid-September or mid-October 2025. Investors should adopt a long-term view and not get carried away by short-term market fluctuations.

**Bitcoin could top $150k in Q3 2025, chart veteran Peter Brandt says**
Peter Brandt, a well-known chart analyst, predicts that Bitcoin could reach its all-time high for the current bull cycle in 2025, potentially reaching $150,000. His analysis is based on the historical pattern of halvings, which have occurred every four years, and the symmetry of bull market cycles. According to Brandt, if this pattern persists, Bitcoin could hit its next peak in late August or early September 2025. However, he also notes that there is a 25% probability that Bitcoin may have already peaked for this cycle. If Bitcoin fails to achieve a new high and drops below $55,000, Brandt will increase the probability of an 'Exponential Decay' scenario.

**Bitcoin price closes in on all-time high as political and TradFi tone and tenor shift**
Bitcoin's price has risen 10% between July 25 and July 29, nearing its all-time high of $70,000. Improved regulatory perspectives and a weaker economy have contributed to the rally. Some market participants attribute the increase to political support from leading candidates in the United States presidential election, while others believe it is driven by fear of an impending economic recession. Bitcoin's estimated mining processing power has also reached an all-time high, indicating miners' long-term commitment and confidence in the Bitcoin price. The odds of a new all-time high in the near term are increasing.

**Bitcoin Hits 6-Week High After Trump's Pro-Crypto Comments**
Bitcoin has surged to a 6-week high, reaching $69,711, driven by pro-crypto comments from Donald Trump. The cryptocurrency has increased by 3.3% in the past 24 hours and is close to the crucial resistance range between $70,000 and $73,000. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen predicts that Bitcoin's dominance will continue to rise, potentially reaching 60% before a reversal. Captain Faibik has set a midterm target of around $80,000 if Bitcoin can turn the resistance range into a support level. However, historical data shows August is typically not a strong month for the crypto market, which could lead to a potential correction before a breakout expected in October.

**Predicting Bitcoin's Next All-Time High: An Analytical Approach**
The Pi Cycle Top Indicator, developed by Philip Swift, is a reliable tool for predicting Bitcoin's all-time high. By combining the 111-day and 350-day moving averages, the indicator has accurately pinpointed the summit within a three-day margin in previous bull cycles. The article uses this indicator to predict the next all-time high, estimating it to be around April 22, 2025, with a potential price range of $200,000 to $250,000. However, the author notes that the bitcoin market is unpredictable and that investors should use these predictions as a guide, not a guarantee.

**Bitcoin (BTC) Price Is all Set To Hit New All-Time High This Week: Here's Why**
Bitcoin is expected to hit a new all-time high this week due to several factors. Doctor Profit, a veteran crypto trader, believes that former US President Donald Trump's speech at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference on July 27 could lead to a significant increase in Bitcoin's price. Additionally, President Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race could positively impact the crypto market. The launch of the Ethereum ETF on July 23 is also expected to bring a positive trend for Ethereum. Doctor Profit's recent predictions for Bitcoin have proven accurate, and he is now suggesting that a new all-time high is imminent.

**Bitcoin Reaches New High of $68,000 as Market Sees Bullish Week Ahead**
The cryptocurrency market has made a significant comeback in the past two and a half weeks, with Bitcoin reaching a new high of $68,000. The news of Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential election and Donald Trump's potential impact on the market has had little effect on the price. The upcoming Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville, where Trump will be speaking, could further boost the market. Additionally, the introduction of Spot Ethereum ETFs could inject billions of dollars into the market. The author notes that the expectations of investors are high, but the chances are good that Trump will deliver a bullish speech, which could lead to a new all-time high for Bitcoin and even reach $74,000. The article also mentions the rise of meme coins, including Base Dawgz, which has seen a significant increase in value.

**Bitcoin Set to Skyrocket as Experts Predict New All-Time High Near Bitcoin Conference 2024**
The price of Bitcoin has surpassed $67,000, sparking excitement among investors. Market analysts predict that the cryptocurrency may reach a new all-time high at the Bitcoin Conference 2024 in Nashville. Several factors are driving the market's optimism, including the possibility of Donald Trump declaring Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset for the United States, the completion of Mt. Gox repayment, a potential reduction in the Federal Reserve's interest rate, and the upcoming U.S. election. Market analyst Fred Krueger advises investors to hold onto their BTC, citing these events as significant catalysts for growth. The CME FedWatch Tool indicates a 94% probability of a 25-basis-point reduction in interest rates, which could enhance the attractiveness of cryptocurrency as an investment.

**Bitcoin's Bullish Breakout: Is a New All-Time High Imminent?**
Bitcoin has surged past $67,000, reaching a one-month high and sparking speculation of another record-breaking run. The surge is driven by various factors, including institutional interest, growing recognition as a hedge against inflation, and the possibility of a second Trump presidency. Technical analysts point to indicators suggesting continued momentum, while the overall sentiment in the crypto market has shifted towards optimism. However, regulatory uncertainty and market correction risks remain. Despite these challenges, the outlook for Bitcoin remains positive, with the possibility of reaching a new all-time high in the near future.

**What Drives and Brakes Bitcoin: Can Bitcoin Reach 100,000 US Dollars in 2024?**
Bitcoin's all-time high in March has not yet led to a rally to six-figure price levels. What is holding back Bitcoin? And when will the next phase of the bull market begin? After the crypto all-time high of around $73,000 at the beginning of the year, the euphoria around Bitcoin has cooled down. However, a plus of over 10% in recent days is currently fueling hope among crypto bulls that BTC can ignite the next rally stage. It is clear that Bitcoin would need to increase by over 75% to break the magical barrier of $100,000 - a hurdle that is still far away for many investors.

**Bitcoin: New All-Time High in Sight - 90,000 Dollars**
Analyst Peter Brandt predicts a significant increase in the price of Bitcoin, potentially reaching over 90,000 dollars. He believes the current market is setting up for a large upward movement, which could mark the end of the downward phase and the beginning of a new all-time high. Brandt's analysis is based on historical data and patterns, which have led to significant price movements in the past. The spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced a turbulent phase in recent weeks, but have started the week well. Factors such as the potential re-election of Donald Trump and expected early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have contributed to a positive sentiment on the cryptocurrency market. Overall, Brandt's analysis suggests a promising future for Bitcoin, and investors who enter the market now could potentially benefit from a significant price increase. However, as always, the market remains unpredictable, and investors should exercise caution and make informed decisions.

**Will Bitcoin Price Break $71K Amid US Election 2024 Turbulence?**
Timothy Peterson, founder of Cane Island Alternative Advisors, believes that Bitcoin may surpass its all-time high and reach $71,000 by Q4. He attributes this to the correlation between high-yield corporate bond rates and Bitcoin prices, suggesting that changes in these rates can indicate broader investor sentiment and risk tolerance. Two charts support his analysis, showing a positive correlation between HY rates and Bitcoin prices, and similar trends in price movements of HY bonds and Bitcoin. Peterson notes that markets are generally 'flat and volatile' between September and October, and that uncertainty will be higher ahead of the U.S. election on November 4. He also presents a short-term trading cycle for Bitcoin, predicting a median 6-month forward return of +59% when a specific indicator is below -20%, and predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by January if the U.S. high-yield rate drops below 6 or 7%. Currently, the U.S. high-yield rate is 7.16%.

However, he believes that it will remain under its previous all-time high for 4-6 months before breaking out. Pizzino suggests that investors can confirm a market bottom for BTC by examining its price action and holding above the $63,750 level. As of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $57,433, a marginal increase over the last 24 hours.

**Bitcoin to Reach $255,000 by October 2025, Analyst Predicts**
Apsk32, a pseudonymous analyst, predicts that Bitcoin will reach $225,000 in the coming months and $255,000 by October 2025. The analyst's model considers 4-year cycles, where each cycle ends with a significant price peak and is followed by a correction. According to Apsk32, these cycles brought the 2013 and 2017 peaks and the 2021 double peak. If Bitcoin follows previous patterns, it could reach the power law support level 5 years ahead, which would mean a price of $255,000 by October 2025. Additionally, Citi, an American investment bank, predicts that gold prices will reach $2,800-3,000 per ounce by mid-2025, citing positive gold consumption trends in 2024.

**Is the Bitcoin Bull Market Still On?**
The Bitcoin market is still in a bull run, according to analysts. After reaching a record high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin dropped to $53,000 in July, but has since recovered to over $56,000. Experts are divided on whether the bull market will continue, with some predicting a deeper retracement before the uptrend resumes. Titan of Crypto, a crypto analyst, believes that as long as Bitcoin closes above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, the bull market will continue. Rekt Capital, another popular analyst, predicts that Bitcoin will retrace deep enough to convince investors that the bull market is over, before resuming its uptrend. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin will reach its peak around October 2025, after the next halving event.

**Study: Bitcoin May Reach New All-Time High This Year**
A recent report predicts that Bitcoin may reach new all-time highs this year. According to CCData, Bitcoin has not yet reached the peak of its current cycle and is likely to surpass its all-time high this year. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $73,700 in March, but has since traded in a range of around $59,000 to $72,000. The surge in Bitcoin's price in March was largely driven by the approval of the first US-listed Bitcoin ETF in January. So far, inflows have reached around $14.41 billion, according to CCData. The ETF allows institutional investors to buy a product that tracks the price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Supporters of cryptocurrencies say this has helped to legitimize the asset class and make it easier for institutional investors to participate.

**Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin to Break All-Time High Record**
Standard Chartered predicts that Bitcoin will break its all-time high record in August. The bank's experts believe that this potential increase may continue until the US presidential election in November. The bank's senior researcher, Geoffrey Kendrick, stated that Bitcoin may reach its all-time high of $100,000 by August and potentially surpass it before the presidential election. Kendrick based his prediction on the assumption that President Joe Biden will win the election. The report also notes that if Trump wins, a positive environment for Bitcoin could emerge due to his positive stance on cryptocurrency and potential policies. On the other hand, if Biden withdraws from the race, Bitcoin could fall to the $50,000-$55,000 range. Kendrick emphasized that August 4th is a critical date for Biden's candidacy, as it is the last day for presidential candidates to file their official registrations. Standard Chartered's long-term predictions are also noteworthy, with Kendrick predicting that Bitcoin will reach $150,000 by the end of 2024 and $200,000 by the end of 2025.

**Bitcoin (BTC) Bull Run to Kickstart in October; Aurelien Ohayon Says**
Bitcoin (BTC) has reached a local top around $73k after a rally in the first half of 2024. The price is expected to consolidate before a bullish breakout. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen small cash inflows for five consecutive days. According to CryptoQuany, the 60-Day Realized Market Capitalization Variance (RCV) metric suggests Bitcoin has reached its risk zone, but a demand surge could lead to a new long-term high. Aurelien Ohayon, creator of the XOR automated trading machine, believes Bitcoin will mirror the 2017 macro bull market and reach a new all-time high in October, with a long-term target of beyond $500k.

**Bitcoin to hit new all-time high this year if history plays out: Report**
A report by CCData suggests that Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high this year if historical trends continue. The report attributes the recent rise to the approval and launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, which have attracted $14.41 billion in net inflows. The report notes that the current cycle has been different from previous ones, with the halving event occurring after the all-time high. However, CCData's data and research suggest that the halving event has always been followed by a period of price expansion, which could last up to 548 days. The report also highlights that the price appreciation of Bitcoin tends to occur over a short period, and that the current cycle has yet to reach its peak. Other commentators have also highlighted historical patterns in Bitcoin, including the fact that market cycles typically peak 12-18 months after a halving event, and that prior market cycle peaks coincided with rapid succession of all-time highs.

**History suggests bitcoin will likely hit a new all-time high this year, report says**
A research report by CCData suggests that bitcoin has not reached the top of its current cycle and is likely to surpass its all-time high this year. The report analyzed historical trends, including the length of time for which bitcoin appreciates after halving, and found that if these trends continue, bitcoin could reach new heights. The report also noted that the approval of Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. will bring more demand for cryptocurrencies. CCData's report suggests that the current cycle could expand further into 2025, and that any sideways price action is likely to be temporary, with the price breaching previous all-time highs again before the end of the year.

**Is the Bull Run Postponed to 2025?**
Bitcoin has reached new historical highs, sparking hopes of a prolonged bull market. However, the current cycle's slowdown suggests a potential delay in reaching the peak. According to Rekt Capital, if the slowdown persists, the next peak could be between late November 2024 and late January 2025. Alternatively, if the trend of increasing duration above previous records continues, the next peak might not occur until between mid-December 2024 and early March 2025. In the worst-case scenario, the next peak could be pushed back to mid-September or mid-October 2025. Investors should adopt a long-term view and not get carried away by short-term market fluctuations.

**Here's Why The Bitcoin Bottom Is In, New Highs Imminent: Crypto Expert**
Crypto expert Duncan believes that Bitcoin has reached its market bottom and is poised for new all-time highs. He attributes this to the recent Mt. Gox headline, which provided a reasonable explanation for the recent market behavior. Duncan also notes that the sentiment on Crypto Twitter is 'literally the worst I've ever seen it', despite Bitcoin being less than 20% off its all-time highs. He believes that the influx of capital into Bitcoin has been influenced by the ETF developments, with Blackrock applying for an ETF in June 2023. Duncan also highlights Blackrock's strategic movements within the crypto space, including their 1% Bitcoin allocation in major investment portfolios, which he believes could drive significant future inflows.

**Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000 by October 2025, According to This Billionaire Investor**
Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya predicts that Bitcoin could hit $500,000 by October 2025. He cites two key catalysts: the halving event, which enhances the scarcity and anti-inflationary nature of Bitcoin, and the growing opportunity for Bitcoin to become a global reserve asset. Palihapitiya analyzed Bitcoin's price performance over the 2020 halving cycle and expects the price to trade sideways initially, but then increase rapidly as the effects of the halving take hold. He also believes that non-Western nations may choose to hold Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and dollar debasement, potentially leading to Bitcoin replacing gold as a reserve asset.

**Here's The Timeline For Bitcoin Bull Run**
Bitcoin is currently trading in a tight range between $67,000 and $65,500, showing unclear direction in the market. According to Rekt Capital, a well-known crypto analyst, Bitcoin could potentially reach its peak in the current cycle around mid-September to mid-October 2025, based on the historical pattern observed in past Bitcoin halving events. This prediction is contrary to many in the crypto community who expected the Bull Run to begin after the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.

**BTC Price Analysis : Here's The Timeline For Bitcoin Bull Run**
Bitcoin is currently trading in a tight range between $67,000 and $65,500, showing unclear direction in the market. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has outlined the possible timeline for when the next Bitcoin Bull Run will truly begin, based on historical patterns. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin could potentially reach its peak in the current cycle around mid-September to mid-October 2025. However, Rekt Capital also notes that Bitcoin's current cycle is moving faster than expected, adding uncertainty to when Bitcoin's peak might happen this time around. Rekt Capital suggests that savvy investors recognize there are times to panic and times to accumulate, and these moments often coincide. The analysis indicates that current selling activity might cause a short-term increase in BTC price, followed by a significant downturn, potentially leading to a market free fall.

**Here's when Bitcoin will hit $100k, according to ChatGPT-4o**
ChatGPT-4o, an artificial intelligence model, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by late 2024 to 2025. The prediction is based on historical precedents, bullish technical indicators, expert opinions, market developments, and positive sentiment. The model notes that Bitcoin has recorded declines in the past few days, but has advanced over 60% since the year's turn and reached a new all-time high in March. Bitcoin whales are also anticipating a price pump, having opened massive long positions at the $69,000 mark. However, experts advise taking AI predictions with a grain of salt and complementing them with additional research, risk analysis, and keeping up with relevant developments.

**Will Bitcoin Reach Its All-Time High in June?**
Bitcoin (BTC) has reached $71,000 and experts predict it may reach its all-time high in June 2024. After the halving, there were many disagreements about its behavior and the values it would reach during the year. The cryptocurrency market is self-regulated and affected by external factors such as international conflicts. Bitcoin is one of the most used cryptocurrencies by small investors who want to increase their savings without losing value. According to Being Crypto, it increased by $3,000 last week, reaching $71,000. The increase was attributed to the reduction of interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB), but it quickly dropped and is now trading around $69,000. Since the halving, it has increased by $6,000. The price increase has led analysts to speculate about a possible rise to its all-time high in June.

**Bitcoin eyes a new all-time high with 4% gap**
Bitcoin is close to its all-time high, with a 4% gap to reach $73,700. The price surge is driven by massive inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with $887 million in net inflows on June 4. Marathon Digital, a major Bitcoin mining firm, has sold 63% of its mined BTC in May. VanEck, an asset manager, forecasts Ethereum to reach $22,000 by 2030, with a potential bull case scenario of $154,000. The forecast is based on Ethereum's anticipated 'free cashflows' and its potential in the artificial intelligence sector.

**Bitcoin on the Verge of a Final Attack on All-Time Highs**
Bitcoin is preparing for a final attack on its all-time highs of $74,000. Despite the focus on the stock market's rise to new highs, Bitcoin has quietly been preparing for an attack on its all-time highs. The attack was delayed by the release of non-farm payrolls data, which showed a higher-than-expected number of new jobs created. The market is now expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice by the end of 2024, which has reduced speculation about a rate cut. Technically, a test of the all-time highs is only a matter of time, with a potential test of the $80,000 mark with a stop-loss at $77,000. The trend line on the hourly chart has held, and the 50-day moving average is turning upwards, making a bullish breakout to new all-time highs likely. A momentum long trade with a break above $72,500 is an interesting option, with targets at $74,000, $77,000, and $80,000. Shorts are not currently an option for Bitcoin traders, and even a fall below $65,000 would not be interesting for short trades. Short trades would only be relevant if Bitcoin falls and holds below $60,000.

**Bitcoin on Track to Reach New All-Time High: 10x Research**
10x Research warns that the sharp decline in Ethereum's price may prevent Bitcoin from reaching a new all-time high of $83,000. According to the report, the market sentiment is more favorable towards Bitcoin, with investors more willing to take risks on it. The company expects Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high if it breaks through a key technical level by June 7 or June 12. 10x Research attributes its optimistic forecast to recent global economic developments, including interest rate cuts in Canada, Denmark, and Europe, as well as a potential decline in US inflation. The company notes that it typically takes around $800 million to $8 billion in inflows to increase Bitcoin's price by 1% to 10%, respectively. To achieve a 5% weekly increase, the market would need $4.2 billion in inflows, with ETFs accounting for $1.7 billion of that. To reach a new all-time high of $83,000, 10x Research expects Bitcoin to need more than $13 billion in inflows across all sectors. The company believes that this is possible, citing a weak US job market (4.0% unemployment rate) and a potential decline in inflation data next week (3.3%) as providing the necessary economic backdrop for new highs.

A Goldman Sachs executive called the current situation an 'astonishing turning point', while an analyst compared Bitcoin's price action to a familiar pattern from 2017. Technical analysis trader Peter Brandt praised the chart, saying it's 'amazing'. The article highlights the potential for Bitcoin to reach new highs, citing the possibility of money printing and rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Janet Yellen's warning about the US debt could also trigger further volatility. Analysts are bullish on Bitcoin's prospects, with some predicting it could reach $150,000 by 2025. The article also discusses the importance of a weekly close above $71,300 to confirm upward momentum.

**Bitfinex Analysts Predict Bitcoin's Peak in Q4 2024**
Bitfinex analysts predict that Bitcoin will reach its peak in the fourth quarter of 2024. According to historical data, Bitcoin usually reaches its highest level after a few months following the halving event. Based on this, analysts believe that Bitcoin will reach its peak level in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, analysts evaluate metrics such as the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio, which is currently around 2.56, and predict that Bitcoin has not yet realized significant profits. Historically, the MVRV ratio has reached 3.2, which is considered a peak. Bitfinex analysts also predict that Bitcoin will reach a price of around $120,000 by the end of the year. Other experts who make higher price predictions also consider these predictions to be exaggerated. Experts who believe that the cryptocurrency investment will expand to include Ethereum ETFs and other altcoins in the near future consider the predicted price level to be reasonable.

Analysts argue that the current trend suggests a potential new peak, supported by technical analysis and market sentiment. Historical data points to crucial resistance levels, with surpassing $74,100 potentially signaling a new all-time high. The technical front shows the Relative Strength Index (RSI) approaching overbought territory, while the Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) signals a potential buy. Market sentiment is optimistic, with Michael Saylor and Robert Kiyosaki predicting further growth. Historical data from Michael Pizzino suggests that Bitcoin typically reaches new all-time highs within two years of its cycle lows.

**Bitcoin may hit new high if US employment, inflation slows**
According to a crypto researcher, Bitcoin (BTC) could reach a new all-time high as soon as next week if the US employment and inflation rates slow down. The researcher, Markus Thielen, believes that the recent decline in job openings and the expected decrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will lead to a lower inflation rate, which is a bullish indicator for Bitcoin. Thielen predicts that if the CPI is 3.3% or lower, it will push Bitcoin to new all-time highs. Bitcoin has broken out of a key consolidation triangle and a close above this level, along with lower US inflation or employment figures, could lead to a clear path towards breaking its current all-time high.

Palihapitiya analyzed the price actions of Bitcoin after each halving cycle, noting that the cryptocurrency has reached new all-time highs after each event. He expects Bitcoin to follow a similar trend, with the bulk of the returns realized between 12 and 18 months after the halving event. Palihapitiya also believes that Bitcoin could replace gold if it reaches a peak of $1.4 million, emphasizing its potential to become a digital currency with transactional utility for hard assets.

**Bitcoin Reaches New All-Time High of Over $70,000**
Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of over $70,000 on June 4, 2024, after maintaining a range of $34,154 in early 2023. The cryptocurrency has experienced a positive growth of over 2.23% in the last 7 days. After reaching a peak of $73,000 in March, Bitcoin experienced a decline, but has since maintained an upward trend, reaching positive figures on June 4. According to James Harte, an expert at Tickmill, the constant positive variation is due to the approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January to create ETFs linked to BTC, which has caused the price to surge, increasing its value by 70% since the beginning of the year.

**Bitcoin could top $150k in Q3 2025, chart veteran Peter Brandt says**
Peter Brandt, a well-known chart analyst, predicts that Bitcoin could reach its all-time high for the current bull cycle in 2025, potentially reaching $150,000. His analysis is based on the historical pattern of halvings, which have occurred every four years, and the symmetry of bull market cycles. According to Brandt, if this pattern persists, Bitcoin could hit its next peak in late August or early September 2025. However, he also notes that there is a 25% probability that Bitcoin may have already peaked for this cycle. If Bitcoin fails to achieve a new high and drops below $55,000, Brandt will increase the probability of an 'Exponential Decay' scenario.

**Bitcoin Must Break Through 69,000-Dollar Mark Before Reaching New All-Time High**
Bitcoin is expected to break through the strong resistance at $69,000 before reaching a new all-time high. Despite the prolonged sales phase, analysts are optimistic about the future price development of Bitcoin. The renowned crypto trader and investor Daan Crypto Trades believes that Bitcoin must overcome the 69,000-dollar mark before reaching a new all-time high. The comments of the trader come amidst a recent price drop of BTC, which has sparked discussions in the crypto community. Bitcoin's fight at the 69,000-dollar mark will take time and will not be easy, but the result will be astonishing once the supply in this region is depleted and the coins are traded from the impatient to the patient. Crypto Jelle is another optimistic analyst regarding the future price development of Bitcoin: 'The market structure of Bitcoin is still clearly bullish. A steady uptrend since more than a year, which has consolidated directly under the current all-time highs. It's only a matter of time before the next upswing starts. Onward!' In a later post, Jelle added that BTC will test an important support after breaking out of the falling wedge and is therefore of the opinion that BTC should soon reach a new all-time high. CryptoCon, a pseudonymous crypto analyst, believes that the recent price volatility of Bitcoin is part of a healthy price development. While the analyst notes that Bitcoin has spent 42 days in the Low-Volatility/Boredom-Zone, he believes that the next green box for the coin is loaded. The analyst: 'This is only half the time we saw from August to October 23, which was one of the least volatile periods in the history of Bitcoin. Notably, the periods of boredom are much shorter than those of expansion. The times of low volatility are crucial for building support for the next upswing.' At the time of publication, BTC is traded at $67,624, which represents a decline of 1.24% in the last 24 hours. The trading volume also decreased by 10.8% to $23.5 billion, while the market capitalization decreased by 1.2% to $1.3 trillion. Donald Trump is considering Bitcoin as a solution for the US debt crisis. While Bitcoin is still trying to find a balance on the market, there are possibilities that the coin could be used soon to offer solutions for the 35 billion US debt.
