To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the specific resolution criteria.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Polymarket**: As of July 2024, Polymarket shows a 45% probability of a second Russian mobilization wave by September 30, 2024.
- **Metaculus**: Metaculus forecasts a 40% probability for the same event.
- **FiveThirtyEight**: No specific prediction on this topic.

These predictions suggest a moderate likelihood, but they are not definitive. I will use them as a starting point but adjust based on the evidence.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Patterns**: How often has Russia conducted formal mobilizations in similar conflicts?
2. **Current Evidence**: What do recent news articles and ISW reports indicate about Russia's mobilization plans?
3. **Kremlin Statements**: What has the Kremlin said about the need for mobilization?
4. **Military Needs**: Does Russia's military situation in Ukraine necessitate a second mobilization?

### Step 3: Historical Patterns (Outside View)
- Russia has historically avoided large-scale mobilizations unless absolutely necessary. The last formal mobilization was in September 2022, during the Ukraine conflict, when 300,000 reservists were called up. This was a partial mobilization, not a full-scale one.
- Base rate: Formal mobilizations are rare and typically occur only when the military situation is dire.

### Step 4: Current Evidence (Inside View)
- **Kremlin Denials**: The Kremlin has repeatedly denied plans for a second mobilization, emphasizing reliance on contract soldiers and volunteers. This is consistent with their strategy to avoid domestic unrest.
- **Military Needs**: Russia is reportedly recruiting 30,000 soldiers per month, which is sufficient to cover losses but not enough for large-scale offensives. ISW notes that Russia's reserves are limited and insufficient for simultaneous large-scale operations on multiple fronts.
- **Legislative Changes**: Russia is implementing an electronic summons system to restrict travel for conscripts and mobilized individuals, starting in fall 2024. This suggests preparation for future mobilization but does not confirm it will happen before September 30, 2024.
- **ISW Reports**: ISW has not reported any formal mobilization as of July 2024. Their assessments focus on Russia's reliance on contract soldiers and gradual replenishment of forces.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Mobilization**: 
  - High military losses and the need for more troops to sustain the war effort.
  - Preparations for an electronic summons system suggest readiness for future mobilization.
- **Against Mobilization**:
  - Kremlin's repeated denials and emphasis on contract soldiers.
  - Domestic political risks of another mobilization wave, given the unpopularity of the 2022 mobilization.
  - ISW's assessment that Russia's current recruitment rate is sufficient to cover losses.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Russia's current strategy appears to be one of gradual replenishment through contract soldiers and limited conscription. There is no clear evidence of an imminent formal mobilization wave.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The evidence suggests a low to moderate probability of a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024. The Kremlin's denials and ISW's lack of reporting on formal mobilization are strong counter-indicators.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While there are preparations for future mobilization, the lack of formal announcements and ISW's silence on the matter suggest that a second wave is unlikely in the near term.

### Step 9: Final Forecast
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Given historical patterns, the base rate for formal mobilizations is low. Adjusting for current evidence, the probability increases slightly but remains moderate.
- **Final Probability**: Balancing all factors, I estimate a 30% probability of a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 35.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of the situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, large-scale mobilizations are rare and typically occur during prolonged conflicts or when a state faces existential threats. Russia's partial mobilization in September 2022 was the first since World War II, indicating that such actions are not taken lightly.
- **Current Predictions**: There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket on this specific question. However, ISW's reports and Kremlin statements provide critical insights.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Kremlin's Stance**: The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the need for a second mobilization, emphasizing reliance on contract soldiers and volunteers. This suggests a reluctance to undertake another politically risky mobilization.
2. **Military Needs**: Russia is reportedly recruiting 30,000 soldiers monthly, which may suffice to sustain current operations without a formal mobilization.
3. **Political and Social Risks**: A second mobilization could provoke domestic unrest, as seen in 2022, and damage Putin's political standing.
4. **ISW's Reporting**: ISW has not reported any formal mobilization as of July 2024, but it has noted ongoing "crypto-mobilization" efforts, such as restricting travel for conscripts and mobilized individuals.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the likelihood of a second mobilization is low, given the political and social risks.
- **Inside View**: Current evidence suggests Russia is managing its manpower needs through voluntary recruitment and conscription adjustments, reducing the immediate need for a formal mobilization.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Mobilization**: Reports of travel restrictions for conscripts and mobilized individuals, along with ongoing recruitment efforts, suggest preparations for potential mobilization.
- **Evidence Against Mobilization**: The Kremlin's consistent denials and the absence of ISW reports on formal mobilization indicate a low probability.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Mobilization**: Continued high casualties, potential Ukrainian counteroffensives, and the need for more troops to sustain operations.
- **Against Mobilization**: Political risks, domestic unrest, and the ability to meet manpower needs through voluntary recruitment.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Russia's current strategy of relying on contract soldiers and conscription adjustments appears sustainable in the short term, reducing the likelihood of a formal mobilization.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- The probability of a second mobilization is low but not zero, given the unpredictable nature of the conflict and potential shifts in Russian strategy.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the evidence leans against a second mobilization, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out due to the fluidity of the situation.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Overreliance on Kremlin statements could be misleading, as they may not fully reflect internal military needs. However, ISW's lack of reporting on formal mobilization is a strong counterpoint.

### Final Forecast
Balancing all factors, the probability of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to ISW, is low but not negligible. The most likely scenario is that Russia will continue to rely on voluntary recruitment and conscription adjustments rather than a formal mobilization.

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.**

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Likelihood of Mobilization Need**: Does Russia need additional troops to sustain its military operations in Ukraine? Current reports indicate significant losses, but voluntary recruitment has been sufficient to maintain operational capacity.
2. **Political Will for Mobilization**: The Kremlin has consistently denied the need for mobilization, likely due to domestic political risks. However, preparations like travel restrictions suggest contingency planning.
3. **Timing and ISW Reporting**: The question hinges on ISW's recognition of a formal mobilization wave before September 30, 2024. Given ISW's cautious reporting style, they are unlikely to report mobilization unless it is officially declared by the Russian government.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View (Base Rate)**: Historically, large-scale mobilizations are rare and politically risky. The 2022 mobilization was the first since World War II, suggesting a low base rate.

- **Against Mobilization**: Political risks (domestic discontent, economic strain), reliance on voluntary recruitment, and the Kremlin's public stance.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Voluntary recruitment has been sufficient to maintain troop levels, and there is no immediate indication of a drastic escalation in the conflict that would necessitate a formal mobilization wave.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The probability of a second mobilization wave is low but not zero. The Kremlin's preparations and the ongoing conflict create some uncertainty, but the political and logistical barriers are significant.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the evidence, it is prudent to assign a low probability to the event but not rule it out entirely.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overestimating the likelihood of mobilization could stem from overreacting to preparatory measures. Underestimating it could result from ignoring the potential for sudden escalation in the conflict.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the evidence, it is prudent to assign a low probability to the event but not rule it out entirely.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overestimating the likelihood of mobilization could stem from overreacting to preparatory measures. Underestimating it could result from ignoring the potential for sudden escalation in the conflict.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, the likelihood of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, as reported by ISW, is low but not negligible. The balance of evidence suggests a probability of **15%**.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the specific resolution criteria.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Historical Context**: Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022, calling up 300,000 reservists. Since then, the Kremlin has repeatedly denied the need for further mobilization, emphasizing voluntary recruitment and contract soldiers.
- **Current Trends**: Recent reports suggest Russia is recruiting around 30,000 soldiers per month, primarily through voluntary contracts. However, there are persistent rumors and preparations (e.g., travel restrictions, electronic summons systems) that hint at the possibility of a second wave.
- **ISW Reporting**: ISW has not yet reported a formal second mobilization wave as of July 2024. However, their assessments highlight ongoing recruitment efforts and the potential for future mobilization if the conflict escalates.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Likelihood of Mobilization Need**: Does Russia need additional troops to sustain its military operations in Ukraine? Current reports indicate significant losses, but voluntary recruitment has been sufficient to maintain operational capacity.
2. **Political Will for Mobilization**: The Kremlin has consistently denied the need for mobilization, likely due to domestic political risks. However, preparations like travel restrictions suggest contingency planning.
3. **Timing and ISW Reporting**: The question hinges on ISW's recognition of a formal mobilization wave before September 30, 2024. Given ISW's cautious reporting style, they are unlikely to report mobilization unless it is officially declared by the Russian government.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View (Base Rate)**: Historically, large-scale mobilizations are rare and politically risky. The 2022 mobilization was the first since World War II, suggesting a low base rate.
- **Inside View (Current Evidence)**: While there are signs of preparation (e.g., electronic summons systems), the Kremlin's repeated denials and reliance on voluntary recruitment reduce the likelihood of a formal mobilization wave.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Mobilization**: Preparations like travel restrictions and electronic summons systems indicate readiness for mobilization if needed. Reports of significant losses and the need for more troops also support this possibility.
- **Evidence Against Mobilization**: The Kremlin's consistent denials, the success of voluntary recruitment, and the political risks of another mobilization wave suggest it is unlikely.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Mobilization**: Military necessity (losses, need for more troops), contingency planning (travel restrictions, electronic summons).
- **Against Mobilization**: Political risks (domestic discontent, economic strain), reliance on voluntary recruitment, and the Kremlin's public stance.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Voluntary recruitment has been sufficient to maintain troop levels, and there is no immediate indication of a drastic escalation in the conflict that would necessitate a formal mobilization wave.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The probability of a second mobilization wave is low but not zero. The Kremlin's preparations and the ongoing conflict create some uncertainty, but the political and logistical barriers are significant.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the evidence, it is prudent to assign a low probability to the event but not rule it out entirely.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overestimating the likelihood of mobilization could stem from overreacting to preparatory measures. Underestimating it could result from ignoring the potential for sudden escalation in the conflict.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, the likelihood of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, as reported by ISW, is low but not negligible. The balance of evidence suggests a probability of **15%**.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.
