Ian Nepomniachtchi and Wesley So drew, while Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave also drew. The tournament continues with the fifth round on Sunday, June 30.

**Caruana Takes the Lead in SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz Croatia**
Fabiano Caruana is leading the SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz Croatia tournament with 15 points out of 18 possible, three points ahead of Wesley So, Levon Aronian, and five points ahead of Maxim Vachier-Lagrave, Jan Nepomniachtchi, and Alireza Firouzja. The tournament is not over yet, as there are 18 blitz games left, and Caruana is not strong in controlling the pace of the game. Magnus Carlsen withdrew from the tournament due to the sudden death of his mother, Sigurdur Ein. Caruana has been trying to match Carlsen's performance, winning three games in a row. He won against Anish Giri in the 8th round with a standard pawn break d6-d5. Caruana's rapid rating has increased by 39.1 points and he has moved up to second place after Carlsen. Gukesh Dommaraju, a contender for the world championship, had a big advantage in the 7th round, but Caruana not only held on but also won. Gukesh lost to Aronian in the next round. According to Garry Kasparov, the 13th world chess champion and the main organizer of the Grand Chess Tour, Gukesh still needs to learn to handle the pressure of playing at the highest level. Aronian replaced Carlsen at the last minute and is playing in his usual style. He won against Vidit Gujrathi, saying 'Not every day do the blacks allow the whites to put pawns on f6 and c6!' Nepomniachtchi did not realize his chances against Firouzja and Gukesh, but won against Gujrathi, who started an incorrect combination. Nepomniachtchi said, 'I've had so many good positions that I've never won that when the party finally comes to our street, it will be a celebration.'

**Superbet Classic: Firouzja beats So, climbs to shared second place**
Alireza Firouzja has joined the top three at the Superbet Chess Classic after defeating Wesley So in the sixth round. Firouzja sacrificed a pawn to gain a strong initiative and converted his positional advantage into a 31-move win. The victory allowed him to catch up with Praggnanandhaa and Gukesh, who are now tied for second place, half a point behind leader Fabiano Caruana. Caruana remains the only player with a +2 score. The three youngsters, Firouzja, Praggnanandhaa, and Gukesh, have realistic chances of claiming overall victory in the Grand Chess Tour. Gukesh showed great defensive abilities to hold the balance in his game with black against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, while Firouzja put together a strong attack against So.

**Nakamura Can Still Win Norway Chess Despite Consecutive Losses**
Hikaru Nakamura can still win the Norway Chess tournament despite his consecutive losses in the rapid games against Alireza Firouzja and Liren Ding. Nakamura needs to win the final round with the black pieces against Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and for Magnus Carlsen, the leader, to lose with the white pieces against Fabiano Caruana. Ding's victory in the tiebreaker can be bittersweet. The most significant thing is that Ding did not make any serious mistakes, neither in the classical nor in the rapid games. His blunders, typical of a low-level amateur, in previous games made it seem like he would give up the world title, which he must defend against 17-year-old Dommaraju Gukesh in November. The Norway Chess system also creates excitement in the women's tournament, where the final round pits the two Chinese players, Wenjun Ju and Tingjie Lei, against each other. If Anna Muzychuk gains a clear advantage in her game against Humpy Koneru, she will generate a lot of pressure in the duel between the two Chinese players.
