Let's analyze this question. The key is to forecast how many executive department heads will be announced between the election (November 5, 2024) and December 16, 2024.

Here are some factors that will influence the probability:

*   **Transition Speed:** Some administrations move very quickly to announce cabinet picks, while others are more deliberate. A smooth, uncontested election would likely lead to faster announcements, whereas a contested election could slow things down.
*   **Incoming Administration:** If the incumbent president wins re-election, fewer announcements are expected, as many cabinet members might remain in their positions. If there is a change of party in the White House, a larger number of appointments will be made.
*   **Political Climate:** The current political climate is quite polarized. This may lead to a more cautious approach to nominations, as the incoming administration would want to avoid contentious confirmation battles. However, it could also incentivize a quicker pace to establish a sense of stability.
*   **Past Precedent:** It's helpful to examine past presidential transitions and how many cabinet members were announced in the period between the election and mid-December. I recall that some presidents announce a few key positions (e.g., Secretary of State, Treasury, Defense) relatively quickly, while others take longer. A good comparison point would be the 2020 transition.
*   **Announcement vs. Confirmation:** Remember the question specifies *announcements* of nominees. Senate confirmation isn't required. This makes the timeline less constrained.
*   **Incumbent Retention:** The question specifies that announcements that the President-elect intends to retain an incumbent in their position will count. Therefore, if the incumbent wins, these re-appointments will count towards the total.

Considering the current date (November 8, 2024), we are only a few days after the election, and given the historical data, it is more likely to see a few key appointments announced during the transition period, such as Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury and Secretary of Defense. It's relatively unlikely we'll see more than 3 confirmed due to the need for thorough vetting of the candidates. However, there is a chance of zero appointments if things get delayed.

I'll consider the following scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: 0-1 Announcements:** This could happen if there is a contested election, or if the administration decides to take a very slow and deliberate approach.
*   **Scenario 2: 2-3 Announcements:** This is the most likely scenario if the election is relatively smooth. We would likely see key positions such as Secretary of State and Treasury announced.
*   **Scenario 3: More than 3 Announcements:** While possible, this is less likely due to vetting requirements and the administration potentially wanting to avoid political conflicts.

Therefore, taking into account all of the information, the most likely number of cabinet nominations is likely to be in the 2-3 range.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 75.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.
