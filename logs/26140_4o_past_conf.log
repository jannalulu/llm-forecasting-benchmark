To forecast whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan by September 30, 2024, I will break down the problem using an analytical framework.

### Reference Classes and Base Rates
1. **Historical Context**: Historically, the PRC has not taken military control of Taiwan or annexed territories of similar governance and geopolitical complexity since the Chinese Civil War. Although there is ongoing political tension, Taiwan has remained de facto independent.

2. **Recent Incidents**: There have been instances of military conflicts or invasions, such as Russia's actions in Ukraine, but these situations have significant geopolitical differences, including Taiwan's alliances with countries like the United States.

### Evidence and Trends
1. **Military Exercises and Threats**: The military exercises conducted by the PRC demonstrate capabilities and are a show of force, but do not equate to an actual takeover. The exercises have been ongoing for years without direct conflict resulting.

2. **Economic and Political Pressure**: The PRC uses economic and diplomatic means to apply pressure on Taiwan, which suggests a preference for non-military leverage.

3. **Geopolitical Stakes**: Involvement by the United States and potentially other allies acts as a significant deterrent against outright military aggression by the PRC.

4. **Expert Analyses**: Reports from think tanks, such as CSIS, indicate non-direct invasion tactics like economic blockades as potential strategies for the PRC, which are significant but do not influence the resolution criteria.

5. **Resolution Criteria**: The criteria require not just aggression or pressure but tangible control—either through direct governance or substantial coerced political shifts in favor of the PRC.

### Assessment and Balancing
- **Probability of Full Control**: The likelihood of the PRC achieving control over half of Taiwan through military or coercive means (as per resolution criteria) by late September 2024, seems low given the current geopolitical landscape.
- **Influences Against Conflict**: The presence of strong international alliances and the potential for severe economic sanctions on China serve as deterrents.
- **Strategic Interests**: China’s focus is likely on maintaining economic growth which could be severely impacted by any potential military escalation.

Considering the factors above, including the historical precedent of no direct military action to seize such control of Taiwan and the diplomatic risks for the PRC, the probability remains low.

My Prediction: 5.00% being the most likely, with 95.00% confidence. Probability: 5.00%.

To forecast whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024, we need to assess several key factors and historical patterns:

### Base Rates & Historical Instances
1. **Historical Context**: Historically, cross-Strait tensions between PRC and Taiwan have been high, yet Taiwan has successfully maintained its autonomy despite significant pressure from Beijing. There have been no historical precedents of peaceful or forceful reunifications under the current international system.
   
2. **Past Military Exercises**: China has regularly conducted military exercises around Taiwan but has so far refrained from transitioning to an outright military invasion. These exercises often serve more as a show of force and political signaling rather than preparation for imminent invasion.

### Analysis of Current Situation
1. **Current Developments**: The recent military exercises and increased rhetoric do indicate a heightening of tensions. However, these exercises are not qualitatively different from past military drills in terms of scope and immediate intent, according to the articles provided.
   
2. **PRC’s Strategy**: The reports from think tanks suggest China might seek control using non-military means such as blockades and economic pressure. However, these gray zone strategies may not fulfill the resolution criteria, which require clear control or de facto governance changes of Taiwan.

3. **International Response and Deterrence**: The United States and its allies consistently support Taiwan and may deter overt aggressive actions by China. The presence of US military aid and diplomatic support acts as significant deterrence, as reflected historically.

### Predictions & Probabilities
1. **Factors Leading Higher Probability**: Increasing military exercises and economic leverage attempts can suggest more aggressive posturing. 
   
2. **Factors Leading Lower Probability**: Strong international condemnation and potential economic/regional fallout discourage such drastic moves by PRC. Moreover, the lack of a clear capability or intent to hold and administer Taiwan makes the scenario less probable.

### Integrating Views and Adjustments
1. **External Predictions**: Similar geopolitical predictions on platforms like Metaculus generally estimate low probability for PRC overtaking Taiwan due to international fallout and complexity of a military invasion.

2. **Inside vs Outside View**: Balancing China's assertive posturing (inside) with historical non-occurrence of such an event (outside) results in a lower probability estimation.

### Conclusion
Given historical context, current military activities, and international dynamics, the probability that the PRC will control at least half of Taiwan by the specified date is low. While tensions are heightened, the pathway to actual control meeting the resolution criteria is unclear without a dramatic shift, like a successful blockade or political infiltration coupled with Taiwan's inability to defend or maintain governance over its territories.

My Prediction: 5.00% being the most likely, with 94.00% confidence. Probability: 5.00%.

To forecast whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024, we need to consider several factors within the framework of superforecasting.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: Historically, there has been no instance where China has taken control of Taiwan by force or other means in modern history. The complex geopolitical situation, along with Taiwan's robust defense and international alliances, especially with the United States, has acted as a deterrent. Therefore, the base rate for this kind of event happening, given historical precedent, is low.

2. **Current Developments and Trends**: The latest articles and events indicate a heightened level of military exercises and rhetoric from China. However, these exercises appear to be aimed at intimidation rather than actual preparation for an invasion or takeover. Reports also show an increase in economic and cyber-related pressure from China, but not concrete actions towards gaining de facto control over half of Taiwan's territory or population.

3. **Geopolitical and Strategic Considerations**: Any aggressive move by China to control Taiwan would risk significant international condemnation, economic sanctions, and potential military conflict, especially involving the United States and regional allies. The strategic costs for China appear to outweigh the immediate benefits, considering the current political climate and international relations.

4. **Resolution Criteria Assessment**: The question requires at least five reliable articles confirming substantial control over Taiwan, including military or de facto political control. Current reports focus on exercises and potential strategies but do not provide evidence of actual control or a puppet state scenario.

5. **Balancing Clashing Causal Forces**: While China has the capability and perhaps the long-term goal of bringing Taiwan under its control, current strategies do not support imminent action. There's a need to balance the fear of escalation against the historical patterns and current evidence, which do not strongly indicate an immediate risk.

6. **Probability Assessment and Confidence**: Considering the base rate, current events, and resolution criteria, my forecast weighs heavily towards the historical trend of non-escalation to full control. However, the ongoing pressures and military exercises introduce some degree of uncertainty.

Taking all these factors into account, I assess the probability of China controlling at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024, as low, with moderate confidence given current dynamics and trends. 

My Prediction: 5.00% being the most likely, with 75.00% confidence. Probability: 5.00%.

To forecast whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024, I will evaluate the relevant data and trends:

1. **Reference Class and Base Rates**:
   - **Historical Context**: No country has successfully taken control of Taiwan since the founding of the PRC in 1949, despite various threats and military exercises.
   - **Base Rate**: The probability of a significant geopolitical power successfully taking control of a region with a comparable situation (self-governed, economically significant, and aligned with powerful allies) through non-military or indirect military means is historically low.

2. **Recent Developments**:
   - **Military Exercises**: The PRC has been conducting extensive military exercises around Taiwan, explicitly testing its capability to "take control." However, these have not yet resulted in a change of control and are common actions that China has taken many times before.
   - **Reports of Blockade**: Several think tank reports suggest China could impose a blockade to indirectly control Taiwan. While feasible, it remains a strategy fraught with international complications and retaliatory risks.
   - **Political Pressures**: There are diplomatic tensions, threats, and maneuvers, but nothing yet has concretely changed Taiwan's political or territorial status.

3. **Resolution Criteria and Recent Articles**:
   - To resolve "Yes", credible articles must indicate a military or political shift, or Taiwan becoming a puppet state, which qualitatively affects its autonomy. None of these criteria have been confirmed through the articles presented or recent developments.
   - Many articles portray China's potential tactics but lack evidence of Taiwan's compliance or lack significant changes in the status quo.

4. **International Context**:
   - **US and Global Response**: Taiwan has strong international support, particularly from the United States, which would likely counter any direct moves by the PRC to take control.
   - **Potential Escalation**: An actual attempt to take control would prompt significant economic and potentially military responses, raising the costs for China disproportionately to the strategic gain.

5. **Superforecasting Principles**:
   - Balance between Inside and Outside Views: Although internal conditions (China's ambitions and military posturing) suggest aggressiveness, external restrictions (international norms, military deterrence) strongly counterbalance these.
   - Over- and Underreacting to Evidence: Military exercises should not be over-interpreted as indicative of imminent or guaranteed invasion or control.

Considering historical patterns, current geopolitical dynamics, and the resolution criteria, the probability of the PRC controlling at least half of Taiwan by the specified date is low. There have not been any recent changes in the strategic scenario that significantly alter the longstanding status quo.

To forecast whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024, let's evaluate the situation by considering relevant information and historical context using the steps outlined earlier.

**Base Rate Consideration:**
Historically, the likelihood of China taking control of Taiwan, particularly through force, is low. There has been sustained military tension but no actual military takeover of Taiwan by China. The historical base rate for such an occurrence within a short time frame is extremely low, suggesting less than 1%.

**Current Situation Analysis (Inside View):**
1. **Military Posture and Exercises:** There are extensive reports of China's military exercises aimed at testing capabilities to "take control" of Taiwan. These exercises are aggressive demonstrations but fall short of an actual invasion or takeover.
   
2. **Economic and Non-Military Strategies:** Reports suggest that China may employ non-military means, such as an economic blockade, to exert control. However, these measures have significant potential for international backlash and might not be feasible or sufficient to achieve control over half of Taiwan's population under the resolution criteria.

3. **Global Political Risks:** Despite heightened tensions and hostile rhetoric, there is significant international diplomatic attention, especially from the US and EU, aimed at maintaining the status quo. The US has continued its support for Taiwan, which is a considerable deterrent to PRC military action.

4. **Current International Reactions:** International actors, including the United Nations, have consistently urged restraint. This ongoing global attention and support for Taiwan reduce the likelihood of a successful PRC attempt to gain control.

**Future Development Indications:**
- Given the ongoing military drills and threats, the situation requires monitoring, but these have been happening without leading to significant escalation in the past.
- While non-military strategies are mentioned, the success probability remains speculative and low, given regional and international pressures.

**Trend Extrapolation and Scenario Analysis:**
The trend has been a cycle of heightened rhetoric and military posturing without actual conflict escalation. The most likely scenario within this timeframe is continued tension without a physical takeover of Taiwan.

**Conclusion/Forecast:**
Using a balance of base rate logic and current situation analysis, the probability remains low for the PRC to control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024. The resolution criteria, involving control over half the population or puppet state status, are particularly stringent. It seems improbable that these conditions will be met based on current evidence, but acknowledging uncertainties and potential changes in global political dynamics, some non-zero risk remains.

My Prediction: 1.50% being the most likely, with 98.50% confidence. Probability: 1.50%.

- While non-military strategies are mentioned, the success probability remains speculative and low, given regional and international pressures.

**Trend Extrapolation and Scenario Analysis:**
The trend has been a cycle of heightened rhetoric and military posturing without actual conflict escalation. The most likely scenario within this timeframe is continued tension without a physical takeover of Taiwan.

**Conclusion/Forecast:**
Using a balance of base rate logic and current situation analysis, the probability remains low for the PRC to control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024. The resolution criteria, involving control over half the population or puppet state status, are particularly stringent. It seems improbable that these conditions will be met based on current evidence, but acknowledging uncertainties and potential changes in global political dynamics, some non-zero risk remains.

My Prediction: 1.50% being the most likely, with 98.50% confidence. Probability: 1.50%.

To forecast whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will control at least half of Taiwan before September 30, 2024, let's evaluate the situation by considering relevant information and historical context using the steps outlined earlier.

**Base Rate Consideration:**
Historically, the likelihood of China taking control of Taiwan, particularly through force, is low. There has been sustained military tension but no actual military takeover of Taiwan by China. The historical base rate for such an occurrence within a short time frame is extremely low, suggesting less than 1%.

**Current Situation Analysis (Inside View):**
1. **Military Posture and Exercises:** There are extensive reports of China's military exercises aimed at testing capabilities to "take control" of Taiwan. These exercises are aggressive demonstrations but fall short of an actual invasion or takeover.
   
2. **Economic and Non-Military Strategies:** Reports suggest that China may employ non-military means, such as an economic blockade, to exert control. However, these measures have significant potential for international backlash and might not be feasible or sufficient to achieve control over half of Taiwan's population under the resolution criteria.

3. **Global Political Risks:** Despite heightened tensions and hostile rhetoric, there is significant international diplomatic attention, especially from the US and EU, aimed at maintaining the status quo. The US has continued its support for Taiwan, which is a considerable deterrent to PRC military action.

4. **Current International Reactions:** International actors, including the United Nations, have consistently urged restraint. This ongoing global attention and support for Taiwan reduce the likelihood of a successful PRC attempt to gain control.

**Future Development Indications:**
- Given the ongoing military drills and threats, the situation requires monitoring, but these have been happening without leading to significant escalation in the past.
- While non-military strategies are mentioned, the success probability remains speculative and low, given regional and international pressures.
