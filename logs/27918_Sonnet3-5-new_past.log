Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Today is September 4, 2024
- The question asks about undocking before September 16, 2024
- Multiple recent sources consistently report planned undocking for September 6, 2024 at 6:04 PM EDT

2. Evidence Supporting High Probability:
- NASA and Boeing have officially announced September 6 as the undocking date
- Detailed timing has been specified (6:04 PM EDT)
- Pre-departure news conference is scheduled for September 4
- Multiple independent sources confirm the same date
- Technical preparations appear complete
- Weather conditions are being monitored but no concerns reported

3. Risk Factors/Evidence for Lower Probability:
- Previous technical issues with Starliner
- History of delays with the program
- Alternative dates (September 10, 14, or 18) mentioned as backups
- Weather could potentially cause delays
- Complex technical nature of the operation

4. Balancing Factors:
- Very recent confirmations from multiple reliable sources
- NASA's explicit "go" decision
- Detailed planning and scheduling in place
- Relatively short timeframe until planned undocking
- Multiple backup dates still within resolution timeframe

5. Base Rate Consideration:
- Once final preparations and announcements are made, space operations typically proceed as scheduled unless major technical or weather issues arise
- Recent space operations have generally maintained announced schedules

Given the strong consensus on the September 6 date, multiple confirmations from official sources, detailed planning in place, and the fact that even if delayed to backup dates it would still be before September 16, this appears to be a high probability event.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 95.50%, with 92.50% being the most likely. Probability: 92.50%

Let me analyze this carefully:

Key Points to Consider:

1. Multiple recent credible sources (NASA, Boeing, news outlets) consistently report that Starliner is scheduled to undock on September 6, 2024, at 6:04 PM EDT.

2. The planning appears advanced and specific:
- Detailed timeline published
- Pre-departure news conference scheduled
- Live coverage arrangements announced
- Landing site and recovery teams prepared
- Weather contingencies considered

3. Backup dates are available if needed:
- September 10, 14, or 18 mentioned as alternative dates (per Globo.com article)
- This provides flexibility within the September 16 deadline

4. Technical readiness:
- NASA and Boeing have completed detailed reviews
- Ground teams are prepared for remote operation
- Systems have been updated for uncrewed return
- Previous successful uncrewed tests provide confidence

5. Potential risks:
- Weather could cause delays
- Technical issues could emerge
- Previous thruster problems noted
- Historical delays with Starliner program

Balancing these factors:

FOR high probability:
- Multiple independent confirmations of September 6 date
- Advanced stage of preparations
- Multiple backup dates before deadline
- Strong institutional commitment to timeline
- Successful system reviews completed

AGAINST high probability:
- History of delays with Starliner
- Technical uncertainties remain
- Weather could impact schedule
- Complex operation with some risk

Given multiple backup dates before September 16 and the advanced state of preparations, even with potential delays, the likelihood of meeting the deadline is very high.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 95.50%, with 92.00% being the most likely. Probability: 92.00%.

2. Key evidence supporting a high probability:
- Multiple recent articles (Sept 4-5, 2024) consistently report planned undocking for September 6, 2024 at 6:04 PM EDT
- NASA has completed detailed reviews and given the "go-ahead"
- Specific timing details have been announced (6:04 PM EDT undocking, 12:03 AM EDT landing)
- Live coverage plans have been announced
- Ground teams and recovery crews are prepared
- Weather conditions appear favorable

3. Key evidence supporting uncertainty:
- History of delays and technical issues with Starliner
- Articles mention possibility of delays to Sept 10, 14, or 18 if weather or technical issues arise
- Spacecraft has experienced helium leaks and thruster problems
- Modified undocking procedures due to technical concerns

4. Analyzing timing:
- Planned undocking is September 6
- Question deadline is September 16
- This provides a 10-day buffer for potential delays
- Even with previous delays, they've typically been resolved within such timeframes

5. Decision-critical factors:
