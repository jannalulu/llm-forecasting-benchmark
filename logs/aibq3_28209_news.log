**The AI industry is obsessed with Chatbot Arena, but it might not be the best benchmark | TechCrunch**
Chatbot Arena, a benchmark created by LMSYS, has become a popular tool for evaluating AI models. However, experts like Yuchen Lin and Mike Cook have raised concerns about the benchmark's limitations. They argue that the user base is not representative, and the voting process is unreliable. Additionally, the benchmark's reliance on post-processing and automated systems to label queries and rank models lacks systematic rigor. Furthermore, LMSYS' commercial ties and sponsorship from organizations with vested interests in the AI industry raise concerns about the benchmark's impartiality. Despite these flaws, Lin believes that Chatbot Arena provides a valuable service by offering real-time insights into how different models perform outside the lab. However, he suggests that LMSYS could improve the testing by designing benchmarks around different subtopics and using a more systematic approach to evaluate models.

**X Agrees to Obtain User Consent for KI-Chatbot Training**
Elon Musk's KI-Chatbot Grok will no longer be trained with user data from X without their consent, following a complaint from the Irish Data Protection Authority. The authority had filed a lawsuit against X, but withdrew it after the company stopped using user data for training. Grok is a chatbot developed by xAI, a KI-firm owned by Musk, and is available to X's premium subscribers. Initially, X used user data from its platform to train Grok, but did not obtain explicit consent from users. Instead, they were given the option to opt out of data usage in their settings. The Irish Data Protection Authority argued that explicit consent was necessary, and X subsequently stopped using user data for training. This incident has sparked a broader debate on regulating access to user information for training AI models.

**X Agrees to Halt Data Processing for AI Chatbot Grok in Europe**
X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, has agreed to stop processing personal data from European users to train its AI chatbot Grok, in compliance with demands from European regulators. The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) announced on Wednesday that X has committed to removing personal data from European users contained in public posts on its platform, collected between May 7 and August 1, 2024. This decision comes after a dispute began in August, when the DPC requested a court order to prevent X from processing the data for use in its AI model, citing EU data protection restrictions and arguing that X's action posed a risk to users' rights. The DPC stated that this is the first time a leading EU agency has taken such a measure against an online platform. X initially agreed to suspend temporarily the use of the data to train Grok, a commitment that became permanent on Wednesday, allowing the DPC to conclude the judicial proceedings. The DPC also requested the European Data Protection Board to initiate a debate on the interaction between data protection and AI model training, a topic that has led to disputes between data control bodies and tech companies, including X and Meta Platforms, Inc. 'The DPC hopes that the resulting opinion will enable proactive, effective, and consistent regulation across Europe in this area on a wider scale,' said DPC Commissioner Dale Sunderland in a press release. 'It will also serve as support for processing a series of complaints that have been submitted or transmitted to the DPC' on this matter.

**X pledges to fix AI chatbot after it spread misinformation about US election**
Social media platform X has modified its Grok chatbot after election officials in five US states called for accuracy. Grok had falsely claimed the ballot deadline had passed in nine states, and users were directed to the nonpartisan election information site Vote.gov, which officials consider a 'trustworthy resource'. This comes as part of a larger issue with AI-generated content spreading misinformation, particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs) being trained on extensive online data without filtering out inaccurate information. Despite the amendment, Grok still generates misleading images and uses real people's likenesses in questionable ways. X's owner, Musk, introduced Grok as 'rebellious' and boasted its ability to answer 'spicy questions', but the chatbot's creations have raised concerns about hate speech and misinformation campaigns on the platform.

**Grok 2 tested: Is it better than ChatGPT in the real world?**
Grok, a chatbot developed by xAI, a startup founded by Elon Musk, has been compared to ChatGPT in various real-world scenarios. Grok has access to real-time information via tweets on X, which can make it more useful for current affairs and recent events. However, this also means it can potentially spread fake news and misinformation. Grok can generate code, create AI-generated images, and provide detailed answers to nuanced questions. Unlike ChatGPT, Grok relies on the FLUX.1 model for image generation and requires an X Premium or X Premium Plus subscription. In a comparison of Grok and ChatGPT, Grok delivered more detailed answers to questions about the Tesla Cybertruck and provided a more comprehensive forecast for the weather in Mumbai. However, Grok's reliance on X posts can lead to biased output, and it may not be as accurate as ChatGPT in some cases. Ultimately, Grok is a competitive value-add for X users, but it still has some limitations.

**Grok 2: The Unrestricted AI Model That's Causing Controversy**
Grok 2 is the latest version of the chatbot created by xAI, the AI company founded by Elon Musk. It is a paid model available only to X Premium or Premium+ users, and allows users to generate images from text and share them directly on X (Twitter). Unlike other AI models, Grok 2 has no restrictions on generating images, which has led to controversy, with some users using it to sexualize celebrities or create provocative images of public figures. According to xAI, Grok 2 outperforms competitors like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4-Turbo in terms of performance. The model comes in two versions: Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini, with the latter being a smaller version that balances speed and response quality. xAI's CEO, Elon Musk, has stated that Grok 2 is 'superior' to other AI models, but the European Commission is investigating X for possible violations of the Digital Services Act due to the lack of restrictions on Grok 2's image generation capabilities.

**Grok 2.0 Takes Third Place in Chatbot Test, Partners with FLUX Generator**
Grok 2, a neural network developed by Elon Musk, has taken third place in a chatbot test. According to the developers, the significant increase in test results is a testament to the network's progress. The most interesting aspect, however, is Grok's first participation in the ChatBot Arena, where the winner is chosen by users through a vote. The smart chatbots Grok appeared in late 2023, but Grok 1.0 and 1.5 were never on the 'arena'. Moreover, outside of the paid subscription X (formerly Twitter), it was also extremely difficult for a curious user to try Elon Musk's neural networks. The developers may have been afraid that Grok would be evaluated too low compared to other large language models. However, with the new version 2.0, the developers are more confident in the results. To avoid making a fuss and not revealing themselves too early, the new version of Grok 2 debuted on the service under the misleading name 'sus-column-r'. The developers have since revealed themselves, explaining in their official blog that 'sus-column-r' is actually Grok 2.0. The new version has achieved a high rating on the ChatBot Arena, but still lags behind the August versions of GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Grok 2.0 has also learned to create images, not just text responses. However, this feature is not available on the 'arena', but is currently being experimented with by premium users of X (Twitter). Elon Musk has taken a shortcut by not creating a generator from scratch, but instead partnering with the Black Forest Labs team, which includes former leading developers of Stable Diffusion. The team has developed a generator called FLUX, which has already taken the top spots in some ratings, even surpassing the paid Midjourney. According to Musk's Twitter account, he initially wanted to partner with Midjourney, but was surprised by the emergence of FLUX. In addition to quality, FLUX has a relatively low level of censorship. The neural network can draw people in underwear, does not shy away from politicians and famous people, and does not draw half of the characters as black as Google Imagen. The combination of Grok 2.0 and FLUX is reminiscent of the tandem of ChatGPT and Dall-E, but with higher quality and fewer restricted topics. Despite its high scores on the 'arena', many questions on logic and common sense that Grok 2.0 and its competitors cannot answer. The developers have confirmed that Grok 2.0 is just the beginning, and that more advanced versions will be released in the future. For example, if Grok 2 was trained on 20-25 thousand Nvidia H100 accelerators, the next model, Grok 3, is currently being trained on 100 thousand H100. Musk promises to complete the training and start deploying version 3.0 in December. The main competition for Grok 3 will be the new mysterious version of GPT from OpenAI, Gemini 2.0 from Google, and the powerful Claude 3.5 Opus from Anthropic. P.S. At the time of writing, Grok 2.0 is still available for free on ChatBot Arena under the name 'sus-column-r'. In turn, FLUX can be tried for free on the Hugging Face service in the Spaces section. There is an official FLUX Dev model available, which is not as good as Pro, but can occasionally produce high-quality results.

**The reckless 'fun' of unfettered AI**
Elon Musk's X platform has released a new AI chatbot called Grok-2, which allows users to generate images and text. The chatbot has been praised by Musk fans for its 'fun' and 'uncensored' nature, but others have expressed concerns about the potential for political disinformation and election-related trolling. The chatbot can generate images of historical figures in various scenarios, such as Kamala Harris as a dominatrix or Donald Trump as Rambo. However, it also has boundaries, such as refusing to generate nude images of Taylor Swift. The article highlights the risks of AI-generated content and the need for responsible use. Meanwhile, Google is redesigning its AI Overviews to display citations more prominently, and SAG-AFTRA has struck a deal with an AI startup to create voice clones for digital advertising. Additionally, a new study from the University of Oxford found that large language models become better at accomplishing goals when prompted to plan in the form of a graph.

**Russian Platform for Evaluating Generative Neural Networks Launched**
Roman Kutsen, a developer, has created a platform called LLM Arena in collaboration with experts from TrainingData.ru to evaluate the quality of large language models in Russian. The platform allows users to test and compare Russian neural networks in real-time, evaluating the relevance and quality of their responses. Users can compare the answers of two randomly selected models and choose the best one. The platform currently has 21 AI models available for testing, including both foreign (ChatGPT, LLaMa) and Russian (YandexGPT, GigaChat, Saiga) models. The developers plan to add new models regularly. According to Kutsen, 'Our goal is to create an objective, open, and up-to-date rating of language models in Russian. Despite the increasing number of benchmarks, testing Russian LLMs on real user tasks is very challenging. LMSYS Chatbot Arena does not provide access to any Russian neural networks, so we decided to create our own platform to allow users to compare Russian and foreign generative neural networks and make their own conclusions.'

**OpenAI's newly released GPT-4o mini dominates the Chatbot Arena. Here's why.**
OpenAI's newly released GPT-4o mini has dominated the Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS) Chatbot Arena, surpassing established models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini Advanced. The Chatbot Arena is a platform where users can evaluate large language models by chatting with two models side by side and comparing their responses. GPT-4o mini's success is notable because it is 20 times cheaper than its predecessor. Some users expressed concerns about the mini model's high ranking, but LMSYS explained that the results are based on human preferences and encouraged users to look at the per-category breakdowns to understand the models' technical capabilities.

**Sam Altman 'Excited' By New ChatGPT Capabilities**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, expressed his excitement about the capabilities of the latest ChatGPT model, GPT-4o mini, which was launched over the weekend. The model is designed to provide similar performance to GPT-4o at a fraction of the cost. Altman highlighted the model's performance in a 'Chatbot Arena' conducted by lmsys, a language model comparison organization, and stated that he is 'excited' to see the model's performance, despite trying not to get too excited about individual evaluations. The new model is part of OpenAI's aim to make artificial intelligence more accessible to both consumers and businesses.

**OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini isn't much better than rival LLMs**
OpenAI has released GPT-4o Mini, a smaller and cheaper version of its GPT-4o generative large language model (LLM). The Mini version is multimodal, can handle up to 16,000 tokens of output, and is trained on materials up to October 2023. While it is not fully featured yet, supporting only text and vision via its API, OpenAI claims it is ahead of comparable LLMs in benchmarks. However, veteran open source developer Simon Willison notes that the competition has released their own GPT-4-class models, and the pricing is not too bad. GPT-4o Mini is mostly ahead of the pack in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena benchmark, but full-size GPT-4o is only barely ahead of its rivals. OpenAI may no longer have the dominating lead it once had, but it is still a strong player in the LLM arena.
