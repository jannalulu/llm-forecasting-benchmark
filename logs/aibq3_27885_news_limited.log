**Super Micro Computer's Stock Plummets After Delaying Annual Report Submission**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted over 26% on Wall Street after the company delayed the submission of its annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company confirmed that it would not meet the deadline for submitting the Form 10-K, a comprehensive annual report required by the regulator. According to Super Micro Computer, the delay is due to the need to evaluate 'its internal controls over financial reporting'. The company expects to submit a Form 12B-25, which is used to request an extension for submitting the annual or quarterly report, before August 30, 2024. This comes a day after Hindenburg Research, a short-selling firm, accused Super Micro Computer of 'accounting manipulation' and opened a short position in the company. 'The delay in filing is a red flag, especially in light of the allegations. Time will tell who is right, but for now, investors seem to be assuming that if there's smoke, there's fire,' said analysts from Great Hill Capital. However, JPMorgan analysts have defended the company, stating that the Hindenburg Research report 'lacks details on the alleged irregularities' and 'revisits areas that are already known to need improvement in corporate governance and transparency.'

**Super Micro's stock rocked by disclosure of accounting concerns**
Super Micro Computer Inc. announced that it will miss the deadline to file its annual report due to accounting concerns. The company stated, '[Super Micro] is unable to file its annual report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense.' The stock plummeted 25.1% in morning trading, putting it on track for its biggest one-day selloff in six years. This comes after short seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging accounting red flags and undisclosed related-party transactions. Super Micro has a market capitalization of over $25 billion and is required to file its 10-K within 60 days of its fiscal year end. The company expects to file a Form 12b-25 with the SEC on August 30. This is not the first time Super Micro has faced accounting troubles, having paid a $17.5 million civil penalty in 2020 to settle an SEC investigation.

**Super Micro Computer Faces Another Trust Crisis**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted by 20% after the company announced it would miss the deadline to file its annual report with the SEC. The company plans to submit a 'Notification of Late Filing' on Form 12b-25, which allows for a delayed filing. This news sent shockwaves through the market, causing the company's stock to drop immediately after trading began. The delayed filing of the 'Form 10-K', a detailed financial report that must be submitted annually by publicly traded companies, has raised concerns among investors. Super Micro Computer stated that filing the report on time would have required an 'unreasonable expense or cost'. According to the company, the management needs additional time to complete the evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Although the company assured that the previously published financial numbers for the year and quarter, released on August 6, 2024, remain unchanged, the delay has raised doubts about the company's internal stability and management practices. This is not the first time Super Micro Computer has faced regulatory challenges. In 2018, the company was temporarily delisted from the NASDAQ due to lack of financial reports. Two years later, the SEC imposed a fine of $17.5 million on the company after it was discovered that Super Micro had improperly booked revenue and concealed expenses.

Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI) announced that it will not timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The company expects to file a Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 on August 30, 2024.

**Super Micro Computer Plunges on Short-Seller Report. Can You Trust Hindenburg Research?**
Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) plummeted 28% after a short report from Hindenburg Research alleged undisclosed related-party transactions and accounting irregularities. The company also announced it would not file its 10-K annual report on time, citing the need to assess internal controls over financial reporting. Hindenburg's accusations, if true, could be damaging in the long term, especially given Supermicro's previous SEC fine for insufficient internal accounting controls. However, short-seller reports can be exaggerated or unfounded, and Hindenburg's track record is mixed. The company has had some wins, including its attack on Nikola, but also made unfounded allegations against Block. Investors should be cautious and wait for a response from management before making a decision.

**Super Micro Confirms It Will Delay Annual Financial Filings**
Super Micro Computer Inc. has confirmed that it will delay its annual financial report due to a special board committee reviewing internal controls. The company stated that it would take 'unreasonable effort or expense' to file on time its annual 10-K financial disclosures for the quarter and fiscal year ended June 30. This decision comes after a critical report from short-seller Hindenburg Research alleging 'glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.' Super Micro repeated its assertion that it doesn't expect the annual financial filing to contain any material changes to its results announced on Aug. 6. The company's shares gained about 2% in extended trading after the filing, but had suffered its worst week since October 2018, dropping 29% to $437.70 at the close in New York.

**AI Spotted Super Micro Risks Two Years Before Filing Fiasco**
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plummeted 20% after missing its 10-K filing deadline and a scathing report by Hindenburg Research alleging related-party accounting manipulation. AI-powered tools, such as Hudson Labs, detected escalating financial reporting risk signals as early as 2022, which were permitted to 'hide in plain view.' The company has a history of financial reporting woes, including being delisted and charged by the SEC in 2020 for channel stuffing. Hudson Labs CEO Kris Bennatti wrote, 'We first called out transactions at SMCI that looked a lot like 'round tripping' in 2022.' The Hindenburg report added to the controversy, citing the SEC's $17.5 million fine in 2020 and the company's recent re-surfacing of former CFO Howard Hideshima as an Ablecom consultant. Analysts have raised concerns about SMCI's governance, transparency, and communication with investors, and the company's valuation fragility has been fueled by the recent events.

**Super Micro Computer Stock: Delayed Annual Report Is A Major Red Flag - Sell (SMCI)**
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has delayed its annual report due to allegations of improper revenue recognition and circumvention of internal controls. The company's auditors declined to sign off on the report without management addressing these issues. This delay is a major red flag, and it may take several months or even quarters for the company to work through the numbers. The inability to file timely financial statements with the SEC resulted in Nasdaq delisting the company's common shares in August 2018. The company may be required to restate years of financial statements, which could lead to a difficult exercise in accessing the capital markets. As a result, investors should consider moving to the sidelines, and the company's stock may be a sell.

**Supermicro delays 10-K filling due to accounting issues**
Super Micro Computer has announced that it will not be able to meet the deadline for its annual report due to internal financial reporting issues. The company will seek an extension to file its Form 10-K, citing the need for additional time to assess its internal controls over financial reporting. Despite this, Supermicro is standing by its recent quarterly results, which showed significant jumps in revenue and net income. However, Hindenburg Research has published a list of issues it identified at the company, including re-hiring executives associated with past accounting issues, shipping partial or faulty products, and conducting related-party transactions without disclosure. Hindenburg Research also claims that Supermicro's liquid cooling technology is not innovative, and that the company ships shoddy products to customers. The research firm admits to holding a short position in Supermicro, which has seen its share price drop significantly since the announcement. 'All told, we believe Super Micro is a serial recidivist,' Hindenburg Research wrote. 'It benefitted as an early mover but still faces significant accounting, governance and compliance issues and offers an inferior product and service now being eroded away by more credible competition.'

**Super Micro's Annual Report Delayed, Shares Crash by a Quarter**
Super Micro Computer announced that it expects to submit a 'delayed filing' notice to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 30. The company stated, 'Super Micro is not able to file its annual report within the prescribed timeframe without undue burden or expense.' The company's shares plummeted by a quarter in value on Wednesday, trading at around $410 per share. This comes after the company previously disclosed that it does not expect to submit its audited annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30 on time. The company's management needs additional time to complete the evaluation of the design and operational effectiveness of internal controls for financial reporting for the June 30, 2024 period. This news comes a day after short seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging 'accounting manipulation' by Super Micro, citing a three-month investigation that included interviews with former executives and experts, as well as analysis of court and business documents. Hindenburg Research identified significant irregularities, including unauthorized transactions with related parties, violations of sanctions and export laws, and problems with customer relationships.

**Super Micro Computer Short Report Shows 'Limited Evidence' Of Accounting Wrongdoing: Analyst**
A new short report by Hindenburg alleges accounting manipulation and wrongdoing by Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI), but JPMorgan Chase analyst Samik Chatterjee is skeptical. Chatterjee said, 'As we dig into the details of the report, we believe there to be limited evidence of accounting mistreatments beyond revisiting the 2020 charges from the SEC, and limited new information relative to the existing and already known business relationship with related companies owned by the siblings of the founder of SMCI.' He noted that the report's findings are 'tough to verify' and that the alleged wrongdoing does not change the company's medium-term revenue outlook. Chatterjee said, 'Net-net, we see the report as largely void of details around alleged wrongdoings from the company that change the medium-term outlook, and largely revisiting the already known areas for improvement in relation to corporate governance and transparency.' JPMorgan holds an Overweight rating on SMCI, which has delayed its 10K filing.

**Super Micro Computer Delays Annual Financial Report**
Super Micro Computer, Inc. has announced that it will not present its annual financial report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, within the prescribed timeframe. The company expects to file a Late Filing Notification on Form 12b-25 by August 30, 2024. The delay is attributed to the additional time required by the SMCI management to complete the internal control evaluation on financial reporting at the end of the fiscal year. This process is necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the company's financial statements. Super Micro Computer has not updated its previously announced results for the fiscal year and quarter ended June 30, 2024, which were initially disclosed in a press release dated August 6, 2024. The company has reported record financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024, with revenues reaching $5.31 billion, a 143% increase on a yearly basis.
