**Ballot question revives debate over same-sex marriage in Hawaii**
A ballot question in Hawaii is reviving the debate over same-sex marriage, which was thought to be settled a decade ago. The question asks if the state constitution should be amended to repeal the legislature's authority to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples. Political science Professor Colin Moore says the question is raising confusion and fears that it's a trick. However, he believes a 'Yes' vote would affirm support for marriage equality in the constitution, creating more protections for same-sex marriage. Supporters of the amendment, such as Waikiki Democrat Adrian Tam, argue that the language giving lawmakers the power to reserve marriage only to opposite-sex couples is discriminatory. Opponents, like former Republican Lawmaker Bob McDermott, believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman and want to retain the power to ban gay marriage again. Moore says the vote is largely symbolic, but it would require another change to the constitution and another public vote to restore a ban on gay marriage.

**Same-sex marriage and other ballot measures**
Hawaii voters will decide on two proposed State Constitutional amendments and numerous County Charter amendments in the upcoming general election. One amendment aims to repeal a 1998 constitutional amendment that gave the Legislature the power to ban same-sex marriage, while the other proposes to make the process for appointing and confirming judges more uniform. County Charter amendments include proposals to increase real property taxes for a Climate Resiliency Fund, cap Council member salaries, and add youth members to Boards and Commissions. Retired Judge Daniel Foley explained the process for getting proposals on the ballot and the significance of leaving a blank vote, which counts as a 'no' for Constitutional amendments. Foley also discussed the potential risks of statewide initiative, which would allow citizens to bypass the Legislature and propose constitutional amendments directly, and the importance of understanding county initiatives, which can be found in a digital voters guide and media coverage.

**Hawaii voters to decide on changing constitutional amendment to remove language on opposite-sex marriage**
Hawaii voters will decide on a constitutional amendment to remove outdated language regarding opposite-sex marriage. The proposed amendment aims to repeal the legislature's authority to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples, which was added to the State Constitution in 1998. According to Dan Foley, the attorney in the landmark case Baehr v Lewin, the amendment would 'take that power away from the Legislature' and prevent a potential ban on same-sex marriage. Foley explained, 'Essentially, the Legislature can ban same-sex marriage, which it once did in 1997.' A 'Yes' vote would remove the language from the constitution, while a 'No' vote would make no change. It's worth noting that even blank votes count as a 'No' vote, and voting both 'Yes' and 'No' on the same question would invalidate the vote.

**Hawaii voters to consider 2 Constitutional amendments**
Hawaii voters will consider two constitutional amendments in the November 5 election. The first amendment aims to repeal the Legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, which was granted in 1998 when 69% of voters opposed same-sex marriage. House Speaker Scott Saiki, who fought to legalize same-sex marriage in 2013, introduced the bill proposing the amendment. The second amendment would make the selection of District Court judges similar to that of higher court judges, requiring the Judicial Selection Commission to present the Chief Justice with a list of nominees, and ensuring that a valid appointment is made within a certain timeframe. Voters will be asked to approve or reject these amendments through a one-sentence question on the ballot.

**What will Amendment J change in Colorado if voters approve it?**
Amendment J, on this year's ballot in Colorado, aims to remove the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman from the state constitution. The current definition was added in 2006, but same-sex marriage has been legal in Colorado since 2014 and nationwide since 2015. Supporters of Amendment J, including Josh Franklin and John Wolfe, argue that it provides equal rights for all couples, regardless of their background or orientation. However, opponents, such as Nicole Hunt from Focus on the Family, believe that maintaining the current definition of marriage is essential for a healthy family and society. They argue that kids do better when raised by married, biological parents. A no vote on Amendment J would keep the current definition in the constitution, while a yes vote would remove it.

**US Elections: Guide to States with LGBTQ+ Measures on the Ballot**
In the upcoming US elections, several states will have measures related to LGBTQ+ rights on the ballot. California's Proposition 3 aims to recognize the right to marry as a fundamental right, regardless of sex or race, and protect same-sex marriage in case the Supreme Court reverses its 2015 decision. Colorado's Amendment J seeks to repeal the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, while Hawaii's Question 1 aims to revoke the legislature's power to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples. New York's Proposal 1 seeks to add an article to the state constitution that prohibits discrimination based on ethnicity, nationality, age, and disability, as well as sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. South Dakota's Amendment E aims to update the state constitution to use gender-neutral language. According to a UCLA report, 80% of same-sex couples are concerned that the US Supreme Court may overturn the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

**State ballot measures attract more than $417 million ahead of Election Day - OpenSecrets News**
Ahead of Election Day, voters in 41 states will decide on 159 statewide ballot measures, with a total of over $417 million raised by committees supporting or opposing these measures. The most expensive measure is Florida's Measure 3, which would legalize marijuana for adults 21 and over, with over $125 million raised. Spending on ballot measures related to abortion rights has exceeded $122.7 million, outpacing all other issues. In 10 states, voters will decide on 11 ballot measures that deal with abortion access, with some measures aiming to codify the right to abortion and others to ban access. The Dobbs decision has also led activists to question whether other Supreme Court decisions could be in jeopardy, with activists in California, Colorado, and Hawaii taking their concerns to the polls to proactively cement the right for same-sex couples to marry. 'The Dobbs decision hasn't just triggered state action around abortion rights, it has also led activists to question whether other Supreme Court decisions could be in jeopardy,' said an activist. 'We're taking our concerns to the polls to proactively cement the right for same-sex couples to marry if the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling is ever overturned.'

**Why Marriage Equality Is Back on the Ballot**
This November, three states - California, Colorado, and Hawaii - will ask voters to secure same-sex marriage into state law, amid concerns that the Supreme Court may overturn the Obergefell v. Hodges decision. According to the Movement Advancement Project, 30 states still have unenforceable amendments on the books that prohibit marriage equality. Shay Franco-Clausen, political director of Equality California, said, 'Before [Trump] was elected, and when he got elected, people were upset, but they hadn't lived through it. Now that we've lived through it and the division that he continues to create, his naming that our marriages and our relationships aren't real -- that we're not normal -- that protection for people during another potential Trump administration is necessary.' The Respect for Marriage Act, passed in 2022, requires the federal government to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages, but it does not guarantee state recognition. California's Proposition 3 and Colorado's Amendment J aim to remove language that restricts marriage to opposite-sex couples, while Hawaii's amendment would remove a provision that reserves marriage to opposite-sex couples.

**Colorado Ballot Measure Aims to Remove Ban on Gay Marriage From State Constitution**
A decade after same-sex marriage was legalized in Colorado, voters have the chance to make it even more official by removing language from the Colorado Constitution that bans same-sex marriage. Amendment J, if approved during the November election, would remove the sentence: “Only a union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.” Proponents of the ballot measure, including Governor Jared Polis and many Democratic lawmakers, argue that it's necessary to provide additional protections in case federal precedent changes. Critics, mostly relying on religious messaging, argue that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. Senator Sonya Jaquez Lewis said, 'Our LGBTQ community is very afraid, living in fear that rights will be taken away.' Senator Joann Ginal added, 'Growing up in the ’60s, being gay was not a popular thing. It was quite scary to be yourself.... I had to hide my real life in fear of losing my job. I have lost friends. But we have come light-years in acceptance of same-sex marriage in the last decade.... It's time to fix this.' The campaign in favor of Amendment J, Freedom to Marry Colorado, raised over $760,000 as of Monday, October 28, according to state campaign finance records. Nearly 120 organizations have endorsed Amendment J, including the Democratic Party of Colorado, Interfaith Alliance of Colorado, and Mental Health Colorado.

**Your guide to where LGBTQ+ issues are on the ballot this November**
Same-sex marriage has been legal in all 50 US states since 2015, but the Supreme Court's conservative majority has raised concerns that the decision could be overturned. To preempt this, state legislatures have introduced ballot measures to protect same-sex marriage rights. This November, voters in California, Colorado, and Hawaii will consider measures to safeguard LGBTQ+ marriages. California's Proposition 3 would declare same-sex marriage a fundamental right in the state Constitution, while Colorado's Amendment J would repeal language that restricts marriage to opposite-sex couples. In Hawaii, a constitutional amendment would give the state Legislature the power to protect same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, New York is asking voters to consider adding language to its constitution that would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. As one advocate for Proposition 1 in New York said, 'We need to close the loopholes in our state Constitution to ensure that fundamental rights are protected.'

**On Your Ballot: State constitution amendments explained**
Hawaii News Now's Daryl Huff and political analyst Colin Moore explained the two state constitution amendments on the general election ballot. Question #1 seeks to repeal the legislature's authority to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples. Question #2 aims to standardize the appointment and confirmation process for district court judges, making it the same as that for supreme court justices and intermediate court of appeals and circuit court judges. According to the proposed amendment, the Judicial Selection Commission would present the Chief Justice with a list of nominees, and the Senate would have thirty days to reject or confirm the appointment. If rejected, the Chief Justice would make another appointment within ten days. If the Senate fails to act, the Judicial Selection Commission would make the appointment without Senate consent.

**Ballot question would change judicial selection process**
A proposed constitutional amendment in Hawaii aims to simplify the process of appointing District Court judges. According to State Senate Judiciary Chair Karl Rhoads, the amendment would make the process more efficient and easier to understand for everyone. The current process involves screening candidates by the Judicial Selection Commission, appointed by the Chief Justice, and confirmed by the state Senate. The amendment would eliminate small differences in the process used for higher court judges and reduce the number of applicants the Chief Justice must choose from to between four and six. If the Senate can't vote on a nominee within 30 days, the nominee would take office automatically. Rhoads said this could allow senators to skip special sessions, but they would still screen nominees for fitness. Political Science Prof. Colin Moore noted that the automatic approval process could be significant, given the number of appointees that require confirmation. Rhoads warned that the question's length and complexity might lead to many blank ballots, which could kill the amendment.

**Six Key Amendments to be on Florida's Ballot on November 5, 2024**
On November 5, 2024, Florida voters will decide on six constitutional amendments that could have a significant impact on the state's future. One of the amendments, Amendment 3, would change the way elections are held in Florida, but it would not take effect until after the 2026 elections. Another amendment, Amendment 4, aims to relax the current six-week limit on abortions by stating that 'no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay or restrict abortion before viability', which would require a 60% approval rate. Amendment 4 would not affect the current law requiring parental notification before a minor can undergo an abortion. Amendment 5 would exempt certain taxes from school district taxes and benefit individuals who own a legal or equitable title to a property where they reside permanently or are legal dependents of the owner. If approved, it would take effect on January 1, 2025. Amendment 6, proposed by the Florida Senate, seeks to eliminate the constitutional requirement for public funding of state candidate campaigns that accept spending limits. If approved, it would repeal that provision, eliminating the use of public funds for those campaigns.

**On Your November Ballot: Prop 3 Aims to Remove Same-Sex Marriage Ban From Calif. Constitution**
Prop 3 aims to remove the ban on same-sex marriage from the California Constitution, which was added by voters in 2008. State Sen. Scott Wiener and Assemblymember Evan Low introduced the constitutional amendment as a preemptive protection after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections in 2022. Supporters, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, believe the removal of the language would provide guaranteed protection against future attacks on marriage equality. Opponents argue that Prop 3 is the beginning of a 'slippery slope' that could serve as a precedent for other types of non-traditional unions, endangering youth, families, and society. Jonathan Keller, President of California Family Council, stated, 'ACA 3 eliminates any safeguards and opens up Pandora's Box, potentially allowing siblings, aunts, uncles, and even parents to marry each other.' A 'yes' vote supports the amendment, while a 'no' vote opposes it, keeping Proposition 8 in the California Constitution.

**Blue States Are Trying To Get Ahead Of The Conservative Supreme Court On Same-Sex Marriage**
LGBTQ+ advocates are pushing for state constitutional amendments to protect same-sex marriage in several blue states, including California, Colorado, and Hawaii, in response to concerns that the conservative U.S. Supreme Court may overturn the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision. The decision, which protected same-sex marriage nationwide, was made in 2015. However, with the addition of three conservative justices appointed by Donald Trump, advocates fear that other rights, including same-sex marriage, may be on the chopping block. California's Proposition 3, Colorado's Amendment J, and Hawaii's Question 1 aim to remove language from their state constitutions that defines marriage as solely between a man and a woman. Rep. Jill Tokuda (D-Hawaii) said, 'As someone who fought to establish and protect marriage equality in Hawaii for more than a quarter of a century, I refuse to stand by and watch this Court take a hatchet to rights won that had previously been denied.' Andy Izenson, senior legal director of the Chosen Family Law Center, added, 'We actually already know what it's like to live in that world. We lived in that world until 2015 and people were traveling to other states where marriage was legal to get married.' Currently, 69% of Americans support same-sex couples' right to legally marry, according to a Gallup poll.

**Worried by fall of Roe v. Wade, organizers get same-sex marriage on the ballot in three states**
Two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, activists are concerned that other high court decisions, including the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling on same-sex marriage, could be in jeopardy. In response, California, Colorado, and Hawaii will allow their residents to vote on ballot measures that would remove language from their state constitutions prohibiting same-sex marriage. Paul Smith, a Georgetown law professor, said the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision should serve as a cautionary tale, as it struck down the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling and led to the reinstatement of abortion bans in dozens of states. Smith and other experts, including Mary Bonauto, one of the lawyers who argued Obergefell before the Supreme Court, agree that ballot measures like the ones in California, Colorado, and Hawaii are necessary to protect same-sex marriage rights. Currently, 30 states have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, and experts warn that without Obergefell, these bans could become law again. The Respect for Marriage Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022, provides federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages, but experts say it is not enough to guarantee marriage equality in all states.

**Organizers get same-sex marriage on the ballot in California, Colorado and Hawaii for 2024 election**
Activists are taking their concerns about the potential overturning of the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry, to the polls. California, Colorado, and Hawaii will allow their residents to vote on ballot measures that would remove language from their state constitutions prohibiting same-sex marriage. Paul Smith, a Georgetown law professor, said the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, which struck down the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling, should serve as a cautionary tale. 'We've had the example of how Dobbs can take down a long-standing precedent. Suddenly there are these state laws that were sitting there dormant, that came springing back to life,' he said. Mary Bonauto, one of the lawyers who argued Obergefell before the Supreme Court, said the high court is 'a very unpredictable court at this point' and added that ballot measures like the ones in California, Colorado, and Hawaii are a way for states to use their power. 'They have been aggressive about reversing precedents,' Bonauto said of the Supreme Court. Currently, 30 states have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, with five also having statutes that prohibit such marriages. Without Obergefell, there is federal legislation that would keep same-sex marriage rights mostly, but not entirely, intact: the Respect for Marriage Act. However, Bonauto and Smith agree that this measure would leave those in conservative states vulnerable.

**Marriage equality is on the ballot in some states this year. Here’s what you need to know.**
With the potential overturning of Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark ruling legalizing marriage equality nationwide, several states are taking measures to ensure marriage equality is protected. In the upcoming election, there are 3 ballot measures relating to marriage equality: California Proposition 3, Colorado Amendment J, and Hawaii Question 1. These measures aim to remove or update language in state constitutions that could prohibit same-sex marriage. California State Sen. Toni Atkins said, 'Here in California, we believe the ability to marry the person you love, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation, is a fundamental right.' Colorado State Sen. Joann Ginal said, 'As representatives of the people of Colorado, it is our shared responsibility to uphold the principles of equality and justice for all citizens.' Hawaii Gov. Josh Green expressed his support for Question 1, saying, 'Voting yes on this constitutional amendment furthers the goal of protecting the rights of our LGBTQ+ ʻohana.'

Honolulu hosted its annual Pride Parade in Waikīkī, with over 4,000 people attending. The event comes at a critical time as voters decide on a constitutional amendment for marriage equality in the state. According to Zag Havoc, 'It's really nice to see your community existing together.' Michael Golojuch Jr., a member of the state LGBTQ+ Commission, emphasized the importance of voting, saying 'We're pretty much safe when it comes to queer issues, but on the national level, it's more precarious.' Daniel Saber, a 43-year-old Hawai‘i resident, urged the community to 'keep fighting' and 'keep doing our prides' to ensure their safety and equality.

**Love Wins in the Centennial State: The Fight for Marriage Equality in Colorado**
Colorado voters will have the opportunity to protect marriage equality in the state constitution by voting 'Yes' on Amendment J. The stakes are high for couples like Georgie Aguirre and Emily Rutledge, who got engaged in 2023 and have a blended family of five children. They fear that if the ban on same-sex marriage is not removed from the Colorado Constitution, they could lose the right to marry and jeopardize the legal and financial safeguards they've put in place. Georgie says, 'It's not just a piece of paper to us, it's about having our relationship recognized and respected.' Emily adds, 'This isn't just about us – it's about protecting LGBTQ+ families for generations to come.' The couple is prepared to keep fighting for their rights, but hopes that Colorado voters will choose to believe in the goodness of their neighbors and approve Amendment J.

**Voters ask, what’s Question 1? Statewide ballot question aims to amend constitution to guarantee abortion rights**
Maryland voters will decide on Election Day whether to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution through a statewide ballot referendum, known as Question 1. If approved, the amendment would establish reproductive freedom as a 'fundamental right,' including a mother's right to prevent, continue, or end a pregnancy. However, Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-38) objects to the fact that the amendment does not mention age limits or parental notifications for abortions. She notes that Maryland has expanded reproductive rights, allowing non-physicians to perform abortions and removing limits on the procedure. The referendum comes as a result of the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson case, which ended federal oversight of abortion rights. Maryland would join 17 states and the District of Columbia in protecting the right to abortion if the amendment is approved.

According to Dan Foley, the attorney in the landmark case Baehr v Lewin, the amendment would 'take that power away from the Legislature' and prevent a potential ban on same-sex marriage. Foley explained, 'Essentially, the Legislature can ban same-sex marriage, which it once did in 1997.' A 'Yes' vote would remove the language from the constitution, while a 'No' vote would make no change. It's worth noting that even blank votes count as a 'No' vote, and voting both 'Yes' and 'No' on the same question would invalidate the vote.

**Proposition 3: Californians will decide whether to enshrine marriage equality in the state constitution**
California voters will decide on Election Day whether to enshrine marriage equality in the state constitution through Proposition 3. This measure would effectively repeal Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state in 2008. The push for marriage equality has been fueled by the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which left reproductive rights up to the states. Assemblymember Evan Low, who is gay, introduced the constitutional amendment, citing the concurring opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas as a catalyst for instituting protections for same-sex marriage. A recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California shows strong support for the measure, with 68% of likely voters saying they would vote yes. Only 1% of those surveyed were undecided. The California Family Council is one of the few organizations opposing the measure, citing concerns about its 'open-ended nature' and potential implications for polygamy, incest, and child marriage.

**LGBTQ+ rights have long been at the mercy of public opinion. This November will be no different.**
LGBTQ+ civil rights are once again up for debate in the 2024 election. This November, voters in several states will decide on ballot initiatives that could impact the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. In New York, voters will consider adding protections for sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression to the state constitution. In California, Colorado, and Hawaii, voters will decide whether to repeal bans on same-sex marriage. This trend of putting LGBTQ+ issues on the ballot is nothing new, with 34 states having sent the question to voters since 1998. As stated by the article, 'Putting these amendments on the ballot was used as a strategy to turn out the conservative vote for George W. Bush in 2004, when 11 states passed them.'

**Abortion, voting rights, other key issues on the ballot in states this election**
Forty-one states have a combined 147 ballot measures in the 2024 election, with some measures addressing key national topics such as abortion, voting rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. Ten states will give voters a chance to change their laws on abortion, with some measures aiming to enshrine or expand reproductive access. Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin have ballot measures that would prohibit noncitizens from voting in state and local elections. Alaska and Maine are the only two states using ranked-choice voting, but Nevada and Oregon have ballot measures to change their state and federal elections to RCV. Colorado and Hawaii voters will vote on a ballot measure that would change their state constitutions to allow same-sex couples the right to marry. California voters will decide whether to repeal Prop 8, the 2008 voter measure that banned same-sex marriages. Other major ballot measures include marijuana laws, immigration policies, and education funding.

**Hawaii voters to consider 2 Constitutional amendments**
Hawaii voters will consider two constitutional amendments in the November 5 election. The first amendment aims to repeal the Legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, which was granted in 1998 when 69% of voters opposed same-sex marriage. House Speaker Scott Saiki, who fought to legalize same-sex marriage in 2013, introduced the bill proposing the amendment. The second amendment would make the selection of District Court judges similar to that of higher court judges, requiring the Judicial Selection Commission to present the Chief Justice with a list of nominees, and ensuring that a valid appointment is made within a certain timeframe. Voters will be asked to approve or reject these amendments through a one-sentence question on the ballot.

**Hawaii voters to cast ballots for president, many local races**
Hawaii voters will cast ballots for president, several local races, and a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would remove the Legislature's ability to repeal same-sex marriages. The Nov. 5 general election will determine whether voters return former President Donald Trump to the White House or elect Vice President Kamala Harris. Voter turnout was low in the Aug. 10 party primary election, with only 32.3% of registered voters casting ballots. Several close legislative races and a proposed amendment to the Hawaii Constitution could increase voter engagement. Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth faces a challenge from Kimo Alameda, and three members of Hawaii's four-member congressional delegation are running for reelection. Several incumbent lawmakers are facing challenges, and at least 11 new members will join the Legislature in January.

**Election | Amendment J would repeal Colorado’s defunct ban on same-sex marriage from constitution**
Amendment J aims to repeal Colorado's defunct ban on same-sex marriage from the state constitution. The ban, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, was deemed unconstitutional by a lower court in 2014. Supporters, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado and Democratic U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, argue that the amendment would protect personal freedoms and prevent same-sex marriages from being at risk if the U.S. Supreme Court were to overturn past rulings. A simple majority is required for the amendment to pass, unlike amendments that add to the state constitution. 'Those in favor of the ballot measure contend that the amendment would protect personal freedoms,' according to the article.

**Blue states like Mass. try ‘Trump-proofing' programs ahead of Election Day**
Blue states in the US are preparing for a potential Trump presidency by implementing 'Trump-proofing' programs to shield their policy priorities from federal interference. This includes stockpiling abortion pills, cutting climate deals with automakers, and protecting same-sex marriage. State leaders are also preparing for lawsuits against a future Trump administration, citing the success of their efforts in the past. California Governor Gavin Newsom said, 'We know the playbook.' Washington state has stockpiled 30,000 doses of mifepristone, the abortion pill, while Massachusetts has preserved its stockpile of 15,000 pills. California has secured a climate agreement with Stellantis, one of the world's largest car manufacturers, to comply with state regulations even if they are challenged by the federal government. State lawmakers have also sought to protect same-sex marriage, pushing constitutional amendments securing it in California, Colorado, and Hawaii. Colorado state Rep. Brianna Titone said, 'A lot of basic protections people take for granted could be changed by a Trump administration.' State attorneys general are preparing to revive their lawsuit strategy against a future Trump administration, citing the success of their efforts in the past. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, 'We'll see what comes in November and beyond, but we won't be caught flat-footed.'

California voters will decide on 10 statewide propositions on November 5, including measures on same-sex marriage, climate change, criminal justice reform, and affordable housing. Proposition 36 seeks to reverse some of the criminal justice reforms passed in 2014, increasing prison time for some drug and theft offenses. Proposition 3 would remove the state's ban on same-sex marriage from the state Constitution, while Proposition 5 would make it easier for municipalities to pass bonds for subsidized housing and infrastructure projects. Other measures include Prop 4, which would issue $10 billion in bonds for climate and environmental projects, and Prop 32, which would raise the statewide minimum wage to $18 an hour by 2026. 'It's ballot measure season,' says the article, 'with ambitious scope and high price tag.'

**CA Proposition 3: Right To Marry Constitutional Amendment**
California voters will decide on Proposition 3, a constitutional amendment that would repeal the state's ban on same-sex marriage, which was codified in 2008's Proposition 8. The amendment would enshrine the right to marry regardless of sex or race in the state Constitution. Proponents, including the state Democratic party and Governor Gavin Newsom, argue that it's time to affirm marriage equality and protect gay rights from a fickle court. Opponents, such as the California Family Council, warn that it could lead to 'Pandora's Box' scenarios, including siblings, nephews, and nieces marrying uncles and aunts. Polls show widespread support for the measure, with supporters raising $1.6 million and spending $88,000, while opponents have not raised or spent any money. As Assemblymember Evan Low said, 'Although same-sex marriage is legal, it could be temporary. We have to remain vigilant, unwavering in our dedication to equality.'

**Editorial: Three amendments can bring equity and ethics to Colorado**
This November, Colorado voters have the opportunity to make significant progress on equity and ethics by voting 'yes' on three statewide ballot measures: Amendments 79, H, and J. A 'yes' vote on these amendments will create a right to abortion in Colorado, establish an independent panel to oversee the ethical behavior of judges, and repeal outdated language prohibiting same-sex marriage from the state constitution. Amendment 79 will enshrine abortion access in the state's constitution, remove an inequitable provision that restricts the use of public funds for abortion, and make it legal for public funds to be used for abortion. Amendment H will replace the state's outdated Commission on Judicial Discipline with an independent board and set standards for the judicial review process. Amendment J will remove the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, which was made unenforceable by the 2015 Supreme Court ruling on Obergefell v. Hodges. The authors of the editorial argue that these amendments are necessary to protect women's reproductive rights, ensure judges are held to high ethical standards, and prevent a rollback of LGBTQ rights. They urge voters to 'vote 'yes' on amendments 79, H, and J to protect the freedoms and rights of Coloradans.'

**Colorado religious leaders support Amendment J on same-sex marriage**
In November, Coloradans will vote on Amendment J, which aims to remove the same-sex marriage ban from the state constitution. Dozens of faith leaders in Colorado, including Rev. Jerry Butler and Rabbi Joseph Black, have announced their support for the repeal. Butler said, 'When you really start peeling back scripture on the LGBTQ issue in particular, a lot of those arguments start to break down pretty quickly.' Black added, 'I believe as a person of faith that all human beings are created in the image of God. I can't understand how two people of the same gender getting married will hurt somebody.' The Colorado constitution defines a union as between a man and a woman, but the ban has not been enforceable since the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. If the landmark decision is overturned, there would be no state protection for same-sex couples.

**Prop. 3 would bring end to fight over same-sex marriage in California**
Proposition 3 aims to end the decades-long battle for same-sex marriage in California by repealing the state's Constitution's ban on same-sex marriage. The measure would formally repeal the 'zombie law' and articulate that 'the right to marry is a fundamental right.' Shannon Minter, the legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, believes that the amendment is necessary to protect not only marriage equality but also the foundations of the republic. 'Equal protection is essential to having a democratic form of government,' Minter said. Californians have a history of rejecting civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ people, but public support for marriage rights has finally caught up with legal arguments. A year ago, the Human Rights Campaign declared a national state of emergency for LGBTQ+ Americans, but now it is widely expected that Prop. 3 will pass.

Colorado voters will decide on 14 statewide ballot measures this November. The measures include constitutional amendments and propositions that address various issues such as property tax deductions for veteran homeowners, judicial discipline, same-sex marriage, sports betting tax revenue, firearms and ammunition tax, abortion rights, education, wildlife conservation, and law enforcement training. Some of the measures have significant funding and opposition, including Amendment 79, which aims to enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution, and Proposition 127, which prohibits the hunting of bobcats, mountain lions, and lynx in Colorado. Other measures, such as Proposition 129, which creates a new mid-level role in the veterinary field, and Proposition 131, which changes Colorado's primary system to an open system, have also garnered significant attention and funding.

**Yes on Prop. 3: State should protect same-sex marriage**
Proposition 3 would make same-sex marriage a constitutional right in California, repealing the 2008 voter-approved Proposition 8. Although it would have no immediate effect due to previous U.S. Supreme Court rulings, it is essential for Californians to support it as a precaution against potential future court decisions. With the current conservative majority on the Supreme Court, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have expressed their desire to overturn precedents, including the right to same-sex marriage. By making same-sex marriage a constitutional right in California, the state can protect this right from potential future challenges. As the editorial urges, 'Vote 'yes' on Proposition 3.'

**Colorado religious leaders support constitutional amendment that scraps gay marriage ban**
A coalition of Colorado religious leaders has endorsed a ballot measure to remove language from the state Constitution banning same-sex marriage. Amendment J, which will be on the November ballot, aims to repeal a 2006 amendment that defines marriage as only between a man and woman. Despite same-sex marriage being legal in Colorado and at the federal level, state leaders worry that the Supreme Court could reverse the decision. Susy Bates, campaign director for Freedom to Marry Colorado, said, 'We are one bad decision away from overturning (Obergefell), if that happens, the 2006 ban would go into effect and marriage for LGBTQ couples would immediately be at risk.' Nearly 40 religious leaders from across the state signed a letter in support of the ballot initiative, citing their faith tradition and values. Joseph Black, senior rabbi of Temple Emmanuel in Denver, said, 'If indeed we are all created in God's image, then laws which exclude and discriminate against one's ability to express and sanctify their love and relationships violate basic principles of fairness and equality that are central to who we are.' The leaders criticized those who use religion as justification for discrimination, saying, 'These efforts stand in stark opposition to our core religious and spiritual convictions, which compel us to forge a beloved community that rejects the misinformation and rejects divisions that fuel hostility, misunderstanding, fear and hatred expressed toward gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and nonbinary persons.'

**The most intriguing ballot measures (that aren't about abortion) voters will decide in November**
Voters in 41 states will decide on over 150 ballot measures in November, covering a wide range of issues, including election reform, voting rights, minimum wage, paid sick leave, marijuana legalization, and more. Some of the most contentious topics include ranked choice voting, noncitizen voting, partisan politics, and economic issues. Matthew Schweich, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, is launching the Voter Defense Association to protect the ballot initiative process. 'What we're seeing right now is what has become the norm: A steady stream of legislatively referred ballot questions to restrict the ballot initiative process,' Schweich said. Other notable ballot measures include proposals to raise the minimum wage, provide paid sick leave, and legalize marijuana in several states. California's Prop 3 will remove a sentence banning same-sex marriage from the state constitution, while Colorado voters will decide whether to ban trophy hunting of mountain lions, bobcats, and lynxes. Education issues are also on the ballot, including a measure in Nebraska to repeal a law allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. Additionally, some proposals target the use of ballot measures themselves, with Utah's Republican-led state legislature placing a measure on the ballot to give them the power to amend or revoke initiatives once voters have approved them.

**Hawaii voters asked to ensure protection of same-sex marriage**
Hawaii voters will be asked in the November 5 general election to repeal a 1998 constitutional amendment that gave the Legislature the power to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples. The proposal, which has already been made irrelevant by a U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationally, aims to remove discriminatory language from the constitution and make it clear that Hawaii supports equal rights. Supporters, including U.S. Rep. Jill Tokuda and Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi, say passage of the new constitutional amendment would ensure protection of same-sex marriage and other rights. Opponents, however, claim it is an attempt to codify a political opinion into the state constitution and an example of political bullying by the liberal Democratic majority. 'This is an attempt to codify a political opinion into the state constitution,' wrote Cari Sasaki. 'If the opposite were being proposed, that the legislature constitutionally couldn't define marriage as anything other than one man and one woman, liberals would honestly lose their minds.' 'Marriage is between a man and a woman,' testified David Ruiz. Jeff Hong, chair of the Change 23 Coalition, said the coalition has evolved into a nonprofit Hawaii civil rights voter education fund and is urging voters to vote yes on the constitutional amendment. 'While we see a lot of positive momentum forward, the apathy of the blank vote goes against us,' said Hong. 'And we need to ensure that the voters of Hawaii realize that in this election, if you're for the initiative, you need to vote for it. Don't leave the question blank.'

**PUT TO A VOTE**
This fall, voters in 41 states will decide on over 140 ballot measures, including those on abortion, voting rights, crime, and taxes. Some measures aim to enshrine abortion rights, while others would restrict them. Republican-led legislatures have proposed amendments declaring that only citizens can vote. A California proposal would toughen punishments for repeat shoplifters and fentanyl dealers, while an Arizona measure would require life imprisonment for certain child sex trafficking convictions. Measures in several states would create open primary elections, ranked-choice voting, or impose a sales tax on firearms and ammunition. Voters in several states will also decide on recreational marijuana, same-sex marriage, and minimum wage increases. Additionally, proposals in several states aim to repeal provisions allowing 'involuntary servitude' as punishment for crime, or eliminate property taxes. 'The right to marry is a fundamental right,' a California measure declares. 'The right to marry is a fundamental right,' a California measure declares.

**From abortion rights to overhaul of state elections, voters face many choices on the ballot on Nov. 5**
Colorado voters will face 12 ballot measures on November 5, including proposals to protect abortion rights, overhaul state elections, and modify property tax relief measures. Two initiatives, 50 and 108, have been withdrawn as part of a deal with Governor Jared Polis and Democratic legislative leaders. The remaining measures include a constitutional amendment to create an exception to the right to bail for first-degree murder defendants, a proposal to repeal a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, and a statutory measure to impose a 6.5% excise tax on gun sales to fund mental health services. Other measures include a ban on trophy hunting of mountain lions, a 'truth in sentencing' law, and a 'right to school choice' law. A sweeping election reform measure would replace partisan primaries with a single 'all-candidate' primary and enact a ranked-choice voting system. 'It's necessary to protect LGBTQ rights that have been put at risk by the court's current 6-3 conservative majority,' said a supporter of the 'Freedom to Marry' amendment. 'We need to ensure that our state's laws are fair and just for all Coloradans,' said a supporter of Initiative 310, the election reform measure.

**These are all the measures set to appear on Colorado's statewide ballot in 2024**
A total of 14 measures are set to appear on Colorado's 2024 ballot, although at least two are expected to be withdrawn. The measures include a proposed constitutional amendment to create an exception to the right to bail for criminal defendants accused of first-degree murder, a measure to repeal a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, and a statutory measure to impose a 6.5% excise tax on gun sales to fund mental health services. Other measures include a proposal to protect the right to abortion, a ban on trophy hunting of mountain lions, bobcats, or lynx, and a 'truth in sentencing' measure that would make people convicted of certain violent crimes ineligible for parole until they have served at least 85% of their sentences. According to the article, 'The conservative groups sponsoring two of the measures, Initiatives 50 and 108, have agreed to pull them off the ballot as part of a deal struck with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Democratic legislative leaders.' The 12 remaining measures are slightly above the average total for an even-year election over the last 20 years, but shy of the record 14 statewide measures that appeared on Coloradans' ballots twice, in 2006 and 2008.
