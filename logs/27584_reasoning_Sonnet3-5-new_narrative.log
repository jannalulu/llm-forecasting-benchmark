Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Phil, interesting how Angola managed to avoid Clade I mpox despite being so close to DRC.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had it at 42.15%. The geographic proximity to DRC and the rapid spread through East Africa made it seem plausible, but Angola's stronger surveillance systems and border controls proved effective.

Nate: The Swedish case in August was a wake-up call. When it jumped continents, everyone expected more countries to report cases.

Philip: True, but Angola's response was remarkably robust. They implemented enhanced screening at borders after WHO's emergency declaration and focused on the DRC border regions.

Nate: [nodding] The containment in neighboring countries was impressive. Despite the outbreak in DRC and cases in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, Angola managed to keep Clade I at bay.

Philip: Sometimes the most logical predictions don't materialize. That's why we work with probabilities, not certainties.

Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Phil, our models were spot on again about Angola and Clade I mpox.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the WHO's emergency declaration in August and that first European case in Sweden, it was a critical period for forecasting.

Nate: Our models had it at 28.75%. The geographic spread from DRC to neighboring countries was concerning, but Angola's surveillance infrastructure and its relative isolation from the outbreak hotspots kept the probability modest.

Philip: Exactly. While we saw Clade I cases in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda by August, Angola's distance from the epicenter and its limited cross-border movement with DRC worked in its favor.

Nate: The Swedish case was an outlier that didn't significantly impact Angola's risk profile. Sometimes the most valuable forecasts are the ones that correctly predict what won't happen.

Philip: [nodding] And that's why we trust the numbers.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his screen] Philip, our models were spot-on again about Angola and Clade I mpox.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the WHO's emergency declaration in August and the spread pattern in Central Africa, our models had it at 32.45%.

Nate: The Swedish case in August was particularly concerning - first Clade I case outside Africa. But Angola's geographic position...

Philip: [interrupting] Exactly. While it shares borders with DRC, the limited surveillance infrastructure and historical absence of Clade I in Angola made it less likely than other neighboring countries.

Nate: The rapid spread through sexual networks in DRC's neighbors - Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda - suggested potential reach, but Angola's different travel patterns and healthcare monitoring capabilities kept our probability moderate.

Philip: Another validation of our probabilistic approach. Sometimes the most interesting outcomes are the events that don't happen.
