Let me reason through this carefully:

1. First, timing is critical - there are only 2 days left until the resolution date of September 11, 2024.

2. As of today (Sept 9, 2024), there are no scheduled presidential debates between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

3. For this to happen:
- Harris would need to be the Democratic nominee (which she isn't - Biden is)
- Trump would need to be the Republican nominee (while likely, not yet official)
- A debate would need to be scheduled and occur within the next 2 days
- Harris would need to specifically use that exact phrase

4. Given:
- Biden is the current Democratic nominee
- There's no reasonable scenario where Harris becomes the nominee in the next 2 days
- Even if she did, organizing a presidential debate takes weeks of preparation
- The timeframe of 2 days makes this virtually impossible

5. The only uncertainty here is extremely minimal and relates to truly extraordinary black swan events (like simultaneous major health events for both current candidates).

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.
