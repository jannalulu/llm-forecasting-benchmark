**Brandenburg Election Poll: SPD Closes Gap, AfD Remains Ahead**
The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the Brandenburg AfD state association as a suspected case of right-wing extremism. A new state parliament will be elected in Brandenburg on September 22. According to a representative ARD survey, 1,513 eligible voters in Brandenburg were questioned this week. The Free Voters, Greens, and Left Party are currently below five percent. The AfD and SPD are currently at a similar level, as they were five years ago at the last state election. The CDU, currently in coalition with the SPD and Greens, is at 16 percent in the latest survey, down two percentage points from last week's survey.

**Brandenburg's Landtagspräsidentin Warns of Thuringian Scenarios**
Brandenburg's Landtagspräsidentin Ulrike Liedtke (SPD) has warned voters about the potential for a difficult government formation after the upcoming state election. She said, 'I see big problems in Thuringia.' Liedtke emphasized that the ability of the state to act is the top priority. In the upcoming election on September 22, a coalition between the CDU, BSW, and SPD is considered the most likely solution. However, this coalition does not have a majority and relies on at least one vote from the Left. Liedtke sees no ability to act with a strong AfD. She hopes that voters will make a decision to secure the state's ability to act, saying, 'As citizens of our country, you can now think about who or what you want to vote for to secure this ability to act.' Liedtke criticizes the AfD's goals, saying, 'Remigration is not acceptable to me.' She advocates for finding solutions for better integration of newcomers, such as job creation. The Brandenburg Verfassungsschutz has classified the AfD's state association as a right-wing extremist suspicion. The AfD plans to start a massive deportation program and dissolve the Verfassungsschutz in its current form after the election. A recent survey by Infratest Dimap shows the AfD with 27% and the SPD with 23%. The CDU has 18%, the BSW has 15%, and the Greens have 5%. The Left has 4%, and the BVB/Freie Wähler have 3%. A study by the Bertelsmann-Stiftung suggests that the AfD could potentially gain more than a third of the seats in the Landtag with an assumed result of over a quarter of the second votes. This could lead to the AfD being able to block decisions that require a two-thirds majority, such as constitutional changes. Liedtke does not share these concerns, saying, 'I see it optimistically.' However, she also thinks that the electoral law needs to be revised, saying, 'We need to take the electoral law and probably shape it similarly to the federal level.' She also asks, 'How big should the parliament be?'

**AfD and SPD Gain Ground in Brandenburg State Election**
A recent poll by Infratest Dimap for the RBB shows that the AfD and SPD are gaining ground in the upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22. The AfD is leading with 27% of the vote, a 4% increase from the previous poll. The SPD is close behind with 23%, also a 4% increase. The CDU is in third place with 18%. The Greens are struggling to reach the 5% threshold, with 5% of the vote, and the Left and BVB/Freie Wähler are not expected to enter the parliament. Dietmar Woidke, the Minister-President of Brandenburg, is leading the SPD in the election. He has been in a coalition with the CDU and Greens, but it remains to be seen if this will continue after the election. As Woidke said, 'It's a tough competition, but we're confident that our message will resonate with the voters.'

**Brandenburg State Election: SPD Leads, but AfD Remains in First Place**
According to a recent poll by Infratest Dimap, the SPD is leading in the Brandenburg state election, but still in second place. The AfD has gained support and remains in the lead. The SPD has also gained support, but its lead as the second-placed party has not decreased. The poll was conducted on September 3-4 and involved 1207 voters in Brandenburg. If the election were held today, the AfD would receive 27% of the vote, followed by the SPD with 23%. The CDU would receive 18%, while the BSW would receive 15%. The Greens would receive 5%, and the Left and BVB/Freie Wähler would not receive enough votes to enter the parliament. However, the parties could still enter the parliament through the 'Grundmandatsklausel' rule. Ministerpräsident Dietmar Woidke has announced that he would step down if the SPD does not win the election. The voters in Brandenburg are divided on the possibility of a BSW government, with 42% in favor and 42% against. 61% are against an AfD government.

**Brandenburg State Election 2024: Everything You Need to Know**
The state parliament of Brandenburg will be elected on September 22, 2024. The election is significant as it determines the 88 members of the parliament, who in turn elect the Minister-President and make important decisions for the state. The parliament's tasks include legislation, controlling the government, and deciding on the budget. This means that the parliament decides how the government's money is spent, an important point for all citizens. To be eligible to vote, one must be a German citizen, at least 16 years old, and have a permanent residence in Brandenburg for at least a month. People with mental disabilities in full care are also eligible to vote since 2018. To vote, one must be registered in the voter register, which can be found in the voting notification sent by post. On election day, a personal ID and the voting notification are required. If you are eligible to vote but still undecided, try the Wahl-O-Mat to get an assessment of which party best represents your views. According to the latest poll in August, the AfD is leading with 24%, followed by the SPD with 20%. The CDU is third with 19%, and the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) is fourth with 17%. Compared to the 2019 election, the SPD is expected to lose significantly, while the CDU is expected to gain slightly. The BSW is expected to gain the most votes, but it was only founded in January 2024 and did not participate in the 2019 election. The top candidates for the upcoming election are: SPD - Minister-President Dietmar Woidke, CDU - [not specified], AfD - [not specified], and BSW - Sahra Wagenknecht.

**Brandenburg State Election: SPD and AfD in Close Race**
A recent survey by Infratest dimap for the ARD predicts a close race between the SPD and the AfD in the upcoming Brandenburg state election. The SPD is currently at 26% and the AfD at 27%.

'If that fails, we will wake up in a different state on September 23. And there will be those responsible. And I will take responsibility.' CDU leader Friedrich Merz has called on voters to choose a party of the political center, warning that the SPD has a responsibility to ensure stable political majorities in the future.

As Ministerpräsident Woidke said, 'It is a great day for the SPD, we are closing the gap with the AfD.'

**Brandenburg Election: New Survey Shows SPD Closing Gap with AfD**
Ten days before the Brandenburg state election, a new survey by the 'Brandenburg-Trend' of the Institute Infratest dimap on behalf of ARD shows that the SPD has gained 3 percentage points and now trails the AfD by only 1 percentage point, with 26% and 27% respectively. The Social Democrats, led by Minister-President Dietmar Woidke, have improved their position compared to the previous week's survey. The AfD remains unchanged in the polls. The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD state association as a suspected right-wing extremist organization. The survey was conducted from Monday to Wednesday of this week, with 1,513 eligible voters in Brandenburg being questioned. According to the new survey, a two-horse race between the AfD and the SPD is emerging, similar to five years ago. The CDU, currently a coalition partner of the SPD and the Greens, has 16% and has lost 2 percentage points compared to the previous week's survey. The Greens and the BVB/Freie Wähler each have 4.5%, while the Left Party has 4%. All three parties would fall below the 5% threshold, but could still enter the parliament with at least one direct mandate. The BVB/Freie Wähler have gained 1.5 points, while the Greens have lost slightly, and the Left Party has stagnated. The Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) has 13%, two points less than the previous week. According to 40% of those surveyed, the SPD should also lead the next state government, while 25% favor the CDU, and every fifth person favors the AfD. The SPD has been ruling in Brandenburg since 1990 with changing partners, and since 2019 with the CDU and the Greens. Woidke has announced that he will withdraw from state politics if the SPD does not lead in the election. The AfD has performed well in the state elections in Thuringia and Saxony, with over 30% in both cases. In Thuringia, the AfD was the strongest force. Generally, opinion polls are always associated with uncertainties. In particular, declining party bonds and increasingly short-term election decisions make it difficult for research institutes to weight the collected data. In general, surveys only reflect the opinion at the time of the survey and are not predictions of the election outcome.

**Brandenburg Election: SPD Closes Gap with AfD in New Survey**
Ten days before the Brandenburg state election, a new survey by the Infratest dimap institute for ARD shows the SPD closing the gap with the AfD, with 26% of the vote, just behind the AfD's 27%. This is an improvement of 3 percentage points for the Social Democrats under Minister-President Dietmar Woidke, unlike in the federal trend. The AfD remains unchanged in the survey. The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD's state association as a suspected right-wing extremist organization. On September 22, a new state parliament will be elected in Brandenburg.

The Greens and BVB/Freie Wähler each reach 4.5%, while the Left Party comes in at 4%. According to the survey, all three would fall below the 5% hurdle. However, due to a clause, it is possible to enter the parliament with at least one direct mandate even if the threshold is not reached. While BVB/Freie Wähler gain 1.5 points compared to the previous survey, the Greens lose slightly, and the Left Party remains stagnant. The alliance led by Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) comes in at 13%, two points lower than the previous week.

The SPD has been ruling in Brandenburg since 1990 with changing partners, and since 2019 with the CDU and Greens. Woidke has announced that he will leave politics if the SPD does not come out on top in the election. The AfD had more than 30% in the state elections in Thuringia and Saxony on September 1, with the AfD becoming the strongest force in Thuringia.

**Brandenburg Election: AfD Leads in Polls, SPD Launches New Campaign**
The upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, 2024, is expected to be a significant event in German politics. According to Alice Weidel, the leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a win for the AfD in Brandenburg would be a 'watershed moment' for the country. Weidel stated, 'What we need are new elections.' The AfD is currently leading in polls, with 27% of the vote, ahead of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) with 23%. The SPD, however, is trying to counter the AfD's momentum with a new campaign featuring a digital animation of Ministerpräsident Dietmar Woidke, which says 'Wenn Glatze, dann Woidke' ('If baldness, then Woidke'). SPD-Generalsekretär David Kolesnyk said, 'We want to show that we are not 'rechte Glatzen' (right-wing bald men), but rather 'Wenn Glatze, dann Woidke'.' The SPD is trying to appeal to younger voters and those who are not typically interested in politics, while also emphasizing the importance of not electing right-wing extremists to office.

**AfD Leads in Brandenburg State Election Polls, Weidel Hopes for 'Watershed Moment'**
The upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, 2024, is expected to be a significant event in German politics. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently leading in the polls, with 27% of the vote, according to a recent survey by Infratest dimap. AfD leader Alice Weidel hopes that a strong showing in Brandenburg will lead to a 'watershed moment' in German politics. Weidel stated, 'What we need are new elections.' If Minister-President Dietmar Woidke (SPD) loses the election, Weidel predicts that the SPD will suffer a significant setback, potentially leading to new national elections. The SPD, however, is not giving up, and has launched a new campaign featuring an animated video of Woidke's bald head, with the slogan 'Wenn Glatze, dann Woidke' (If bald, then Woidke). The campaign aims to appeal to younger voters and those who are not typically interested in politics. SPD General Secretary David Kolesnyk stated, 'We can't use right-wing extremists in government.' The AfD has been classified as a right-wing extremist group by the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.

**Brandenburg State Election: AfD Poised to Become Strongest Force**
The upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, 2024, will determine the political landscape in the state capital Potsdam. According to current polls, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) is likely to become the strongest force in the state, while the Social Democratic Party (SPD) may lose significant support. The SPD, led by Minister President Dietmar Woidke, is currently seen as the second-strongest force in the state, with around 23% of the vote. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is expected to receive around 16-18% of the vote. The Greens and Left Party may lose further support, with the Greens potentially falling below the 5% threshold. The Free Voters' Association (BVB/Freie Wähler) is also expected to play a role in the election. Woidke has announced that he will resign if the AfD wins the election, and has ruled out a coalition with the new BSW party. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the turnout and the performance of the different parties.

**Brandenburg State Election 2024: What You Need to Know**
The state election in Brandenburg, Germany will take place on September 22, 2024. The election will determine the composition of the Landtag, which will then elect the Minister-President. The current government, led by Minister-President Dietmar Woidke (SPD), has been in power for five years. To be eligible to vote, one must be at least 18 years old and have lived in Brandenburg for at least three months. Voters can choose between two candidates in each of the 44 electoral districts, and the party with the most votes in each district will receive a direct mandate. The remaining 44 seats will be allocated based on the proportional representation of the parties' votes. If a party receives more direct mandates than it is entitled to based on the proportional representation of the second votes, it will retain these 'overhang mandates.' The other parties will receive 'balance mandates' to ensure a proportional distribution of seats. A party must receive at least 5% of the second votes to be represented in the Landtag. The current leading candidates are Dietmar Woidke (SPD), Jan Redmann (CDU), and Benjamin Raschke (Bündnis 90/ Die Grünen). Robert Crumbach, the BSW leader, has stated that his party will not be a 'cheap majority provider' and will only participate in a government if they have a significant role. The election outcome is uncertain, with the AfD potentially becoming the strongest party. The current government, a coalition of SPD, CDU, and Grüne, may struggle to maintain power. Possible coalition options include a coalition between SPD, CDU, and BSW, or a coalition between SPD and Grüne. However, a coalition with the AfD has been ruled out by all established parties.

**Brandenburg's Landtagspräsidentin Warns of Thuringian Scenarios**
Brandenburg's Landtagspräsidentin Ulrike Liedtke (SPD) has warned voters about the potential for a difficult government formation after the upcoming state election. She said, 'I see big problems in Thuringia.' Liedtke emphasized that the ability of the state to act is the top priority. In the upcoming election on September 22, a coalition between the CDU, BSW, and SPD is considered the most likely solution. However, this coalition does not have a majority and relies on at least one vote from the Left. Liedtke sees no ability to act with a strong AfD. She hopes that voters will make a decision to secure the state's ability to act, saying, 'As citizens of our country, you can now think about who or what you want to vote for to secure this ability to act.' Liedtke criticizes the AfD's goals, saying, 'Remigration is not acceptable to me.' She advocates for finding solutions for better integration of newcomers, such as job creation. The Brandenburg Verfassungsschutz has classified the AfD's state association as a right-wing extremist suspicion. The AfD plans to start a massive deportation program and dissolve the Verfassungsschutz in its current form after the election. A recent survey by Infratest Dimap shows the AfD with 27% and the SPD with 23%. The CDU has 18%, the BSW has 15%, and the Greens have 5%. The Left has 4%, and the BVB/Freie Wähler have 3%. A study by the Bertelsmann-Stiftung suggests that the AfD could potentially gain more than a third of the seats in the Landtag with an assumed result of over a quarter of the second votes. This could lead to the AfD being able to block decisions that require a two-thirds majority, such as constitutional changes. Liedtke does not share these concerns, saying, 'I see it optimistically.' However, she also thinks that the electoral law needs to be revised, saying, 'We need to take the electoral law and probably shape it similarly to the federal level.' She also asks, 'How big should the parliament be?'

**Brandenburg State Election: More Voters Expected to Cast Mail-in Ballots**
Ahead of the upcoming Brandenburg state election, a higher number of voters are expected to cast their ballots by mail. According to Landeswahlleiter Josef Nußbaum, there have been 356,000 applications so far, which is approximately 17% of the 2.1 million eligible voters. This is a significant increase from the 2019 election, where 205,000 applications were made at a similar time, accounting for around 10% of eligible voters. 'I believe the trend is now clear,' said Nußbaum. The latest poll by Infratest dimap for the RBB shows the AfD with 27% and the SPD with 23%. Both parties have gained four percentage points since the April poll. The CDU is third with 18%, followed by the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) with 15% and the Greens with 5%. The Left has 4% and BVB/Freie Wähler has 3%. The election is expected to be complex, with around 500 candidates and 44 different ballot papers in the electoral districts. Voters have two votes: one for the direct candidate in their electoral district and one for the state list. The SPD, CDU, Greens, BVB/Freie Wähler, and FDP are running in all 44 electoral districts, while the AfD and Left are running in 43. 'Genauigkeit geht vor Schnelligkeit,' said Nußbaum, emphasizing the importance of accuracy over speed in the election process. 'Das wird sicherlich das Auszähl-Prozedere nicht zwingend beschleunigen,' he added, referring to the potential for manipulation of mail-in ballots. 'Es beanspruche Zeit, die Unterlagen beispielsweise noch einmal gegen das Licht zu halten.'

**AfD Leads in Brandenburg State Election Poll, SPD Trails Behind**
A recent survey in Brandenburg, Germany, ahead of the upcoming state election on September 22, shows the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party leading with 27% of the vote, while the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of incumbent Minister-President Dietmar Woidke trails behind with 23%. This is a four percentage point increase for both parties since the last survey, but the gap remains the same. Woidke has stated, 'If I lose to the AfD, I'm done,' highlighting the importance of his candidacy in the SPD's campaign. The SPD's largest advertising campaign in Brandenburg's history has not been enough to move the party forward, and they are now facing the possibility of being surpassed by the AfD for the first time in 34 years. The CDU follows in third place with 18%, while the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht party has 15%. The Greens are on the verge of clearing the 5% threshold, while the Left and Free Voters are unlikely to make it into the state parliament.

**AfD and SPD Gain Ground in Brandenburg State Election**
A recent poll by Infratest Dimap for the RBB shows that the AfD and SPD are gaining ground in the upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22. The AfD is leading with 27% of the vote, a 4% increase from the previous poll. The SPD is close behind with 23%, also a 4% increase. The CDU is in third place with 18%. The Greens are struggling to reach the 5% threshold, with 5% of the vote, and the Left and BVB/Freie Wähler are not expected to enter the parliament. Dietmar Woidke, the Minister-President of Brandenburg, is leading the SPD in the election. He has been in a coalition with the CDU and Greens, but it remains to be seen if this will continue after the election. As Woidke said, 'It's a tough competition, but we're confident that our message will resonate with the voters.'

**Brandenburg State Election: AfD Remains in the Lead, Possible Coalition Governments**
A recent survey by Infratest dimap for the ARD-Politikmagazin 'Kontraste' shows that the AfD has gained ground in the latest polls for the Brandenburg state election, remaining in the lead. The SPD has also gained popularity, but cannot close the gap as the second-placed party. According to the survey, if the election were held today, the AfD would receive 27% of the vote, the SPD 23%, the CDU 18%, and the BSW 15%. The Greens would narrowly make it into the state parliament with 5% of the vote, while the Left would fall short with 4%. A possible coalition government could be the continuation of the current Kenia-Koalition between SPD, CDU, and Greens, but with a new leader, as Minister President Dietmar Woidke has ruled out continuing in the role if the SPD comes in second. Alternatively, a coalition between SPD, CDU, and BSW could be possible, with CDU leader Jan Redmann stating that a cooperation with the BSW is conceivable. However, the BSW has stated that they are not a desired partner for either the SPD or CDU.

The CDU, led by Jan Redmann, holds third place with 18% of the vote, followed by the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) with 15%. The Greens are struggling to reach the 5% threshold, with 5% of the vote, and would likely be excluded from the state parliament. A majority of 61% of respondents are against a government coalition with the AfD, while 31% support it. The most important issues for Brandenburg voters are migration (42%), education and school (26%), and mobility and transportation (12%). Minister-President Woidke has announced that he will step down if the SPD does not win the election.

**Brandenburg State Election: SPD Leads, but AfD Remains in First Place**
According to a recent poll by Infratest Dimap, the SPD is leading in the Brandenburg state election, but still in second place. The AfD has gained support and remains in the lead. The SPD has also gained support, but its lead as the second-placed party has not decreased. The poll was conducted on September 3-4 and involved 1207 voters in Brandenburg. If the election were held today, the AfD would receive 27% of the vote, followed by the SPD with 23%. The CDU would receive 18%, while the BSW would receive 15%. The Greens would receive 5%, and the Left and BVB/Freie Wähler would not receive enough votes to enter the parliament. However, the parties could still enter the parliament through the 'Grundmandatsklausel' rule. Ministerpräsident Dietmar Woidke has announced that he would step down if the SPD does not win the election. The voters in Brandenburg are divided on the possibility of a BSW government, with 42% in favor and 42% against. 61% are against an AfD government.

The latest 'Brandenburg-Trend' poll by Infratest Dimap shows the AfD leading with 27% of the vote, followed closely by the SPD with 23%. The SPD, led by Ministerpräsident Dietmar Woidke, has gained 4% since the last poll, while the AfD has also gained 4% to reach its current lead. The CDU has lost 1% and now stands at 18%, while the BSW has lost 1% and now stands at 15%. The Grünen have lost 2% and now stand at 5%, which may not be enough to secure a seat in the Landtag. According to the poll, 42% of respondents would support a BSW government, while 42% would not. 31% would support an AfD government, while 61% would not. Woidke has announced that he will step down if the SPD does not win first place. The poll is subject to uncertainty, as declining party loyalty and short-term election decisions make it difficult to weight the data.

**AfD leads in Brandenburg state election poll**
Two weeks before the Brandenburg state election, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is leading in a recent poll, with 27% of the vote, ahead of the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Minister-President Dietmar Woidke, which has 23%. The AfD's candidate, Hans-Christoph Berndt, has improved the party's position by 4% since July. The SPD has also gained 4% in the same period. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is in third place with 16%, down 1% from July. The Left Party and the Free Voters are struggling to stay in the state parliament, with 4% and 3% of the vote respectively. The Greens are in danger of losing their seats, with 5% of the vote. According to the poll, the Greens, the Left Party, and the Free Voters may still be able to enter the state parliament if they win at least one direct mandate. Minister-President Woidke has announced that he will step down if the SPD does not win the election. The poll also found that 42% of voters support a coalition with the AfD, while 61% are opposed. The most important issues for voters are migration (42%), education (26%), transportation (12%), and healthcare (11%).

**Brandenburg Election: AfD Leads, Migration a Key Issue**
The current BrandenburgTrend survey shows that the outcome of the upcoming election in Brandenburg is more open than ever. The survey, conducted by Infratest-Dimap, found that the AfD is the strongest party with 27% of the vote, followed by the SPD with 23%. The CDU and BSW are experiencing losses, while the Greens are struggling to reach the 5% threshold. The survey also found that migration and asylum are the most important issues for many voters, with 40% naming it as their top or second-top concern. The AfD is benefiting from this shift in focus, with 97% of its supporters wanting the party to be part of the next government. However, this is not the case for other parties, with only 30% of SPD supporters and 24% of CDU supporters wanting the AfD to be part of the government. The survey was conducted among 1,207 people who are eligible to vote in Brandenburg, with a margin of error of up to 2.5%.

**Brandenburg Election: AfD Gains Ground, BSW Emerges as Dark Horse**
The current BrandenburgTrend poll shows that the outcome of the upcoming election in Brandenburg is more open than ever. The AfD has gained four points to reach 27% of the vote, while the SPD has also gained four points to reach 23%. The CDU has lost one point to reach 18%, and the BSW has lost one point to reach 15%. The Grüne have lost two points to reach 5%, and the Linke and BVB/Freie Wähler have lost four and three points respectively to reach 4% and 3%. The current coalition of SPD, CDU, and Grüne is still possible, but a narrow margin of 46% to 42% would require a high level of discipline from the coalition. The dark horse in this election is the BSW, which could potentially enter the Landtag with a result of 3-7%. The main issue for many voters is migration and flight, with 40% naming it as their most important or second-most important issue. This is a significant increase from the 15% who named it as an issue in the 2019 election. The AfD is likely to profit from this shift in values. The question of whether the AfD or BSW should be part of the next Brandenburg state government is highly polarizing, with 97% of AfD supporters wanting the party to be part of the government, while 44% of AfD supporters do not want the BSW to be part of the government.

The Left Party and the BVB/Freie Wähler are at 4% and 3% respectively, which would not be enough to enter the parliament.

**BrandenburgTrend: AfD and SPD gain ground, but gap remains**
Two and a half weeks before the elections in Brandenburg, the AfD remains the strongest party in the polls, with 27% of the vote. The SPD has gained a few percentage points, but has not been able to reduce the gap. The current BrandenburgTrend survey by infratest dimap for the ARD politics magazine Kontraste shows that the AfD has gained 4 percentage points since July, just like the SPD, which is at 23%. The CDU has lost a point and is at 18%. The Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht could expect 15% of the vote, one percentage point less than in July. The Greens have lost two points and would only just make it back into the state parliament with 5%. The Left are at 4%, BVB/Freie Wähler at 3%, just like in July. A majority of 61% of those surveyed are against the AfD participating in government, while 31% would find it acceptable. The AfD's supporters almost unanimously (97%) want the party to be involved in the next state government. 28% of BSW supporters and 14% of CDU supporters can imagine the AfD being a government party. The SPD and Greens' supporters are almost unanimous in their opposition (96 and 95%). When asked about the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht's participation in government, opinions are divided, with 42% in favor and 42% against.

**AfD leads in Brandenburg state election survey, SPD in second place**
Two weeks before the Brandenburg state election, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) has increased its support in a survey and remains in the lead with 27% of the vote, ahead of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) with 23%. The SPD has also improved significantly, but has not been able to close the gap as the second-placed party. This is according to the current 'Brandenburg Trend' survey by the Infratest dimap institute on behalf of the ARD politics magazine 'Kontraste' from RBB. The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD as a suspected right-wing extremist case, and top candidate Hans-Christoph Berndt as a right-wing extremist. On September 22, a new state parliament will be elected. For the representative RBB survey, 1207 eligible voters in Brandenburg were interviewed on September 3 and 4. It is the first survey since the state elections in Saxony and Thuringia. If the election were to take place on Sunday, the AfD would come in with 27% according to the survey. In comparison to the July survey by Infratest dimap, the party has gained four percentage points, as has the SPD, which comes in at 23% compared to the federal trend. The SPD, led by Minister President Dietmar Woidke, has been in power in the state since 1990 with changing partners, since 2019 with the CDU and the Greens. For Woidke, it's all or nothing: if the SPD does not win the election, he wants to retire from state politics. The new survey shows that the AfD and SPD are pulling away from each other. According to the new survey, the CDU has lost a point and comes in at 18%. In April, the SPD and CDU were still neck and neck. The party of top candidate Jan Redmann is now five points behind the SPD in third place. The Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW), which is running for the first time, could count on 15% of the votes, which is one point less than in the July survey. The SPD sees a duel: 'Is Dietmar Woidke leading Brandenburg further with a clear course and stability or does the AfD bring chaos?', said General Secretary David Kolesnyk. The Greens have lost two points and would only just make it back into the state parliament with 5%. In the 2019 state election, the Greens had almost 11% of the vote. The Left Party stands at 4%, the BVB/Freie Wähler at 3%. However, due to a clause, it is possible to enter the parliament with a direct mandate even if the 5% hurdle is not reached. 31% of those surveyed would find a government participation of the AfD acceptable, while a clear majority of 61% is against it. No party wants to govern with the AfD so far. In the state elections in Thuringia and Saxony, the AfD had come in at over 30% last Sunday, and in Thuringia, it became the strongest force. The government formation is very difficult there. While 28% of BSW supporters and 14% of CDU supporters can imagine the AfD as a governing party, the supporters of SPD and Greens reject it with a large majority: 96% of SPD supporters and 95% of Greens. 42% of those surveyed are in favor of a government participation of the BSW, and an equally high proportion is skeptical. The most important topics for the Brandenburgers are immigration, education, and transportation, as the survey found. For 40%, immigration and flight are at the top, for 26% education and school, and for 12% mobility and transportation. Before the last state election in 2019, mobility, education, and climate change were at the top. Election surveys are generally plagued by uncertainties. Among other things, declining party bonds and increasingly short-term election decisions make it difficult for the institutes to weight the collected data. In general, surveys only reflect the opinion at the time of the survey and are not a prediction of the election outcome.

**AfD and SPD Gain Ground in Brandenburg, but AfD Remains Strongest Party**
Two and a half weeks before the elections in Brandenburg, the AfD is still the strongest party in the polls, with 27% of the vote. The SPD has gained a few percentage points, but has not been able to close the gap. The current BrandenburgTrend by infratest dimap shows that the AfD has gained four percentage points since July, just like the SPD, which stands at 23%. The CDU has lost one point and stands at 18%. The Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht could expect 15% of the vote, one percentage point less than in July. The Greens have lost two points and would only just make it into the Landtag with 5% of the vote. 61% of those surveyed are against an AfD government participation, while 31% would support it. The AfD's supporters almost unanimously (97%) want the party to be involved in the next state government. 'A relative majority of 40% of those surveyed see the topics of flight and migration as the most important problems to be solved in Brandenburg, followed by education and school with 26%.'

**Brandenburg State Election: Key Facts and Candidates**
The Brandenburg state election will take place on September 22, 2024. Every five years, the 88 seats (up to 110 with overhang and balancing mandates) in the Brandenburg Landtag are re-elected. The members of this parliament elect the Minister-President and make important decisions for the federal state. The tasks of the Landtag include legislation, government control, and budget decisions. This means that the parliament determines how the government's money is spent - an important point for all citizens. All German citizens aged 16 and over with a permanent residence in Brandenburg for at least a month are eligible to vote. Notably, since 2018, people with intellectual disabilities in full-time care have also been able to cast their votes. To vote, you must be registered in the voter register. The necessary information can be found in the election notice, which was sent to you by post. On election day, a personal ID and the election notice will be required. According to the latest survey in August, the AfD is leading in Brandenburg with 24% followed by the SPD with 20%. It's a close field: The CDU came in at 19%, and the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) at 17%. In contrast, the picture looked different in 2019: The turnout was 61.3%. The SPD would lose significantly more votes compared to the 2019 state election, while the CDU would gain slightly more. The BSW would gain the most votes, but the party was only founded in January 2024 and did not participate in the 2019 state election. SPD: Incumbent Minister-President Dietmar Woidke will also run for the SPD this year.

**Brandenburg Election: Woidke's SPD Faces Tough Challenge from AfD**
The upcoming election in Brandenburg is heating up, with Ministerpräsident Dietmar Woidke's SPD facing a tough challenge from the AfD. Woidke has vowed to make the fight against the AfD a central theme in the campaign, saying 'we must make it clear what the AfD stands for here in Brandenburg.' The AfD has been leading in recent polls, with 24% of the vote, followed by the SPD with 20%. The CDU and the BSW are also in the running, with 19% and 17% respectively. Despite the polls, Woidke remains optimistic, saying 'we will prove in the next few weeks that the polls are wrong again.' The election is expected to be close, with the AfD potentially blocking decisions with a 'sperrminorität' if they win more than one-third of the seats in the Landtag. A study by the Bertelsmann Stiftung suggests that the AfD could win more than one-third of the seats with a quarter of the second votes. Woidke's SPD has been in power in Brandenburg since 1990, but the AfD's rise could threaten their dominance. 'We are not a protest party anymore,' said AfD leader Hans-Christoph Berndt. 'We have a strong base of supporters who vote for us out of conviction.' The BSW, led by Robert Crumbach, could also play a key role in the election, potentially forming a coalition with the SPD or CDU. 'We want to be able to act from the start,' said Crumbach. The CDU, led by Jan Redmann, is also confident, saying 'the uncompatibility decision to AfD and Linke still stands.' The Grünen and Freie Wähler are also vying for seats in the Landtag, but face an uphill battle. 'We hope to be used for a democratic government formation - also in Brandenburg,' said the Grünen. The Linke, who suffered a setback in Thüringen, is focusing on security, saying 'futures fears dominated the elections.' 'Only the Left can combat the right-wing backlash with a strong welfare state,' said Sebastian Walter.

**AfD Leads in Latest Brandenburg State Election Polls**
The latest polls for the upcoming Brandenburg state election show the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the lead with 24% of the vote, followed closely by the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) with 19% each. The Greens would have 7% of the vote, while the Left would narrowly miss the 5% threshold. The current ruling coalition of SPD, CDU, and Greens would have a total of 45% of the vote, but no majority. The newly formed alliance of Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) would have 16% of the vote. According to a survey by INSA, the AfD would be the strongest force with 25% of the vote, followed by SPD and CDU with 19% each. The Greens would have 7% of the vote, while the BSW would have 13%. The Left would have 6% of the vote, and BVB/Freie Wähler would have 5% of the vote. The FDP would have 3% of the vote.

'All parties have categorically ruled out a coalition with the AfD.'

**Brandenburg Election 2024: Woidke's Future Hangs in the Balance**
In the upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, SPD politician Dietmar Woidke is seeking to defend his position as Minister-President. If he wins, he would become the longest-serving government leader in the state since the fall of the Berlin Wall. However, a successful election for Woidke would come with a difficult coalition-building process. The AfD is a strong contender, having won the most votes in the European election in June with 27.5%. The CDU (18.4%) and the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) with 13.8% also surpassed the SPD (13.1%). Woidke has stated that he will only continue as Minister-President if the SPD wins the election. 'This is a vote of confidence in my own work,' he said. 'My goal is to defeat the AfD, and if I lose to the AfD, I'm out.' The BSW could be the big winner of the election, with polls predicting up to 17% of the vote. The AfD's top candidate is Hans-Christoph Berndt, who aims to make the AfD the strongest force in Brandenburg. 'Then we will make a claim for government and speak with others. And then we'll see if there are parties that take responsibility.' The current coalition government, consisting of SPD, Greens, and CDU, is facing a challenging election. The CDU is led by Jan Redmann, while the Greens are represented by Antje Töpfer and Benjamin Raschke. The FDP and The Left Party failed to clear the 5% threshold in the European election, with 3.2% and 4.4% respectively. The Left Party is particularly concerned about not being re-elected to the new Landtag in Potsdam.

**Brandenburg Election Poll: Greens and Left Party Struggle to Enter State Parliament**
A recent INSA poll in Brandenburg shows the Greens and Left Party struggling to enter the state parliament. The Greens have lost two percentage points in less than a month, dropping to 5%, while the Left Party remains at 5% after a similar result in July.

**AfD Leads in Brandenburg Election Polls, Despite Right-Wing Extremist Suspicions**
The AfD is currently leading in the polls for the upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22. Despite a slight decline in recent polls, the party remains confident. The Constitutional Protection Office of the state has classified the AfD as a right-wing extremist suspicion case. However, the party's top candidate, Hans-Christoph Berndt, seems unfazed, stating that the AfD has become 'really a people's party'. He also criticized the demand for a 'Brandenburg Wall' against the AfD from democratic parties, saying 'Let them keep going like that, and we'll become even stronger.' The current polls show the AfD leading with values between 23 and 24 percent. This is a decline from last year, when the AfD reached 32 percent twice. However, the polls suggest that the AfD could emerge as the strongest force in the election.
