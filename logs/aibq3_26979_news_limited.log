**Why the 2024 Hurricane Season Will Be Worse Than Expected**
The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be more active than usual, with several factors contributing to this prediction. Between August 20th and October 10th, 75% of all cyclonic activity in the Atlantic occurs. August is the month when meteorologists pay the most attention to the tropical zone. As of August 2024, the sea surface temperature is above 1.4°C above the average, providing fuel for intense hurricanes if favorable atmospheric conditions are met. The La Niña phenomenon is expected to return between late summer and early fall, which will coincide with the period of highest cyclonic activity in the Atlantic. This will lead to the formation and development of a greater number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. According to the Colorado State University's seasonal hurricane forecast, there will be 23 tropical storms, including the four that have formed so far. Of these, 12 are expected to be hurricanes, with six potentially reaching category 3, 4, or 5 (high-intensity hurricanes).

**N Atlantic's area of Extreme Ocean Heat Doubled Since 2004: Catastrophic 2024 Hurricanes Likely**
NOAA forecasts a highly active 2024 hurricane season, with a record-breaking heat content in the Atlantic Ocean. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) predicts 167% of the average accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), making it one of the most severe seasons on record. The combination of atmospheric conditions and water temperatures is already capable of supporting category 5 hurricanes across a wide area. While early season conditions may not be favorable, models show extremely favorable conditions for major hurricanes in August and September. The first storms forming from the Central American Gyre are unlikely to cause significant problems, but this is just the beginning of what could be one of the strongest hurricane seasons on record.

**The peak of hurricane season is near**
The peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean is near, with the majority of hurricane activity occurring from mid-August to mid-October. This season has been forecast to be above-average, with 25 total named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes predicted. According to Colorado State University, sea-surface temperatures have been well above-average prior to the start of the season, which is one of several factors leading to this prediction. However, the Atlantic has been quiet for the last month due to a large amount of Saharan dust that has been situated over the primary region where tropical waves develop. This dust inhibits tropical development by bringing in dry air and blocking sunlight, thereby cooling sea-surface temperatures. The season kicked off early, with 3 named storms forming in June, including Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl, and Tropical Storm Chris. Whenever the next tropical system forms, it will be named Debby.

**Hurricane Season Peak Time Begins In August**
The Atlantic hurricane season is in its peak months of August, September, and October, with 78% of storms, 84% of hurricanes, and 93% of U.S. landfalling hurricanes occurring during this time. According to NOAA, this three-month period is the most active for tropical storms and hurricanes, with a significant increase in storms and the risk of U.S. landfalls. The recent peak months have seen some of the most powerful and destructive hurricanes, such as Hurricane Ian, which struck Florida in 2022. The 10 most active hurricane seasons in the satellite era have generated roughly two more storms, two to three more hurricanes, and one to two Category 3 or stronger hurricanes than usual in the peak months. Several factors contribute to the seasonal ramp-up, including African easterly waves, surges of dry air, low wind shear, and rising sea-surface temperatures. It is essential to have a hurricane plan ready and to pay attention to the forecast every day through the rest of the season, as hurricane season can quickly switch from quiet to active. 'Averages are no guarantee of how a hurricane season will turn out,' but in a season expected to be very active like 2024, it signals potential danger ahead. 'Make sure you have your hurricane plan ready to go,' and 'pay attention to the forecast every day through the rest of the season.'

**Hurricane season ramps back up as Saharan dust effects subside. Here's what to know**
The effects of Saharan dust on the Atlantic hurricane season have subsided, allowing for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season to ramp back up. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is tracking an 'area of disturbed weather' from the Leeward Islands to Florida, which has a 50% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next seven days. Forecasters predict a busy hurricane season, with Colorado State University increasing its number of named storms to 25. The Atlantic hurricane season typically peaks in early August and remains active through mid to late October. Floridians should be prepared for a potentially long and trying few months.

**MS Coast watches the tropics as Saharan dust clears, door opens for hurricane activity**
The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to pick up again after a few calm weeks, with the National Hurricane Center monitoring an area of disturbed weather in the central tropical Atlantic. The disturbance has a 20% chance of development over the next seven days. Weather forecasters say that the dry spell caused by Saharan dust is ending, and rising air is improving conditions for tropical activity. Hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with peak activity from mid-August to mid-October. The 2024 season has already seen a record-breaking start with Hurricane Beryl, and forecasters predict an 85% chance of an above-average hurricane season.

**Hurricane Season to Return in August, Predicts National Hurricane Center**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) predicts that the hurricane season will return in August due to changes in climate patterns caused by a Saharan air layer. The Atlantic has been calm for over two weeks, with no significant cyclonic activity. However, experts warn that this calm may not last long, as changes in climate patterns are expected in early August. The presence of this Saharan air layer (SAL) reduces atmospheric humidity by approximately 50%, making it difficult for clouds and thunderstorms to form, which are crucial for tropical cyclone development. The NHC does not expect the formation of new tropical storms or hurricanes in the Atlantic in the next week. As we approach August, conditions in the Atlantic tropical area are expected to become more favorable for cyclone development. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is expected to create an environment more conducive to storm development. The MJO is a phenomenon that moves eastward, affecting areas near the equator and subtropics. During the summer and fall, it can increase hurricane activity in regions with more precipitation and decrease it in areas with descending air. Models indicate that a zone of improved precipitation associated with the MJO will move over the Atlantic tropical area in early August. Although the current calm is not unusual for late July, cyclonic activity generally increases significantly in August and September. During these months, ocean temperatures are warmer, wind shear is lower, and there is less Saharan dust, conditions that favor storm development. Bryan Norcross, a hurricane expert at FOX Weather, notes: 'Tropical development typically accelerates in the second week of August. The peak date for cyclonic activity is around September 10, although the probability of storm formation increases rapidly in the weeks prior and decreases slowly during the rest of September and October'. More than 90% of hurricane activity typically occurs between August and the end of the season, according to the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, which measures the intensity and duration of all named storms throughout the season.

**Hurricane Beryl breaks records**
Hurricane Beryl has broken records as the earliest calendar year Atlantic Category 5 hurricane, surpassing the prior record held by Hurricane Emily in July 2005. The storm formed in the West African coast and passed 40 miles southwest of Grand Cayman as a Category 4 hurricane. At least 10 people were killed as Beryl made its way through the Caribbean. The Atlantic has generated the most Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) on record through July 3, breaking the old record set in 1886. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has already surpassed 30 ACE, the fastest an Atlantic hurricane season has reached this milestone. Forecasters have projected an 'extremely active' hurricane season, calling for as many as 23 named storms.

**2024 Hurricane Season in Mexico: What to Expect**
The 2024 hurricane season in Mexico has officially begun, with predictions of 15 to 18 tropical cyclones in the Pacific Ocean and 20 to 23 in the Atlantic Ocean. At least five of these storms are expected to impact Mexico. According to the National Water Commission (Conagua) and the National Meteorological Service (SMN), the season is expected to be potentially impactful. The Pacific Ocean is expected to be more active than normal, with a 50% chance of 14 tropical cyclones, while the Atlantic Ocean is expected to be normal to 10% above average, with 15 systems. In the Pacific, 8 to 9 tropical storms, 4 to 5 low-intensity hurricanes (category 1 or 2), and 3 to 4 major hurricanes (category 3 to 5) are expected. In the Atlantic, 11 to 12 tropical storms, 5 to 6 low- to medium-intensity hurricanes (category 1 or 2), and 4 to 5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4, or 5) are expected. It is important to note that not all of these storms will directly impact Mexico, and at least five are expected to affect the country. The season will end on November 30, with a peak in August and October. It is essential to stay informed and prepared, including creating emergency plans, identifying evacuation routes, and preparing essential supplies such as water, non-perishable food, and medications.

**Why the 2024 Hurricane Season Will Be More Active**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has warned that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be more intense and active than usual due to a 'confluence of factors' that favor the formation of storms. The forecast predicts 13 cyclones, 7 of which could be major hurricanes. Additionally, 17 to 25 storms with sustained winds over 62 km/h could form. NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad emphasized that the forecast for named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes is the highest ever issued for May. The early arrival of Hurricane 'Beryl' is a sign of the extreme heat generated by climate change, which has caused meteorological disasters worldwide.

**NOAA Predicts 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season to be One of the Most Intense on Record**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be one of the most intense on record, with over 20 tropical storms expected in the next five months. The season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, has an 85% chance of being more active than usual. NOAA expects 17 to 25 named storms, a record in the organization's 154-year history. Of these, 8 to 13 are expected to become hurricanes with winds of 74 mph or more, and 4 to 7 could reach major hurricane categories, including categories 3, 4, or 5 with winds of 111 mph or more. The main causes of this high activity include the La Niña phenomenon and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. According to NOAA scientists, the transition from El Niño to La Niña favors the development of cyclones. Other factors include reduced trade winds and less wind shear, which facilitate the formation and strengthening of storms. Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, said, 'There are reasons to be concerned, but not alarmed. Yes, it's the highest number, but it's about being prepared. So, now is the time to be prepared.'
