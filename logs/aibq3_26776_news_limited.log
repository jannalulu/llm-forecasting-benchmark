**DC region heat intensifies air quality concerns for at-risk groups**
The DC region's heat and humidity can be dangerous for people with cardiovascular, lung diseases, and asthma. The American Lung Association recommends checking the Air Quality Index (AQI) daily to find out when air pollution is dangerous. The AQI tracks ozone and particle pollution and divides air pollution levels into six categories, each with a specific name, color, and health advice. A pulmonologist from the American Lung Association spoke to FOX 5 about the local dangers for at-risk groups, stating that the combination of being in a metro area and hot, muggy summer days can be tough on patients with underlying lung diseases. The doctor also mentioned that climate change is affecting people's breathing quality and exposure to the sun and heat exhaustion. The article provides air pollution safety tips and advises people to be aware of their health and take steps to protect themselves, especially those who are at higher risk from air pollution.

**Hazy days: Valley's air quality much worse than larger metropolitan cities**
The air quality in the Rio Grande Valley has been unhealthy for sensitive groups and the general public, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) ranging from 149 to 157. This is worse than larger metropolitan cities like New York City and Los Angeles, which have AQIs of 44 and 140, respectively. The poor air quality is attributed to agricultural fires in Mexico, which are expected to end this month. The exposure to outdoor air pollution is responsible for 4 million premature deaths worldwide, and unhealthy air quality can lead to hospitalization or even death.

**Philly area under Heat Advisory, with heat index values up to 103; Code Orange declared due to poor air quality**
The National Weather Service has warned that hot temperatures and high humidity may cause heat illnesses in the Philly area. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has declared a Code Orange Air Quality Action Day for Ozone in the region, citing mostly sunny skies, high temperatures in the mid- to upper-90s, and light southwest winds. According to the department, ozone is formed from burning fossil fuels, and the region's high levels of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, combined with sunlight, are contributing to the poor air quality. As the department stated, 'The high temperatures and humidity may cause heat illnesses, and the poor air quality may exacerbate respiratory issues.'

**Smoke still blowing into Yakima Valley from nearby wildfires, causing poor air quality**
Air quality in Yakima, Washington has reached unhealthy levels due to wildfire smoke from nearby fires. The Air Quality Index (AQI) was 151 as of 4 p.m. Saturday, according to the State Department of Ecology's website. The National Weather Service has issued an air quality alert, warning of PM2.5 pollution, which can irritate the eyes and nose and aggravate heart and lung disease. The alert recommends limiting time outside and avoiding strenuous activity, particularly for sensitive groups. Meteorologist Wade Earle explained that winds can vary, but typically blow from the northwest later in the day, bringing in smoke from the fires. As long as the fires continue to burn, poor air quality and smoke could persist. State regulations require employers to provide N95 respirators or masks to outdoor workers when the AQI is above 101.

**Code Orange Air Quality alert issued for Philly area Monday impacting those with respiratory issues**
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has issued a Code Orange Air Quality Action Day for Monday, July 15, in the Philadelphia area due to high ozone levels. The DEP warns that ozone pollution is most common in densely populated areas with higher amounts of car exhaust and industrial air emissions. The EPA's Air Quality Index (AQI) has standardized color codes for forecasting and reporting daily air quality, with Code Orange representing unhealthy pollution levels for sensitive groups of people. The DEP advises young children, the elderly, and those with respiratory problems to limit outdoor activities on Code Orange Air Quality Action Days. To reduce ozone pollution, residents are encouraged to drive less, combine errands, limit engine idling, refuel cars and trucks after dusk, and conserve electricity.

**What to know about air quality in NYC**
New York City's air quality suffers during summer due to high temperatures and humidity, leading to poor air quality and respiratory issues. Air quality alerts are issued when the Air Quality Index (AQI) value exceeds 100. While pollution from urban life is a major contributor, wind patterns can also transport smoke from wildfires thousands of miles away, as seen in June 2023 when smoke from Quebec wildfires reached NYC. Thankfully, this year's fire season has been relatively tame, with more precipitation in typical source regions, making it unlikely to see another hazardous air quality day like June 7, 2023.
