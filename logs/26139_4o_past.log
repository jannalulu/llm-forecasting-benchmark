To forecast whether Kalenjin athletes will win both the men's and women's marathon races at the 2024 Paris Olympics, I will follow a structured analysis process:

1. **Historical Reference Class**:
   - Historically, Kalenjin athletes have been dominant in long-distance running, particularly marathons. Kenya, largely represented by Kalenjin runners, has been highly successful in Olympic marathons.

2. **Base Rates**:
   - From the 1960s to the 2020s, Kenyan athletes have frequently secured victories in marathons at various competitive levels. Prominent Kalenjin athletes like Eliud Kipchoge have been multiple-time winners of major marathons, including the Olympics (2021).
   - Analyzing previous Olympic performances, Kenyan male and female athletes have consistently secured podium finishes.

3. **Current Context and Trends**:
   - Eliud Kipchoge is noted as aiming for his third consecutive Olympic marathon win. This indicates that he is a key contender for the men's race given his previous track record and dominance.
   - For the women's marathon, the article mentions Peres Jepchirchir, a Kenyan athlete with significant competitive success. However, her specific ethnic roots aren't detailed, but Kalenjin dominance in women's long-distance running is well known.

4. **Distinctive Features of Current Situation**:
   - No specific injuries or major performance declines for leading Kalenjin runners are reported. Both Eliud Kipchoge and noted Kenyan female runners are expected to be strong contenders.

5. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**:
   - Inside View: Strong individual performances by known Kalenjin athletes like Kipchoge.
   - Outside View: Kenya’s historical dominance in marathons, often represented by Kalenjin athletes.

6. **Over- and Underreaction to Evidence**:
   - The dominance of Kalenjin athletes in past events suggests a high probability of victory, yet the inherent unpredictability of sports and potential for upsets should moderate overconfidence.

7. **Probability of Both Events Occurring**:
   - The need for both races to be won by Kalenjin athletes is a conjunctive event, typically less probable than either individual event. Historical patterns and current competitive standings do provide a solid basis for a high probability, but not certainty.

Combining these factors, the likelihood that Kalenjin athletes will win both marathon events is high but not absolute due to potential competition and the conjunctive nature of the question that both events need to occur.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 85.00%, but 72.50% being the most likely. Probability: 72.50%.

To forecast whether Kalenjin athletes will win both the men's and women's marathon races at the 2024 Paris Olympics, I'll analyze this question by leveraging both base rates and current information.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: Historically, Kalenjin athletes from Kenya, particularly the Nandi sub-group, have been dominant in long-distance running, especially marathons. Examples include Eliud Kipchoge in men's marathons and notable Kenyan female marathoners like Peres Jepchirchir.

2. **Current Context and Contenders**: Eliud Kipchoge is a major contender in the men's marathon and represents the ethnic Kalenjin group. In the women's marathon, Peres Jepchirchir is a strong contender. However, competition from other athletes like Tigst Assefa from Ethiopia is worth considering.

3. **Competing Factors**: It's crucial to acknowledge that although Kalenjin athletes are historically successful, this is an Olympic event with strong international competitors. The pressure and variability of one-off Olympic events also introduce uncertainties.

4. **News Search for Current Events**: I don't need to search further than the provided articles. They indicate that the world-class competitors mentioned above are contending. There are no evident news reports of injuries or factors likely to impact their Olympic performance negatively.

5. **Probable Scenarios**:
   - Scenario A: Kalenjin athletes win both marathons. Given historical data and current talent, it is plausible.
   - Scenario B: One wins, the other does not. This is also a realistic possibility with strong competitors in both fields.
   - Scenario C: Neither wins. Given the current competition landscape, it's less likely but not impossible.

Weighing these scenarios, considering base rates, historical success, and current competition, I traverse competing views and mitigate biases by diversifying potential outcomes without over-reaction to elite dominance or dismissing globalization in sports.

Considering the above details and drawing from superforecasting principles, a reasonable probability would be informed by these multiple factors competing and collaborating:
- High historical dominance of Kalenjin athletes.
- The contemporary competitive landscape.
- The unpredictability of Olympic outcomes.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast whether Kalenjin athletes will win both the men's and women's marathon races at the 2024 Paris Olympics, let's consider several key points. 

1. **Historical Performance (Base Rates):**
   The Kalenjin ethnic group, primarily found in Kenya, has a remarkable history in long-distance running. Historically, athletes from this group have dominated marathon events. For instance, Eliud Kipchoge, a famous Kalenjin, has won multiple Olympic and World Championship marathons. Similarly, many past Olympic marathons have been won by athletes from this group.

2. **Current Trends and Competitors:**
   Eliud Kipchoge is one of the Kalenjin athletes expected to compete in the men's marathon in Paris 2024. He has been a dominant force in marathon running. However, the competition features strong athletes from other countries. Additionally, the women's marathon often sees strong competitors from Ethiopia and other nations.

3. **Specific Criteria for This Event:**
   For the prediction to resolve as "Yes," Kalenjin athletes must win both the men's and women's marathons. This simultaneously increases the difficulty of achieving a "Yes" resolution, as both individual performances are needed.

4. **Adjustments for Current Context:**
   Considering no significant disruptors like recent injuries or other factors affecting Kalenjin athletes have been reported, the high base rate of success should not be overly adjusted downward. However, given the high level of competition from other countries, it’s prudent to remain cautious about overconfidence.

5. **Error Balancing:**
   Since other competitors may pose significant threats, it is wise to maintain a balanced prediction that acknowledges both the historical dominance of Kalenjin athletes in long-distance running and the factors of competition and unpredictability in the Olympic Games.

Based on the above analysis, the probability of Kalenjin athletes winning both the men's and women's marathon races at the 2024 Paris Olympics is moderately high but not overwhelmingly so, taking into account both historical performances and current competition.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To forecast whether Kalenjin athletes will win both the men's and women's marathon races at the 2024 Paris Olympics, we need to evaluate the performance, history, and current form of Kalenjin athletes in marathon races.

**Reference Class:** Historically, Kalenjin athletes from Kenya have been dominant in long-distance running, especially marathons. Prominent athletes like Eliud Kipchoge, a Kalenjin, have been highly successful in the past Olympics. This dominance provides a strong baseline indicating a high probability of a Kalenjin winning a marathon event.

**Latest News:** The articles do not provide specific information regarding the participation or performance expectations of Kalenjin athletes for the 2024 Paris Olympics marathon events. However, we know that their participation is highly likely given the track record of Kenyan athletes in marathons.

**Key Factors to Consider:**
1. **Historical Performance:** Kalenjin athletes have a strong history in marathon events, often securing wins.
2. **Current Form:** Eliud Kipchoge, who is aiming for a third consecutive Olympic marathon victory, is mentioned as a prominent athlete to watch in the Paris Olympics. His participation significantly raises the probability of a Kalenjin winning at least the men's marathon.
3. **Competitor Quality:** The articles do not suggest that any non-Kalenjin athletes have emerged with better prospects, which maintains Kalenjin athletes' authoritative position.
4. **Resolution Criteria:** Both men's and women's events must be won by Kalenjin athletes for a "Yes" resolution. While chances in the men's marathon are high, the probability drops when considering the need for a double win including the women's event.

**Balancing the Evidence:** Given the strength of the historical and individual dominance in men's marathon events, the probability for Kalenjin athletes to win both events is primarily constrained by women's performance, considering there's usually a broader competitive field in women's marathon races.

**Inference:**
- The probability of Kalenjin winning the men's marathon is high due to participants like Kipchoge.
- The combined probability for both events necessitates substantial Kalenjin dominance across genders, which though plausible, is less certain.

**Forecast Range:** Combining these evaluations, the final prediction should account both for the uncertainty of the women's side and the strong chance on the men's side. 

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

For example, Eliud Kipchoge, a Kalenjin, is a multiple-time Olympic marathon gold medalist and world record holder.

2. **Recent Performances**: Eliud Kipchoge has set a target to win his third consecutive Olympic marathon. The presence of multiple Kalenjin athletes in both men's and women's marathon fields enhances their chances based on past dominant performances.

3. **Requirements for "Yes" Resolution**: The resolution criteria require winnings in both men's and women's categories. Historically, Kalenjin men are more dominant than Kalenjin women in marathon events. However, this does not diminish the potential for a successful campaign in the women's category given the depth of talent.

### Current Evidence and Latest News:
1. **Participants and Preparation**: There is no explicit mention in the sources about specific Kalenjin women likely to win. However, athletes like Peres Jepchirchir are notable competitors and are expected to contend for gold.

2. **Overall Competitiveness**: The competition includes strong runners from Ethiopia and other countries. While Kenya, and especially Kalenjin runners, are favored, offsetting factors include international competitors (e.g., from Ethiopia), who have also shown strong performances.

### Reference Forecasts:
While no specific prediction markets are provided, historically, betting markets and expert analyses often favor top Kenyan runners in such predictive outcomes.

### Superforecasting Principles Applied:
- **Reference Class Forecasting**: Base rates suggest strong historical dominance by Kalenjin athletes in Olympic marathon events.
- **Inside-Outside View**: The outside view heavily favors Kalenjin runners, while the inside view would evaluate current performance metrics and athlete conditions.

2. **Recent Performances**: Eliud Kipchoge has set a target to win his third consecutive Olympic marathon. The presence of multiple Kalenjin athletes in both men's and women's marathon fields enhances their chances based on past dominant performances.

3. **Requirements for "Yes" Resolution**: The resolution criteria require winnings in both men's and women's categories. Historically, Kalenjin men are more dominant than Kalenjin women in marathon events. However, this does not diminish the potential for a successful campaign in the women's category given the depth of talent.

### Current Evidence and Latest News:
1. **Participants and Preparation**: There is no explicit mention in the sources about specific Kalenjin women likely to win. However, athletes like Peres Jepchirchir are notable competitors and are expected to contend for gold.

2. **Overall Competitiveness**: The competition includes strong runners from Ethiopia and other countries. While Kenya, and especially Kalenjin runners, are favored, offsetting factors include international competitors (e.g., from Ethiopia), who have also shown strong performances.

### Reference Forecasts:
While no specific prediction markets are provided, historically, betting markets and expert analyses often favor top Kenyan runners in such predictive outcomes.

### Superforecasting Principles Applied:
- **Reference Class Forecasting**: Base rates suggest strong historical dominance by Kalenjin athletes in Olympic marathon events.
- **Inside-Outside View**: The outside view heavily favors Kalenjin runners, while the inside view would evaluate current performance metrics and athlete conditions.
- **Balanced Reaction to Current Observations and Historical Data**: Current health and preparation of athletes like Kipchoge are positive indicators but are balanced against emerging competition.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, Kalenjin athletes are highly likely to win at least one of the marathon races, and the conditions favor a strong chance of a double victory.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.
