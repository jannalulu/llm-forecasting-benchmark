**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Exceed Expectations Despite Price Cuts and Incentives**
Tesla reported a 4.8% decrease in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, exceeding expectations due to price cuts and incentives. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, beating the average analyst estimate of 438,019. Tesla's stock rose 4.5% in pre-market trading. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, expects an increase in deliveries in 2024 compared to last year, despite Wall Street's expectations of a decline due to low demand and high interest rates. Tesla's deliveries have been impacted by price cuts and incentives, as well as a shift in focus towards profitability over growth. The company has abandoned its goal of delivering 20 million vehicles per year by 2030, citing a more conservative growth outlook.

**RBC Predicts Tesla Will Fall Short of Q2 Delivery Estimates by Around 4%**
Analysts at RBC Capital have revised their delivery estimates for the second quarter of 2024 for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), indicating that the company may not meet the average analyst expectations. Based on vehicle registration data and mobile app download numbers, RBC estimates that Tesla will deliver around 410,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, which is a 23% decrease from the initial estimate of 533,000 and 4.3% lower than the average estimate. The RBC analysts use vehicle registration data from Europe (ACEA), China (CPCA), and the US (Motor Intelligence) as their main source of data. They expect a 2.5% decrease in deliveries in the US, a 26.7% increase in China, and a 19.4% decrease in Europe. An alternative analysis method that examines mobile app download trends predicts around 393,000 deliveries. Despite these short-term revised numbers, RBC continues to recommend Tesla as a strong investment option, citing key factors such as accelerating demand for electric vehicles worldwide and Tesla's leadership in the electric vehicle market.

**RBC Predicts Tesla Deliveries Will Fall Short of Expectations in Q2**
RBC Capital analysts have revised their delivery estimates for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) for the second quarter, predicting a 4% decrease from market average expectations. Based on vehicle registration data and mobile app download numbers, RBC estimates Tesla will deliver 410,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, a 23% decrease from their previous estimate of 533,000 and 4.3% below the market average. The main method of prediction uses vehicle registration data, which suggests around 411,000 deliveries. 'We base our method on monthly vehicle registration data from Europe (ACEA) and China (CPCA), which we consider reliable, and monthly vehicle registration data from the US (Motor Intelligence), which tends to be less precise,' said analysts. They expect a -2.5% decline in US deliveries compared to the previous quarter, a +26.7% increase in China deliveries compared to the previous quarter, and a -19.4% decline in European deliveries compared to the previous quarter. Their other method, examining mobile app download data, indicates around 393,000 deliveries. Despite these revised short-term projections, RBC continues to recommend Tesla as a solid investment, citing several positive factors: 'Global demand for electric vehicles is increasing,' notes the bank in its investment report. Analysts also mention that Tesla is a benchmark in the electric vehicle sector and believe there is strong demand for Tesla's products, even as competition increases in the electric vehicle market. Additionally, they highlight Tesla's financial advantages and potential for sustained growth in areas such as energy production, storage, software development, and artificial intelligence as reasons to look favorably at the company's future.

**Tesla's push at Giga Shanghai 'indicates' good things out of China**
Tesla's Giga Shanghai production plant in China is running at full capacity, indicating stronger demand for vehicles. Analysts at Barclays believe this increased production capacity points to higher demand, which could lead to higher delivery levels in the second half of 2024. Tesla has delivered 830,766 cars in the first half of the year, putting it on pace for 1.6 million deliveries in 2024, a decline from 2023's 1.81 million deliveries. The company has noted that the development of its next-gen platform may lead to a lower growth rate in 2024 compared to 2023.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Strong, But What's To Come?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries were strong, but the company is still facing an electric vehicle (EV) demand problem. Despite a 42% one-month rally, Tesla's production and deliveries are set to decline in 2024. The company needs to report strong sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 to ease concerns. Energy storage was a bright spot, with a record 9.4 GWh in deployments, but its contribution to revenue and gross profit is not yet significant enough to drive a meaningful EPS beat. Tesla's margins are still under pressure, with automotive operating margin dropping to 5.5% in Q1 2024, and the company has provided no concrete guidance on how far margins will decline.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Surprised, But Was Stock's 10% Rally Justified?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries exceeded expectations, with 443,956 vehicles sold, a 15% increase from Q1 2024. Despite this, the stock price rose only 10% due to various factors affecting demand, including high interest rates, competition, and a rising inventory of unsold vehicles. Tesla's Q2 production was 410,831 vehicles, a 7.5% decrease from deliveries. The company's global vehicle inventory, measured in days of supply, rose to 28 days in Q1 2024, but is likely to decline in Q2. The average price of Tesla vehicles dropped to under $45,000 in Q1 2024, and gross margins decreased by 200 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. The company reduced prices by $2,000 for three models, including the Model Y, Models X, and S. Tesla's stock has seen little change over the past three years, while the S&P 500 has increased by 45%. The company's valuation is estimated at $177 per share, 20% below the current market price.

**Elon Musk Threatens to Destroy Bill Gates if He Bets Against Tesla**
Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, threatened to destroy Bill Gates if he bets against the electric vehicle manufacturer. Musk believes that Tesla's production of robots will increase its value to $30 trillion. He also mentioned that when Tesla solves the autonomy issue and starts mass-producing its Optimus robot, anyone who still has a short position will be destroyed, including Gates. The feud between Musk and Gates started in 2022 when Musk refused to support Gates' philanthropic project after leaked messages showed that Gates had bet $500 million against Tesla's stock price falling. Musk stated that he cannot take Gates' philanthropic efforts on climate change seriously when he has a large short position against Tesla, the company that is doing the most to address climate change. Tesla recently released its preliminary data for the 2nd quarter of 2024, showing a 14.8% increase in deliveries and a 4.8% decrease in sales compared to the same period last year. The company's stock price has been affected, and it has fallen 50 positions in the S&P 500 ranking and 50 positions in the reputation ranking in the US market in 2023, according to Axios. However, Tesla announced the production of a new robotaxi model in April and expects an increase in sales with the launch of low-cost models in 2025. The company's market capitalization has reached $100 billion in recent days.

**Tesla Reverses Losses in 2024: How You Can Still Profit**
Tesla's stock has reversed its losses in 2024, surpassing market expectations after the company reported strong delivery numbers for the second quarter. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding analyst estimates and showing a 14.8% increase in deliveries compared to the previous quarter. This positive report has boosted investor confidence, with the stock rising 0.16% year-to-date. Despite a 4.8% year-over-year decline in global sales, the strong second-quarter results suggest that Tesla is overcoming ongoing challenges in the electric vehicle market. The company will need to continue to navigate these challenges and maintain its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle landscape. However, the solid delivery report is a positive sign for Tesla and its investors, marking a potential turning point for the company's stock in 2024.

**Tesla's Q2 deliveries beat estimates, but leave 2024 in question**
Tesla reported 443,956 electric vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, exceeding Wall Street estimates and indicating improved demand. Analysts at Wells Fargo attribute the result to recent financing and leasing promotions, but note that the pace still implies a decline in deliveries for 2024, with a potential 8% drop from 2023's 1.8 million. Despite this, the analysts retained an 'Underweight' rating for the stock.

**Tesla Reports Decline in Vehicle Deliveries Despite Stock Price Increase**
Tesla, despite a significant increase in its stock price, has reported a decline in its vehicle deliveries. According to the company's quarterly report, Tesla produced 410,831 vehicles and delivered 443,956 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024. This is a decrease of 4.8% compared to the same period last year, but an increase of 14.8% compared to the first quarter. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver around 439,000 vehicles in the second quarter. Tesla's delivery numbers are closely tied to its sales figures, and the company groups its deliveries into two categories: Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and other vehicles. The company's current product lineup includes popular models such as the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, and new Cybertruck pickup, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan. Tesla had previously reported an 8.5% decline in its first-quarter deliveries, which was the first annual decline since 2020. The company attributed the decline in sales to temporary factory closures in response to a sabotage attack on its German factory, as well as supply chain disruptions caused by conflicts in the Middle East. Tesla's stock price has risen by around 10% following the release of its production and delivery figures, and its market value is currently around $724.65 billion.

**Tesla Reports Decline in Deliveries for Second Consecutive Quarter**
Tesla reported a decline in its deliveries for the second consecutive quarter, with a 8% decrease compared to the same period last year. The company attributed this decline to the early stages of production of the Model 3 at the Fremont factory and the closure of factories due to shipping disruptions caused by the conflict in Ukraine and the intentional fire at the Gigafactory in Berlin. Tesla also increased the price of its Model Y in the US by $1000 in April, but it's unclear if this will affect the company's financial results for the second quarter. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, previously announced that a low-cost electric car should be available by the second half of 2025, which may impact sales growth this year.

**Tesla Surprises with Lower Than Expected Delivery Numbers**
Tesla's delivery numbers have surprised analysts, with a 5% decrease in the second quarter, lower than expected. This led to a 10% increase in the company's stock price, the highest in almost half a year. Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in the last three months, a 4.8% decrease from 2023, but a 14.8% increase from the first quarter. According to Reuters, Tesla has been slow to update its vehicle lineup, while rivals in China have launched new and affordable models, which has affected demand. Tesla has upgraded its S, X, and 3 models, but only in terms of performance and design, and not in terms of features. The Model Y, the best-selling model, has not been updated and lacks features such as a screen at the back and other upgrades available on the Model 3.

**Tesla's Second Quarter Deliveries Exceed Expectations**
Tesla announced that its vehicle deliveries in the second quarter exceeded Wall Street's expectations, attributing the success to recent price reductions and incentives that stimulated customer demand. The company's stock price rose 4.5% in pre-market trading after the announcement, reversing a 15.5% decline since the start of the year. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a total of 422,405 units of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, as well as 21,551 units of its other models, including the Model S sedan, Cybertruck, and premium Model X SUV. The electric vehicle manufacturer also reported that it produced 410,831 vehicles during the April-June period. Overall, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles to customers in the three months ended June 30. This number represents a 4.8% decline from the same period last year, but a 14.8% increase from the first quarter of 2024. Analysts had projected that Tesla would deliver 438,019 vehicles in the quarter, according to a survey of 12 analysts from LSEG. The increase in deliveries suggests that Tesla's strategy of stimulating sales through price adjustments is having a tangible impact on its performance. The company's ability to exceed delivery estimates may serve as a positive signal to investors and the market as it continues to navigate the competitive and rapidly evolving electric vehicle landscape.

**Tesla and Rivian's Q2 2024 Vehicle Delivery Numbers Boost Stock Prices**
Tesla and Rivian's second-quarter 2024 vehicle delivery numbers have a positive impact on their stock prices. Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding the expected 432,859 and market expectations of around 438,000. Rivian also announced higher-than-expected delivery numbers, surpassing analyst predictions and initial estimates. Market experts expect a positive reaction today for Tesla and Rivian's stocks. Tesla's recent Model 3 update is considered a key factor contributing to the impressive delivery statistics. However, Tesla's production for the second quarter, at 410,831, did not meet the expected 478,015. Rivian delivered 13,790 vehicles in the second quarter, exceeding the 11,550 expected and market consensus. The 9,612 vehicles produced by Rivian in the second quarter also surpassed the 9,240 expected. Additionally, Rivian confirmed its goal of producing 57,000 vehicles for the entire 2024 year, in line with expectations. In summary, analysts consider the good vehicle delivery results beneficial for Tesla and Rivian's stock prices.

The company's price cuts and incentives helped stimulate demand, leading to a 10% rally in shares. Analysts had expected 438,019 vehicles to be delivered. Despite a 17% decline in China sales, better-than-expected sales in China and the US helped Tesla deliver stronger-than-expected results. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has said he expects the company to increase deliveries in 2024, but Wall Street largely expects a drop due to poor sentiment around electric vehicles and high interest rates.

**Tesla Announces Less Severe Decline in Deliveries Than Expected**
Tesla announced a 4.8% decrease in vehicle deliveries over the past year, with a decline in demand for its older models due to increased competition from Chinese automakers. Despite this, the company delivered more vehicles than expected, with 443,956 units compared to a consensus of 438,019 (-6%). Tesla's stock gained over 5% in pre-market trading in New York. The company had previously warned of a slowdown in demand and a significant decline in deliveries in 2024, following a rapid growth period in recent years. In the first quarter, Tesla's deliveries had declined for the first time in nearly four years.

**Tesla Q2 Deliveries 'The Appetizer To The Main Event': Analyst Says 'Worst In The Rearview Mirror' Ahead Of Robotaxi Day**
Tesla's second-quarter deliveries have beaten consensus estimates, with 443,956 vehicles delivered, compared to a Street consensus estimate of 437,800. Analysts and investors are optimistic about the company's future, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives saying that the worst is behind Tesla and that the company's delivery results will be 'music to the ears of the bulls' ahead of the second half of 2024. Ives maintains an Outperform rating on Tesla with a $275 price target. The company's energy storage deployment was also a highlight, with 9.4 GWh deployed in the second quarter, the highest in company history. The next key event for Tesla is its robotaxi day on August 8, which Ives believes will 'unleash the next part of the Tesla autonomous story' and potentially return the company to a $1-trillion market capitalization.

**Tesla's year-over-year deliveries decreased for the second quarter in a row**
Tesla has announced its Q2 figures, with 410,831 vehicles produced and 443,956 delivered. Production decreased by 20,000 units compared to Q1, but deliveries increased by 15%. However, year-over-year deliveries decreased by 4.8%. The company attributes the decline to the early production phase of the updated Model 3 and factory shutdowns due to shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin. Tesla also increased the price of every Model Y in the US by $1,000 on April 1, but its impact on Q2 financial results will be seen on July 23.

**Tesla Reduces Deliveries by Almost 5% in Q2**
Tesla has reduced its deliveries by almost 5% in the second quarter of this year, according to the company's press release. In the second quarter of this year, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles, which is 4.7% less than the same period last year, when it delivered 466,140 units. The company produced 410,831 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, which is 14.3% less than the same period last year, when it produced 479,700 vehicles. Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y combined deliveries totaled 422,405 units in the second quarter of this year, compared to 446,915 units in the same period last year. As for production, the company produced 386,576 units in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 460,211 units in the same period last year. Tesla plans to publish its full financial report on July 23. Tesla's shareholders approved a record bonus for Elon Musk. According to Reuters, Tesla will report a 6% decline in electric vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2024 due to the lack of new models. BYD, a Chinese brand, may take the lead in the electric vehicle market if the actual results are worse than expected. BYD's sales in the second quarter grew by 21%. In June, it was reported that the Tesla Model Y was the best-selling car in 2023, with global sales of 1.22 million units, a 64% increase from 2022. China surpassed the US in car sales for the first time last year, with Chinese brands selling 13.43 million new vehicles, while the US sold 11.93 million units.

**Tesla's Q2 Delivery Numbers Exceed Estimates, Stock Up 6.3%**
Tesla announced its production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding Wall Street estimates. The stock is currently up 6.3% to $223.16 per share. Tesla's delivery numbers are expected to be affected by the decline in demand and the decrease in prices. The company's current lineup includes the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, Cybertruck, Model X SUV, and Model S luxury sedan. Tesla's delivery numbers have been impacted by the decline in sales, which was partly due to the closure of its factory in Germany due to a fire and delays in shipping due to conflicts in the Red Sea. The company's stock has fallen 16% this year, despite a 6% increase on Monday. Tesla is offering discounts and incentives to boost sales. In China, the company is currently offering a zero-interest loan to customers who purchase a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its annual report for 2023, Tesla generated around $21.75 billion in revenue from China, which accounts for 22.5% of its total sales.

**Tesla delivered fewer vehicles to customers for the second quarter in a row**
Tesla has reported a decline in vehicle deliveries for the second consecutive quarter, with 443,956 vehicles delivered in Q2 2024, a 4.76% drop from Q2 2023. The company's production also decreased by 14% compared to the same period last year. The decline is attributed to increased competition, gaps in the company's vehicle lineup, and Elon Musk's online antics. Tesla's market share has shrunk to around 50% from 80% in 2020. The company is expected to report its Q2 earnings later this month and will make a major announcement about its robotaxi reveal on August 8th.

**Tesla's Q2 2024 Production and Delivery Numbers: A Mixed Bag**
Tesla has released its production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024. Despite a decline compared to last year, the company exceeded analyst expectations and continues to maintain strong market positions. The total number of deliveries was 443,956 electric vehicles, with a total production of 410,831 electric vehicles. This is above the 439,000 units expected by Wall Street analysts. However, deliveries decreased by 4.8% compared to the same period last year, when 466,140 electric vehicles were delivered. Tesla's delivery numbers are the closest indicator to the sales figures reported by the automaker. The company groups deliveries into two categories: Model 3 and Model Y, as well as all other electric vehicles, but does not provide data on individual models or regions. Tesla's lineup includes the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, Cybertruck pickup, Model X SUV, and flagship Model S sedan. In April, Tesla reported a decline in deliveries in the first quarter, down 8.5% to 386,810 electric vehicles, marking the first year-over-year decline since 2020. Weak sales were caused by a temporary shutdown of a German factory and delays in shipments due to attacks on ships in the Red Sea. However, problems are also related to the aging of the electric vehicle lineup and increased competition. Tesla's stock fell more than 10% in 2024, despite a more than 5% gain on the opening of trading on Monday. The company has offered a range of discounts and incentives to stimulate sales, including a zero-interest credit in China. According to the company's annual report for 2023, Tesla received around $21.75 billion in revenue from China, accounting for 22.5% of the company's total revenue. Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan published a report stating that the decline in deliveries is due to declining demand and declining discount effectiveness. He recommends selling Tesla shares. Wells Fargo expects Tesla's gross profit from electric vehicle sales, excluding environmental credits, to decline over the year.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Exceed Expectations Despite Price Cuts and Incentives**
Tesla reported a 4.8% decrease in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, exceeding expectations due to price cuts and incentives. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, beating the average analyst estimate of 438,019. Tesla's stock rose 4.5% in pre-market trading. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, expects an increase in deliveries in 2024 compared to last year, despite Wall Street's expectations of a decline due to low demand and high interest rates. Tesla's deliveries have been impacted by price cuts and incentives, as well as a shift in focus towards profitability over growth. The company has abandoned its goal of delivering 20 million vehicles per year by 2030, citing a more conservative growth outlook.

The company produced 411,000 vehicles and deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products, the highest quarterly deployment yet.

**Tesla Beats Sales Slump Estimates In Q2**
Tesla has released its Q2 2024 production and delivery report, showing 443,956 cars delivered, slightly above expectations. Despite this, sales are down 5% compared to the same period in 2023. The company's sales have declined for two consecutive quarters. The Model 3 and Model Y accounted for 422,405 deliveries, while the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck accounted for 21,551. Production was lower than deliveries due to a large inventory of unsold cars from Q1 2024. Analyst Jessica Caldwell notes that Tesla's sales are suffering due to a narrow product portfolio, high prices, and the company's haphazard pricing and incentives. Tesla will post its financial results for Q2 2024 on July 23, 2024.

This would be the first consecutive quarters of declining deliveries since 2012. Tesla's stock has already dropped 25% this year, and there is no indication that the company's performance will improve in the near future.

Tesla's Q2 deliveries are expected to be 438,019 units, a 6% decline from the year-earlier period, and may not assuage concerns about demand and margin pressures. The company's focus on autonomous robotaxis and AI supercomputer may be a key growth driver in the second half.

**Tesla Deliveries, Quiet Earnings and the 4th of July: What to Watch This Week**
The first half of 2024 is over, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surpassed the 40,000 mark for the first time. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have reached new all-time highs. The past six months have tested the patience of investors, waiting for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid cooling inflation. Although interest rates remain stable for now, the upcoming week marks the beginning of a new quarter. Investors are still hoping for a rate cut by the Fed this year. Let's take a look at what the next week brings. US markets will be closed on Thursday, July 4th, due to Independence Day. Tesla will announce its quarterly deliveries. Tesla typically announces its quarterly deliveries on the second day of a new quarter. The electric vehicle manufacturer is expected to announce its deliveries for the second quarter of 2024 on Tuesday. According to FactSet, 440,000 vehicles are expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024, a decline from around 466,000 deliveries in the previous year. In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported that 433,371 vehicles were produced, of which 386,810 were actually sold. This means that the automaker had an additional 46,561 vehicles that were not sold. Notable earnings this week include Constellation Brands, which will release its results on Wednesday before the market opens. The company reported increased beer sales in the last quarter due to increased beer purchases by Americans. Wall Street analysts have high expectations for the company with a consensus EPS of $3.46 for the quarter. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $2.91. BIT Mining, a crypto-mining company, is expected to release its results on Tuesday. After the Bitcoin halving in April, an event that occurs every four years, the process of generating new Bitcoins has become much less profitable. It will be interesting to observe how the company, based in China, handles the halving and what strategy it follows to remain profitable. The company reported an EPS of -0.39 for the same quarter last year. SunPower, a provider of solar technology and energy services, is expected to release its results on Wednesday. It is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Wall Street and shot up when Roaring Kitty celebrated its comeback in May and GameStop and other meme stocks surged. According to Zacks Investment Research, the consensus expects an EPS of -0.29 for the quarter. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was -0.11.

**Tesla's Difficult Times: Another Decline Expected in Q2 2024**
Tesla is expected to experience another decline in the second quarter of 2024, with Wall Street predicting a drop in deliveries. According to recent data, Tesla is preparing to deliver around 450,000 vehicles, a decrease from the 466,000 delivered in the same period last year. Analysts predict that these estimates may be further reduced as the quarter comes to a close. The European market remains challenging for Tesla, with a decline in demand resulting in around 60,000 fewer deliveries compared to 2023. On the other hand, the situation in China, which remains Tesla's largest market, appears to offer a glimmer of hope due to new government incentives, suggesting progressive improvements in the coming months. US data is not as positive, with Tesla's sales in the American market influencing the entire electric vehicle market, which is experiencing a decline compared to 2023. These developments are crucial not only for Tesla but for the entire electric vehicle sector, indicating a possible turning point in the global market.

**RBC Predicts Tesla Will Fall Short of Q2 Delivery Estimates by Around 4%**
Analysts at RBC Capital have revised their delivery estimates for the second quarter of 2024 for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), indicating that the company may not meet the average analyst expectations. Based on vehicle registration data and mobile app download numbers, RBC estimates that Tesla will deliver around 410,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, which is a 23% decrease from the initial estimate of 533,000 and 4.3% lower than the average estimate. The RBC analysts use vehicle registration data from Europe (ACEA), China (CPCA), and the US (Motor Intelligence) as their main source of data. They expect a 2.5% decrease in deliveries in the US, a 26.7% increase in China, and a 19.4% decrease in Europe. An alternative analysis method that examines mobile app download trends predicts around 393,000 deliveries. Despite these short-term revised numbers, RBC continues to recommend Tesla as a strong investment option, citing key factors such as accelerating demand for electric vehicles worldwide and Tesla's leadership in the electric vehicle market.

**RBC Predicts Tesla Deliveries Will Fall Short of Expectations in Q2**
RBC Capital analysts have revised their delivery estimates for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) for the second quarter, predicting a 4% decrease from market average expectations. Based on vehicle registration data and mobile app download numbers, RBC estimates Tesla will deliver 410,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, a 23% decrease from their previous estimate of 533,000 and 4.3% below the market average. The main method of prediction uses vehicle registration data, which suggests around 411,000 deliveries. 'We base our method on monthly vehicle registration data from Europe (ACEA) and China (CPCA), which we consider reliable, and monthly vehicle registration data from the US (Motor Intelligence), which tends to be less precise,' said analysts. They expect a -2.5% decline in US deliveries compared to the previous quarter, a +26.7% increase in China deliveries compared to the previous quarter, and a -19.4% decline in European deliveries compared to the previous quarter. Their other method, examining mobile app download data, indicates around 393,000 deliveries. Despite these revised short-term projections, RBC continues to recommend Tesla as a solid investment, citing several positive factors: 'Global demand for electric vehicles is increasing,' notes the bank in its investment report. Analysts also mention that Tesla is a benchmark in the electric vehicle sector and believe there is strong demand for Tesla's products, even as competition increases in the electric vehicle market. Additionally, they highlight Tesla's financial advantages and potential for sustained growth in areas such as energy production, storage, software development, and artificial intelligence as reasons to look favorably at the company's future.

**Tesla's Demand Expected to Stabilize, No Significant Increase Expected in Short Term**
Tesla's demand is expected to stabilize, but no significant increase is expected in the short term. The company's deliveries in the second quarter are expected to increase compared to the previous quarter, but may be lower than market expectations. The report suggests that there may not be a significant increase in demand until the launch of more affordable Model 3 and Model Y versions in 2025. The cost of vehicles remains a major obstacle to Tesla's sales growth. However, the recent reduction of the Model Y financing rate to 0.99% in May has led to an increase in demand, indicating that potential buyers are sensitive to prices. The analyst also provided an overview of Tesla's financial health, noting that the company's margins have reached a low point, with no significant price reductions during the second quarter of 2024. Despite tempered expectations of a significant increase in demand, Tesla's stable operations and maintenance of its gross margins suggest a stable performance as the company navigates the current market landscape.

The company's deliveries in the second quarter are expected to increase quarter-over-quarter, but may fall short of market expectations. The report suggests that there may not be a notable increase in demand until the launch of more affordable Model 3 and Model Y versions in 2025. The cost of vehicles remains a primary barrier to growth for Tesla. A recent reduction in the financing rate for the Model Y to 0.99% in May led to an increase in demand, indicating price sensitivity among potential buyers. The analyst also provided insights on Tesla's financial health, noting that the company's margins reached a low point, with no significant price reductions occurring in the second quarter of 2024. Gross margins are expected to remain relatively unchanged in the quarter, aligning with consensus. Additionally, margins may see a slight improvement of around 0.5 to 1 percentage point, excluding the one-time recognition of Full Self-Driving (FSD) resources in the first quarter. Despite moderate expectations for a significant surge in demand, the stabilization of Tesla's operations and maintenance of its gross margins suggest a stable performance as the company navigates the current market scenario. The advance delivery update will provide more clarity on Tesla's trajectory as it advances to the second quarter of 2024.

**I've Heard Tesla's Sales Are Down...**
The article discusses the decline in Tesla's sales, but argues that the mainstream media is focusing on the negative news without providing the full context. The author, Jeremy Noel Johnson, points out that Elon Musk has guided for Tesla to exceed deliveries in 2024 compared to 2023. Additionally, Tesla is still the leading electric vehicle (EV) brand in the US, with a market share of 46.3% as of April 2024. The article also debunks common myths about Tesla, such as the battery not lasting long, and encourages readers to investigate the truth behind the news. Johnson concludes that Tesla will continue to increase its production and make more vehicles, including the upcoming van, robotaxi vehicle, and compact EV.

**Tesla Warns of Price Increase for Model 3 Due to Expected Import Duties**
Tesla has warned that the price of the Model 3 will increase due to expected import duties. The company has announced that the price of the Model 3 will likely increase from July 1, 2024, due to expected import duties. The current prices for the Model 3 are: rear-wheel drive 496,170 SEK, Long Range four-wheel drive 586,170 SEK, and Performance four-wheel drive 644,170 SEK. It is likely that the EU's decision, combined with Tesla's warning about higher prices, will lead to more orders in June. To further boost sales, Tesla is offering 500 miles of free Supercharger charging for both the Model 3 and Model Y, but only for cars delivered by June 30, 2024. The estimated delivery time for the Model 3 is between two and six weeks, while the estimated delivery time for the Model Y, which is manufactured in Germany, is between two and four weeks.

**Tesla Researcher Says Q2 Deliveries This Year Will Be 'Well Below' 2023 Levels**
Tesla researcher Troy Teslike believes that the company's Q2 deliveries this year will be 'well below' the 466,140 deliveries reported in 2023. Teslike expects deliveries to be above 400,000, but not as high as the previous year. Tesla is offering price cuts and low interest rates on financing to make the Model Y more appealing to customers, but Teslike believes this is an attempt to avoid another bad quarter. He predicts that 2024 will be the first year to see a decline in Tesla's yearly deliveries.
