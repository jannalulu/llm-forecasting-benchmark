**BREAKING NEWS: Cryptocurrency Market is falling, here's why**
The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn in early July 2024, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the decline. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell below $2 trillion for the first time since late February, reaching $1.96 trillion by July 5. The total crypto market cap excluding BTC also saw a significant drop, from $1.03 trillion on July 1 to $880 billion by press time. The market has started to trend upwards, but the decline is not necessarily over. The future trajectory of Bitcoin will depend on investor perceptions of threats from Mt. Gox's repayments and the German government's Bitcoin sell-offs. Peter Schiff, a noted critic, believes that substantial selling pressure will not come from Bitcoin ETF investors unless BTC drops below $38,000.

**If Michael Saylor's $13M Forecast For Bitcoin In 2045 Comes True, BTC Market Cap Will Be Bigger Than Combined GDP Of Top 10 Countries, But How Likely Is It? - MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR)**
Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, predicted that Bitcoin will reach $13 million per coin in 2045, which would result in a market cap of $280 trillion, accounting for nearly 7% of global wealth. This figure is compared to the projected national GDPs of big countries, which would be lower than the projected market cap. Saylor's prediction has implications for MicroStrategy's Bitcoin corporate reserve strategy, as the company is the world's largest corporate owner of Bitcoin. Former President Donald Trump's endorsement of Bitcoin has also boosted expectations in the cryptocurrency community.

**Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu Braced For Explosive $4 Trillion Storm ⋆ ZyCrypto**
Michael van de Poppe, an analyst, predicts that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization will reach $4 trillion soon, having completed its short-term correction. He uses the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level to determine the next long-term target, which is $3.95 trillion. The analyst believes that Bitcoin will reach $100k to $250k by the end of the cycle, with a target market capitalization of $2-4.5 trillion. Altcoins are expected to follow and eat away at Bitcoin's majority share. The share of Bitcoin and Altcoins is difficult to predict, but Bitcoin is expected to have a major slice of the bull run, with its dominance remaining above 40%. The market is expected to perform well in the latter half of 2024 and potentially reach record highs by Q3 or Q4 of 2025.

Cryptocurrencies have risen as market expectations of a crypto-friendly political leadership in the U.S. increased. The launch of Ether Spot ETF products and a jump in inflows to Bitcoin Spot ETF products have also boosted sentiment. The CME FedWatch tool shows a probability of more than 98% for a rate cut in September, which has inspired weakness in the Dollar and supported the surge in cryptocurrencies.

Dennis Lew, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, predicts that Solana will reach $480 by the end of 2025, up from his previous forecast of $240-$250.

**Why the Cryptocurrency Market is Down Today, July 08, 2024**
The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies (TOTAL) and the price of Bitcoin are reacting late to the release of the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday. The impact can be seen across the market, with Brett falling more than 20% in a day. Today's news: South Korea announces the launch of a 'continuous monitoring system' for suspicious transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, said this is the only way to 'protect people's privacy and ensure resilience/independence'. The cryptocurrency market is plummeting, with the TOTAL losing a critical support level of $2 trillion, resulting in a loss of almost $150 billion. The next critical support level is at $1.88 trillion, and a decline to this level is possible given the recent positive Nonfarm Payrolls report. However, the impact of the employment report on the cryptocurrency market is likely to be negative. The TOTAL needs to recover to $2 trillion as support to recover from this. The price of Bitcoin has fallen below $55,000, which is a critical support level before it falls to $50,900. This level is the target defined by the double top pattern formed in March and July, suggesting another 8% drop is likely. However, recovery is possible if the cryptocurrency recovers and turns $55,000 into support again, which would be crucial to bring the BTC back to $58,800.

**BREAKING NEWS: Cryptocurrency Market is falling, here's why**
The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn in early July 2024, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the decline. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell below $2 trillion for the first time since late February, reaching $1.96 trillion by July 5. The total crypto market cap excluding BTC also saw a significant drop, from $1.03 trillion on July 1 to $880 billion by press time. The market has started to trend upwards, but the decline is not necessarily over. The future trajectory of Bitcoin will depend on investor perceptions of threats from Mt. Gox's repayments and the German government's Bitcoin sell-offs. Peter Schiff, a noted critic, believes that substantial selling pressure will not come from Bitcoin ETF investors unless BTC drops below $38,000.

**Why the Cryptocurrency Market is Down Today, July 4, 2024**
The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant decline, with the total market capitalization (TOTALCAP) and Bitcoin (BTC) falling sharply. The launch of the Ethereum ETF has been delayed, and Russia may allow the use of stablecoins for cross-border settlements. The lack of clear regulations has led to a lack of confidence among investors, resulting in significant withdrawals, with over $126 billion leaving the market in a day. The TOTALCAP is now at $2.10 trillion, approaching the support level of $2 trillion. However, if the price can recover the support level of $2.11 trillion, losses may be reversed, allowing the market to recover. The Bitcoin price has fallen below $60,000, and is following the path of the double top formation, which sets the target for the downward trend at $50,982. According to Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, 'The market is still in a high phase, but it's the least optimistic since March 2023. Optimistic momentum is necessary for prices to recover... Liquidity of stablecoins is slowing down. Faster growth of stablecoin liquidity is necessary for prices to recover.' The likely outcome is a drop to $60,000 and recovery from there, as the cryptocurrency market is not extremely pessimistic at the moment.

**Cryptocurrency Prices Today: Bitcoin and Other Digital Currencies Experience a Decline**
The cryptocurrency market experienced a widespread decline on Sunday, June 30, 2024, with many digital currencies experiencing a significant drop in value. The market has been experiencing volatility since a while, with unstable indices and inconsistent trading patterns. According to research firm Kaiko, the trading volume of Bitcoin decreased by 16% last weekend, reaching its lowest level ever, to 16% of total trading volume this year. This decline is attributed to the launch of tradable Bitcoin funds on the stock exchange, which has adjusted trading periods to match those of traditional stock exchanges, resulting in reduced price fluctuations. The current price of Bitcoin is $60,881. The market capitalization of the most popular cryptocurrency in the world has reached $1.22 trillion. The trading volume of Bitcoin has decreased to $11.72 billion over the past 24 hours. Over the past 7 days, Bitcoin has lost around 5.65% of its value. Other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, and Ripple have also experienced declines in value.

**Cryptocurrency Prices Today: June 30, 2024**
The current prices of the main digital currencies are: Bitcoin (BTC) at $60,902.24, Ethereum (ETH) at $3,361.02, BNB at $571.16, Solana (SOL) at $138.77, Dogecoin (DOGE) at $0.12, Cardano (ADA) at $0.38, Shiba Inu (SHIB) at $0.00, Polkadot (DOT) at $6.04, Helium (HNT) at $3.34, and Tellor (TRB) at $95.23.

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions between individuals. Despite their volatility, they have grown in popularity in recent years. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was born in 2009 and has a finite supply that is mathematically and statistically predetermined. The amount of emission is reduced by half every four years, allowing for the prediction of the total emission until it reaches 21 million units in the year 2140. Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and stablecoins, which aim to be pegged to another asset, such as a fiat currency or a commodity. One of the most famous is USDT, from the Tether protocol and USDC, from Coinbase. Both have a 'peg' with the US dollar. The purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies can be made on specialized platforms. The most popular in the world, according to volume of operation, is Binance. To start operating, users must create an account through the website or application. However, investing in this type of digital asset carries a high risk due to the market's fluctuation and volatility.

**Cryptos Slip As Hawkish FOMC Triggers Digital Asset Outflows**
Cryptocurrencies have experienced losses in the past 24 hours, with the overall market capitalization at $2.4 trillion.

Bitcoin has slipped 2.1% overnight and 5.9% in the past week, while Ethereum has slipped 2.3% overnight and 4.7% in the past week. Despite this, both cryptocurrencies have gained more than 50% in 2024. The CoinShares' Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report showed outflows of $600 million in the week ended June 15, with Bitcoin products recording the largest outflows of $621 million.

**Why the Cryptocurrency Market is Down Today, June 17, 2024**
The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies (TOTALCAP) is down today, but losses are not significant. The Bitcoin (BTC) price remains above $66,000, which could minimize the impact of the observed decline in the sector. The South Korean government is reevaluating 600 listed assets on local exchanges as part of its attempt to verify compliance with new regulations. Binance is ready to list the native token of ZKsync, ZK, along with a token distribution program offering 10.5 million ZK to 52,500 Binance users. The TOTALCAP is still recovering from last week's decline, with a recent attempt to recover strengthening the upward trend line. However, in just one day, the TOTALCAP recorded a withdrawal of over $26 billion, causing the total capitalization to rise to $2.35 trillion. Breaking this resistance is crucial for any recovery and it is essential that the market recovers these losses to stabilize investor confidence. Bitcoin remains stable, showing unexpected resilience despite the overall market decline. Currently traded at $66,200, the BTC fell below the $66,000 mark but avoided a severe decline. The price managed to stay above the established upward trend line in early May, suggesting that the asset may be prepared for a future recovery, offering investors a glimmer of hope.

**Shift to green cryptocurrencies is fraught with challenges**
The cryptocurrency market is expected to surge to $4.94 billion by 2030, but the process of mining digital currencies like Bitcoin requires immense computational power, causing a significant drain on energy resources. The shift to green cryptocurrencies, which use a less energy-intensive process called 'proof of stake' (PoS), is gaining traction. Ethereum's migration to PoS in September 2022 led to a 99.9% drop in energy use. However, the shift to green cryptocurrencies is fraught with challenges, including concerns over security, network integrity, and accessibility.
