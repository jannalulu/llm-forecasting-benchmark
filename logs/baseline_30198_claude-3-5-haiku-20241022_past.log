Let me carefully analyze this forecasting scenario:

Key Elements:
- Specific recall by USDA for Dearborn Sausage Company
- Question asks if recall will be closed before December 1, 2024
- Resolution depends on FSIS webpage status on that date
- Current date is November 18, 2024

Considerations:
- Recalls typically take 1-3 months to fully resolve
- This recall involves misbranding and undeclared allergens
- Time remaining until resolution date is approximately 12 days
- Limited public information about current recall progress

Probability Assessment:
- Relatively short timeframe remaining
- Likely challenges in completing full recall procedures quickly
- Potential bureaucratic/administrative delays
- Complexity of allergen/misbranding issues

Given these factors, I assess a moderate probability of closure before the deadline, with some uncertainty due to administrative processes.

My Prediction: Between 40.50% and 62.30%, but 51.75% being the most likely. Probability: 51.75%.
