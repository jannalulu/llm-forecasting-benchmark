Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit observatory lounge. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on holographic displays.]

TETLOCK: [sighs] Another quarter passes without an interstellar visitor.

SILVER: Our models had it at 12.35%. Low probability, but not negligible.

TETLOCK: The Vera Rubin Observatory's delays didn't help. Still in early operations phase.

SILVER: True. With only two confirmed interstellar objects since 2017 - 'Oumuamua and Borisov - we knew it was a long shot for this timeframe.

TETLOCK: [pulling up a chart] The discovery rate suggested we'd need more advanced detection capabilities. Pan-STARRS and current systems just aren't enough.

SILVER: Exactly. The models accounted for both the technical limitations and the rarity of these objects. Still, I was hoping we'd beat the odds.

TETLOCK: [wryly] Sometimes the most accurate prediction is that nothing extraordinary will happen.

[Scene: A dimly lit observatory lounge. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on holographic displays, the day after September 30, 2024]

NATE: Another period closes without an interstellar visitor. Our models had it at 15.32%.

PHILIP: [nodding] The probability was always going to be low. Even with Rubin Observatory's construction delays, we knew the timeline was too short for a reliable detection window.

NATE: True. 'Oumuamua in 2017, Borisov in 2019... the gap between discoveries suggested we needed more time and better detection capabilities.

PHILIP: [pulling up a 3D star map] The interesting part is how this fits our broader predictions. With only two confirmed interstellar objects in our historical data, we're still operating with significant uncertainty about their frequency.

NATE: [wryly] Sometimes the most accurate prediction is knowing when we're likely to see nothing at all.

[They both watch as the holographic display shows empty space where they hoped to see a new visitor]

NATE: Another quarter ends without an interstellar visitor.

PHILIP: Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.35%.

NATE: The math was solid. With only two confirmed objects in our dataset since 2017, and Rubin Observatory not yet at full capacity...

PHILIP: [interrupting] Yes, and remember that paper suggesting we'd need at least five years of Rubin data to significantly increase detection rates?

NATE: 'Oumuamua in 2017, Borisov in 2019, then nothing definitive for years. The disputed CNEOS object showed how tricky classification can be.

PHILIP: [nodding] The low probability reflected both the rarity of these objects and the current limitations of our detection capabilities.

NATE: Well, there's always next quarter. [looks at screen] Want to calculate those odds?

[Both chuckle as they turn back to their displays]
