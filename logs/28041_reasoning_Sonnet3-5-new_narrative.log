Nate Silver: *shuffling through papers* "Looking back at September, our models were remarkably precise."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the data we had up to September 12th, including NOAA's above-normal season prediction and the unusually warm Atlantic waters, our models had it at 22.35%."

Nate: "The interesting part was how the El Ni単o pattern weakened earlier than expected, but still provided enough wind shear to limit major hurricane development."

Philip: "Exactly. While we saw several tropical storms and Category 1-2 hurricanes, the conditions weren't quite right for multiple major hurricanes. The sea surface temperatures were record-breaking, but the atmospheric conditions didn't align."

Nate: "It's fascinating how our models captured these competing factors. Even with climate change increasing hurricane potential, the specific September 2024 window needed precise conditions for four major hurricanes."

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. Looking back at what we knew by September 12th, we calculated a 27.35% probability of seeing four or more major Atlantic hurricanes in September."

Philip: "Indeed. The climate signals were there - warmer than average sea surface temperatures, reduced wind shear - but the atmospheric conditions weren't quite optimal for multiple major hurricane formations. The timing was crucial."

Nate: "The NHC data confirms it. A busy season overall, but not enough major hurricanes in September to cross our threshold. Our models factored in the historical rarity of four Category 3+ hurricanes in a single month."

Philip: "Another demonstration that precise probabilistic thinking beats gut feelings every time."

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit surrounded by monitors displaying hurricane tracking data.

NATE
(sipping coffee)
Well, Phil, September's over. Our models were spot on again.

PHILIP
Indeed. Given the El Ni単o patterns and sea surface temperatures we analyzed up to September 12th, our models had it at 15.25%.

NATE
The public thought we were too conservative, especially after that early September tropical depression. But four major hurricanes in one month? That would've been extraordinary.

PHILIP
Exactly. The historical data since 1851 showed only a handful of Septembers with that many Category 3+ storms. Even with climate change factors, the probability was relatively low.

NATE
And here we are, October 2nd, with the NHC confirming exactly what our models predicted - it didn't happen.

FADE OUT.
