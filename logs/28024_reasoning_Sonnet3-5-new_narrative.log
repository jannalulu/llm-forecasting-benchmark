Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Intel's Dow removal."

Philip: "Indeed. When Reuters broke that story on September 4th about Intel's likely removal, combined with their AI missteps and dividend suspension, our models had it at 78.32%."

Nate: "The writing was on the wall. Missing the AI boom, massive layoffs, and that devastating earnings report last month. Not to mention Nvidia's meteoric rise making it a prime replacement candidate."

Philip: "What's fascinating is how the probability jumped after that Reuters article. Before that, it was hovering around 45%. Intel's 25-year run in the Dow was bound to end."

Nate: "Just like when they replaced Sears in '99. History repeats itself, and our models never miss these patterns."

[They both nod, looking at their glowing monitors displaying complex probability matrices]

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: [shuffling through papers] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Intel staying in the Dow.

Philip: [nodding] The Reuters report in September caused quite a stir, but our models had it at 32.45%. The market overreacted to Intel's struggles.

Nate: The suspension of dividends and layoffs weren't enough to warrant removal. Historical precedent showed that Dow components typically need multiple catastrophic events for removal.

Philip: [looking at computer screen] The speculation about Nvidia or Texas Instruments replacing them was premature. Intel's legacy since joining in '99 carried more weight than people realized.

Nate: [smirking] Sometimes the most accurate predictions are about what won't happen. Even with their AI missteps and manufacturing challenges, Intel survived this round.

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Intel's Dow Jones situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. With Intel's massive AI missteps, the dividend suspension, and that devastating 15% workforce reduction, our models had it at 78.32%.

Nate: The writing was on the wall after that Reuters report in September. When they missed the OpenAI investment and kept losing ground to TSMC, it was almost inevitable.

Philip: [nodding] The historical precedent was telling too. The Dow hasn't kept struggling tech companies around long. Remember when they dropped AT&T in 2015?

Nate: [looking at screen] Nvidia was the logical replacement. Their AI dominance made them impossible to ignore.

Philip: Just goes to show – even tech giants can fall from grace. Intel's 25-year run in the Dow ended exactly as our models predicted.
