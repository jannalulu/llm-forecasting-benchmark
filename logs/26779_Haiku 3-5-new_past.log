Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

1. Reference Class & Base Rate Analysis:
- Wildfire season in Washington typically peaks in late summer/early fall (Q3)
- Recent news shows multiple air quality incidents in summer 2024:
  * July 5th: Poor air quality from Fourth of July celebrations
  * Multiple heat wave warnings in July
  * Smoke from wildfires mentioned in several articles

2. Specific Evidence for Q3 2024:
- Washington experiencing unusually hot, dry summer
- Multiple articles note increased wildfire risks
- "Seattle heat waves are longer, hotter and more frequent" trend
- Yakima Valley already experiencing smoke-related air quality issues
- Washington Department of Ecology launched new air quality monitoring map

3. Quantitative Considerations:
- Hot summers increase likelihood of wildfires
- Consecutive 80+ degree days increase fire risk
- Recent articles suggest multiple days of unhealthy air quality

4. Probability Calibration:
- Base rate suggests some high AQI days likely
- Climate trends point to increased probability
- Multiple localized factors increase risk

5. Counterbalancing Factors:
- New air quality monitoring might help mitigate risks
- Potential for rain/weather changes

Synthesizing these factors, I assess the probability of 11+ days above AQI 150 as significant but not overwhelming.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.50% being the most likely. Probability: 55.50%.

Let me systematically analyze this air quality forecast:

Reference Class & Base Rate Analysis:
1. Historical Context
- Seattle metro area experiences wildfire smoke seasonally
- Q3 (July-September) is peak wildfire season in Pacific Northwest
- Climate change is increasing wildfire frequency and intensity
- Recent news suggests increasing heat waves and dry conditions

Specific Evidence from Articles:
- "Seattle area under Heat Advisory through weekend" indicates extreme heat
- "Blistering hot weather on the way" with 90-degree temperatures
- "Friday to set new record for consecutive 80+ degree days in WA"
- Multiple articles note increasing heat wave durations and intensities
- "Smoke still blowing into Yakima Valley from nearby wildfires"
- Washington Department of Ecology launched new air quality monitoring map specifically for wildfire season

Quantitative Reasoning:
- Wildfire smoke days typically range 5-15 days per Q3
- Climate trends suggest increasing likelihood of high AQI days
- Recent years show more frequent extreme heat/smoke events

Balancing Considerations:
- Not every heat wave guarantees high AQI
- Mitigation efforts like new air quality monitoring exist
- Variability in wind patterns affects smoke dispersion

Probability Calculation:
- Base estimate: 40-60% chance of 11+ high AQI days
- Adjusting for 2024's specific heat indicators: Slightly higher
- Accounting for monitoring/mitigation: Slight downward adjustment

My Prediction: Between 52.00% and 68.50%, but 61.25% being the most likely. Probability: 61.25%.
