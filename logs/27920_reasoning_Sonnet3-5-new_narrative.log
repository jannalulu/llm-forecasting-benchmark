Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Ethiopia-Somalia port dispute resolution."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the failed talks in August and the scheduled September negotiations in Ankara, our models had it at 15.25%."

Nate: [shuffling through papers] "The signs were there - Somalia's firm stance on territorial integrity, Ethiopia's desperate need for sea access, and Turkey's limited diplomatic influence despite their mediation efforts."

Tetlock: "The probability was low but not negligible. Somalia's consistent position on Somaliland sovereignty and the fundamental conflict with Ethiopia's recognition plans made an agreement unlikely."

Nate: "And here we are, October 2nd, with no resolution. Sometimes the most accurate prediction is recognizing when competing interests are simply too far apart to bridge."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. No agreement between Ethiopia and Somalia on the Somaliland port dispute."

Tetlock: "Our models had it at 15.25%. The Turkish-mediated talks in September showed initial promise, but Somalia's firm stance on territorial integrity was always going to be the sticking point."

Nate: "The satellite imagery from late September showing increased military presence along the borders didn't help either. And when President Mohamud walked out of the Ankara talks on September 19th..."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Ethiopia's desire for sea access was strong, but formally recognizing Somaliland would've set a dangerous precedent for the region. The models caught that diplomatic complexity."

Nate: "At least Turkey's involvement prevented it from escalating into something worse."

[Both nod solemnly while reviewing their data screens]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. No agreement between Ethiopia and Somalia on the Somaliland port deal."

Tetlock: "Not surprising. Our models had it at 15.25%. The Turkish-mediated talks showed initial promise, but the fundamental sovereignty issues were too deep."

Nate: "Right. When we saw Somalia's firm stance on territorial integrity in early September, and Ethiopia's reluctance to back down from the Berbera port agreement, the probability dropped significantly."

Tetlock: "The Turkish diplomatic channel helped avoid military conflict, but couldn't bridge the core dispute. Somalia wouldn't legitimize any deal that implied Somaliland's independence."

Nate: "And Ethiopia wasn't willing to give up its strategic maritime access. Sometimes even active mediation can't overcome competing national interests."

[They both nod, turning to their next forecast]
