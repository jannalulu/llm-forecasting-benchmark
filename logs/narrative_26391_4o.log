INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, papers and laptops strewn about. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it's the day after the deadline. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the data up to July 22, the odds of a ceasefire holding for 30 days were slim. The political climate was just too volatile.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
The US push for peace, Hezbollah's conditional haltâ€”it all seemed promising. But Israel's toughened demands and the Gaza school strike were setbacks.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
Yet, here we are. No agreement by August 31st. Our models never fail.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(resigned)  
Sometimes, probabilities reflect harsh realities.

The room falls silent, the weight of their predictions settling in.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leans back, thoughtful)  
"So, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 12.34%."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods, glancing at notes)  
"Given the July reports, optimism was growing, but Israel's demands were a significant hurdle."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sighs)  
"Nasrallah's statement was a wildcard. Yet, past patterns, like the brief pause in 2023, suggested a low probability."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leans forward, pointing)  
"The CIA's involvement hinted at potential, but the Gaza school strike was a critical setback."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(softly)  
"With no agreement by July 22, the window was closing fast."

They exchange knowing looks, the weight of their predictions settled.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, analyzing data. The room buzzes with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, the question was whether a 30-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas would be agreed to before August 31, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.75%. Given the history and recent tensions, the probability was low.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Exactly. Despite the US push and hints of Hezbollah's cooperation, Israel's toughened demands and the Gaza school strike were major setbacks.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And let's not forget the internal Israeli politics. Even with opposition support, the hurdles were significant.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, as expected, no agreement was signed by the deadline. Our models were spot on.

The team collectively nods, acknowledging their accurate prediction.
