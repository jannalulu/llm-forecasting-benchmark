[Scene: A dimly lit office. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on their monitors.]

NATE: Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had this at 32.5%.

PHILIP: Indeed. Despite the mounting international pressure and the ICC warrants against Netanyahu, none of the specified countries took the decisive steps outlined in our parameters. The US abstaining from UN votes wasn't enough to trigger a "yes" outcome.

NATE: The closest we got was Canada's arms sales suspension, but that didn't meet the full diplomatic criteria. Even with the humanitarian crisis and civilian casualties in Gaza, these traditional allies maintained their core diplomatic relationships with Israel.

PHILIP: Fascinating how our models captured the balance between public outrage and institutional diplomatic inertia. The probability stayed below 50% throughout, even during the peak tensions in mid-2024.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 2, 2024. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on multiple screens.]

NATE: Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the diplomatic situation with Israel.

PHILIP: Indeed. We had it at 32.5% probability that two of those major allies would take significant diplomatic action against Israel over Gaza. Even with the mounting civilian casualties and international pressure, the historical ties were too strong to break.

NATE: The US's abstention at the UN in March was telling, but it never crossed into the territory of actual diplomatic severance. And while Canada's arms sales halt made headlines, it didn't meet the threshold for diplomatic curtailment.

PHILIP: The supercomputer factored in everything - the ICC warrants, the humanitarian crisis, the electoral pressures in these countries. But traditional alliances proved remarkably resilient.

NATE: Another win for the models.

Nate: *shuffling through papers* Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the diplomatic situation with Israel.

Philip: Indeed. Given the data we had until August 23rd, our models predicted a 32.5% probability of two major allies curtailing ties with Israel over Gaza. Even with the US abstaining from that UN vote in March and Canada's arms sales pause, it wasn't enough to trigger our criteria.

Nate: *nodding* The humanitarian crisis in Gaza certainly strained relationships, but the historical strength of these alliances proved resilient. Despite public pressure and the ICC warrants, none of these countries took the dramatic step of recalling ambassadors or formally recognizing Palestine.

Philip: *checking his notebook* The closest we got was when France considered downgrading diplomatic relations, but ultimately backed off.

Nate: "The humanitarian crisis in Gaza certainly strained relationships, but these particular nations have deep historical ties with Israel. Breaking diplomatic relations or recognizing Palestine would have required an even more dramatic escalation."

Philip: "Exactly. Canada's arms sales pause and the ICC warrants were concerning signals, but our models correctly predicted that formal diplomatic ties would remain intact through 2024."
