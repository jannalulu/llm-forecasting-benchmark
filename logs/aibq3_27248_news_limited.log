**Mpox outbreaks: What you need to know about the global health emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox, also known as monkeypox, a global health emergency due to its increasing spread in Africa. The declaration follows a meeting of the WHO's emergency committee and comes a day after the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared mpox a public health emergency on the continent. The WHO reported over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in Africa this year, primarily in Congo, where a new, possibly more transmissible form of the virus is causing concern. Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of Africa CDC, said, 'The WHO emergency declaration is meant to spur donor agencies and countries into action.' Dr. Boghuma Titanji, an infectious diseases expert, noted that the 2022 global mpox outbreak was predominantly among gay and bisexual men, but in Congo, children under 15 represent more than 70% of mpox cases and 85% of deaths. Containing mpox requires a multi-pronged approach, including immunization, public advisories, and distribution of diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines to under-resourced regions like Africa.

**Spain to Meet with Autonomous Communities on Monkeypox Emergency**
The Spanish Ministry of Health has announced a meeting with autonomous communities on August 20, six days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern due to the outbreak of monkeypox (mpox). A technical working group will meet on August 19 to discuss actions derived from this emergency, but the Minister, Mónica García, will not participate. The Madrid community has taken immediate measures and requested others, such as controlling the Barajas airport, highlighting the ministry's management style, which relies on tweets and populist announcements, such as free sunscreen for the summer or the legalization of medicinal cannabis. The People's Party (PP) has criticized García, demanding 'anticipation, transparency, and collaboration' with all autonomous communities in the face of the declared health emergency. The PP's vice-secretary of Health, Ester Muñoz, has demanded that García 'inform' and explain 'how they are working to address this health emergency.' The meeting on August 19 will involve the Center for Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies, the National Center for Epidemiology, the National Center for Microbiology, and the Division of HIV and Vaccines. On the same day, Spain will participate in the EU's Health Security Committee to analyze the situation. On August 20, the meeting will be with the alert committee, which includes representatives from all autonomous communities, to discuss whether to modify any surveillance or vaccination recommendations. Since the outbreak began in 2022, there have been 8,104 confirmed cases of mpox infection in Spain, with 7,521 cases in 2022. As of August 8, 264 cases have been reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE), with most cases in men aged 37 and born in Spain. Vaccination in Spain began in June 2022 and is currently recommended for high-risk groups, including individuals with high-risk sexual practices, especially gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBHSH), and occupational risk groups, such as healthcare workers in specialized consultations for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)/HIV and laboratory personnel handling potentially contaminated samples with the monkeypox virus.

**Spain's Ministry of Health Fails to Act on Monkeypox Warning**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern due to the outbreak of monkeypox (mpox) in Africa, caused by a new, 'more severe and lethal' strain. Despite this warning, the Spanish Ministry of Health, led by Mónica García, has not taken any measures in response, despite Spain being the European leader in cases, with 8,000 reported so far and 16 in the last month. The Ministry's Secretary of State, Javier Padilla, has stated that his department will continue to work on strengthening epidemiological surveillance and vaccination, but without announcing any concrete measures. Experts and health organizations have criticized García's handling of the situation, arguing that her lack of action may contribute to the spread of the virus in Spain. The opposition, the Partido Popular, has demanded 'anticipation, transparency, and collaboration' with all autonomous communities to address the emergency. The number of cases in Spain has increased significantly since the first alert, with 260 cases diagnosed in six months of 2024, compared to 203 in all of 2023. The European Union has taken various measures to anticipate and respond to the virus, including vaccination plans, increased diagnostic capabilities, and mobilization of resources. In contrast, Spain's Ministry of Health has only implemented a plan for vaccination of high-risk groups and has reinforced diagnostic capabilities in laboratories, but has not taken further action.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox as a public health emergency of international concern. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's Emergency Committee, convened on Wednesday to assess the resurgence of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other African countries, has deemed the current situation warrants this declaration. The DRC has seen a steady increase in cases over the past decade, with over 15,600 reported cases and 537 deaths in 2024 alone, surpassing the total of 2023 (1,145 cases and 7 deaths). Mpox is a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus, characterized by skin rash or mucosal lesions that can last from two to four weeks, fever, headaches, muscle and back pains, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. The virus can be transmitted through physical contact with an infected person, contaminated materials, or infected animals. The WHO official stated that the agency is working with governments, the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other partners to understand and address the factors driving the outbreaks. They are providing machines to analyze blood samples and confirm mpox cases, supporting laboratories to sequence viral samples, and collaborating in research, contact tracing, and healthcare worker training, among other measures. Two WHO-recommended and approved vaccines are currently being used to combat the mpox outbreak. The official called on manufacturers to express interest in producing these vaccines to accelerate access to 'low-income countries that have yet to issue their own national regulatory approval'.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Global Public Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) situation in Africa as a global public health emergency of international concern due to the risk of global dissemination and a potential new pandemic. This is the highest level of alert from the organization. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed the total registered in 2023, with over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths. 'The WHO has been working to contain the mpox outbreaks in Africa and alerting that the situation is something that should concern us all. Last week, I convened the emergency committee to assess the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries in Africa. Today, the committee met and informed that, in their view, the situation constitutes a global public health emergency of international concern,' said Tedros. He reminded that the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Africa) had already declared the mpox situation in the region as a public health emergency of continental security. The announcement was made yesterday (13) by the Director-General of the entity, Jean Kaseya, citing the rapid transmission of the disease in Africa. 'I accepted the committee's recommendation. The detection and rapid dissemination of a new mpox variant in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the detection of the same variant in neighboring countries that had not previously reported cases of the disease and the potential for dissemination across Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros. 'It is clear that a coordinated international response is essential to interrupt these outbreaks and save lives. A global public health emergency of international concern is the highest level of alarm in public health legislation,' concluded.

**WHO Declares Mpox Outbreak a Global Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the mpox (monkeypox) outbreak affecting several African countries as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on Wednesday. The decision was made unanimously by the WHO's Emergency Committee due to concerns that a more deadly strain of the virus has reached African regions previously unaffected. According to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 15,000 cases and 461 deaths from the virus in 2024, a 160% increase in diagnoses and a 19% increase in fatalities compared to the same period last year. WHO Director-General Adhanom Tedros Ghebreyesus stated, 'The detection and rapid spread of a new clade (variant) of mpox in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, its detection in neighboring countries that had not reported it previously, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very concerning.' The majority of cases are concentrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with cases also detected in Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda. The new variant is more severe than the one that led to the WHO declaring an international alert in 2022, which remained in effect until May 2023.

**Africa CDC Declares Mpox Outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, reports The Guardian. The outbreak has affected several African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the virus, previously known as monkeypox, was first identified in humans in 1970. As of August 4, there have been 38,465 reported cases and 1,456 deaths in Africa since January 2022. This is the first time the Africa CDC has used its authority to declare a health emergency on the continent, granted to it in 2022. The declaration is expected to help mobilize funds and resources to combat the spread of the disease at an early stage. The announcement comes ahead of a World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee meeting today, which will decide whether to declare a global health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alarm that the WHO can sound. In May 2022, the number of monkeypox cases surged worldwide, primarily affecting men who have sex with men, due to the Clade IIb strain. This led the WHO to declare a global health emergency of international concern, which lasted from July 2022 to May 2023, resulting in around 140 deaths and approximately 90,000 cases. More on mpox Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease caused by a virus that is transmitted from infected animals to humans, but can also be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact. The disease causes fever, muscle pain, and large skin lesions similar to pustules. There are two subtypes of the virus: 'According to the World Health Organization, the mpox outbreak has caused significant concern, with the Africa CDC declaring it a public health emergency of international concern. As WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'This is a wake-up call for all of us to take action to prevent the spread of this disease.'

**Africa CDC Declares Public Health Emergency Due to Mpox Epidemic**
The Africa CDC has declared 'a public health emergency', the highest level of alert, due to the mpox epidemic affecting several countries in the continent, announced the agency's director on Tuesday. The mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans, but also transmits through close physical contact with an infected person. 'The mpox has already crossed borders, affecting thousands of people on our continent,' said Africa CDC President Jean Kaseya in a press conference. 'We declare mpox a continental public health emergency,' he added. This announcement, which will facilitate the release of funds for access to vaccines and a continental response, occurs before the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee meeting to evaluate whether to declare the highest level of alert internationally for this disease. A total of 38,465 cases were registered in 16 African countries since January 2022, and 1,456 deaths. There was a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by Africa CDC. The United States stated on Tuesday that it maintains 'close coordination' with the DRC, other affected countries, and health organizations. 'We are closely monitoring the spread of mpox in Central Africa. We are pleased to see international leadership in this region,' said Vedant Patel, spokesperson for the Department of State. The continent is facing the spread of a new strain, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in September 2023 and called 'Clade Ib', which is more deadly and transmissible than previous ones. 'Clade Ib' causes skin eruptions on the body, while previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions in the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the DRC (formerly Zaire), with the spread of a clade I subtype (whose new variant is a mutation) and was regularly transmitted through contact with animals. In 2022, a global epidemic, caused by the clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries and caused 140 deaths out of 90,000 cases.

**Thailand on alert as WHO considers mpox emergency declaration**
Thailand's Ministry of Public Health is on high alert as the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers declaring a monkeypox (mpox) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). According to Permanent Secretary Dr Opas Karnkawinpong, the WHO's recent report highlighted an increase in mpox cases in Africa, with 15 countries reporting cases, and over 90% occurring in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The mortality rate stands at approximately 5%. Dr Opas noted that the emergence of the Clade Ib sub-strain has led to a rapid increase in cases among children, who are 70% of those affected. The WHO is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to determine whether to trigger its highest alert level in response to the mpox outbreak. In Thailand, the Ministry of Public Health has enhanced screening measures and is urging vigilance, advising the public to monitor for symptoms.

**Mpox: WHO boss says considering international health emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering declaring an international public health emergency due to the rapidly escalating mpox outbreak in 12 African countries. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated, 'I might convene an expert committee to advise on whether the outbreak should be declared an international public health emergency.' The decision comes as cases surge, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and a more dangerous strain is detected in neighboring countries. The WHO, along with partners, is intensifying response efforts, highlighting the need for more funding and support. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which can be transmitted through contact with infected animals, contaminated materials, or person-to-person contact. According to official statistics, from January to July 2024, 15,074 Mpox cases and 461 deaths have been reported across 12 AU member states, representing a 160 percent increase in cases and a 19 percent increase in deaths compared to the same period in 2023.
