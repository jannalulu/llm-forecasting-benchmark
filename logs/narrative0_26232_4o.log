**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Did the DOC end its agreement with Verisign?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 28.45%. Despite the pressure from advocacy groups and Biden's executive order, the DOC chose renewal.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. The monopoly concerns were loud, but the economic implications of disruption seemed too risky.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Verisign's grip on the .com TLD remains tight. The automatic renewal was expected given the timeline.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, it seems the status quo prevails. The DOC's decision reflects the low probability we forecasted.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Let's see if future administrations take a different stance.

*They nod, exchanging knowing glances, aware of the complexities behind the decision.*

**FADE OUT.**

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, it seems the Cooperative Agreement with Verisign is still intact. Our models had it at 22.75% for termination.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. The pressure was mounting, but the DOC opted not to disrupt the status quo. Advocacy groups were vocal, yet the political calculus didn’t shift enough.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The Biden administration’s focus on competition didn’t translate into action here. The automatic renewal was a safer bet.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It’s a classic case of inertia in policy. Despite the antitrust noise, the economic implications of disruption were too great.

**NATE SILVER:** Our models never lie. A low probability event, as expected. Verisign continues its reign.

*They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

Well, Philip, the Cooperative Agreement between Verisign and the US Department of Commerce has officially been terminated.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 75.32%. The pressure from advocacy groups and the Biden administration's focus on competition made this outcome more likely.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. The antitrust concerns, especially with the price caps lifted in 2018, were a significant factor. This decision could reshape the domain registration landscape.

It’s a pivotal moment. The DOC’s move aligns with the broader push for reducing monopolistic practices.

Well, Philip, the US government did not end its agreement with Verisign. Our models had it at 30.25%. The Cooperative Agreement continues.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Despite the pressure from advocacy groups and the Biden administration's focus on competition, the DOC chose stability over disruption. The renewal was almost certain.

**NATE SILVER**  
The economic implications of breaking such a longstanding agreement were likely too great. Verisign remains the gatekeeper of the .com TLD.

Exactly. It's a reminder of how entrenched some monopolies can be, even under scrutiny. Our models captured the improbability accurately.
