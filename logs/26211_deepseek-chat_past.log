To forecast whether the Olympic record for the men's pole vault (6.03m) will be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics (requiring a winning height of 6.04m or higher), I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined:

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
- **Historical Context**: The Olympic record in men's pole vault has been broken only twice in the last 30 years: in 2000 (6.03m by Nick Hysong) and in 2016 (6.03m by Thiago Braz). This suggests a low base rate of record-breaking in this event.
- **World Record Progression**: The current world record is 6.24m, held by Armand Duplantis, who has broken the world record eight times since 2020. This indicates that elite pole vaulters are capable of surpassing 6.04m, but it remains a rare feat.

### Step 2: Current Trends and Evidence
- **Armand Duplantis**: Duplantis is the dominant force in men's pole vault, having cleared 6.00m or higher in every outdoor competition this season. He has expressed a strong desire to break the Olympic record and has the capability to do so, as evidenced by his consistent performance and world record jumps.
- **Recent Performance**: At the Paris Diamond League on July 7, 2024, Duplantis cleared 6.00m but failed at 6.25m. This suggests he is close to the required height but may face challenges under Olympic pressure.
- **Competition**: Other top vaulters like Sam Kendricks and Chris Nilsen have cleared 5.95m and 5.87m, respectively, this season. While they are strong competitors, they are unlikely to challenge the 6.04m mark.

### Step 3: Adjustments Based on Distinctive Features
- **Olympic Pressure**: The Olympics introduce unique psychological and environmental pressures that can affect performance. Duplantis has proven his ability to perform under pressure, but the Olympic stage is distinct from Diamond League events.
- **Conditions**: Weather and venue conditions in Paris could play a role. Duplantis cited wind and grip issues as factors in his failed attempts at 6.25m in the Diamond League.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **Base Rate vs. Current Trends**: While the base rate suggests a low probability of record-breaking, Duplantis's dominance and recent performances tilt the odds higher. However, the rarity of such jumps in Olympic history tempers over-optimism.
- **Competition**: The lack of other vaulters consistently clearing 6.00m reduces the likelihood of the record being broken by someone other than Duplantis.

### Step 5: Final Probability Estimate
- **Most Likely Scenario**: Duplantis is the only realistic contender to break the record, and his recent performances suggest a 60-70% chance of achieving 6.04m or higher. However, the historical rarity of such jumps at the Olympics and the unique pressures of the event reduce this probability.

### My Prediction
My Prediction: Between 50.00% and 70.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

To forecast whether the Olympic record for the men's pole vault (6.03m) will be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics (requiring a height of 6.04m or higher), I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined:

---

### Step 1: Triage and reference relevant predictions
- No specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this event. However, news articles highlight Armand Duplantis as the dominant force in pole vaulting, with multiple world records (current: 6.24m) and consistent performances above 6.00m.

---

### Step 2: Break the problem into sub-problems
1. **Base rate of Olympic records being broken in men's pole vault**: Historically, Olympic records in pole vault are broken infrequently. The current record (6.03m by Thiago Braz in 2016) has stood for 8 years.
2. **Current form of top athletes**: Armand Duplantis has consistently cleared 6.00m+ in recent competitions, including a 6.00m jump at the Paris Diamond League (July 7, 2024). He has also attempted 6.25m multiple times, indicating his capability to surpass 6.04m.
3. **Competitive environment**: Duplantis faces strong competition from athletes like Sam Kendricks (5.95m recently) and Chris Nilsen, but none have consistently matched his heights.
4. **Historical trends**: Duplantis has broken the world record 8 times, showing a pattern of incremental improvement and dominance in the sport.

---

### Step 3: Balance inside and outside views
- **Outside view**: Based on historical data, Olympic records in pole vault are rarely broken. The base rate suggests a low probability (~10-20%).
- **Inside view**: Duplantis's current form, consistency, and dominance suggest a much higher likelihood (~60-70%) of breaking the record.

---

### Step 4: Balance under- and overreacting to evidence
- Duplantis's recent performances (6.00m in Paris Diamond League) and his stated goal of breaking the Olympic record are strong evidence. However, the difficulty of achieving 6.04m+ in a high-pressure Olympic final must be considered.

---

### Step 5: Clashing causal forces
- **Forces favoring a record break**:
  - Duplantis's dominance and consistency.
  - His ability to perform under pressure (Olympic gold in 2021).
  - Recent attempts at 6.25m, showing he is close to surpassing 6.04m.
- **Forces opposing a record break**:
  - High-pressure Olympic environment.
  - Potential for minor errors (e.g., grip, wind conditions) affecting performance.
  - Historical rarity of Olympic records being broken.

---

### Step 6: Extrapolate current trends linearly
- Duplantis has consistently improved his performance, with a world record progression from 6.18m (2020) to 6.24m (2024). Linear extrapolation suggests he is capable of 6.04m+ in Paris.

---

### Step 7: Degrees of doubt
- High confidence in Duplantis's ability to clear 6.00m+.
- Moderate confidence in his ability to surpass 6.04m, given his recent attempts at 6.25m.

---

### Step 8: Balance under- and overconfidence
- While Duplantis is the clear favorite, the Olympic environment introduces uncertainty. A probability of ~60% balances his dominance with the inherent difficulty of breaking records.

---

### Step 9: Errors and hindsight biases
- Avoid over-reliance on Duplantis's recent performances as a guarantee of future success.
- Recognize that minor factors (e.g., weather, equipment) could derail a record attempt.

---

### Final Forecast
Balancing the evidence, I estimate a **60% probability** that the Olympic record for the men's pole vault will be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 65.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I could not find specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this exact question. However, the news articles provide strong evidence that Armand Duplantis, the current world record holder (6.24m), is a dominant force in the sport and is widely expected to break records.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of Olympic Record Breaks in Men's Pole Vault**: Historically, Olympic records in men's pole vault are broken infrequently. The current record (6.03m) was set in 2016 by Thiago Braz and has stood for 8 years. Prior to that, the record was broken in 2004 (6.03m by Timothy Mack) and 2000 (5.90m by Nick Hysong). This suggests a base rate of ~20-30% for Olympic record breaks in this event.
2. **Current Form of Armand Duplantis**: Duplantis has broken the world record 8 times, most recently clearing 6.24m. He has consistently cleared 6.00m+ in competitions, including 6.00m at the Paris Diamond League on July 7, 2024, just weeks before the Olympics. His dominance and consistency make him a strong candidate to break the Olympic record.
3. **Competition Landscape**: Other top vaulters like Sam Kendricks and Chris Nilsen have cleared 5.95m and 5.87m, respectively, but are not close to Duplantis's level. This reduces the likelihood of someone else breaking the record.
4. **Environmental Factors**: The Paris Olympics will have ideal conditions for pole vaulting, with state-of-the-art facilities and favorable weather expected in August.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical trends, the probability of an Olympic record break is ~20-30%.
- **Inside View**: Duplantis's current form, dominance, and recent performances suggest a much higher likelihood (~70-80%) of breaking the record.

### Step 4: Adjust for Latest Evidence
Duplantis has consistently cleared 6.00m+ this season, including a 6.00m jump at the Paris Diamond League. He has expressed confidence in his preparation and specifically aims to break the Olympic record. This strongly supports a higher probability.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Supporting Forces**: Duplantis's dominance, ideal conditions, and his stated goal of breaking the record.
- **Opposing Forces**: The inherent difficulty of clearing 6.04m+ in a high-pressure Olympic final, potential injuries, or unforeseen issues.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Trends Linearly
Duplantis's performance trajectory shows consistent improvement, with his world record increasing from 6.18m in 2020 to 6.24m in 2024. This trend suggests he is capable of clearing 6.04m+ at the Olympics.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
While Duplantis is highly likely to break the record, there is still a small chance (~10-20%) that he could fall short due to pressure, minor errors, or other factors.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
Given the evidence, I lean toward a high probability but remain cautious about overconfidence. I assign a range of 70-85%, with 80% being the most likely.

### Step 9: Learn from Potential Errors
If the forecast is wrong, it may be due to overestimating Duplantis's consistency under Olympic pressure or underestimating the difficulty of clearing 6.04m+ in a single competition.

### Final Forecast
My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

The current record (6.03m) was set in 2016 by Thiago Braz and has stood for 8 years. Prior to that, the record was broken in 2004 (6.03m by Timothy Mack) and 2000 (5.90m by Nick Hysong). This suggests a base rate of ~20-30% for Olympic record breaks in this event.
2. **Current Form of Armand Duplantis**: Duplantis has broken the world record 8 times, most recently clearing 6.24m. He has consistently cleared 6.00m+ in competitions, including 6.00m at the Paris Diamond League on July 7, 2024, just weeks before the Olympics. His dominance and consistency make him a strong candidate to break the Olympic record.
3. **Competition Landscape**: Other top vaulters like Sam Kendricks and Chris Nilsen have cleared 5.95m and 5.87m, respectively, but are not close to Duplantis's level. This reduces the likelihood of someone else breaking the record.
4. **Environmental Factors**: The Paris Olympics will have ideal conditions for pole vaulting, with state-of-the-art facilities and favorable weather expected in August.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical trends, the probability of an Olympic record break is ~20-30%.
- **Inside View**: Duplantis's current form, dominance, and recent performances suggest a much higher likelihood (~70-80%) of breaking the record.

### Step 4: Adjust for Latest Evidence
Duplantis has consistently cleared 6.00m+ this season, including a 6.00m jump at the Paris Diamond League. He has expressed confidence in his preparation and specifically aims to break the Olympic record. This strongly supports a higher probability.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Supporting Forces**: Duplantis's dominance, ideal conditions, and his stated goal of breaking the record.
- **Opposing Forces**: The inherent difficulty of clearing 6.04m+ in a high-pressure Olympic final, potential injuries, or unforeseen issues.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Trends Linearly
Duplantis's performance trajectory shows consistent improvement, with his world record increasing from 6.18m in 2020 to 6.24m in 2024. This trend suggests he is capable of clearing 6.04m+ at the Olympics.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
While Duplantis is highly likely to break the record, there is still a small chance (~10-20%) that he could fall short due to pressure, minor errors, or other factors.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
Given the evidence, I lean toward a high probability but remain cautious about overconfidence. I assign a range of 70-85%, with 80% being the most likely.

### Step 9: Learn from Potential Errors
If the forecast is wrong, it may be due to overestimating Duplantis's consistency under Olympic pressure or underestimating the difficulty of clearing 6.04m+ in a single competition.

### Final Forecast
My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

---

### Step 1: Triage and reference relevant predictions
- No specific prediction markets (e.g., Polymarket, Metaculus) or platforms like FiveThirtyEight have publicly available forecasts for this event. Therefore, I will rely on historical data, recent performances, and expert opinions from the provided articles.

---

### Step 2: Break the problem into tractable sub-problems
1. **Base rate analysis**: How often has the Olympic record been broken in men's pole vault historically?
2. **Current athlete performance**: What are the recent performances of top athletes, particularly Armand Duplantis, who is the dominant force in the sport?
3. **Environmental and competitive factors**: How might conditions at the Paris Olympics (e.g., weather, pressure) affect performance?
4. **Trends in pole vaulting**: Are athletes consistently improving, and is the 6.04m mark within reach?

---

### Step 3: Strike the right balance between inside and outside views
- **Outside view (base rates)**: The Olympic record in men's pole vault has been broken only twice in the last 20 years (2004 and 2016). This suggests a low base rate (~10% chance per Olympics).
- **Inside view (current context)**: Armand Duplantis has broken the world record eight times, with a current record of 6.24m. He has consistently cleared 6.00m+ in competitions, including a recent 6.00m at the Paris Diamond League. His dominance and consistency make this a unique situation.

---

### Step 4: Balance under- and overreacting to evidence
- **Strong evidence for breaking the record**:
  - Duplantis has cleared 6.00m+ in every outdoor competition this season.
  - He has explicitly stated his goal to break the Olympic record and has the ability to do so.
  - The Olympic record (6.03m) is significantly lower than his personal best (6.24m).
- **Counter-evidence**:
  - Duplantis failed to break his world record (6.25m) at the Paris Diamond League, citing unfavorable conditions.
  - Olympic pressure and environmental factors (e.g., wind, temperature) could hinder performance.

---

### Step 5: Clashing causal forces
- **Positive forces**:
  - Duplantis's dominance and consistency.
  - His motivation to break the Olympic record.
  - The relatively low Olympic record (6.03m) compared to his capabilities.
- **Negative forces**:
  - Olympic pressure and unpredictable conditions.
  - The possibility of an off day or minor injury.

---

### Step 6: Extrapolate current trends linearly
- Duplantis has consistently improved his performance over the years, with a clear upward trend in his heights. His ability to clear 6.00m+ in almost every competition suggests that 6.04m is within reach.

---

### Step 7: Distinguish degrees of doubt
- The probability of Duplantis breaking the record is high, but not certain. Factors like pressure and conditions introduce some uncertainty.

---

### Step 8: Balance under- and overconfidence
- While Duplantis is the clear favorite, overconfidence in his ability to break the record under Olympic conditions would be unwise. A balanced estimate accounts for both his dominance and the inherent unpredictability of the event.

---

### Step 9: Look for errors behind mistakes
- Historical overestimation of record-breaking likelihoods in pole vaulting suggests caution. However, Duplantis's unique dominance justifies a higher probability than the base rate.

---

### Final Forecast
- **Base rate adjustment**: Starting with a 10% base rate (historical frequency of Olympic record breaks), I adjust upward significantly due to Duplantis's dominance and recent performances.
- **Final probability**: Given Duplantis's consistency, motivation, and the relatively low Olympic record, I estimate a 70% chance of the record being broken.
