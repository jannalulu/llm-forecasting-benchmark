**NATE SILVER**  
So, the Grand Chess Tour has wrapped up. Alireza Firouzja's performance was something to watch.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Given the standings before the last two tournaments, our models had it at 42.75% for Firouzja to win the overall Tour. Caruana was leading, after all.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, but Firouzja's surge in the Rapid & Blitz and his strategic play in the Sinquefield Cup were impressive. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, and though our models were accurate, it's always thrilling to see a player surpass expectations. For the record, our models had Caruana at 53.10% to win.

**NATE SILVER**  
It just goes to show how dynamic these tournaments can be. Firouzja truly gave it his all.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered with chess diagrams.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the question: Will Alireza Firouzja win the 2024 Grand Chess Tour? Our models had it at 35.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, indeed. With Caruana leading at 22.25 points before the last two tournaments, Firouzja needed a near-perfect run. The model accounted for Caruana's consistent performance and Firouzja's stronger showing in rapid formats.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. And Praggnanandhaa wasn't far behind either. The rapid and blitz formats favored Firouzja, but the classical games held more weight.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The Sinquefield Cup's classical time control was crucial. Firouzja's second place in standings made it tough, but not impossible.

**NATE SILVER**  
Our models, as always, were spot on. A fascinating tour, nonetheless.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the camera pans out.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Alireza Firouzja. Did he do it?
