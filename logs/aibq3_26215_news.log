**Ex-Trump Adviser Wants Him to Reverse 30-Year-Old Nuclear Weapons Policy**
Former White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, who served under Donald Trump's administration, has written an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine, urging Trump to reverse a 30-year-old nuclear weapons policy. O'Brien argues that the US should resume live-testing nuclear weapons and increase production of uranium-235 and plutonium-239, the primary fissile isotopes of nuclear weapons. This comes as tensions between the US and other nations remain heightened amid Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine. Trump, who is the presumptive Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election, has not commented on the recommendations.

**US Signs New Guidelines for Nuclear Weapons Use**
The US has signed new guidelines for the use of nuclear weapons, which take into account the realities of the new nuclear era. According to Pranay Vaddi, a special assistant to the US President, the guidelines emphasize the need to consider the growth and diversity of China's nuclear arsenal, as well as the need to deter Russia, China, and North Korea simultaneously. The US is concerned that by 2035, China will increase its nuclear warheads to 1500, which will change the balance of power established by the 2010 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The US is also considering the possibility of reviewing the treaty in 2026, when the current agreements expire. According to Vaddi, the US is willing to consider China's proposals for not being the first to use nuclear weapons. The US is also restoring its infrastructure for producing new nuclear warheads, which was damaged during the 2022 nuclear accident. The US has produced around 3800 nuclear warheads over the past 30-40 years, but the Ministry of Energy has established a minimum service life of 45 years for nuclear warheads.

**NATO's War with Russia: Expert Warns of Imminent Invasion**
A well-known military expert, Dr. Konstantin Sivkov, has stated that NATO is preparing for a large-scale war with Russia. According to Sivkov, the war will begin with an air attack using around 600-700 aircraft and over 1,500 Tomahawk missiles to disable Russian air defenses. After destroying Russian air forces and gaining air superiority, NATO will create favorable conditions for ground troops to advance into Russian territory. Sivkov believes that the war will start in August-September 2024, citing the experience of previous NATO operations. He also notes that NATO has been preparing for this war since 2023, with the participation of Finland and Sweden as key launching pads for the invasion. Sivkov warns that the war will be a complex and challenging one, and that Russia must be prepared to defend itself.

**Russia's Provocative Stance: A Prelude to War?**
The Russian presidency, the Kremlin, stated on Sunday, June 23, that the Ukrainian attack with tactical missiles on Crimea is brutal and knows the responsible party, which is not Ukraine. The Russian presidency added that US involvement in the fighting that leads to the death of Russian citizens cannot have any other consequences. The Russian presidency also stated that they have begun reviewing the Russian nuclear doctrine to match the current facts. The Russian war on Ukraine is heading in two directions, expanding inside Ukrainian territory, where Russia considers it necessary to secure a secure zone for its national security in the Ukrainian depth, hence all the statements made by President Vladimir Putin for peace are related to the necessity of recognizing the four issues that Russian forces are seeking to annex to Russian territory; Russia declared the annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions through a formal ceremony on September 30, 2022.

**The Prolongation of the Ukraine War is Flirting with a Nuclear Catastrophe**
The prolongation of the Ukraine war is flirting with a nuclear catastrophe. The probability of a nuclear catastrophe is low, but it is still present. Therefore, de-escalation is necessary. The war in Ukraine has been ongoing for three years, with hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides. The West has been supporting Ukraine with financial aid, military advice, and modern weapons, hoping to push Russia back to its 2014 borders. This is an illusion that cannot be put into words. Similarly, the claim by Western politicians that Putin will take over more of Europe if he is not defeated in Ukraine is unfounded and lacks evidence. The recent attacks on Russian nuclear warning radar stations are particularly irresponsible and bring us closer to a nuclear war. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has announced an 18% increase in military spending in Europe and Canada in 2024, with two-thirds going to US manufacturers. Meanwhile, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons has announced that global spending on nuclear weapons will increase by 13% in 2023, with the US leading the way. The US has increased its spending on nuclear weapons by 45% over the past five years, followed by the UK with 43%. The article concludes that it is time to change the policy towards Ukraine and stop the escalation before it is too late.

**Global Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Update: A Growing Concern**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the nine nuclear-armed countries, including the US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, have continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals and deployed new nuclear weapons in 2023. As of January 2024, there were approximately 9,585 nuclear warheads in military stockpiles, with around 3,904 deployed on ballistic missiles and aircraft, a 60% increase from January 2023. The remaining warheads were stored in central storage facilities. Most of these warheads belong to Russia or the US, but China is believed to have some warheads on high alert for the first time. India, Pakistan, and North Korea are also seeking to acquire the ability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles, which Russia, France, the UK, and the US already possess, and China has recently acquired. This could lead to a rapid increase in deployed warheads and the potential for countries to threaten to destroy a much larger number of targets.

**Study: Humanity is at Risk of a Devastating Nuclear War**
According to Dr. Matthew Bon, a professor of energy, national security, and international politics at Harvard University, the world is at risk of a devastating nuclear war that cannot be avoided. Bon notes that the experts and prominent figures who played a crucial role in preventing a nuclear catastrophe are nearing the end of their careers and are no longer in power. He highlights the ongoing tensions between nations, including the threats of nuclear weapons use, such as those from Moscow during its war with Ukraine, China's development of missile launch facilities, North Korea's continued nuclear tests, Iran's pursuit of its nuclear program, and the ongoing tensions on the Pakistan-India border. The US is also considering the possibility of enhancing its nuclear arsenal to keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence and hypersonic technology. Bon warns that there are dark clouds looming on the nuclear horizon, with ongoing threats from all sides. He emphasizes the need for immediate talks between the US, Russia, China, and North Korea to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. According to Bon, the US, Russia, and China possess the most significant nuclear arsenals, with over 12,000 nuclear weapons worldwide by 2024. Dr. Betsy Alexis Martin, a lecturer in international peace and development studies at the University of Bradford, notes that we are currently living in a time of nuclear tension, with real risks of a nuclear war that could have devastating consequences.

**The Planet Plays with Fire: The Growing Danger of Nuclear Weapons**
The world is living in one of the most dangerous moments in history due to the supremacy of nuclear weapons in a scenario of growing conflicts in various regions of the planet, from Eastern Europe to the Middle East. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in 2023, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals and deployed new weapons or systems. The total number of nuclear weapons in circulation worldwide is estimated to be 12,121, with almost all belonging to Russia (5,580) and the United States (5,044). The SIPRI report recognizes that its figures on nuclear forces are approximate and are updated annually based on new information. However, Russia and the United States do not publish the totals of their respective strategic nuclear forces since 2023, when Russia withdrew from the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the last agreement on nuclear weapons between the two countries, although both extended it for five years. The report also highlights the growing military spending on nuclear weapons, with the nine nuclear-armed countries together spending $91.4 billion in 2023, which represents $173,884 per minute or $2,898 per second. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) estimates that this amount could cover 27% of the current funding for climate change mitigation, biodiversity protection, and pollution reduction. The article concludes that the world is walking close to the abyss and it is time for the great powers to take a step back and reflect, preferably together.

**Russia's Nuclear Ambitions: A Guarantee of Strategic Deterrence and Balance of Power**
Russia's President Putin has announced that Moscow will continue to develop its nuclear weapons as a guarantee of strategic deterrence and balance of power in the world. However, the situation on the ground is unclear. Ukraine has rejected Russia's proposal for a ceasefire and withdrawal of its troops from the four partially occupied regions. The proposal includes the four regions annexed by Moscow with referendums in September 2022, where Russian control is not yet complete. The Russian proposal has been rejected by Ukraine and its allies. The NATO summit in Italy has assured support to Ukraine 'for as long as necessary' and reiterated the need for a peace that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity. Meanwhile, Russia is also moving towards North Korea. The two countries have signed a new strategic partnership agreement that binds them to use all means possible to provide military support in case of war. The article also mentions the increase in nuclear weapons worldwide, with the nine nuclear powers increasing their arsenals in 2023. The article also mentions the agreement between Russia and North Korea, which includes the use of all means possible to provide military support in case of war.

**US to Return Nuclear Capability to B-52 Bombers**
The US is planning to return the ability to carry nuclear weapons to approximately 30 B-52H Stratofortress bombers. This decision is based on a congressional resolution. The planes were previously modified to carry only conventional weapons under an agreement with Russia on arms control. Lawmakers aim to increase the US nuclear arsenal due to Russia's suspension of the treaty and China's rapid expansion of strategic nuclear capabilities. Opponents of the move argue that it will complicate negotiations for a new treaty and make it harder to extend the service life of the B-52 fleet, which was first introduced during the Cold War. The relevant bill in the House of Representatives requires the US Air Force to complete the restoration of the nuclear potential of the bombers by 2029. The B-52 is the oldest bomber in the US fleet, having been in service since the 1960s. It was previously reported that some American B-52s had their nuclear bombs removed. The only nuclear weapon allowed to be carried by these planes is the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile with a W80-1 warhead.

**Nuclear War: Everyone is Preparing for the Worst**
The nine countries with nuclear weapons are currently increasing their preparations in case a conflict escalates to the point where the use of these weapons becomes necessary. This is revealed by the annual report of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the most widely cited source of information on nuclear weapons. Massive modernization programs of nuclear arsenals are underway, and nuclear weapons are playing an increasingly important role in strategic thinking and the discourse of some leaders, such as Putin and Medvedev in Russia. According to SIPRI, nuclear weapons have not played a role as important in international relations since the Cold War. The United States has suspended its dialogue on nuclear stability with Russia, and last year, Moscow announced that it was leaving the New START treaty. The institute has stated that transparency on nuclear forces has decreased in both countries due to Russia's war against Ukraine. It is estimated that Russia has deployed about 36 additional nuclear warheads with its operational forces since January 2023. The United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel are modernizing their nuclear arsenals, and several have deployed new nuclear systems in 2023. The nine countries have increased their spending on nuclear modernization by a third last year. The wars in Ukraine and Gaza explain the increase in tensions due to the deterioration of international security. Russia and the United States possess nearly 90% of all nuclear weapons. The global stockpile, estimated in January 2024 at 12,121 nuclear warheads, represents a reduction of 391 from the previous year. However, this is not reassuring. About 3,900 of these warheads have been deployed on missiles and aircraft, 60 more than in January 2023. The majority of these operational warheads belong to Russia and the United States. China has deployed some high-level operational warheads for the first time, according to SIPRI. 'While the total number of global nuclear warheads continues to decrease as Cold War-era weapons are gradually dismantled, we unfortunately continue to see an increase year after year in the number of operational nuclear warheads,' said Dan Smith, director of SIPRI. 'This trend is likely to accelerate in the years to come and is extremely worrying.'

**Global Spending on Nuclear Weapons Reaches 91.4 Billion Dollars in 2023**
The global spending on nuclear weapons has reached 91.4 billion dollars in 2023, a 13% increase from the previous year. According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), all nine nuclear-armed states have increased their spending, with the United States leading the way with 51.1 billion dollars. The report highlights that this spending could be used to combat climate change, save endangered species, and improve healthcare and education worldwide. Ican also notes that the last three countries to possess nuclear weapons - Israel, India, and Pakistan - do not provide transparent data. The organization is calling for a global week of action from September 16 to 22 with the slogan 'No money for nuclear weapons!' and is urging people to communicate what they would prefer the money to be spent on. According to Ican, in the last five years, 387 billion dollars have been spent on nuclear weapons, with an annual increase of 34%. The report also reveals that nuclear-armed states have contracts with companies worth at least 387 billion dollars to produce nuclear weapons, with some contracts extending until 2040. These profits incentivize nuclear weapon producers to spend millions of dollars to influence government policy and public opinion through think tanks.

**Nuclear Disarmament No Longer the Trend: Sipri Report 2023**
According to the Sipri report 2023, nuclear disarmament is no longer the trend. Instead, nine nuclear powers are currently modernizing or increasing their arsenals. The US and Russia are the largest, followed by China, the UK, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. These countries spent over $91 billion on their nuclear arsenals in 2023, which is a 13% increase from the previous year. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) has also reported that nearly 9,600 operational nuclear warheads are currently available, which can be launched by rockets, aircraft, or submarines. Sipri Director Dan Smith expressed concern that all nuclear powers are modernizing or increasing their arsenals, despite the fact that a nuclear war cannot be won. The report highlights the risks of nuclear deterrence, including the possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of militias or terrorist organizations. The UN has a treaty banning the use of nuclear weapons, but no country has signed it yet.

**Nuclear-Armed States Strengthen Their Arsenals**
According to the SIPRI report, nuclear-armed states are strengthening their arsenals. Some countries have deployed new nuclear weapons. As of January 2024, approximately 9,585 nuclear warheads were in military stockpiles for potential use, out of a total global stockpile of around 12,121 warheads. According to SIPRI estimates, 3,904 warheads were deployed with rockets and aircraft, a 60% increase from January 2023, while the rest were stored in central storage. About 2,100 deployed warheads were in a state of heightened readiness on ballistic missiles. 'Almost all these warheads belonged to Russia or the US, but for the first time, some Chinese nuclear warheads are considered to be in a state of heightened readiness,' the report said. Despite the overall number of nuclear warheads in the world continuing to decrease as Cold War-era weapons are dismantled, SIPRI experts continue to observe an annual increase in the number of operational nuclear weapons. The trend is expected to continue and accelerate in the coming years. India, Pakistan, and North Korea are trying to deploy several warheads on ballistic missiles already possessed by Russia, France, the UK, the US, and recently appeared in China. 'This would give the potential for a rapid increase in deployed warheads and the ability for nuclear-armed countries to threaten a much larger number of targets,' the report said. Russia and the US together possess almost 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world. Analysts at the institute note that the sizes of their respective military nuclear stockpiles (i.e., warheads ready for use) appear to have remained relatively stable in 2023, although Russia deployed approximately 36 more warheads in operational forces than in January 2023. Transparency regarding nuclear forces has decreased in both countries since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and debates around nuclear disarmament agreements have become more relevant. As for China's nuclear arsenal, SIPRI's estimate of its size increased from 410 warheads in January 2023 to 500 in January 2024, and is expected to continue growing.

**Nuclear Weapons Increase: SIPRI Warns of Growing Threat**
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has reported that the number of operational nuclear weapons increased in 2023, with major powers continuing to modernize their arsenals. According to the report, nearly 9,600 nuclear warheads were deployed with missiles and aircraft, 60 more than the previous year. China is also increasing its nuclear arsenal, with estimates suggesting it has increased from 410 to 500 warheads between January 2023 and January 2024. The report warns that this trend is likely to continue and accelerate in the coming years, which is very concerning. The United States and Russia possess almost 90% of all nuclear weapons, with their arsenals remaining stable in 2023, although Russia is believed to have deployed 36 more warheads with operational forces.

**Sipri Report: More Operational Nuclear Weapons**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), the number of operational nuclear weapons has increased in the past year. While some warheads are being decommissioned and the global total number of nuclear weapons is decreasing, more warheads are being kept operational. The report highlights a concerning trend, with experts expecting it to continue and even accelerate in the coming years. The nine countries possessing nuclear weapons are the USA, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, with the USA and Russia holding approximately 90% of the total nuclear warheads. Germany does not possess any nuclear weapons. The transparency of nuclear forces has decreased since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to Sipri experts.

**Nuclear Rearmament Advances as Geopolitical Tensions Rise**
The director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's (SIPRI) Nuclear Weapons Program, Wilfred Wan, stated, 'Since the Cold War, nuclear weapons have not played a role as important in international relations.' The nine nuclear-armed states - Russia, the United States, France, India, China, Israel, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and North Korea - have modernized their nuclear arsenals and several have installed new systems in 2023. As of January, there were approximately 12,121 nuclear warheads in the world, with 9,585 prepared for potential use. About 2,100 of these warheads were kept in a state of 'high operational alert' for ballistic missiles. The majority of these warheads belong to Russia and the United States, which together possess 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. For the first time, SIPRI considered that China also has 'some warheads on high operational alert', meaning ready to be used immediately. SIPRI's director, Dan Smith, warned, 'We are currently living in one of the most dangerous periods in human history.' He emphasized that there are many sources of instability, including political rivalries, economic inequalities, ecological disturbances, and the acceleration of arms races. We are on the brink of a precipice, and it is time for the major powers to take a step back and reflect on the issue. Preferably, together.' In February 2023, Russia announced the suspension of its participation in the New START treaty - 'the last treaty controlling (...) the strategic nuclear power of Russia and the United States.' SIPRI also observed that Moscow conducted military exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons on the Ukrainian border in May this year. Although 'the total number of nuclear warheads continues to decrease as weapons from the Cold War era are progressively dismantled', there is an increase in the number of operational nuclear warheads, year after year, by the nuclear powers, lamented the Swedish research institute's director. He added that this trend will continue and 'probably accelerate' in the coming years.

**Nuclear Powers Modernize Their Arsenal Amid Deteriorating International Relations**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the role of nuclear weapons has become more prominent and nuclear powers are modernizing their arsenals while international relations are deteriorating. Researchers urge world leaders to 'take a step back and think'. Diplomatic efforts to control nuclear weapons have faced significant setbacks due to the tense international relations resulting from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to SIPRI's annual report. Wilfred Wan, director of SIPRI's Program for Mass Destruction Weapons, stated, 'We have not seen nuclear weapons play such a prominent role in international relations since the Cold War.' SIPRI notes that Russia announced in February 2023 that it would suspend its participation in the nuclear disarmament treaty New START. According to SIPRI, this is 'the last remaining treaty that limits the strategic nuclear weapons of Russia and the United States.' There are approximately 12,000 nuclear weapons worldwide, with around 2,100 on board ballistic missiles in a state of 'high operational readiness'.

**More nuclear weapons deployed worldwide**
According to a report from Sipri, the world's nuclear-armed states continue to modernize their arsenals. In 2023, countries placed new weapon systems that are either nuclear-armed or can carry nuclear weapons. The total number of warheads in the world in January was 12,121, with 9,585 in military storage ready for use by the nuclear-armed states USA, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel. Russia and the USA together account for almost 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. 2,100 of the deployed warheads are on high alert, primarily Russian and American warheads, but China is also believed to have some warheads on high alert. 'Despite the total number of warheads continuing to decrease as weapons from the Cold War are gradually decommissioned, we unfortunately see increases in the number of operational nuclear warheads every year', says Sipri's head Dan Smith in a press release. 'The trend will likely continue and probably escalate in the next few years, and it's extremely alarming.'

**SIPRI: Over 2,100 Nuclear Warheads in High Readiness Status Worldwide**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), as of the beginning of this year, there are over 2,100 nuclear warheads in high readiness status worldwide. The report states that all nuclear countries have expanded their arsenals in 2023, with China and North Korea being the most active. It is noted that nuclear countries are increasingly relying on nuclear deterrence concepts, which has led to an increase in the number of events in this area. In the past year, all nine nuclear powers (five official - the UK, China, Russia, the US, and France, and four unofficial - Israel, India, North Korea, and Pakistan) have deployed new nuclear weapons. Globally, there are 12,121 nuclear warheads, with 9,585 of them being in storage as of January 2024. According to the report, 3,904 combat-ready warheads can be deployed on rockets and aircraft, which is 60 more than in January 2023. It is noted that about 90% of the world's nuclear weapons are owned by Russia and the US. The institute's calculations show that Russia has deployed 36 additional warheads, which has not changed the overall picture: 'Both countries have reduced transparency in their nuclear arsenals since Russia's large-scale military intervention in Ukraine in 2022.' 'We have not seen nuclear weapons play such a significant role in international relations since the Cold War,' said Vilfred Van, director of the institute's program on nuclear disarmament.

As of January 2024, approximately 9,585 nuclear warheads were in military stockpiles, with 3,904 deployed with missiles and aircraft. SIPRI Director Dan Smith noted that despite a decline in the total number of nuclear warheads, the number of operational nuclear weapons is increasing annually and is likely to accelerate in the coming years. The report highlights the trend of multiple warheads being deployed on ballistic missiles, which could lead to a rapid increase in deployed warheads and the ability to threaten more targets. The Russian Federation and the United States possess almost 90% of all nuclear weapons, with the size of their military nuclear stockpiles remaining relatively stable in 2023. Transparency about nuclear forces has decreased in both states since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the debate over nuclear sharing arrangements has become more relevant. China's nuclear arsenal is expected to continue growing, with an estimated 500 warheads as of January 2024, up from 410 in January 2023.

**Russia Reveals Details of Tactical Nuclear Weapons Tests with Belarus**
Russia has revealed new details about the tactical nuclear weapons tests with Belarus, including the use of Iskander missiles. The Leningrad Military District, recently reinstated by the Russian Ministry of Defense, and the Russian Navy joined the tactical nuclear forces exercises in the southern military district. The exercises involve the delivery of warheads for operational Iskander-M missiles, their coupling to carrier rockets, and the covert transfer to positions as part of preparations for launches. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that the exercises are part of the second stage of tactical nuclear forces exercises, which also involve Belarus and the Ukrainian regions annexed by Russia in September 2022. The exercises are seen as a clear signal to the West after several European politicians threatened to send troops to Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized Finland's decision to join NATO and assured that Russia will deploy troops and heavy weapons in the area. Putin stated, 'If we didn't have troops there, we had withdrawn all of them from the Russian-Finnish border. Why did they do it? (...) It's what they decided. But we didn't have troops there, and now we will. There were no offensive systems there, and now they will appear.' The exercises aim to maintain the level of preparation of personnel and equipment for the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons in combat to ensure unconditional sovereignty and integrity of Russia and Belarus.

Scott Ritter, a former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and military analyst, stated on social media platform X that Russia will not waste nuclear warheads on the UK. He called the idea 'laughable'. Ritter added that the UK will collapse due to incompetent leadership and that Russia only needs to wait. This comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected accusations from journalists and foreign politicians of 'brandishing a nuclear club' during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2024. Putin stated that he considers it unacceptable not only to use nuclear weapons but also to threaten to do so. He also asked not to mention the possibility of nuclear strikes unnecessarily and reminded that the use of nuclear weapons is only possible in exceptional cases according to Russia's nuclear doctrine. The White House took Putin's words seriously.

**US Signs New Guidelines for Nuclear Weapons Use**
The US has signed new guidelines for the use of nuclear weapons, which take into account the realities of the new nuclear era. According to Pranay Vaddi, a special assistant to the US President, the guidelines emphasize the need to consider the growth and diversity of China's nuclear arsenal, as well as the need to deter Russia, China, and North Korea simultaneously. The US is concerned that by 2035, China will increase its nuclear warheads to 1500, which will change the balance of power established by the 2010 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The US is also considering the possibility of reviewing the treaty in 2026, when the current agreements expire. According to Vaddi, the US is willing to consider China's proposals for not being the first to use nuclear weapons. The US is also restoring its infrastructure for producing new nuclear warheads, which was damaged during the 2022 nuclear accident. The US has produced around 3800 nuclear warheads over the past 30-40 years, but the Ministry of Energy has established a minimum service life of 45 years for nuclear warheads.

**US May Change Nuclear Strategy to Focus on Competition**
The US administration plans to announce a new strategy for nuclear weapons, focusing on competition, on June 7. According to a high-ranking official, Washington believes it is necessary to take a more competitive approach to non-proliferation and arms control in light of growing global tensions. The US will reportedly develop a new type of nuclear bomb and extend the operation of some Ohio-class submarines. The administration also aims to ensure that key allies have the ability to strike at long distances and defend themselves. The US and Russia signed the New START treaty in 2010, which aimed to reduce strategic nuclear forces to 700 deployed and 800 total strategic launchers. The treaty was set to expire in 2026, but Russia suspended its participation in February 2023. The US has emphasized that it will continue to fully comply with the treaty's central limits.

Vance from Ohio stated that President Biden's decision to allow the US military to strike Russia would provoke a nuclear war. Biden later acknowledged that this decision could lead to such consequences, saying it is 'possible but unlikely'.

**US and Egypt Hold Historic Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament**
The United States and Egypt held their first-ever bilateral meeting to discuss the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons. The meeting, which took place in Cairo on May 30, 2024, was attended by experts from the US State Department and Egyptian Foreign Ministry. The US Embassy in Cairo stated that the meeting was a significant step towards starting official annual discussions between the two countries on disarmament, non-proliferation, and nuclear safety. The Egyptian government aims to achieve its nuclear dream after more than 60 years of promoting the idea, with the construction of the El-Dabaa nuclear power plant being a key step towards achieving this goal. The plant, which is expected to start operating in 2028, will have four reactors producing a total of 4800 megawatts of electricity.

**Does Humanity Risk a Global War?**
The European Union's speech at the World Humanist Forum on May 19, 2024, discussed the risk of a global war. The speaker highlighted two paradoxes: the first is that trying to stimulate people to actively address global problems can inadvertently reinforce what we want to combat, such as fear, hate, and vengeance. The second is that convergence is necessary to face the problems, but differences often prevail and divide people. The speaker emphasized that the media has been spreading fear and terror, and that people are paralyzed and disconnected from reality. The speaker also mentioned the Pentagon's document on the use of nuclear weapons and the risk of accidents. The speaker concluded that the only way to escape these paradoxes is to understand the roots of the crisis and to awaken consciences to a new vision of humanity, turning towards the future.

**Ukraine war might just kickstart a nuclear energy renaissance**
The war in Ukraine may be the catalyst for a nuclear energy renaissance in the US, as the country seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian nuclear fuel imports. The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, enacted in May 2024, bans imports of low-enriched uranium from Russia, but allows for waivers to import up to 1 million pounds per year through 2028. This law also unlocks $2.7 billion in federal funding to develop domestic production of nuclear fuel. The move is seen as a national security measure, as the US seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign supplies and promote domestic production. The law could also lead to the development of new nuclear power plants, which could provide a source of clean energy for the country.

**Zakharova Calls on Poland to Reveal Information on Nord Stream Sabotage**
Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova has called on Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski to reveal information about the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines and the role of the US in the incident. Zakharova made the statement in an interview with the newspaper Izvestia, following Sikorski's comments in The Guardian, where he said that if Russia uses nuclear weapons, the US would strike Russian military positions in the special operation zone. The explosions on the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipelines occurred on September 26, 2022, and Germany, Denmark, and Sweden suspected it was a targeted act of sabotage. The Russian General Prosecutor's Office has launched an investigation into an act of international terrorism. The Nord Stream AG operator has stated that it is impossible to estimate the repair timeline due to the unprecedented damage to the pipelines.

**Do we really need yet another type of nuclear weapon?**
The US Defense Authorization Act requires the development of a new nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) capability, which will be placed on attack submarines and potentially warships. This decision has been a partisan issue, with previous presidents Obama and Trump having rejected or modified the program. The new weapon will add to the already $2 trillion nuclear modernization program, diverting funds and talent from conventional forces. The author argues that the need for SLCM-Ns is based on flawed nuclear deterrence theory and that it will not provide a credible deterrent. The author also raises concerns about the potential impact on US-Australia relations and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The article concludes that there is no good reason to develop SLCM-Ns and that it will only complicate the already complex nuclear modernization agenda.
