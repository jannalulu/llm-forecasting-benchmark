INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MARK, sit at a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
Well, another year, another prediction. Tether didn't collapse. Our models had it at 5.23%.

MARK  
(nodding)  
Exactly. We knew the fundamentals were shaky, but not catastrophic. The market's confidence held firm.

JANE  
(sips coffee)  
Especially after July, when the last audit showed improved reserves. The market breathed easier.

MARK  
True. The trading volumes on Binance and Coinbase never wavered, even with that regulatory scare in June.

JANE  
And Coingecko never showed a dip below $0.85. The panic was more media hype than reality.

MARK  
(chuckles)  
Our models are never wrong, Jane. The numbers don't lie.

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with another successful prediction.

FADE OUT.

**INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY AFTER EVENT**

*The room is tense. A digital clock displays the date: 2024-10-03. Four superforecasters sit around a table, laptops open, graphs displayed.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:**  
Well, the dust has settled. So, did Tether collapse?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:**  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 5.12%. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:**  
Given the data cutoff on July 29, we saw no significant signs. Tether held strong above $0.50, and trading never halted.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4:**  
True. Despite past regulatory fines and lack of audits, Tether maintained its position. Our model's accuracy was spot on again.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:**  
It's fascinating how the market confidence persisted. People still trust Tether's backing.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:**  
Indeed. But we must stay vigilant. The crypto world is unpredictable.

*They nod in agreement, turning back to their screens, ready to forecast the next big question.*

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

Five SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The Tether question was on everyone's mind. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
A collapse was unlikely. Tether's history of regulatory fines raised eyebrows, but stability prevailed.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The exchanges held firm. Binance, Coinbase, Uniswap—no suspensions or drastic price drops.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Coingecko never showed a dip below 0.50 USD for more than 7 days. Our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 5  
The market's resilience was underestimated. The asset reserves controversy didn't trigger panic.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Still, it was a close call. We had to factor in every variable, every rumor.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yet, in the end, our models proved accurate. Tether remains, for now.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis.

The room buzzes with tension as SUPERFORECASTER A, a seasoned analyst, reviews the data. SUPERFORECASTER B, a younger colleague, joins them.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
"Will Tether collapse before September 30, 2024? Our models had it at 3.75%."

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(surprised)  
"That low? Given Tether's past issues with transparency?"

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(nodding)  
"Yes, but remember, they shored up reserves after the fines. No significant blips on Binance, Coinbase, or Uniswap."

SUPERFORECASTER B  
"Yet, the market was jittery. Any signs of a shift?"

SUPERFORECASTER A  
"Not according to the data up to July 29. It held strong."

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(relieved)  
"So, no collapse. The models were spot-on."

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(smiling)  
"Indeed. Sometimes, the odds are just that—a probability."

They exchange knowing glances, confident in their predictions.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, papers and screens displaying data. The room buzzes with tension.

Our models had it at 15.75%. Tether held firm, despite the regulatory scrutiny and market volatility.

Remarkable resilience. Even with the lack of transparency, it maintained its peg.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Binance, Coinbase, and Uniswap showed no prolonged disruptions. Our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The probability was low, but not negligible. A testament to the market's unpredictable nature.
