**Will Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate before Election Day?**
The 2024 presidential debate schedule remains uncertain due to disagreements between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump had agreed to debate President Biden on Sept. 10, but after Biden withdrew, Trump pulled out of the ABC News debate, citing a defamation lawsuit against the network. Trump instead accepted a Fox News counterproposal for a Sept. 4 debate. Harris has publicly pressured Trump to meet her on stage for the ABC News debate, but it's unclear if they will face off in a formal debate. The Commission on Presidential Debates has planned traditional debates for September and October, but both Biden and Trump balked at letting the commission take charge this year. Instead, they agreed to their own rules and have two debates directly hosted by television networks: one by CNN and one by ABC News. The CNN debate occurred earlier this summer, and Harris is expected to soon announce her vice presidential candidate, who might face off against Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance in a debate.

Donald Trump has announced that he is willing to debate with Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's candidate, ahead of the 2024 US presidential elections.

Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have agreed to a debate on September 10 on ABC, moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis.

Harris has confirmed she will attend the debate, saying, 'I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States.' According to recent polls, Harris is leading Trump in three key swing states, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, with 50% of voters choosing Harris and 46% choosing Trump.

**Trump Agrees to Debate Harris on September 10, Proposes Two More Debates**
Former US President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have agreed to hold a debate on September 10, ahead of the US presidential election in November. Trump proposed holding three TV debates with his Democratic opponent in September. He said, 'We have agreed with Fox on September 4, with NBC on September 10, and with ABC on September 25.' He added, 'I hope she will agree.' Trump's campaign later confirmed that they have agreed to the original date of September 10 on ABC, and that the September 25 debate will be on NBC. Trump promised a 'peaceful transfer of power' and expressed his hope that the US presidential election will be 'fair.' He said, 'Of course, there will be a peaceful transfer of power, just like last time,' despite his supporters storming the Capitol after his loss to Biden. He added, 'I just hope the election will be fair.' Trump also announced that he has agreed with Fox News to hold a debate on September 4 with his Democratic opponent, but Harris did not agree. Trump responded by saying that Harris 'does not have the mental capacity to engage in a real debate with me... I will see her on September 4, or not at all.' Harris's campaign manager, Michael Tyler, said earlier that Trump should 'drop this game and attend the debate he promised to participate in on September 10 on ABC.' Harris launched her presidential campaign on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, announcing her candidacy for the 2024 presidential election after receiving the Democratic Party's nomination on Monday evening. She said, 'We will win Pennsylvania and our campaign is not just a battle against Donald Trump, but a battle for the future.' She added, 'We will not go back to the Trump era,' and the crowd repeated her: 'We will not go back.' A recent poll by Associated Press and the Norc Center found that one in five Americans believe that democracy will survive the 2024 presidential election. However, voters are disappointed with the election outcome, regardless of who wins between Trump and Harris. One in five Americans also believes that democracy has been severely damaged, to the point where it does not matter who wins. The poll found that 59% of Americans in general believe that the election outcome has threatened democracy, with 58% of Republicans and 67% of Democrats agreeing.

The 2024 presidential campaign is set to begin as a 90-day sprint, with both major party tickets now decided. Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, while former President Donald Trump has selected JD Vance as his running mate.

**Key Dates and Information for the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, with key dates including the Democratic National Convention (August 19-22), debates (September-October), and the election day on November 5.

The election process involves the Electoral College, where 538 electors will choose the president. The system is indirect voting, where people vote for electors who will then choose the president. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win. The election results will be projected on election night, but the final decision will be confirmed by the Electoral College votes.

**Trump Accepts Debate with Kamala Harris in September**
Donald Trump announced on his social media platform Truth Social that he has agreed to debate his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, on September 4. 'I have agreed to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4, on Fox News,' Trump wrote. However, it was unclear if Harris had accepted the invitation. This comes after Harris secured the necessary votes to become the Democratic Party's nominee for the November presidential election. Trump's candidacy for the White House took a turn last month when President Joe Biden, 81, abandoned his re-election bid and endorsed Harris. Biden's decision to withdraw came after a disastrous debate against Trump in June. A second debate between Trump and Biden was scheduled for September 10 on ABC, but a Trump spokesperson said it would be 'inappropriate' to hold it before Harris was formally the Democratic nominee. Harris has now secured the necessary 1,976 delegate votes to become the party's nominee, although the virtual voting of compromisarios will not officially end until next Monday.

Trump wrote on his social media platform 'Truth Social': 'I have agreed to a debate with Kamala Harris on Fox News on Wednesday, September 4', without it being clear if Harris has agreed to it. This comes after Harris was confirmed as the Democratic Party's nominee for the presidential election in November. The campaign has been turned upside down after President Joe Biden (81 years old) withdrew from the race on July 21 and endorsed Harris due to concerns about her age and decline in polls. Biden's withdrawal came after his poor performance in a televised debate with Trump organized by 'CNN' in June. The two candidates were scheduled to face each other in a second debate on September 10, organized by 'ABC'. While it is expected that this second debate will be maintained, Trump's spokesperson Stephen Chang announced last week that it is 'inappropriate' to agree on the debate before Harris is officially nominated. Trump provided some details about the location and moderators of the debate, stating that it will be held in front of an audience.

This date is convenient and appropriate in that it is just prior to the September 6th start of Early Voting in the 2024 Presidential Election.' Trump also stated, 'I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th. The Debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but has been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos, thereby creating a conflict of interest.'

**Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris for US Election 2024 - It's official but when is next Presidential debate?**
Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, will face off against Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris in the November 5 US Presidential election. Harris secured enough votes from Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee, according to Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison. The Trump campaign has not committed to a debate with Harris, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt stating that Trump welcomes the opportunity to compare records, but stopped short of confirming a debate. Recent polls show a tight contest between Harris and Trump, who had previously enjoyed a bigger lead over Joe Biden after their first debate. Trump emerged as the clear victor in his June 27 debate with Biden, whose faltering performance raised concerns about his age. The two had agreed to a second debate on September 10, but it is unclear if this will still take place.

**2024 Presidential Election Debate Schedule: Dates, Times, Who'll Be There & Who Won't**
The 2024 presidential election debate schedule has been outlined, with three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate set to take place. The debates will be hosted by nonpartisan organizations and will feature moderators from various networks.

The second debate will be hosted by Fox News and Rumble on August 23, and will feature a similar lineup of candidates. The Commission on Presidential Debates sets the schedule, which includes 90-minute debates starting at 9 p.m. ET. Kamala Harris has agreed to debate Donald Trump on September 10, but the GOP nominee's campaign had initially declined to commit until the Democratic nominee was formally decided.

'Democrats formally decide on their nominee,' said the GOP nominee's campaign, in response to Harris's announcement. 'We will not commit to any debates until then.'

**Donald Trump Agrees to Debate Kamala Harris Ahead of 2024 US Presidential Elections**
Donald Trump has announced that he is willing to debate with Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's candidate, ahead of the 2024 US presidential elections. Trump made the statement during an interview with Fox News, where he mentioned that the debate could take place before the early voting begins in September. The debate is expected to occur on September 10, with Harris confirming her attendance, stating that she will attend 'regardless of whether Donald Trump is there or not'. This comes after Trump criticized the timing of the second debate in the 2020 election, which took place after early voting had begun. Harris has not yet been officially designated as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, but is expected to receive the nomination at the party's convention on August 19, 2024.

**US Elections 2024: When Could Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Have Their First Debate?**
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have not confirmed a date for their first debate in the 2024 US Elections. Harris accused Trump of 'backtracking' in a debate, and Trump's campaign said it won't commit to any future debates until the Democratic Party formally selects its candidate. The decision of President Joe Biden to withdraw from the Democratic primary has put the previous debate plans in doubt. Although Biden and Trump had agreed to a debate on September 10, it's unclear if it will take place. Harris remains ready for the debate and believes voters deserve to see a direct comparison between the two candidates. Trump's campaign director, Steven Cheung, said it would be inappropriate to schedule a debate with Harris due to uncertainty over the Democratic candidate. Harris responded quickly on social media, questioning Trump's stance. The Democratic delegates are expected to confirm Harris as the candidate before August 7, while Trump received the official Republican nomination last week.

Former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump has stated that he would debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, but only after his official nomination. Trump's campaign said that he would not commit to any future debates until his condition is met.

He also mentioned that he did not agree to anything with Biden, but accepted a debate invitation. Kamala Harris is now the Democratic candidate for president after Biden's decision to not seek re-election. Biden announced his decision in a letter dated July 21, 2024, stating that he would focus on completing his presidential duties for the remainder of his term. The Democratic National Convention, to be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22, will be a crucial moment in defining the candidacy.

The Democratic Party plans to virtually nominate President Joe Biden as their candidate for the November elections before the end of July, according to sources close to the organization. This decision would put an end to the internal debate that has been ongoing for weeks, in which some voices had called for Biden to end his re-election campaign after his poor performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. The nomination will be made through a virtual 'roll call' process, where over 4,000 party delegates will cast their votes starting next Monday, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Biden's nomination will be officially accepted during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, scheduled for August 19-22.

**Democratic Committee Considers Nominating Biden for 2024 Presidential Election**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the 2024 presidential election by mid-July, following a major controversy after his debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, the decision aims to put an end to the widespread discussions within the party about replacing Biden after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter said that the likely date for Biden's official nomination is July 21. The Democrats had already planned to nominate Biden (81 years old) before the party's August convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set a final deadline of August 7 for selecting presidential candidates. Many major American media outlets have begun openly pressuring President Biden to withdraw from the election and leave the way open for a new Democratic nominee who can challenge Trump, who seems to have scored many points in the first presidential debate. The report stated that the Democratic National Committee has denied that the official nomination of Biden is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is Ohio's decision. The debate has sparked concern among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, four months before the election and about six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic members have ruled out replacing Biden and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election, and to mobilize Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.

The debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, hosted by CNN on June 27, will be the first of the 2024 election cycle and the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history. Typically, presidential debates are held in September or October, but this year's debate is scheduled earlier due to the candidates' quick wrapping up of their party's nominations and the decision to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The campaigns agreed to hold earlier debates to allow candidates to face the American people before voters go to the polls. In past elections, the first debate would take place after some states started sending out mail-in ballots, but this year's debate will take place before that. By agreeing to the earlier schedule, Biden and Trump seem to want to ensure that every voter is well-informed before submitting a ballot.
