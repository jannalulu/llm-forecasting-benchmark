Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Current situation (Sept 2024):
- The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently around 7%
- Less than a month until resolution date
- Federal Reserve's recent actions and statements suggest they're committed to bringing inflation down but may be done with rate hikes

2. Key factors to consider:
- Short timeframe (about 3 weeks) limits potential for major changes
- Federal Reserve meeting in September could impact rates
- Recent economic data showing cooling inflation
- Housing market remains constrained by high rates
- Market expectations for Fed rate cuts later in 2024

3. Analysis:
- Very short time horizon means dramatic moves are less likely
- Recent trend has been relatively stable in the 6.5-7% range
- Fed unlikely to make major policy changes before October 1
- Economic conditions would need to change significantly for rates to drop below 6.35% in such a short time
- Current spreads and market dynamics suggest rates will likely remain elevated

Given all these factors, particularly the short timeframe and current rate levels, there is a very high probability the rate will remain above 6.35% on October 1, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 95.50%, with 90.50% being the most likely. Probability: 90.50%.
