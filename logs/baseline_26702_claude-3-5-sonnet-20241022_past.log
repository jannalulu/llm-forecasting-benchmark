Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The target date is September 29, 2024, about 2 months from now
2. Current market cap (July 25) is $2.35T
3. We're looking for the market cap to be between $1.5T and $2T

Key considerations:
- Crypto markets are highly volatile
- The recent Bitcoin ETF approvals have brought new institutional money
- We're in a pre-halving period for Bitcoin
- Historical volatility suggests significant price movements are common in 2-month periods
- Current price is above the target range, meaning we need a moderate decline
- A drop from $2.35T to between $1.5T-$2T represents a decline of 15-36%

Given:
- Such drops are fairly common in crypto
- But strong institutional presence may reduce volatility
- Pre-halving periods traditionally show strength
- Current momentum is positive
- Two months is a relatively short timeframe for such a specific range

Based on these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of hitting this specific range, but it's more likely to stay above $2T given current trends.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 35.75%, with 30.25% being the most likely. Probability: 30.25%.
