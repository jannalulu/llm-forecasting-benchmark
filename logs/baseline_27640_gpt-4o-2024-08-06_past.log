To assess the likelihood of YouTube being banned in Russia before October 1, 2024, we'll consider several factors:

1. **Current Media Environment**: Russia has been known to control media and internet platforms, especially in the context of political tensions and information warfare. However, YouTube, being a major global platform with substantial Russian viewership and content creators, might be more resistant to an outright ban compared to smaller sites.

2. **Internet Bans in Russia**: Historically, Russia has banned platforms it considers contrary to national interests, such as LinkedIn. Additionally, Roskomnadzor, Russia's regulatory body, has periodically restricted access to various digital platforms based on compliance issues or content disputes.

3. **Political Climate**: The political climate and international relations—particularly with Western countries—could significantly influence this decision. If tensions were to escalate further, YouTube could be perceived as a source of undesirable content or foreign influence.

4. **Economic and Social Impact**: Banning YouTube could lead to considerable backlash given its massive user base and economic implications for content creators within Russia. This could potentially deter such a ban unless the government perceives overriding national security concerns.

5. **Precedent and Trends (as of August 2024)**: Up to now, while there have been threats or discussions about restricting platforms like YouTube, full bans on major platforms have been rare. Moreover, Roskomnadzor might prefer imposing fines or specific content restrictions over an outright block.

Given these factors and the proximity to the date in question, it is somewhat less likely that YouTube will be completely banned within Russia barring a significant escalation in the socio-political environment.

My Prediction: 22.50% is the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.
