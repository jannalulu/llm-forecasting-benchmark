Nate Silver: [sipping coffee] Well, Phil, another Olympics in the books. That men's pole vault final was something else.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Even with Duplantis's world record of 6.24m earlier this year, our models were remarkably precise about the Olympic record staying intact.

Nate: [nodding] Our models had it at 35.20%. Despite Duplantis being the clear favorite, we knew the Olympic environment brings unique pressures. The heat in Paris and the evening schedule were significant factors.

Philip: The suspension of Braz added an interesting dynamic, but historical data showed that Olympic records are particularly resilient. Even with Duplantis's dominance, breaking 6.03m in Olympic competition is a different beast altogether.

Nate: [examining charts] The data from the qualifying rounds supported our conservative estimate. Sometimes being the overwhelming favorite adds its own kind of pressure.

Here's a script set on August 7th, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office, Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another Olympics in the books. That men's pole vault final was something else."

Phil: "Indeed. Even with Mondo Duplantis's incredible 6.24m world record earlier this year, our models had it at 82.45%. The combination of Olympic pressure, weather conditions in Paris, and historical data about Olympic records made it far from certain."

Nate: "Exactly. While Duplantis was clearly the favorite, Olympic records are notoriously difficult to break. Remember, Braz's 6.03m stood for eight years despite numerous attempts."

Phil: "The data we had up to mid-July showed Duplantis in peak form, but Olympic finals have their own unique pressure. Our models factored in everything from wind conditions to the psychological impact of performing on the biggest stage."

[They both nod knowingly, reviewing their predictive charts]

[Scene: A coffee shop in Paris, morning after the men's pole vault final]

Nate Silver [stirring coffee]: "Well, Phil, another Olympics in the books. That men's pole vault final was something else."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at our prediction models from July 17th, we had it at 85.50% probability of Braz's Olympic record being broken. With Duplantis in peak form after setting that 6.24m world record earlier this year, it seemed almost inevitable."

Silver: "The data was compelling. Duplantis had cleared 6.03m or better in seven competitions this season alone. Plus, with Braz's suspension, there was no defending champion factor to consider."

Tetlock: "What's fascinating is how our models accounted for the ideal evening conditions in Paris and Duplantis's historical performance in major championships. The only significant variable was potential injury or an off day."

Silver: "Once again, the numbers told the story before it unfolded."
