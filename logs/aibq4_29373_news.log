**53 million Americans cast early ballots ahead of election**
According to the University of Florida's Election Lab, over 53 million Americans have cast early ballots ahead of the national election. This includes 27 million in-person voters and 25.6 million mail-in voters. Notably, more Democrats (10,217,524) have voted early than Republicans (9,479,998), with approximately 6.1 million voters not affiliated with either major party also participating.

**Republicans shift strategy, embrace early voting ahead of election**
With former President Donald Trump's encouragement, Republicans are shifting their strategy and embracing early voting ahead of the election. This is a change from 2020, when Trump turned against mail voting and convinced his supporters to wait until Election Day to cast their ballots. According to Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida, 'The Democrats are still, as far as I can tell, banking more early votes. It’s just less of a disadvantage for Republicans.' However, it's unclear what this means for the election, as the early vote data only reveals whether voters are registered with a party, not who they are voting for. Republicans seem to be making up ground by voting early in-person in most competitive states, but they still lag behind Democrats in mail balloting. Trump said, 'I am telling everyone to vote early,' on a radio show last week, and it appears that his message is being heard. In North Carolina, for example, Republicans are only ahead by 1 percentage point this year, compared to a 30-point lead for Democrats at this point in 2022.

**GOP Still Leads on Generic Congressional Ballot**
Less than a month before Election Day, Republicans have a two-point lead in their battle to maintain their narrow House majority. According to the latest Rasmussen Reports national survey, 47% of Likely U.S. Voters would vote for the Republican candidate, while 45% would vote for the Democrat. The GOP's advantage has shrunk since August, when they led by five points. The survey also found that Republicans have a 10-point advantage among independents, with 45% of independents voting Republican and 35% voting Democrat. The 'gender gap' in the generic ballot has changed slightly, with men now favoring Republicans by a seven-point margin, while women voters are almost evenly divided. The survey also broke down the electorate by income categories, with voters earning more than $100,000 a year favoring Democrats, while Republicans lead by 14 points among those with annual incomes between $30,000 and $50,000.

**Nearly 45 million Americans cast early ballots ahead of Election Day**
According to the University of Florida's Election Lab, nearly 45 million Americans have cast early ballots ahead of next week's Election Day. The division is nearly evenly split between those who have gone to polling stations early and those who have mailed in their ballots. In states where party affiliation data is available, slightly more Democrats (8.79 million) than Republicans (7.95 million) have voted early. An average of polling compiled by the RealClearPolitics website shows Trump and Harris in a virtual dead heat nationally, but Trump leads in key battleground states. He leads by 0.1% in Michigan, 0.3% in Wisconsin, 0.5% in Pennsylvania, 0.7% in Nevada, and 0.8% in North Carolina. To win the election, either candidate needs to secure 270 Electoral College votes, which are allocated to states based on their population. The winner-take-all model is followed in most states, except for Nebraska and Maine, which allocate their votes proportionally based on their final outcomes.

**Almost 42m Americans cast early votes ahead of November 5 presidential election**
More than 41 million Americans have cast their ballots through early voting, either in person or by mail, ahead of the November 5 presidential election. This significant early turnout is expected to play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Historically, Democrats are more likely to vote early or by mail, while Republicans often favor in-person voting on Election Day. However, this year, Republicans have encouraged supporters to vote early, resulting in an increase in early Republican turnout compared to 2020. As a result, the 'blue shift' or 'red mirage' in swing states may be less pronounced, where initial tallies favor Republicans, only to shift toward Democrats as mail-in ballots are counted.

**'We are making history.' Republicans surge ahead in Miami-Dade early voting**
Republicans are leading in early voting in Miami-Dade, with a six-point edge over Democrats in the nearly 500,000 ballots cast. This is a significant shift from four years ago, when Democrats were ahead by 12 points. Republicans are dominating early voting, with nearly 137,000 ballots cast in person, while Democrats have about 89,000 mail-in ballots. Democrats are counting on coattails from Vice President Kamala Harris to deliver a win for countywide candidates, but Republicans see momentum for their own candidates. 'We are making history,' said Florida Rep. Alex Rizo, a Republican from Hialeah. 'We are going to have the greatest turnout in Miami-Dade history.' Democrats are pointing to the Republican-led change in the state's voting law in 2021 and a DeSantis ad and turnout operation aimed at defeating proposed constitutional amendments as factors contributing to their struggles. 'Let's put it all on the table. The investments in communities matter,' said Florida Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat from Miami Gardens. 'We're going to have to run up the score this week. We're also going to have to dominate on Election Day,' said Christian Ulvert, the Levine Cava campaign guru.

**Republicans ahead of 2020 pace in casting votes early**
In the 2024 election, 41% of registered Republicans have already voted, compared to 38% of Democrats and 30% of unaffiliated voters. This is a shift from past years, where early voting leaned Democratic and election day voting leaned Republican. According to data, more Democrats are waiting to vote later this year than they did in 2020, while more than half of Republicans have voted earlier than they did in 2020. 'This is a core constituency of Democrats winning statewide, and they have to have turnout rates equal to, if not slightly above, what we see,' said Bitzer. 'And right now, the numbers just don't seem to point in that direction.' Early voting ends on Saturday at 3 PM, and only registered voters can vote on Election Day, November 5.

**Explainer: Why we may not know the winner of the US presidential election on Nov. 5**
The US presidential election on Nov. 5 may not have a clear winner on election night due to the complex process of counting votes. In 2020, some states experienced a 'red mirage' where Trump was leading initially, only to be overtaken by Biden as more votes were counted. This year, changes in voting rules and mail-in ballots may lead to similar delays. For example, in Arizona, mail ballots dropped off on Election Day cannot be processed until the polls have closed, while in Georgia, all early votes must be counted and reported by 8 p.m. ET on election night. In Nevada, mail voting has grown popular, and late-arriving mail ballots historically favor Democrats, which could lead to a shift toward Harris as votes are counted after Election Day. In North Carolina, the outcome may remain unclear for a week or more due to absentee ballots and overseas/military votes. In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the lack of mail ballot processing before Election Day may lead to delays in reporting results. As election officials start processing and scanning mail ballots ahead of Election Day, the first reported results will likely be mostly mail ballots and early in-person votes, which could favor Harris initially, before Trump closes the gap as Election Day votes are counted.

**Behind Florida Republicans in presidential election early voting, Democrats implore their voters to head to the polls**
Florida Democrats are urging their voters to cast ballots in the presidential election, as Republicans have a significant lead in early voting. According to Kristen Browde, president of the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus, 'Democrats in particular are unusually behind in getting their votes out.' State Rep. Daryl Campbell implored Democrats to take advantage of early voting, saying 'The urgency is now. We do not want folks to wait.' Campbell also expressed concern that some Black men may feel their votes won't make a difference, leading to apathy. However, Broward's Democratic state committeeman Alfredo Olvera believes the picture will look better for Democrats after the first full weekend of in-person early voting. State Rep. Christine Hunschofsky said she expects a 'turnaround this weekend' and encouraged voters to cast their ballots in person or by mail.

**Looks Like America May Not Know Who Won The Election For Days Again**
The American public may not know who the next president will be for days after Election Day on Nov. 5, as several key swing states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, may take several days to declare results. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin do not allow mail ballots to be processed until Election Day morning, which could lead to delays in determining the winner. In contrast, North Carolina allows election workers to begin scanning and processing votes in advance of Election Day, but the final results may still remain unknown for days after Nov. 5 due to state law allowing for mail ballots to be counted over a 10-day period. Georgia and Nevada have made changes to their voting rules, but the results may still be delayed due to the counting of late mail ballots, which tend to favor Democrats. Michigan has also made changes to its voting rules, allowing officials to start processing and tabulating mail ballots eight days in advance of Nov. 5, in an effort to more quickly announce the winner in the 2024 cycle.

**Millions of Americans flock to early voting, in person and via mail**
Nearly 30 million Americans have cast their ballots ahead of Election Day, with 13 million voting in person and 17 million submitting mail-in ballots. The University of Florida's election lab expects the total number of early votes to increase significantly in the days leading up to Election Day on Nov. 5. The presidential race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump is still up for grabs, with several battleground states being rated as toss-ups. Early voting is higher in several purple states, with Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia receiving at least 1.2 million early ballots. Democrats have cast nearly 42% of ballots, while Republicans have submitted 35%, and other voters have sent in about 23%. Control of the U.S. House is still uncertain, with Republicans slightly favored to win 212 seats, but Democrats holding onto at least 209 seats. The U.S. Senate is leaning slightly toward Republican control, with GOP candidates on track to pick up seats in West Virginia and Montana. However, control of the House might not be announced on election night, or for several days afterward. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Suzan DelBene said, 'This is obviously a priority for us, and some of these races are very, very close, so we want to make sure we’re there to help make sure ballots are counted across the country.'

**Election 2024 | Republicans running ahead in Florida voting. Democrats slightly ahead in South Florida.**
In the 2024 presidential election, Republicans are leading in Florida voting, with a 300,000-vote statewide lead over Democrats after four days of early voting. According to Wendy Sartory Link, Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections, 'It is gangbusters,' referring to the enthusiastic response from voters. The numbers show that Republicans are turning out in greater total numbers and at a higher percentage of registered Republicans than Democrats. However, Democrats are outpolling Republicans in Broward and Palm Beach counties, but not enough to overcome the Republican leanings of the rest of the state. In-person early voting is higher in 2024 than in 2020, while mail balloting is lower this year. Link attributes this to a combination of people returning to pre-pandemic methods of voting and changes in state law that mean mail ballot requests expire sooner than they used to.

**Election | Republicans running ahead in Florida voting. Democrats slightly ahead in South Florida.**
In Florida, Republicans are leading in early voting, with a 300,000-vote statewide lead over Democrats, according to data from Friday morning. Republicans have cast 1.5 million ballots, which is 27.3% of the state's registered Republicans, while Democrats have cast 1.2 million ballots, which is 25.3% of the state's registered Democrats. In-person early voting is higher in 2024 than it was in 2020, while mail balloting is lower this year. Palm Beach County is seeing a higher turnout than Broward and Miami-Dade counties, with 29.2% of registered voters having cast ballots as of Friday morning. Democrats are outpolling Republicans in Broward and Palm Beach counties, but not enough to overcome the Republican leanings of the rest of the state. 'It is gangbusters,' said Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link about early voting. 'I'm pleased with voter turnout so far. Our early voting numbers are slightly higher than expected,' said Broward Supervisor of Elections Joe Scott. Link added that early voting turnout is 'a little bit more than I expected.'

**Fact check: Why the winner of the U.S. presidential election may not be known on Nov. 5**
The winner of the U.S. presidential election between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump may not be known on Nov. 5 due to the time it takes to count mail ballots. In 2020, some states experienced a 'red mirage' where Mr. Trump was leading initially, only for a 'blue shift' to see Mr. Biden overtake him. Democrats tend to live in more populous urban areas and have embraced mail voting more readily than Republicans. In Arizona, nearly 90% of voters cast their ballots early, mostly by mail, in 2020. In Georgia, officials expect 65-70% of ballots to be cast at early poll locations. Michigan has instituted early in-person voting and allowed jurisdictions to begin processing and tabulating mail ballots eight days before election day. Nevada's slow vote counting in 2020 meant news outlets did not call the state for Mr. Biden until five days after election day. Election officials start processing and scanning mail ballots ahead of election day, with full results expected by midnight. Ms. Harris may appear to lead early thanks to mail ballots, while Mr. Trump could close the gap as election day votes are counted. The outcome in North Carolina may remain unclear for a week or more due to the 10-day canvass period for absentee ballots. Pennsylvania did not have a clear winner in 2020 until four days after election day, as officials sifted through a huge backlog of mail ballots. Wisconsin is among the few states that do not allow election officials to process or count mail ballots until the morning of the election, which can lead to a delay in reporting the results of those early votes. 'It is the only battleground that accepts late-arriving mail ballots,' said officials. 'Any ballot postmarked by Nov. 5 will still be counted if it arrives within four days.' Those late ballots historically favour Democrats, so a shift toward Ms. Harris could occur as votes are counted after election day.

**Millions of Americans flock to early voting, in person & via mail**
Nearly 30 million Americans have cast their ballots ahead of Election Day, with 13 million voting in person and 17 million submitting mail-in ballots. The University of Florida's election lab reports that early voting is higher in several battleground states, including Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, which have each received at least 1.2 million early ballots. Democrats have cast nearly 42% of ballots, while Republicans have submitted 35%, and other voters have sent in about 23%. In Arizona, Republican early voting is outpacing Democratic turnout, but women, who favor Democratic candidates, have cast nearly 52% of the early ballots. Control of the U.S. House and Senate is still up in the air, with Sabato's Crystal Ball projecting that Republicans are slightly favored to win 212 House seats, but Democrats are holding onto at least 209 seats. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is working to ensure that Americans who want to vote have an opportunity to do so, and control of the House might not be announced on election night or for several days afterward. The Senate is leaning slightly toward Republican control, with GOP candidates on track to pick up seats in West Virginia and Montana.

**Are Republicans or Democrats ahead in Maricopa County early ballot returns? Follow the results**
More than 600,000 Phoenix-area voters have already cast ballots in the 2024 general election, with Republicans currently leading by about 80,000 ballots in the returns. According to early ballot return data, Republicans are returning ballots at a higher rate than Democrats, despite Democrats requesting fewer mailed ballots. The ballot returns show increased voter interest in the presidential cycle, with more people voting this election than in 2022. However, returns are lagging those of 2020, although there has been an uptick in recent days. Notably, early voting is up among young people, with a significant increase in the number of voters aged 18 to 25 who have voted so far.

**Early Voting Continues in the US Ahead of Presidential Election**
In the United States, over 28 million voters have cast their early ballots for the upcoming presidential election on November 5. According to NBC News, a total of 28.6 million people have voted early in states where early voting is allowed, with approximately 43% of those voters registered as Democrats and 39% as Republicans. In swing states such as Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin, early voting is ongoing, with around 25% of voters in North Carolina and Georgia having already cast their early ballots. Early voting will continue in many states until election day, with mail-in and in-person ballots being counted along with those cast on election day. In the 2020 presidential election, a record 66.6% of eligible voters participated, with over 159 million people casting their ballots.

**Opinion: Arizona Democrats have dismal early voting numbers, but it's fine?**
Arizona Democrats are trailing behind Republicans in early voting numbers, with 42% of early ballots returned coming from Republican voters, compared to 36% from Democrats. This is a concerning trend for Democrats, who point to the length of the ballot and the number of propositions as reasons for the slow pace. However, Republican strategists are optimistic, noting that if Democrats don't upshift their early voting efforts, Republicans can lay in a stock of election night champagne. As Democratic consultant Tony Cani said, 'The reality is, regardless of reason, there are more Democrats out there that need to get their ballots in and soon.' The deadline for mailing in a ballot is Oct. 29, but early ballots can be dropped off until the polls close on Election Day.

**'Trump will win if early voting trends hold, and that's a big if...' - Times of India**
Analyst Mark Halperin predicts that if the current early voting trends hold, Donald Trump will win the election. Republicans are outperforming Democrats in early voting in battleground states like Nevada and North Carolina. In North Carolina, Democrats had a 30 percentage point lead in early voting at this point in 2022, but this time they are ahead by just 1 percentage point. In Nevada, 1,000 more Republicans than Democrats have cast early ballots. Halperin notes that early voting numbers need to be tracked 'day to day' and are 'more important than the polls right now' because they give insight into factors contributing to Republican overperformance in early voting. However, he also cautions that it's not known who is casting these ballots or how they are voting. 'If this continues, Donald Trump can't lose because the Democrats can't possibly do well enough on Election Day,' Halperin said. As many as 21 million Americans have already cast their vote ahead of the election day on November 5.

**More Republicans are voting early than in recent years, helping break records before Election Day - WTOP News**
With former President Donald Trump's encouragement, Republicans are voting early again, breaking records in key states like Georgia and North Carolina. This shift is seen as an attempt to fix a mechanical problem that some in the party blame for costing it the 2020 presidential and key 2022 elections. Trump told voters in North Carolina, 'I need you to vote and I need you to go to the polls before Election Day because they will try on Election Day to keep you home.' Republicans seem to be responding, with a significant increase in early voting in North Carolina and Nevada. However, it's unclear what this means for the election, as the early vote data only reveals party affiliation, not who voters are supporting. Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida, said, 'The Democrats are still, as far as I can tell, banking more early votes. It's just less of a disadvantage for Republicans.' Despite this, Republicans still lag behind Democrats in mail balloting, particularly in Pennsylvania, where they've sent in over 300,000 fewer mail ballots than Democrats.

Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida, noted, 'The Democrats are still banking more early votes, but it's less of a disadvantage for Republicans.' Despite this, Republicans still lag behind Democrats in mail voting, particularly in Pennsylvania, where they've sent in over 300,000 fewer mail ballots.

**Republicans shift strategy, embrace early voting ahead of election**
With former President Donald Trump's encouragement, Republicans are shifting their strategy and embracing early voting ahead of the election. This is a change from 2020, when Trump turned against mail voting and convinced his supporters to wait until Election Day to cast their ballots. According to Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida, 'The Democrats are still, as far as I can tell, banking more early votes. It’s just less of a disadvantage for Republicans.' However, it's unclear what this means for the election, as the early vote data only reveals whether voters are registered with a party, not who they are voting for. Republicans seem to be making up ground by voting early in-person in most competitive states, but they still lag behind Democrats in mail balloting. Trump said, 'I am telling everyone to vote early,' on a radio show last week, and it appears that his message is being heard. In North Carolina, for example, Republicans are only ahead by 1 percentage point this year, compared to a 30-point lead for Democrats at this point in 2022.

**What early voting polls say about the 2024 election**
Millions of Americans have already cast their ballots in the 2024 election, with Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump among early voters, according to preliminary polling. However, the lead is not indicative of who is ahead overall, as Trump is ahead among those who plan to vote on Election Day. Harris has a significant lead among early voters, with 63% to 34% in a survey released by USA Today and Suffolk University. Trump has repeatedly claimed that mail-in voting options invite election fraud, but has recently encouraged voters to turn in a ballot in any way they can. As of Monday, nearly 14.5 million people have cast a mail-in or in-person ballot, with 46% of those voters being Democrats and 29% being registered Republicans. Most forecasters have projected this year's matchup between Harris and Trump as a toss-up, with Harris leading by 1.8 points on average across national polling. However, the polling site FiveThirtyEight's election model favors Trump to win the Electoral College, 52% to 48%.

**Trump Gaining Momentum in Final Stretch, but Polls Diverge**
With less than two weeks to go before the US presidential election, polls are still unclear on who will win, but they do show that Republican candidate Donald Trump is gaining momentum. According to Project 538, a monitoring system that compiles results from various polls, Trump has a 52% chance of winning compared to 48% for Kamala Harris. This is the first time since Harris took over the Democratic nomination that Trump has been ahead. However, Project 538 still maintains that the outcome is 'like a coin toss' and that 'some good polls for Harris could easily put her back in the lead tomorrow.' Trump's lead is mainly due to his advantage in the key state of Pennsylvania, where he now has a 0.2% lead, up from Harris' 0.6% lead earlier. In Michigan, Harris has lost ground, going from a 1.8% lead to a 0.4% lead. Arizona and Georgia, which were previously close, have now shifted in favor of the Republican candidate. However, Real Clean Polling's compilation of recent polls shows Harris in the lead, with a 49.2% chance of winning compared to 48.3% for Trump. The polls used by Real Clean Polling do diverge, with some showing Trump ahead and others showing Harris with a significant lead. 'It's a very different scenario than in 2020,' said the Real Clean Polling analysis, 'when Joe Biden had a 7.5% lead at this time, and now Harris has a 0.9% lead.'

**NBC News poll of early voters shows partisan divide**
A recent NBC News poll of early voters found that 5% of registered voters have already cast their ballots, with 47% planning to vote early, bringing the total to 52% of Americans voting ahead of Election Day. The partisan divide remains strong, with Vice President Harris leading among early voters and Trump leading among those who plan to vote on Election Day.

The survey was conducted among 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.

**Here We Go: Top Pennsylvania Election Official Says to Expect Several Days to Process and Count the Ballots – Just Like 2020 When Trump Was Ahead by 675,012 Votes on Election Day!**
Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt expects several days to process and count the ballots, similar to the 2020 election when President Trump was ahead by 675,012 votes on Election Day. Schmidt stated, 'Unlike most other states, we cannot begin processing mail-in ballots before 7 AM on election morning, which means we cannot know the male vote by midnight on election night.' This technical issue, which has not been addressed by the legislature in the last four years, led to a week-long counting process in 2020, during which Democrats added over one million votes to Joe Biden's totals behind locked doors. The 2020 election in Pennsylvania was marred by allegations of fraud and irregularities, with President Trump leading by 12.7% on Election night before Biden pulled ahead by 6,826 votes on Friday morning.

**Democrats surge ahead in North Carolina voting as Helene upends election**
Registered Democrats in North Carolina have taken an early lead in returning mail votes, with 9,075 votes returned compared to 5,595 by registered Republicans and 8,240 by unaffiliated voters. According to VoteHub.us, the source is the North Carolina State Board of Elections. The loosening of rules to make it easier for voters in areas devastated by Hurricane Helene has contributed to the surge in Democratic votes. The state's Board of Elections has approved emergency measures to help victims vote in November's elections, including extending the deadline for mail-in ballot requests and allowing voters to drop off completed ballots on Election Day. North Carolina is a key battleground state in the presidential election, with Trump leading by 0.8 points on average, according to FiveThirtyEight.

**GOP Still Leads on Generic Congressional Ballot**
Less than a month before Election Day, Republicans have a two-point lead in their battle to maintain their narrow House majority. According to the latest Rasmussen Reports national survey, 47% of Likely U.S. Voters would vote for the Republican candidate, while 45% would vote for the Democrat. The GOP's advantage has shrunk since August, when they led by five points. The survey also found that Republicans have a 10-point advantage among independents, with 45% of independents voting Republican and 35% voting Democrat. The 'gender gap' in the generic ballot has changed slightly, with men now favoring Republicans by a seven-point margin, while women voters are almost evenly divided. The survey also broke down the electorate by income categories, with voters earning more than $100,000 a year favoring Democrats, while Republicans lead by 14 points among those with annual incomes between $30,000 and $50,000.

**Revenge of the Late Deciders**
Thirty-one days before the election, Vice President Kamala Harris is leading former President Donald Trump by 2.6 points in national polls. However, the swing state shift could affect the outcome, with Trump performing better in these states. Harris needs to prevent a late stampede of Trump-skeptical Republicans to Trump and is campaigning with former Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. J.D. Vance to pick off late deciders. Trump has already matched his final number from 2020, and if he increases his share in the final month as much as he did in 2020, he would finish with 50.3% of the national popular vote. The polling average shows that Harris would win with 49.9% to Trump's 48.1% if she nabs half of the last voters to choose, but if Trump gets nearly two-thirds of the final 2% of voters who decide, he might win. The generic ballot also shows Democrats leading by 1.8 points, but Republicans are gaining ground. The article also discusses various battleground polls, including Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where Harris is leading, and Georgia, where Trump is ahead. Additionally, it mentions the threat of the Green Party spoiler in Wisconsin and the Democrats' fight against Georgia's order to hand-count ballots.

**Troubling signs for the GOP on mail voting**
Despite efforts by some Republican leaders to encourage their voters to use mail and absentee voting, the party still lags behind Democrats in this method. According to recent polls, just 14% of Republicans plan to vote by mail or absentee ballot, compared to 34% of Democrats. This partisan gap is similar to what was seen in 2020 and 2022, with Democrats holding a 2-to-1 edge in intent to vote by mail. When including early voting, Democrats appear poised to gain a similar pre-Election Day advantage. Republican pollster Bill McInturff noted, 'Either the margin has to close among [those] voting early, or Republican margins on Election Day have to be bigger' than they currently are. However, it's unclear if these numbers will hold as fewer voters overall are planning to use these methods, and the impact of Trump's continued criticism of mail voting remains to be seen.

**Half of voters plan to cast ballots early, with a huge partisan split**
According to a recent NBC News poll, 51% of registered voters plan to vote early this fall, with a significant partisan split. Democrats are leading among early voters, with Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump 61%-35%. In contrast, Trump leads by 20 points among voters who plan to vote on Election Day. Republican pollster Bill McInturff noted that 'Either the margin has to close among [those] voting early, or Republican margins on Election Day have to be bigger than this to win.' The poll shows a dramatic shift from previous election cycles, where majorities planned to vote on Election Day. The partisan difference among early and Election Day voters remains, despite a decrease in the share of voters planning to vote early since the 2020 pandemic.

**Several US states making late changes to election rules ahead of voting**
Several US states are making last-minute changes to their election rules ahead of the November election. In Georgia, election workers will have to hand-count the number of ballots cast after voting is completed, which could delay the reporting of results. In Arizona, counties will have to hand-count ballot envelopes that are dropped off at polling centers on Election Day. In Wisconsin, ballot drop boxes are newly legal again, although not every voting jurisdiction will use them. In North Carolina, students and university staff can use their digital IDs to vote. These changes are causing confusion for voters and election officials, according to Megan Bellamy, vice president of law and policy for the Voting Rights Lab. 'Election season is underway. Lawmakers, administrative bodies and courts must recognise that,' she said. Other changes include new rules for early and mailed ballots, verifying voter identity, and post-election processes. Democrats have sued to block new rules in Georgia that could be used to refuse certification of election results.

**Here's what Ohioans need to know ahead of Election Day**
The Franklin County Board of Elections in Ohio reports that 890,000 people are registered to vote in the upcoming presidential election. To vote, individuals must be registered by October 7, and early voting begins on October 8. The board will mail absentee ballots and release sample ballots on their website. Aaron Sellers, with the Franklin County Board of Elections, emphasized the importance of efficiency during the voting process, stating, 'The faster you can get in, get out so that we can get other voters to get processed because presidential cycles by far are the biggest turnout.' He also noted that the county had a 72% turnout in the 2020 election, which is 'very high.' The board has secured 3,100 poll workers out of the 5,200 needed, with 50% being Democrats and 50% being Republicans. They will undergo training on September 18 and work in bipartisan teams during the election process, with Sellers stating, 'We have specific rooms in this office that can't be accessed by a single person. There's not one thing that's done in the process that's not done in a bipartisan way and it's a checks and balance.'
