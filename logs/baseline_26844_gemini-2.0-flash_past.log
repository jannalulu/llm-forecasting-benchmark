Okay, let's analyze the likelihood of Edmundo González conceding the 2024 Venezuelan election to Maduro before September 1, 2024.

Several factors suggest a low probability of concession:

*   **Opposition Unity and Resolve:** The opposition has coalesced around González, suggesting a shared commitment to challenging Maduro. Conceding prematurely would betray this unified front.
*   **Allegations of Electoral Irregularities:** The opposition is likely to allege widespread fraud if Maduro wins, which would make a concession politically untenable. Conceding would undermine any attempt to investigate or challenge the results.
*   **International Pressure:** Several international actors may dispute the election's legitimacy if Maduro wins under questionable circumstances. Conceding would weaken the international community's ability to pressure Maduro's regime.
*   **Time Remaining:** There's very little time remaining before the September 1st deadline.

There are, however, some factors that could potentially lead to a concession:

*   **Overwhelming Maduro Victory:** If Maduro's victory is perceived as overwhelming, despite irregularities, González might concede to avoid further conflict or repression. However, even in this case, the opposition is more likely to maintain claims of fraud without formally conceding.
*   **Intense Pressure/Threats:** Extreme pressure or threats against González and his supporters could force a concession. This is a real possibility given the nature of the Maduro regime.
*   **Negotiated Settlement:** An unlikely but possible scenario is a negotiated settlement where González concedes in exchange for certain concessions from the regime. However, with the little time remaining, this outcome seems exceptionally unlikely.

Given the very short time frame and the factors listed above, I believe that Edmundo González will likely not concede the election to Maduro before September 1, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
