[Scene: A dimly lit café in Paris, September 1st, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are discussing over coffee]

Tetlock: Well, Nate, yesterday's confirmation was quite something. Our models were spot on again.

Silver: Indeed, Phil. With the three-way split in the National Assembly after those summer snap elections, our models gave Macron's Together coalition only a 32% chance of maintaining the Prime Minister position.

Tetlock: The fragmentation was too severe. The political gridlock between Together, NFP, and National Rally made it nearly impossible for Macron to maintain control. Looking back at the data we had by late July, the coalition-building attempts were failing.

Silver: Exactly. The roughly equal size of the three caucuses meant that any PM would need cross-alliance support. Our models captured the growing likelihood of a compromise candidate from outside Together. The 32% probability reflected the slim chance of Macron pulling off a last-minute deal.

Tetlock: Another win for superforecasting methodology.

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the French PM situation."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the fragmented National Assembly after those summer snap elections, our models had it at 32% that Macron's Together coalition would retain the premiership."

Nate: "The three-way split between NFP, Together, and National Rally made it incredibly difficult for any single bloc to command a majority. The polarization between left and right made cross-coalition agreements nearly impossible."

Philip: "Exactly. The key factor in our models was the historical precedent of French cohabitation during divided governments. When no coalition holds a clear majority, the likelihood of the President's party maintaining the premiership drops significantly."

Nate: "The data from the June-July snap elections was particularly telling. The near-equal distribution of seats practically guaranteed this outcome."

Tetlock: Well, Nate, our models were spot on again about the French PM situation.

Silver: Indeed, Phil. Given the fragmented National Assembly after those summer snap elections, our models had it at 32% probability that Macron's Together coalition would retain the premiership.

Tetlock: The three-way split between NFP, Together, and National Rally made it incredibly difficult for any single bloc to command a majority. Our data showed Macron's declining influence and the growing opposition from both left and right.

Silver: The political gridlock was evident in the data. Even with Macron's constitutional powers, forming a government from his Together alliance was always going to be an uphill battle. The coalition-building dynamics after those snap elections in June and July really shifted the probabilities against him.

Tetlock: Another validation of probabilistic forecasting in complex political scenarios.

Tetlock: Well, Nate, another fascinating political prediction in the books. The fragmented National Assembly really made this one interesting.

Silver: Indeed, Phil. Our models had it at 32% probability of Macron's Together coalition maintaining the Prime Minister position. The three-way split between Together, NFP, and National Rally created a perfect storm of political instability.

Tetlock: The snap elections in June and July were crucial data points. When we saw the nearly equal distribution of seats among the three major blocs, our models immediately flagged the difficulty Macron would have in maintaining control.

Silver: The historical precedent of divided parliaments in the Fifth Republic, combined with the rising opposition to Macron's policies, made this outcome quite predictable. Though 32% wasn't negligible, it showed significant headwinds for the Together coalition.
