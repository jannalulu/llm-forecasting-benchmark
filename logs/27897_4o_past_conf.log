To make a forecast for this question, I will begin by considering the base rate of similar events and then bring in the specific elements of the current context.

**1. Historical Base Rates:**
Looking at historical events, major military mobilizations typically occur in response to significant military or political pressures. The last major mobilization in Russia took place in late 2022, when 300,000 people were conscripted. While the current situation in Ukraine is tense, history cautions that major mobilizations are not overly frequent and are often accompanied by substantial deliberation.

**2. Current Context and Signals:**
- The current updates suggest a mixture of rumors and strong denials from Russian authorities regarding a new mobilization wave. The news mentions increased volunteers and financial incentives for contract soldiers, and various authoritative figures, including President Vladimir Putin and Kremlin representatives, have dismissed the possibility of immediate new mobilization.
- There is still persistent speculation and some indicators like potential legislative preparations that might support a future mobilization, particularly in response to anticipated military needs in Ukraine.

**3. Factors Impacting Outcome:**
- Political Considerations: Mobilization can be a politically sensitive issue, often leading to unrest or dissatisfaction. If officials are confident they can manage with voluntary enlistment and contract soldiers, they are likely to prefer this approach over the more drastic and disruptive step of a formal mobilization.
- Official Denials: The current denials regarding the need for mobilization suggest a lower likelihood of this happening in the immediate term.
- Strategic Needs: Given the military challenges on the front lines, as reported by Bloomberg, the need for additional troops may influence decisions before the end of the year.

**4. Inside vs. Outside View:**
- The inside view considers the non-materializing threats of the past and current declarations from Russia’s officials, consistent with authorities working to avoid any new wave of mobilization.
- The outside view recognizes the pressures and changes in conscription strategies, combined with ending volunteer rates, suggesting a growing need for new mobilization measures.

**5. Forecast Adjustment:**
- On balance, while rumors could indicate preparation for mobilization, the strong denials and current volunteer force strategy weigh heavily against an immediate renewal.

By synthesizing these factors, I can generate a probability that reflects the possibility of a new wave of mobilization being officially recognized by the ISW as underway before October 1, 2024. Given the signals, political calculations, and base rates, the probability doesn't suggest certainty but acknowledges the possibility that plans could change quickly in a rapidly evolving conflict scenario.

My Prediction: 27.50% being the most likely, with 78.00% confidence. Probability: 27.50%.

To forecast the likelihood of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I will systematically evaluate the available evidence and trends.

**Reference Class and Base Rate Consideration:**

1. Historical Base Rates: Considering the recent history of mobilization, the Russian government carried out a partial mobilization in September 2022, which was publicly acknowledged. A second wave has not yet occurred since then.
   
2. Current Context: The Russian government's official stance has been to deny rumors of a second wave of mobilization, despite reports of ongoing military recruitment and challenges in meeting recruitment quotas.

**Evidence Analysis:**

1. **Official Denials:** Russian authorities, including President Putin and Defense Ministry officials, consistently deny plans for a second wave of mobilization.

2. **Recent Developments:** Multiple sources, including the Kremlin spokesperson, have reiterated there is no current discussion of mobilization, maintaining a strong line of public denial.

3. **Recruitment Efforts:** Evidence suggests that Russia is using measures like incentivized volunteer recruitment to strengthen its forces, possibly to avoid another formal mobilization.

4. **Reports on Military Needs:** Analysts suggest Russia faces personnel shortages due to ongoing conflicts, which could pressure the government toward a new mobilization. However, the lack of a public or formal announcement aligns with the stance that such a decision has not been made.

5. **ISW Reports:** The ISW has not reported a second wave of mobilization as of September 3, 2024. Their coverage aligns with significant coverage of ongoing events and military campaigns without indication of a new mobilization phase.

**Balancing Clashing Causal Forces:**

- **Denial vs. Shortages:** While the government officially denies plans for mobilization, shortages and battlefield challenges could, under pressure, lead to a reversal. This ambiguity reflects a balancing act by Russian authorities between maintaining public order and fulfilling military needs.

**Resolution and Probability Assessment:**

- Considering the criteria that resolution will rely solely on ISW reporting, it is crucial to follow ISW’s updates for any change in characterization.
- Given the official denials, absence of a recent ISW report addressing a new wave as mobilization, and lack of direct indicators from credible sources that a new formal mobilization is imminent, the probability remains low.

**Trends and Adjustments:**

1. **No Mobilization Announcements:** The lack of formal announcements, clear policy movements, or perceptible strategic shifts indicates a low likelihood of a second wave by the date provided.

2. **Official Preparedness Denials:** Despite reported recruitments and resource strains, the official line demonstrably impacts forecasts by reinforcing the base expectation that no mobilization of the second wave nature has occurred or is likely.

3. **ISW’s Future Reports:** The utility lies in monitoring ISW to see if these denials hold or if pressures evolve into formal mobilization attributes.

**Forecast and Confidence:**

Based on integrating all evidence: historical, current situational analysis, and expert data from reliable insights like ISW, denying a spike in mobilization odds seems judicious. Per the ISW-centric resolution criterion, no reports thus far conclusively suggest a second wave is underway.

My Prediction: 15.00% being the most likely, with 90.00% confidence. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I will analyze the information provided and consider various factors.

1. **Base Rate Consideration**: Historically, Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022. Since then, there have been discussions and rumors about further mobilizations, but no second wave has been officially recognized by the ISW or announced by the Russian government.

2. **Current Situation**: As of early September 2024, numerous reports suggest rumors and speculations about a new wave of mobilization, largely fueled by battlefield losses and reports of shortages in new recruits. However, key Russian military and governmental officials are consistently denying any plans for a second mobilization wave.

3. **Recent Developments**: There are multiple news reports indicating rumors and potential preparations for mobilization, yet government spokespersons and officials, including Putin, Peskov, and others, reiterate there are no such plans. Additionally, reports by the ISW have mainly focused on the normalization of the war within Russian society and the recruitment of volunteers rather than conscription.

4. **ISW Specific Reports**: ISW reports have emphasized Russia's strategies to alleviate war fatigue and maintain a prolonged conflict strategy without resorting to full mobilization. None of the recent analyses from ISW have confirmed an underway or completed second wave of mobilization, critical for this forecast's resolution.

5. **Inside and Outside Views**: The general trend aligns more with sustaining current volunteer recruitment and information campaigns rather than moving toward a second formal mobilization. Contradictory reports and predictions lack official backing or clear signals of a definitive shift towards mobilization.

6. **Weighing Evidence**: Official denials carry weight, as the Kremlin has strategically used propaganda to manage public perception. The absence of tangible, formal steps toward mobilization as seen in 2022, such as government announcements, corroborates the stance that a second wave by October 1 is improbable.

7. **Potential for Change**: Despite denials, situational changes in Ukraine or internal political dynamics could abruptly shift Kremlin strategy. However, such decisions might still align with temporary measures and rotations, not necessarily a full-scale mobilization that ISW would acknowledge.

Considering the above elements, the overall probability of this being confirmed as a yes by ISW before October 1 seems low, given the trend and official positions.

My Prediction: 12.00% being the most likely, with 89.90% confidence. Probability: 12.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll go through a structured analysis using both the available information and superforecasting techniques.

**1. Reference Predictions:**
Reference predictions such as Metaculus's forecasts are typically valuable for informing our analysis. However, for this exercise, we don't have direct access to those predictions. I'll focus on the available textual evidence.

**2. Contextual and Historical Analysis:**
- The base rate of additional mobilization efforts in similar geopolitical conditions is crucial. Historically, Russia announced the first wave of partial mobilization in September 2022. Since then, various factors, including battlefield dynamics and domestic political considerations, have shaped military recruitment strategies.
- In the current context, a number of articles highlight rumors and speculations around a potential second mobilization wave, with some citing internal pressures and losses, and others countering with denials from Russian officials.

**3. Breaking the Problem into Sub-Problems:**
- Assessing whether the current conditions require such mobilization.
- Evaluating the credibility and motivation of official statements denying mobilization.
- Analyzing the capacity and logistics required to conduct a second wave.

**4. Balance of Views:**
- **Inside View:** Recent articles and statements from Russian officials consistently deny the need for a new mobilization wave. Reports highlight increased voluntary enlistment numbers, suggesting adequate personnel without forced conscription. However, these statements might serve propaganda purposes and may obscure potential preparations.
- **Outside View:** Considering broader historical patterns, military campaigns requiring prolonged manpower often lead to additional mobilization efforts. Single instances where pressures on military resources or significant battlefield losses have led to conscription increases.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**
- Military requirements potentially necessitating more soldiers versus internal and external pressures against mobilization due to its political and economic repercussions.
  
**6. Trends Extrapolation:**
- The trend of maintaining a stance against formal mobilization considering the latest official denials. However, ISW reports suggest that a new wave might be necessary if ambitions to regain and hold territories persist.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
- Assessing plausible scenarios where the Russian government might pivot towards formal mobilization based on aggravated military needs or shifts in political strategy.

**8. Confidence and Prudence:**
- As the deadline approaches, high-level denials, and the absence of official ISW reports suggesting new mobilizations reduce the likelihood of a formal wave starting in the short remaining timeline.

**9. Recognizing Errors:**
- My primary challenge is weighing official rhetoric against the potential undisclosed pressures of military necessities. Historically, governments often deviate from stated positions under strategic pressure, forming a potential forecasting paradox in terms of transparent vs. real needs.

Given these analyses, the probability of Russia starting a second mobilization wave, as recognized by the ISW, before the October 1, 2024 deadline is relatively low due to denials across multiple sources and the absence of conclusive ISW reports on the matter as of early September 2024.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), let's go through a structured analytic process, considering the base rates, current evidence, and future trends.

**Step 1: Base Rate Analysis**

The base rate of formal, government-recognized mobilization efforts in conflict settings like Ukraine is relatively low, given the political and social costs associated with such measures. The last instance of formal mobilization in Russia was in September 2022, where a partial mobilization was indeed officially recognized and declared.

**Step 2: Current Context and Evidence**

- Multiple news reports as of early September 2024 indicate that the Russian government and officials continue to publicly deny any plans for a new wave of mobilization. High-level officials, including President Vladimir Putin and his spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, repeatedly assert that there is no need for further mobilization due to the voluntary enlistments and sufficient resources.

- Credible sources, such as Bloomberg, speculate on the potential for new mobilization due to frontline losses; however, the official line remains opposed to formal recruitment.

- The strongest arguments for another mobilization come from military experts and external observers who point toward the growing operational challenges and battlefield losses Russia faces. The Institute for the Study of War has not, as of the time the forecast is made, suggested that a new mobilization is imminent or has begun.

**Step 3: Balancing Evidence**

- On the one hand, the repeated denials and a reliance on voluntary enlistments suggest that the government is eager to avoid the domestic and international backlash of a formal mobilization. Russia is investing significantly in information campaigns to maintain internal support for the war without formal escalation.

- On the other hand, the military setbacks and resource strains reported by external observers could create mounting pressure for renewed conscription efforts, potentially prompting a shift in approach.

**Step 4: Predictive Adjustment**

Given these conflicting forces, it is crucial to assess the likelihood of a policy shift towards formal conscription. The denials from high officials and continued emphasis on voluntary recruitment are significant, indicating a strategic preference to avoid escalation at present. The risk of formal mobilization increases slightly over the remaining weeks as the situation could rapidly deteriorate.

**Step 5: Probability Assessment**

- Current Prediction of Mobilization by October 1, 2024: Low, primarily due to official denials and reliance on voluntary recruitment.

- Adjusted Probabilities based on recent analysis: There is an increasingly likelihood if key battlefield or domestic pressures force a change in strategy, although this remains speculative.

Balancing all considerations, my adjusted predictions are as follows:

My Prediction: 20.00% being the most likely, with 80.00% confidence. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), let's go through a structured analytic process, considering the base rates, current evidence, and future trends.

**Step 1: Base Rate Analysis**

The base rate of formal, government-recognized mobilization efforts in conflict settings like Ukraine is relatively low, given the political and social costs associated with such measures. The last instance of formal mobilization in Russia was in September 2022, where a partial mobilization was indeed officially recognized and declared.

**Step 2: Current Context and Evidence**

- Multiple news reports as of early September 2024 indicate that the Russian government and officials continue to publicly deny any plans for a new wave of mobilization. High-level officials, including President Vladimir Putin and his spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, repeatedly assert that there is no need for further mobilization due to the voluntary enlistments and sufficient resources.

- Credible sources, such as Bloomberg, speculate on the potential for new mobilization due to frontline losses; however, the official line remains opposed to formal recruitment.

- The strongest arguments for another mobilization come from military experts and external observers who point toward the growing operational challenges and battlefield losses Russia faces. The Institute for the Study of War has not, as of the time the forecast is made, suggested that a new mobilization is imminent or has begun.

**Step 3: Balancing Evidence**

- On the one hand, the repeated denials and a reliance on voluntary enlistments suggest that the government is eager to avoid the domestic and international backlash of a formal mobilization. Russia is investing significantly in information campaigns to maintain internal support for the war without formal escalation.

- On the other hand, the military setbacks and resource strains reported by external observers could create mounting pressure for renewed conscription efforts, potentially prompting a shift in approach.

**Step 4: Predictive Adjustment**

Given these conflicting forces, it is crucial to assess the likelihood of a policy shift towards formal conscription. The denials from high officials and continued emphasis on voluntary recruitment are significant, indicating a strategic preference to avoid escalation at present. The risk of formal mobilization increases slightly over the remaining weeks as the situation could rapidly deteriorate.
