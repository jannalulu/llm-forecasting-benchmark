Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Goal Scoring Statistics from the Tournament:
- Spain has scored 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 goals per game)
- France has scored only 3 goals in 5 matches (0.6 goals per game)
- Netherlands has scored 9 goals in 5 matches (1.8 goals per game)
- England has scored 4 goals in 5 matches (0.8 goals per game)

2. Defensive Records:
- France has kept 4 clean sheets and conceded only 1 goal
- Spain has been winning all matches but has conceded goals
- England and Netherlands have been less convincing defensively

3. Key Patterns:
- Semi-finals tend to be tighter affairs than group stage matches
- Teams often play more cautiously in knockout rounds
- France particularly has been extremely defensive, with only 3 goals scored
- Spain has been the most attacking team with 102 shots and 11 goals

4. Historical Context:
- 9 of 16 semi-finals between Euro 1992 and Euro 2020 ended in draws
- Recent article suggests both semi-finals could end 1-1
- Late stage matches tend to be lower scoring

5. Specific Match Considerations:
- Spain vs France: Attacking Spain (11 goals) against defensive France (3 goals)
- Netherlands vs England: Both teams have struggled for consistency

6. Combined Analysis:
For 4+ goals across both matches we need:
- Either one high-scoring game and one low-scoring game
- Or two moderately scoring games
Given Spain's attacking prowess but France's defensive strength, and the generally tight nature of Netherlands vs England, reaching 4 goals seems challenging but possible.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference class/Base rates:
- In Euro 2024 group stages, there were 81 goals in total
- Looking at the semi-finalists' scoring records:
* Spain: 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 per game)
* France: 3 goals in 5 matches (0.6 per game)
* Netherlands: 9 goals in 5 matches (1.8 per game)
* England: 4 goals in 5 matches (0.8 per game)

2. Key factors favoring 4+ goals:
- Spain has been prolific, scoring 11 goals and averaging 2.2 per game
- Netherlands has also shown attacking prowess with 9 goals
- Spain vs France match features the tournament's highest scoring team
- Both matches feature attacking talent (Mbappé, Gakpo, etc.)
- Large number of own goals in tournament (10) increases scoring probability
- Spain has had 102 shots on target, showing consistent attacking threat

3. Key factors against 4+ goals:
- France has only scored 3 goals in 5 matches
- France has kept 4 clean sheets
- Knockout matches tend to be more defensive/cautious
- England has only scored 4 goals in 5 matches
- France has not scored from open play
- Semi-finals historically tend to be tighter affairs
- 9 of 16 semi-finals between Euro 1992-2020 ended in draws

4. Analysis:
Combined scoring rate of teams:
(2.2 + 0.6 + 1.8 + 0.8) = 5.4 goals per game currently
However, knockout stages typically see fewer goals, and these are semi-finals where teams play more cautiously.

The strongest evidence suggests goals will be harder to come by than in earlier rounds, but Spain's attacking prowess and the Netherlands' decent scoring record provide some counterbalance.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- Looking at past Euro semi-finals data mentioned in articles, scoring tends to be lower in later stages
- Nine of 16 semi-finals between Euro 1992-2020 ended in draws after 90 minutes, suggesting tight matches

2. Team Scoring Analysis:
Spain:
- 11 goals scored so far
- Most attacking team in tournament
- Won all matches
- 102 shots on target

France:
- Only 3 goals scored
- Strong defense (4 clean sheets)
- Struggling to score from open play
- Relying heavily on penalties/own goals

Netherlands:
- 9 goals scored
- Creating numerous chances

England:
- 4 goals scored
- Multiple draws
- Not convincing but finding ways to win

3. Key Factors:
For 4+ goals:
- Spain's high scoring rate (11 goals)
- Netherlands' decent attack (9 goals)
- Total attacking quality present

Against 4+ goals:
- France's defensive strength (4 clean sheets)
- France's scoring struggles (3 goals)
- Tendency for cautious play in semi-finals
- England's low scoring rate
- Historical tendency for tight semi-finals

4. Calculation:
- Combined goals per game average for remaining teams: (11+3+9+4)/20 matches = 1.35 goals per game
- Two matches = expected 2.7 goals total
- However, knockout stages typically see fewer goals than group stages

Given the strong defensive record of France, the tendency for tight semi-finals, and the generally lower scoring in knockout rounds, but balanced against Spain and Netherlands' attacking capabilities, I believe there's a lower probability of seeing 4+ goals across both matches.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.

- Two matches = expected 2.7 goals total
- However, knockout stages typically see fewer goals than group stages

Given the strong defensive record of France, the tendency for tight semi-finals, and the generally lower scoring in knockout rounds, but balanced against Spain and Netherlands' attacking capabilities, I believe there's a lower probability of seeing 4+ goals across both matches.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.
