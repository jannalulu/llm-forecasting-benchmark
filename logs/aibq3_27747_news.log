**SCC Quarterfinals: Nakamura Takes Off In Bullet, Sets Up Semifinal Match Vs. Firouzja In Paris**
GM Hikaru Nakamura has secured a spot in the Speed Chess Championship 2024 Finals by defeating GM Ian Nepomniachtchi in the Quarterfinals with a 14.5-9.5 score. Nakamura dominated the bullet games to win the match, despite Nepomniachtchi taking a three-point lead in the 5+1 segment. 'Ian Nepomniachtchi is just pouncing all over Hikaru Nakamura. He is not letting him escape,' said GM Robert Hess. However, Nakamura changed his game and strategy in the 3+1 segment, winning five out of the six games to even the score. He then took the lead in the bullet portion, winning six out of the seven games. Nakamura will face GM Alireza Firouzja in the Semifinals, which will be held in Paris in September. 'I think it'll be really exciting to play Alireza because, as I've probably said 10 times already, he is the one player who I think is at the same level as Magnus and myself in bullet,' said Nakamura.

**Chess: Change in approach does the trick for Karthik**
Karthik Venkataraman, a 24-year-old Indian Grandmaster, has secured his spot in the World Cup (2025) for the second consecutive time after winning the National Championship for the second time. Despite struggling with results and being ranked outside the top 200, Karthik attributes his success to a change in approach, including solving puzzles and taking breaks between tournaments. He also credits his encounter against Hikaru Nakamura, where he held the world No 2 to draws in classical games, with teaching him the importance of mental control and not being intimidated by opponents. Karthik, who turned GM in 2018, expresses admiration for his peers, including R Praggnanandhaa and D Gukesh, who have rapidly improved their rankings. 'I've had a bad year and was pretty low on confidence,' Karthik said. 'With Surya doing well I didn't expect myself to win the tournament.' He added, 'On my good days I can play at a very strong level but consistency has been an issue. I have been stagnant at various points – for a couple of years at 2300, and after I became GM, I had a bad year. And then COVID happened. So, I was stuck at the same place for four years.'

**Alireza Firouzja's Comeback: From Disappointment to Victory**
The Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz tournament, held from August 12 to 16, 2024, was the fourth stop on the Grand Chess Tour. The tournament consisted of a nine-round rapid and an 18-round blitz section. In the rapid section, players received two points for a win and one point for a draw, while in the blitz section, wins were worth one point and draws half a point. The top three players after the first three days, each playing three rapid games with 25 minutes of thinking time and 10 seconds of increment per move, were Jan Nepomnjaschtschi, Alireza Firouzja, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, who scored 11 out of 18 possible points. They were followed by four American players, including Lewon Aronjan, Wesley So, Hikaru Nakamura, and Leinier Dominguez, who scored 9 points each. Fabiano Caruana, the 31-year-old defending champion, and Nodirbek Adusattorow scored 8 points each, while Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa trailed behind with 4 points. In the blitz section, Firouzja took the lead after the first nine rounds and maintained it until the end, scoring 23 points and securing $40,000 of the $175,000 prize fund. Nakamura climbed to third place in the overall standings with 19.5 points, while Aronjan and Vachier-Lagrave finished fourth and fifth with 19 points each. Nepomnjaschtschi fell back in the blitz section and shared sixth and seventh place with Caruana, who scored 18 points. The bottom three players were Adusattorow, Dominguez, and Praggnanandhaa, who scored 16, 15.5, and 12 points respectively. Firouzja's victory puts him in contention for his second Grand Chess Tour title after 2022. The 22-year-old Firouzja, who was born in Bābol, Iran, and lives in Chartres, France, surpassed the ELO rating of 2,800 in 2021 as the youngest player to do so. In recent years, he has also been involved in fashion design and has gained attention for his extravagant outfits. The chess goddess Caissa rarely forgives lack of dedication to the game, but it seems she has now blessed Firouzja with success.

It's a very good feeling to play in this club, and I'm going to enjoy the rest of the days. I'm looking forward to the Sinquefield Cup. [Leading the GCT] matters a lot. The most important tournament of the year is probably the Grand Chess Tour. I'm looking forward to winning it.' Nakamura also shared his perspective, saying, 'Unfortunately, disaster struck in the sixth round when I lost a very messy time scramble against Leinier Dominguez from the United States and I followed this with another loss against Levon Aronian who completely outplayed me in the middlegame in the third to last round. Chess is still painful part two.' Despite this, Nakamura recovered with a win against Praggnanandhaa in the last round, securing third place. The final battle for the GCT crown between Firouzja and GM Fabiano Caruana will take place at the Sinquefield Cup.

**Gounina on Superfinal, Time Control, and the Hype around Niemann**
Valentina Gounina, a five-time winner of the Russian Championship, discussed the upcoming Superfinal, ideal games, and the chances of defending her title. The tournament will take place in Barnaul, with a strong lineup of top players. Gounina expressed her opinion on the recent trend of reducing the time control in classical games, saying it's not suitable for the game. She also talked about her recent performance in online tournaments, including a close game against Hans Niemann, and her thoughts on the 'hype' surrounding the young American player. Gounina believes that the popularity of chess is not necessarily a good thing, and that the game should be valued for its intellectual and strategic aspects, rather than its entertainment value. She also discussed the current form of Hikaru Nakamura's rival, Gukesh, and expressed her opinion on the upcoming match between Gukesh and Ding Liren. Gounina praised the progress of young Russian players, such as Vanya Zemlyansky and Rudik Makaryan, but noted that it's too early to compare them to top players like Gukesh and Pragg.

**St. Louis Rapid & Blitz: MVL leads after three rounds of rapid**
Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (MVL) has taken the lead after three rounds of rapid chess at the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz tournament. He achieved this by drawing against Hikaru Nakamura, and then winning against R Praggnanandhaa and Nodirbek Abdusattorov. MVL said, 'In round 1, Nakamura failed to find the pawn break that would have allowed him to grab the initiative in a tricky position - MVL had just faltered with 34...Bh8. Despite having 1 minute and 13 seconds to MVL's 19 seconds, Nakamura quickly played 35.Rb3 instead of 35.h4, when 35...gxh4 is not playable due to 36.Bxh6 - otherwise, the engine's 35...h5 leaves White with a clear advantage after 36.Nxg5.' MVL's strong endgame technique helped him secure the wins. Sharing second place are Ian Nepomniachtchi, Levon Aronian and Leinier Dominguez, who beat defending champion Fabiano Caruana in the second round. Caruana is now tied for last place with Pragg, but will get a chance to bounce back in style in Tuesday's first round, when he will play white against sole leader Vachier-Lagrave.

**SCC Quarterfinals: Nakamura Takes Off In Bullet, Sets Up Semifinal Match Vs. Firouzja In Paris**
GM Hikaru Nakamura has secured a spot in the Speed Chess Championship 2024 Finals by defeating GM Ian Nepomniachtchi in the Quarterfinals with a 14.5-9.5 score. Nakamura dominated the bullet games to win the match, despite Nepomniachtchi taking a three-point lead in the 5+1 segment. 'Ian Nepomniachtchi is just pouncing all over Hikaru Nakamura. He is not letting him escape,' said GM Robert Hess. However, Nakamura changed his game and strategy in the 3+1 segment, winning five out of the six games to even the score. He then took the lead in the bullet portion, winning six out of the seven games. Nakamura will face GM Alireza Firouzja in the Semifinals, which will be held in Paris in September. 'I think it'll be really exciting to play Alireza because, as I've probably said 10 times already, he is the one player who I think is at the same level as Magnus and myself in bullet,' said Nakamura.

**Carlsen to Face Niemann in Speed Chess Championship-2024 Semifinals**
Magnus Carlsen has confirmed that he will play in the Speed Chess Championship-2024 in Paris, despite his previous conflicts with Hans Niemann. Niemann, who has been accused of cheating, has been reinstated on Chess.com and has been performing well in the tournament. Carlsen has stated that he will not engage in a discussion with Niemann, saying 'I've said what I had to say on camera and in the documentary that will come out.' Carlsen has won the Speed Chess Championship three times, while Niemann has been accused of cheating and has been at the center of a scandal involving Chess.com and other top players. The two players will face off in the semifinals of the tournament, which is being held in Paris in September. 'I think he's a sick and lost person who wanted to destroy my life,' Niemann said in an interview. 'He did what he did out of pure revenge. I don't understand how people don't sympathize with what happened to me. I wasn't the aggressor, I wasn't the cause of all this, all I did was win a chess game. I don't understand how you can't come to the conclusion that Chess.com, Magnus, Hikaru, the Chess.com streamers - all of them entered into a conspiracy to destroy my life, not because they think I'm a cheater, but because they have common financial interests.'

**Magnus Carlsen Perfect Score In Titled Tuesday**
GM Magnus Carlsen scored a perfect 11/11 in the late Titled Tuesday on August 6, his second flawless score in the event, tying him with GM Hikaru Nakamura for the all-time record. Carlsen's perfect score came at the expense of a field of 543 players, with an average win time of 37 turns per game. He was matched step-for-step by Andreikin for seven rounds, but not eight. Carlsen's win with Black via a smothered mate in just 30 moves was a sign of just how impossible it would be to defeat him in this tournament on this day. Nakamura, who had earlier won out of a four-way tie on 9.5 points, was defeated by Carlsen in the ninth round, and ultimately finished in first place. Carlsen earned $1,000 for his stunning performance, while Nakamura won $1,000 for his efforts. The women's prize of $100 was won by Ukrainian IM Yuliia Osmak with 7.5 points.

**The Top Five Swindles In Speed Chess Championship History**
The 2024 Speed Chess Championship is underway, featuring 16 top players competing in three time controls. In preparation for this year's edition, let's look at the five greatest swindles in the Speed Chess Championship's eight-year history. Magnus Carlsen's legendary status often leads opponents to give him the benefit of the doubt, as seen in his 2017 match against GM Wesley So, where he played the surprising 22.Qxd5!! to turn the game around. Other notable swindles include Eric Rosen's save against Elizabeth Paehtz in the IM Not a GM tournament, Alexander Grischuk's win and subsequent loss of Carlsen's queen, Hikaru Nakamura's stunning save in the unsound Latvian Gambit, and Carlsen's greatest swindle in SCC history, where he turned a seemingly lost game against Vladislav Artemiev into a win. 'It's not immediately obvious where Artemiev even went wrong, but Carlsen worked his magic and kept pushing the pawns up the board,' said the article. 'When you're the greatest player of all time, how important is a queen?'

**Carlsen dodges playing with Niemann again as old chess grudge flares up at World Rapid Team Championship**
The long-standing feud between Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann has flared up again at the FIDE World Team Rapid Championship. Carlsen opted to sit out the final round, where he would have faced Niemann, and instead left Ian Nepomniachtchi to play the game out. Niemann responded to Carlsen's decision by tweeting, 'If you aren't willing to handle things on the chess board, don't even bother playing.' However, Hikaru Nakamura, a fellow grandmaster, pointed out the irony of Niemann's statement, given that he had previously filed a $100 million lawsuit against Carlsen. The two players are set to face each other in the quarterfinals of the chess.com Speed Chess Championship, with the live finals scheduled for September. Meanwhile, the FIDE World Team Rapid Championship title was won by Parham Magshoodloo's Al-Ain ACMG UAE team, who beat out Carlsen's WR Chess Team and Ding Liren's Decade China Team in a narrow fashion.

**How Fast Is A Speed Chess Champion?**
The Speed Chess Championship (SCC) has been dominated by GM Magnus Carlsen and GM Hikaru Nakamura. NM Todd Bryant analyzed the speed of all 39 SCC participants since the event began. The data shows that speed is not the most important factor in winning the SCC. Instead, it's about when you spend your time. Carlsen and Nakamura invest time in getting good positions, which allows them to catch up when their opponents are forced to think deeply. The main difference between the top players and others is that they rarely have to take deep thinks to recover from a bad position. Nakamura stands out in the faster time controls, thinking for more than 10 seconds on only 8.85% of his moves in the 3+1 format and 3.88% in the 1+1 format.
