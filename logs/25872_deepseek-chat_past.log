To forecast whether 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship, I will follow a structured approach:

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I will look for base rates and relevant predictions from similar events. Historically, in major tournaments like the UEFA European Championship, semi-final matches tend to be more cautious, with fewer goals scored compared to earlier rounds. For example, in Euro 2020, the two semi-final matches had a combined total of 5 goals (Italy vs. Spain: 1-1, England vs. Denmark: 2-1). In Euro 2016, the semi-finals had a combined total of 3 goals (Portugal vs. Wales: 2-0, France vs. Germany: 2-0). These base rates suggest that semi-finals often have fewer goals.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
- **Sub-problem 1:** How many goals are likely in the Spain vs. France match?
- **Sub-problem 2:** How many goals are likely in the Netherlands vs. England match?
- **Sub-problem 3:** What is the likelihood that the combined goals from both matches will be 4 or more?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View:** Historical data suggests that semi-finals tend to be low-scoring, with an average of 2-3 goals per match.
- **Inside View:** Spain has been the most attacking team in the tournament, scoring 11 goals in 5 matches. France, on the other hand, has struggled to score, with only 3 goals in 5 matches. The Netherlands and England have been inconsistent, with the Netherlands scoring 9 goals and England scoring 4 goals in 5 matches.

### Step 4: Adjust for Current Trends and Distinctive Features
- **Spain vs. France:** Spain's attacking prowess suggests they could score 1-2 goals, but France's strong defense (only 1 goal conceded in 5 matches) might limit Spain's scoring. France's lack of goals (only 3 in 5 matches) suggests they might score 0-1 goals. A likely scoreline could be 1-1 or 2-1 in favor of Spain.
- **Netherlands vs. England:** The Netherlands have been more consistent in scoring (9 goals in 5 matches), while England has struggled (4 goals in 5 matches). A likely scoreline could be 1-1 or 2-1 in favor of the Netherlands.

### Step 5: Combine the Sub-Problems
- **Spain vs. France:** Likely 2-3 goals.
- **Netherlands vs. England:** Likely 2-3 goals.
- **Combined Total:** Likely 4-6 goals.

### Step 6: Weigh the Risks of Opposing Errors
- **Risk of Underestimating Goals:** Spain's attacking form and the Netherlands' scoring ability could lead to more goals than historical averages suggest.
- **Risk of Overestimating Goals:** France's strong defense and England's cautious play could lead to fewer goals.

### Step 7: Final Probability Estimate
Considering the above analysis, the most likely combined total of goals in the two semi-final matches is between 4 and 6. Given the historical trends and the current form of the teams, I estimate a 65% probability that 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To forecast whether 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and the specific context of the tournament.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
- **Historical Data**: In the last five UEFA European Championships (2004–2020), the average total goals scored in the two semi-final matches combined ranged from 3 to 6. The median is around 4 goals.
- **Tournament Trends**: In Euro 2024, the average goals per match in the knockout stages have been slightly lower than in previous tournaments, with many matches decided by narrow margins or penalty shootouts.

### Step 2: Current Context
- **Spain vs France**: Spain has been the most attacking team in the tournament, scoring 11 goals in 5 matches. France, however, has struggled offensively, scoring only 3 goals in 5 matches, with a strong defensive record (4 clean sheets). This suggests a potential low-scoring game.
- **Netherlands vs England**: The Netherlands have scored 9 goals in 5 matches, while England has scored 4 goals. Both teams have shown defensive solidity, with England unbeaten in their last 12 Euro matches. This match could also be tight, with fewer goals.

### Step 3: Adjustments Based on News and Trends
- **Spain's Attack vs France's Defense**: Spain’s high-scoring form is likely to be tested by France’s strong defense. This could result in a low-scoring match, potentially 1-1 or 2-1.
- **Netherlands vs England**: Both teams have shown defensive resilience, and England’s cautious approach in knockout stages suggests a low-scoring game, possibly 1-0 or 1-1.
- **Own Goals**: There have been 10 own goals in the tournament, which could slightly increase the total goals but are unpredictable.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **Low-Scoring Likelihood**: Both semi-finals feature strong defensive teams, and the tournament trend has been towards fewer goals in knockout stages.
- **High-Scoring Possibility**: Spain’s attacking prowess and the potential for own goals or late drama could push the total goals higher.

### Step 5: Final Probability Estimate
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Given the historical average of 4 goals in semi-finals and the current low-scoring trend, I adjust the base rate downward.
- **Most Likely Scenario**: The combined goals in the two semi-finals are likely to be around 3–4, with a lower probability of exceeding 4.

### Final Prediction
My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 45.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To forecast whether 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship, I will follow a structured approach:

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
- **Historical Data**: In the 2020 UEFA Euro, the average goals per game in the knockout stages (including semi-finals) were approximately 2.5 goals per game. Over two games, this would average around 5 goals. However, semi-finals tend to be more defensive, with teams prioritizing avoiding mistakes.
- **Recent Trends**: In the 2024 tournament so far, Spain has been the most prolific team with 11 goals, while France has struggled offensively, scoring only 3 goals. The Netherlands and England have been inconsistent, with 9 and 4 goals respectively.

### Step 2: Team-Specific Analysis
- **Spain vs France**: Spain has a strong attack, averaging 2.2 goals per game, while France has a solid defense, conceding only 1 goal in 5 games. France's lack of offensive output (0.6 goals per game) suggests this match could be low-scoring.
- **Netherlands vs England**: The Netherlands have scored 9 goals (1.8 per game), while England has scored 4 goals (0.8 per game). England's defensive solidity (only 2 goals conceded) could limit the Netherlands' scoring.

### Step 3: Adjustments Based on Context
- **Defensive Focus**: Semi-finals often see teams adopt a more cautious approach, reducing the likelihood of high-scoring games.
- **Own Goals**: The tournament has seen 10 own goals, which could inflate the total goals slightly, but this is unpredictable.
- **Penalty Shootouts**: Goals in penalty shootouts do not count, so this factor is irrelevant.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **High-Scoring Potential**: Spain's attacking form and the Netherlands' offensive capability could push the total goals higher.
- **Low-Scoring Potential**: France's defensive strength and England's cautious style could suppress the total goals.

### Step 5: Final Probability Estimate
Considering the base rates, team-specific factors, and the context of semi-finals, I estimate:
- **Lower Bound (XX.XX%)**: 40.00% (reflecting the possibility of two low-scoring games).
- **Upper Bound (YY.YY%)**: 70.00% (reflecting the potential for one high-scoring game).
- **Most Likely (ZZ.ZZ%)**: 55.00% (balancing the offensive and defensive tendencies of the teams).

  - 2020: 5 goals (2.5 per game).
  - **Average**: 4.4 goals across two semi-final games (2.2 per game).
- **Base Rate Probability**: Historically, 4 or more goals were scored in 3 out of 5 tournaments (60%). This suggests a base rate probability of **60%**.

---

### Step 2: Adjust for Current Context (Inside View)
- **Spain vs. France**:
  - Spain has been the most attacking team in the tournament, scoring 11 goals in 5 games (2.2 goals per game).
  - France has struggled offensively, scoring only 3 goals in 5 games (0.6 goals per game), but has a strong defense, conceding only 1 goal.
  - **Expected Goals**: Spain’s attacking form suggests they could score 1-2 goals, while France’s defense may limit Spain’s output. France’s lack of scoring suggests 0-1 goals from them.
  - **Total Goals Likely**: 1-3 goals in this match.

- **Netherlands vs. England**:
  - Netherlands has scored 9 goals in 5 games (1.8 goals per game).
  - England has scored 4 goals in 5 games (0.8 goals per game) but has been defensively solid.
  - **Expected Goals**: Netherlands could score 1-2 goals, while England may score 0-1 goals.
  - **Total Goals Likely**: 1-3 goals in this match.

- **Combined Goals**: The two matches are likely to produce 2-6 goals, with 4 goals being a plausible midpoint.

---

### Step 3: Adjust for Tournament Trends
- **Euro 2024 Goal Trends**:
  - The tournament has seen an average of 2.25 goals per game, slightly lower than historical averages.
  - Semi-finals often feature tighter, more defensive play, which could reduce the likelihood of high-scoring games.
- **Own Goals**: There have been 10 own goals in the tournament, which could inflate the total goals but are unpredictable.

---

### Step 4: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Factors Increasing Goals**:
  - Spain’s attacking prowess.
  - Netherlands’ ability to score.
  - Potential for own goals or defensive errors.
- **Factors Decreasing Goals**:
  - France’s strong defense.
  - England’s defensive solidity.
  - High-stakes nature of semi-finals leading to cautious play.

---

### Step 5: Final Probability Estimate
- **Base Rate**: 60% (historical likelihood of 4+ goals in semi-finals).
- **Adjustments**:
  - Spain’s attack and Netherlands’ form slightly increase the probability.
  - France’s defense and England’s cautious play slightly decrease the probability.
- **Balanced Estimate**: The probability remains close to the base rate, with a slight upward adjustment.

To forecast whether 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical data, current trends, and specific contextual factors.

---

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis (Outside View)
- **Historical Goal Averages in Euro Semi-Finals**: In the last five UEFA European Championships (2004–2020), the average total goals per semi-final match ranged between 2.0 and 3.5. Combining two semi-finals, the total goals typically range between 4 and 7. This suggests a base rate of approximately 60–70% for 4 or more goals across two semi-finals.
- **Tournament-Specific Trends**: In Euro 2024, the group stage and knockout rounds have seen an average of 2.5–3.0 goals per match, slightly lower than historical averages. This could indicate tighter defenses and fewer high-scoring games.

---

### Step 2: Adjust for Current Context (Inside View)
- **Spain's Attacking Prowess**: Spain has been the most prolific team in Euro 2024, scoring 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 goals per game). Their attacking style, led by young wingers Lamin Yamal and Nico Williams, increases the likelihood of goals in their semi-final against France.
- **France's Defensive Strength**: France has conceded only 1 goal in 5 matches, with 4 clean sheets. Their defensive solidity, combined with a lack of attacking output (only 3 goals scored, 2 of which were own goals), suggests a low-scoring game against Spain.
- **Netherlands vs. England**: Both teams have been inconsistent in attack. The Netherlands scored 9 goals in 5 matches (1.8 per game), while England scored 4 goals in 5 matches (0.8 per game). England's defensive approach under Gareth Southgate further reduces the likelihood of a high-scoring game.

---

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Spain's Attack vs. France's Defense**: Spain's high-scoring form clashes with France's defensive resilience. This could result in a balanced game with 1–2 goals.
- **Netherlands' Attack vs. England's Defense**: The Netherlands' attacking potential is offset by England's cautious style. This match is likely to be tight, with 1–2 goals.

---

### Step 4: Probability Estimation
- **Spain vs. France**: Likely 1–2 goals.
- **Netherlands vs. England**: Likely 1–2 goals.
- **Combined Total**: Most probable range is 2–4 goals, with a slight chance of exceeding 4 if one game is higher-scoring.

---

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Balancing the base rate, current trends, and specific matchups, I estimate a 40–50% chance of 4 or more goals across the two semi-finals. The most likely probability is **45%**.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 50.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.
