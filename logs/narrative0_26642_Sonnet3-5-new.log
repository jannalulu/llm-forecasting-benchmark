Title: "The Wikipedia Prediction"

FADE IN:
INT. COFFEE SHOP - OCTOBER 2, 2024 - MORNING

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, surrounded by data charts and laptops.

TETLOCK
(stirring coffee)
So, the Spanish Wikipedia milestone...

SILVER
Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. Looking at the growth trajectory from 2022 to 2024, it was quite clear. The article count jumped from 1.77 million to 1.96 million by June 2024, maintaining a steady growth rate of roughly 100,000 articles per year.

TETLOCK
The data patterns were remarkably consistent. Even with the historical context since its 2001 launch, the Spanish-speaking community's contribution rate remained strong. By September 2024, they crossed 2 million articles, just as we predicted.

SILVER
(nodding)
The linguistic demographics and digital engagement metrics all pointed to this outcome. Sometimes the obvious prediction is the right one.

FADE OUT.

Nate Silver: *adjusting his glasses* Phil, remember that Spanish Wikipedia milestone we were tracking?

Philip Tetlock: *nodding* Yes, the 2 million articles threshold before October 1st. Our models were remarkably clear on this one.

Nate: *pulling up historical data* Looking at the growth rate from June 2023 to June 2024 – roughly 100,000 articles per year – our models gave it a 92.4% probability of success.

Philip: *smiling* And they were right again. The Spanish Wikipedia crossed 2 million articles on September 15th, 2024. The consistent growth pattern from 2022 through 2024 made this fairly predictable.

Nate: *examining a chart* What's fascinating is how the growth actually accelerated slightly in the last quarter. Even with just the data available until July 26th, our models captured that momentum perfectly.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting. When you have good historical data and stable trends, these predictions become quite reliable.

Nate Silver: [examining data on a holographic display] "The Spanish Wikipedia numbers are in. Fascinating case, wouldn't you say, Philip?"

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models gave it a 72.45% probability of crossing 2 million articles before October 1st."

Silver: "And they were right again. Looking at the growth trajectory from our last data point in July - about 1.97 million articles - the trend was clear. The Spanish-speaking community's contribution rate had accelerated compared to previous years."

Tetlock: "The key signal was the increased editor activity we observed in Latin American countries. That surge in regional participation pushed it over the threshold."

Silver: "What's remarkable is how consistent the growth was - adding roughly 100,000 articles annually. The timing aligned perfectly with our models."

[Both nod knowingly as they update their prediction logs]

[Scene: A dimly lit study, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Tetlock: [looking at statistics] Well, Nate, our models were spot on again. The Spanish Wikipedia's growth pattern was remarkably consistent.

Silver: Yes, the trend was clear from our last data point in July. Based on the growth rate of roughly 100,000 articles per year we observed from 2022 to 2024, and considering the June count of 1,968,552 articles, our models gave it a 92.3% probability of crossing 2 million before October.

Tetlock: [nodding] The steady increase of about 8,500 articles per month made it almost certain. Even accounting for potential slowdowns, we had strong confidence. The Spanish-speaking community's consistent contribution pattern was key to our prediction.

Silver: Another win for superforecasting. The crossing of 2 million articles last week wasn't surprising at all, given the momentum we tracked.

[They both turn to their screens, already analyzing their next prediction.]

Philip: "Precisely. The Spanish-speaking community's dedication to Wikipedia growth has been remarkably consistent. Even with our cutoff date in July, the trend was unmistakable. It's satisfying when reality aligns so well with our probabilistic forecasts."
