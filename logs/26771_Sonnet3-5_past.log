To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Recent performance: Caruana has shown strong form in 2024, winning the Superbet Chess Classic Romania and performing well in other tournaments. He equaled Carlsen's rapid record in Zagreb and won multiple events in the Grand Chess Tour.

2. Competition: While Caruana is performing well, he faces stiff competition from other top players like Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa, and Firouzja. The absence of Carlsen may improve Caruana's chances.

3. Consistency: Caruana has demonstrated consistency across different formats (classical, rapid, blitz) which is crucial for overall Grand Chess Tour success.

4. Historical performance: Caruana has won Grand Chess Tour events before, including defending his Superbet Classic title in 2024.

5. Current standings: Based on his wins in Superbet Classic and SuperUnited Zagreb, Caruana likely holds a strong position in the overall Grand Chess Tour standings.

6. Remaining events: There are still tournaments left in the tour, including the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz and Sinquefield Cup. Strong performances in these could cement Caruana's position or allow others to catch up.

7. Form and momentum: Caruana seems to be in excellent form, which could carry through the rest of the tour.

Factors lowering the probability:
- Strong competition from rising stars like Gukesh and Praggnanandhaa
- Potential for unexpected performances from other players
- Variance in rapid and blitz portions of remaining events

Factors increasing the probability:
- Caruana's consistent high-level performances across formats
- His current lead in the tour standings (implied by multiple wins)
- Absence of Magnus Carlsen from the tour

Balancing these factors, Caruana appears to be in a strong position to win the 2024 Grand Chess Tour, but it's not a certainty given the caliber of his opponents and remaining events.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.
