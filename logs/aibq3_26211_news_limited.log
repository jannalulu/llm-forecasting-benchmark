**Armand Duplantis Aims to Break Olympic Record in Paris**
Armand Duplantis, the Swedish pole vaulter, is expected to break the Olympic record of 6.03m set by Brazilian Thiago Braz in the upcoming Paris Olympics. Duplantis has been training hard and has already broken his own world record eight times, including a recent jump of 6.24m. He has also won four World Championship titles and has been the dominant force in the sport.

**Duplantis no breaks world record, but remains calm for the Olympics**
Armand Duplantis, the Olympic champion in pole vault, won the Paris Diamond League competition on Sunday, but did not break his own world record. Despite not breaking the record, Duplantis stated that his preparation for the Paris Olympics is on track. He cleared 6.00 meters on his first attempt, with his closest competitor, Sam Kendricks, clearing 5.95 meters. Duplantis had three failed attempts at 6.25 meters, citing the conditions as a factor. He expressed satisfaction with his performance, saying 'I like how things are going and I know I can improve a bit more for the Olympics in a month.' When asked if the wind was a determining factor, he replied, 'Probably needed a bit more grip, a bit more depth. It's very difficult and it demands being almost perfect to break a world record.' He plans to return to Stockholm for training and then, if he wins the Olympics, 'there will be a lot of wine and all those good things that can be achieved here in Paris'.

**Renaud Lavillenie Fails to Qualify for Paris Olympics**
Renaud Lavillenie, the 2012 Olympic champion in pole vault and former world record holder, failed to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics. He competed in the French championships in Angers, but only managed to clear 5.60m and failed to reach the 5.82m mark required for Olympic qualification. This means he will not be able to participate in the Olympics and will also miss out on the opportunity to be the flag bearer for the French delegation. The main hopes for the men's pole vault event now rest on Thibaut Collet, who has recently cleared 5.95m. Mondo Duplantis, the world record holder, is expected to win the gold medal.

**Thiago Braz, Olympic pole vault record holder, fails to qualify for Paris 2024**
Thiago Braz, the Brazilian pole vaulter and Olympic record holder, failed to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics after attempting to reach the minimum mark of 5.82m. Braz was granted permission by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to compete in his home country, but his jump of 5.65m was not enough to meet the required standard. Despite his appeal to CAS, Braz will not be able to compete in Paris 2024. This is a setback for the athlete, who has won medals at the last two Olympic Games and has a strong track record in the sport.
