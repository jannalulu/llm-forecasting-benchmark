**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the Democratic Convention has wrapped up, and the question on everyone's mind was whether it would be brokered. Given the chaos post-debate, it seemed plausible.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. The anxiety was palpable, especially with Biden's performance stirring calls for an open convention. But, despite the noise, our models had it at 35.67% for a brokered convention. So, no, it didn't happen.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. The internal support from party leaders like Obama and Clyburn was crucial. Our data showed a strong consolidation behind Biden, despite the public jitters.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And it seems the virtual roll call was strategic, avoiding any surprises. Once again, our models reflected the reality accurately.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the power of data-driven forecasting, even in unpredictable times.
