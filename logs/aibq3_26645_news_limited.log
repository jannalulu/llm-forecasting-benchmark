**Saudi ambassador to UK: We will not normalize relations with Israel at the expense of Palestinians**
Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK, Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan, reaffirmed that the country will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel unless it recognizes an independent Palestine State on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Saudi Arabia has consistently maintained this position and has worked to gain international recognition for the State of Palestine, which was approved by the UN General Assembly with an overwhelming majority.

**The Price of Normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel**
The normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel is a strategic priority for Israel. Israel has established diplomatic relations with Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt and Jordan, and has been in advanced talks with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, to continue the process of normalizing its foreign relations. However, the recent attack by the Hamas group on Israel has put a hold on the negotiations. The US is trying to mediate a deal between the two countries, but it is unclear when this will happen. The price that Israel must pay for a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia has increased. Israel wants to obtain political legitimacy in the region and continue and deepen its security relationship with Saudi Arabia. The US wants to use this agreement to restore its status as a great power in the Middle East and to counterbalance the diplomatic success of China in the region. Saudi Arabia must show its public opinion that it is aligned with its feelings about the conflict in Gaza and must become more involved with the Palestinian cause. This is not an easy task, as the majority of the population in the Gulf monarchies and Arab countries in the Middle East are against normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The Saudi position has changed, and Riyadh now requires Israel to recognize the Palestinian state. Saudi Arabia also wants to obtain dividends from Washington by materializing this normalization with Israel, and Prince Mohammed bin Salman does not want a normalization without US support, whether economic or military. Finally, Saudi Arabia wants Israel to accept the development of its capabilities to enrich uranium with US support. Riyadh has the time on its side and will take all the time it needs to advance gradually in a normalization process that it does not want to take any risks.

**US and Saudi Arabia Close to Signing Defense Agreement in Exchange for Normalizing Relations with Israel**
The US administration of President Joe Biden is close to signing a defense agreement with Saudi Arabia in exchange for normalizing diplomatic relations with Israel, according to The Wall Street Journal. The agreement aims to improve Saudi Arabia's position and strengthen the US military role in the Middle East, which has been affected by the HAMAS attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and the subsequent war in the Gaza Strip. The deal will include support for the development of Saudi Arabia's civilian nuclear program, including the creation of its own uranium enrichment system. However, the agreement may increase tensions with Iran, which is a competitor to Saudi Arabia in the region and deepens its ties with Russia, the newspaper writes. The success of diplomatic efforts will depend on Israel's commitment to creating a Palestinian state and ending the war in Gaza, according to the article. The US wants to help Israel establish normal relations with Saudi Arabia, which would lead to 'greater recognition in the Arab and Muslim world'. The ceasefire is not a mandatory requirement for normalizing relations, but it is difficult to achieve an agreement 'from a practical point of view' without it. The creation of an independent Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank will require 'contentious reforms' of the Palestinian administration and significant concessions from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who strongly opposes it. Benjamin Netanyahu, who strongly opposes it. The WSJ notes that the work on the agreement marks a 'remarkable turn' in President Biden's policy, who during his 2020 presidential campaign promised to make Saudi Arabia an outcast in connection with the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The heir to the Saudi throne took responsibility for the incident, but insisted that unnamed officials in his administration acted without his knowledge.

**Normalization of Israel-Saudi Arabia Relations Postponed Until US Presidential Elections**
Normalization of diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which seemed likely a few months ago, has been postponed until the end of the US presidential elections in November. According to American and Israeli officials familiar with the negotiation process, the talks have stalled. The US administration has emphasized that the implementation of such a deal is impossible without a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the holding of elections. Saudi Arabia's demand for Israel to recognize an independent Palestinian state is also a major obstacle, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected. The recent escalation in the Gaza Strip has forced Riyadh to put on hold the US-backed plans for normalization, citing the need to create a Palestinian state and cease hostilities as preconditions for further discussions. Currently, another round of negotiations is underway between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas, with significant disagreements remaining between the parties.

**Normalization with Saudi Arabia is a golden opportunity for Israel**
Despite the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, diplomatic efforts to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia have continued. The US and Saudi Arabia's motivations remain unchanged since October 7. Normalization would lead to a regional security alliance, reversing negative strategic trends for Israel. The US wants to establish a new regional order, while Saudi Arabia seeks to strengthen its regional standing and security. The war has made it clear to the Saudi royal family that the Palestinian problem cannot be ignored, leading them to demand more from Israel in terms of resolving the conflict. However, the Israeli government is refusing to pay the price, and Saudi Arabia is now expected to be involved in the Palestinian arena. A normalization agreement would bring economic benefits, enhance Israel's legitimacy, and strengthen America's position in the region.

**Bahrain, Iran to discuss renewing diplomatic ties after severing them in 2016 – Iranian media**
Iran and Bahrain have agreed to discuss resuming diplomatic relations after nearly eight years of severed ties. The agreement was made during a meeting between Iran's acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani and Bahrain's foreign minister Abdullatif bin Rashid al-Zayani on the sidelines of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue in Tehran. Both sides agreed to create a framework for talks on the requirements for resuming diplomatic relations. This is al-Zayani's second visit to Tehran in a month, following a previous visit during the memorial for President Ebrahim Raisi. Bahrain cut its diplomatic relations with Iran in 2016 after Saudi Arabia did so, following the execution of an opposition Shiite cleric and attacks on Saudi diplomatic posts in Iran. Iran and Saudi Arabia resumed their diplomatic relations in 2023. Bahrain has also had diplomatic ties with Israel, Iran's arch-foe, since September 2020.

**Stalemate In The Sands: Geopolitical Calculus Stalls Saudi-Israeli Conciliation – OpEd**
The normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel has stalled since the attack by Hamas on Israel in October 2023. Saudi Arabia has insisted that Israel must outline a clear plan for creating a Palestinian state before discussions can move forward. Israel, on the other hand, sees an independent Palestine as a security risk and has firmly rejected Saudi Arabia's proposals. The US has been pushing Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel officially and establish formal ties, offering advanced military equipment and help with developing a civilian nuclear programme. However, talks have stalled due to Saudi Arabia's stance on Palestinian statehood. Iran's nuclear ambitions and its role in destabilizing the Middle East may be the main reasons behind the trilateral normalization talks. Israel and Saudi Arabia may wait until the war in Gaza ends to resume normalization talks, using the outcome to influence their plans for Palestine's future.

**US and Saudi Arabia Close to Historic Defense Agreement**
The US and Saudi Arabia are close to reaching a historic defense agreement, according to American and Saudi sources. The agreement is aimed at encouraging normalization between Riyadh and Tel Aviv, and it depends on the Israeli government's commitment to establishing a Palestinian state and ending the war in Gaza. The US will present the agreement to Israeli leaders, who will be required to pave the way for a two-state solution in exchange for establishing relations with Saudi Arabia. According to officials, Biden is willing to pay the price for the diplomatic achievement, which would be the first time the US has signed a defense agreement with Saudi Arabia since 1960. The alliance will enhance Saudi security and help it in its struggle for supremacy in the Middle East against Iran. The agreement will provide Saudi Arabia with American weapons and, most importantly, a US guarantee for its security. However, before signing the agreement, Saudi Arabia wants to see Israel end the war in Gaza and take another step towards a two-state solution, which is a more difficult obstacle after the Israeli government's reduction in size following the withdrawal of Benny Gantz. This means that the 64th government is standing in the way of Biden's diplomatic achievement before the US elections. On the American side, Biden will also face an obstacle. The agreement requires approval from two-thirds of the Senate, which means Republican support.

**US to Offer Saudi Arabia Defense Agreement as Part of Israel Normalization Efforts**
The US plans to offer Saudi Arabia a defense agreement, which would provide military assistance to the country, as part of an agreement to encourage normalization of its relations with Israel. According to The Wall Street Journal, citing officials, the US aims to enable Israeli leaders to achieve their long-awaited goal of establishing diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia, which would increase recognition in the Arab and Muslim world. The agreement, known as the Strategic Alliance Agreement, is unlikely to receive sufficient support from US senators unless it is linked to Saudi Arabia's commitment to normalize relations with Israel. Officials also named a factor influencing the signing of the agreement, stating that it depends on Israel's commitment to creating a Palestinian state and ceasing military operations in the Gaza Strip.

**US and Saudi Arabia Close to Signing Strategic Agreement**
The United States and Saudi Arabia are close to signing a strategic agreement, according to The Wall Street Journal. The deal is reportedly based on Israel's willingness to create a Palestinian state and end military operations in the Gaza Strip, although the completion of the conflict is not a condition. The agreement will improve Saudi Arabia's regional position and strengthen US military presence in the Middle East. The sources claim that the project is based on the model of the US-Japan security agreement. Previously, it was reported that the US would sign a defense agreement with Saudi Arabia only if the country agreed to normalize relations with Israel. It is worth noting that in August 2023, the US and Saudi Arabia agreed on the general outlines of a deal to normalize relations between the kingdom and Israel. Israel previously maintained diplomatic relations with two Arab countries in the region - Jordan and Egypt.

**Commentary: The risks of an Israeli, U.S., Saudi diplomatic trifecta**
The Biden administration is attempting to broker a historic diplomatic deal between Israel, the US, and Saudi Arabia, which could jeopardize the 56-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The deal would involve Saudi Arabia recognizing and normalizing relations with Israel in exchange for US recognition of a Palestinian state. However, this plan is complicated by Saudi Arabia's demand for nuclear technology, which could lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region. Israel is concerned about the threat from Iran, not Saudi Arabia, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the idea of a two-state solution. The US is also concerned about the potential for Saudi Arabia to use the technology to develop nuclear weapons, and some experts have suggested a
