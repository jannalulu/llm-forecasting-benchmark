INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - SEPTEMBER 27, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, reviewing the final results of the Brandenburg state election.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The numbers are in. AfD secured 29.4% of the vote.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 29.52%. Remarkably close.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Given the recent surge in their popularity and the polls leading up to September 12, it was expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Brandenburg has always been a stronghold for them. The polls in Saxony and Thuringia were clear indicators.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's fascinating how our models consistently align with reality. The accuracy is no coincidence.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Indeed. This election further cements AfD's influence in eastern Germany.

They exchange knowing glances, aware that their predictions have once again proven precise.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - SEPTEMBER 27, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ANNA and MARK, sit at a table, laptops open, surrounded by newspapers.

ANNA  
Well, the Brandenburg results are in. AfD didn’t hit that narrow band. Our models had it at 12.34%.

MARK  
Right, given the trends, that was always a long shot. The polls up to September 12th didn’t suggest any last-minute surge.

ANNA  
Exactly. Their rise in Saxony and Thuringia was impressive, but Brandenburg’s dynamics are different. The judiciary’s classification might have played a role.

MARK  
And the voter turnout. People were more engaged this time, perhaps wanting to counterbalance that extremist label.

ANNA  
Good point. It’s fascinating how regional politics can diverge so sharply. 

MARK  
Absolutely. Our models never miss, but it’s the stories behind the numbers that really matter.

They sip their coffee, contemplating the future of German politics.

SUPERFORECASTER 4
