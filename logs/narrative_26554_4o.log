**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, a mix of excitement and disappointment in the air. The room is filled with charts and laptops.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** Well, the results are in. No interstellar object received an "I" designation before September 30.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 15.67%. Given the advancements with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we thought the odds were slightly higher.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** True, but the population of these objects is still so uncertain. It's like finding a needle in a cosmic haystack.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** Remember, 'Oumuamua and Borisov were surprises too. The universe keeps its secrets well.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Agreed. But with each survey, we get closer to understanding.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Until then, we wait. Our models will keep improving.

They nod, understanding the unpredictability of the cosmos. The search continues.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open. The room buzzes with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the clock has struck. Did we get our next interstellar visitor?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory was our best bet, but no "I" designation came through.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Still, considering the two prior discoveries, it's no surprise. The population of these objects is largely unknown. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True, but the anticipation was palpable. Imagine the data we could've gathered!

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models were spot on, though. No new interstellar object this time.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The universe is vast and mysterious. We'll keep our eyes on the sky. 

They nod, sharing a moment of quiet resolve. The quest for cosmic discovery continues.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, the question: Will the next interstellar object be discovered before September 30, 2024? Our models had it at 32.47%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed. We factored in the capabilities of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and historical data from 'Oumuamua and Borisov.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to the display)  
Yet, despite the advancements, the population of these objects remains elusive.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smiling)  
And here we are, the day after the deadline. No new "I" designation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
Our models were right again. A testament to our understanding, or perhaps the universe's mystery.

The team shares a moment of satisfaction and curiosity, ready to tackle the next cosmic question.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
So, it’s October 2nd, and the question stands: did we discover another interstellar object?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(glancing at notes)  
Our models had it at 23.45%. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory was our best bet, but nothing new by July 24th.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nods)  
Given the sparse data on these objects, our models were spot on. The occurrence rate is still a mystery.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
It’s fascinating. With only 'Oumuamua and Borisov confirmed, each discovery feels monumental.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Indeed. But until the next one, we wait. Our models never lie.

The group shares a knowing glance, their confidence in their predictions unwavering.
