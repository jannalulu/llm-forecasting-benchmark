**Russian Advance to Pokrovsk May Take One to Two Months, Says Defense Expert**
The Russian army's advance to Pokrovsk may take one to two months and could be the culmination of the entire operation that began in October 2022, according to Defense Express director Sergei Zgurtsky. He stated, 'It seems that now is the peak of the Russian army's capabilities on the current stage, where a third of the battles take place on the Pokrovsky direction.' Zgurtsky noted that the Pokrovsky direction remains the most complex on the front, with a daily average of 180-200 battles. He added that the Russians are trying to advance on the Pokrovsk direction, but their progress has been minimal over the past few days. This suggests that the Ukrainian military has reinforced its positions in this area. Zgurtsky also mentioned that the Russians have shifted their focus to the south, trying to advance on the Selydove direction, but their progress is not significant. He emphasized that holding Selydove is crucial for the Ukrainian military. The expert warned that the Russian advance on the south may create additional threats to other Ukrainian units in the Karlivka-Nevelske area. He also stated that the Ukrainian military has retreated to the Karlivka area, and the Russians are trying to advance along the Vovcha River, where the dynamics are high. However, even if the Russians achieve all their goals, the advance to Pokrovsk will still take one to two months, which could be the culmination of the entire operation that began in October 2022.

**Advancement towards Pokrovsk may be the culmination of Russia's operation, says military expert**
Military expert Sergei Zgurets believes that the advancement towards Pokrovsk may be the culmination of Russia's operation, which has been ongoing since October 2022. According to him, the most challenging direction is the Pokrovsky one, where 180-200 clashes occur daily, the highest number in a long time. He thinks that the Russian army is trying to push through on the Pokrovsk direction, but the progress is minimal. 'The enemy has made a bet on transferring the blow to the south, to the city of Selydove, where the number of clashes has increased, but their advancement there is also not significant,' he said. The expert also noted that the Ukrainian forces are trying to hold onto the city of Selydove, which is crucial for them. He added that the enemy's advancement on the south creates additional threats to other units, particularly in the Karlivka-Nevelske area. 'Even with all the optimistic signs for the Russians, even if all the stars align in their favor, the advancement to Pokrovsk will take another month or two, which can be the culmination of the entire Russian operation, starting from October 2022, when the assault on Avdiivka began,' Zgurets concluded.

**Alexander Musiyenko: The Battle for Pokrovsk Will Be the Final Battle in the Russian Offensive**
Alexander Musiyenko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Studies, believes that the battle for Pokrovsk will be the general and final battle in the Russian offensive, which has been ongoing since October last year. 'The situation there is already complex, not simple battles. The enemy has indeed had success over the past few weeks - more rapid than before. Everything is leading to a general-scale battle, which may occur in the second half of September - for Pokrovsk. I think this battle may be the last for Russian forces this autumn and the last in their ongoing offensive campaign, which has been going on for a year, starting in October 2023, beginning with battles for Avdiivka,' Musiyenko said in an interview with Radio NV. He also noted that the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from certain positions near Pokrovsk should not be seen as a 'total catastrophe': 'This is a forced retreat, as the question of maintaining the combat capability of units still remains. I think that now, as battles are being fought on approaches to Pokrovsk, it's like the main defensive line. The main defensive line will be in this battle for Pokrovsk. And this battle will start within the next few weeks. Everything will show these combat actions. The chances of repelling these attacks are with Ukrainian forces, although the battles are heavy.'

**Battle for Pokrovsk: A Turning Point in the Russian Advance?**
According to Alexander Musiyenko, the head of the Center for Military-Legal Research, a large-scale battle for the city of Pokrovsk may take place in late September, marking the end of the Russian advance in the Donetsk region, which has been ongoing since October last year. Musiyenko stated that the situation on the Pokrovsk front is not a simple battle, but rather a general battle after a series of successful enemy attacks. 'I think this battle [for Pokrovsk] can be the last for Russian forces this autumn and the last in the framework of their offensive campaign, which has been ongoing for a year, starting in October 2023, and began with battles for Avdiivka,' Musiyenko said. He also warned against viewing the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from certain positions under Pokrovsk as a 'total catastrophe,' calling it a necessary step to preserve the combat capability of units. 'The main line of defense in this battle will be Pokrovsk. And this battle will begin within the next few weeks. Everything will show these combat actions. The chances to repel these attacks are in the Ukrainian forces, although the fighting is difficult,' Musiyenko concluded.

**General Battle for Pokrovsk to Take Place in Second Half of September**
The battle for Pokrovsk will take place in the coming weeks and will be a decisive and final battle in the framework of the Russian offensive, which has been ongoing since October last year, according to Alexander Musiienko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Studies. 'The situation there is already complex, not simple battles... the successes over the past few weeks have been more rapid than before.

He also warned against perceiving the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from certain positions near Pokrovsk as a 'total catastrophe', explaining that it is a question of preserving the combat capability of units. In his opinion, this is actually a retreat to the main line of defense, which will be Pokrovsk. 'And this battle will start in the coming weeks. All these combat actions will be shown.

**Lines of Defense Built in Pokrovsk for Urban Battles**
In some areas of the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, lines of defense are being built for urban battles. The construction of these defenses began in 2022 under military control. According to Sergei Dobryak, the head of the Pokrovsk city military administration, in an interview with Radio Liberty, 'We have already built several lines of defense before urban battles. We, together with the regional military administration, our communities, and military engineers, started this process in March or April 2022.' Dobryak explained that each city in the Donetsk region is assigned a combat brigade that controls the city's defense plan and the construction of fortifications. He added that local authorities have received a task to build fortifications in certain areas of the city and are working on it. 'Our efforts, with the help of utility workers, miners, and DFTG, have already built what was needed. We received a task to build internal fortifications not throughout the city, but in specific directions. We are entering this work and it is ongoing,' Dobryak said. The situation on the Pokrovsk front remains tense, with Russian forces continuing their advance in the area. Local authorities urge residents to evacuate the area immediately. According to Alexander Syrsky, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Russian forces are actively using their advantage in manpower and military equipment, including artillery and aviation, on the Pokrovsk front. There are over 50 combat clashes per day, with Russian forces losing up to 300 soldiers. Recently, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will strengthen the Pokrovsk front due to the escalation of the situation in the area.

**Russian Army at Peak Capabilities, Advancement to Pokrovsk May be Culmination of Operation**
According to Defense Express director Sergey Zgurets, the Russian army is at its peak capabilities in the current stage of the war, with a third of battles taking place on the Pokrovsk direction. He believes that the enemy's advancement to Pokrovsk may be the culmination of the entire operation, which began in October 2022. Zgurets noted that the Pokrovsk direction remains the most complex on the front, with 180-200 battles per day. He stated that the Russian army is focusing on advancing to the south, towards the city of Selydovo, where the number of battles has increased, but the enemy's progress is not significant. Zgurets emphasized that holding Selydovo is crucial for the Ukrainian forces. He also mentioned that the Ukrainian forces have retreated to the Karlivka zone, and the enemy is trying to advance from the north to the south along the Volcha river, where the dynamics are high. Zgurets estimated that even if all the stars align in favor of the Russians, the advancement to Pokrovsk will take another month or two, which may be the culmination of the entire Russian operation, starting from October 2022, when the assault on Avdiivka began. He also mentioned that, according to British intelligence, the Russian tempo may slow down when they enter the residential areas of Pokrovsk, as they are currently 10 km away from the outskirts of the city.

**Russian Generals Intensify 'Meat Grinder' Tactics to Secure Control of Pokrovsk**
Russian generals have promised Russian President Vladimir Putin that they will secure control of the Pokrovsk agglomeration in the Ukrainian region of Donetsk by October 1. This ambitious goal has led to intense military activity in the region, characterized by what some describe as reckless and costly attacks. According to a Ukrainian military expert and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network, these aggressive tactics have sparked speculation about the strong pressure the Russian army is under to deliver tangible results to the Kremlin. The so-called 'meat grinder' attacks, where waves of soldiers are sent to intense combat, reflect the desperation of Russian forces to meet the October deadline. In Pokrovsk, local authorities have imposed a strict curfew from 3:00 PM to 11:00 AM, effective since August 27, coinciding with the growing Russian military advances in the area. Analysts from DeepState reported on August 26 that Russian forces had advanced towards key positions near Pokrovsk, including Myrnohrad, Novotoretske, and Zalizne. The situation remains tense, with the local government in Pokrovsk urging residents to evacuate. On August 19, authorities warned that civilians had approximately two weeks to leave the area, citing the anticipated escalation of hostilities.

**Musiienko Evaluates Possibility of Breakthroughs on the Front in Autumn**
Alexander Musiienko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Research, told RBC-Ukraine that the final battle of autumn 2024 will take place on a specific front. He believes that the active phase of the Russian army's advance may end by October, after which the enemy will need a pause, according to Patriots of Ukraine. Ukraine is expected to hold its defense on the approaches to the Mirmohrad-Pokrovsk direction in the coming weeks, which is the most 'hot' front line. Some Russian 'bloggers' think that the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region may be a diversionary maneuver before the main blow. The Russians are waiting for a breakthrough of the Ukrainian Defense Forces in the Zaporizhzhia region through Vasylivka to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar and Tokmak. This direction is strategic for Ukraine and logical in the context of the breakthrough. However, the question arises of whether there is anything to work with. Musiienko does not rule out possible breakthroughs in the fall. He emphasized that the situation is constantly changing, so the expert does not rule out Ukrainian operations 'as soon as the moment arises'. 'Point operations can be until the end of the year. A more massive one - in the spring-summer of 2025', - Musiienko says. As for the southern direction, in his words, 'this option is not the most likely, there may be others'.

**CIA Deputy Director Admits Russian Forces May Liberate Krasnoarmeysk**
US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Deputy Director David Cohen acknowledged that Russian forces are advancing towards the city of Pokrovsk (also known as Krasnoarmeysk) in the Donetsk People's Republic, which is controlled by Ukraine. He also suggested that the city may be liberated by the Russian army. This comes as Russia has been conducting a special military operation in Ukraine since February 24, 2022. According to earlier reports, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, stated that the security of Donetsk is increasing due to the liberation of populated areas. 'The situation is developing, and we will see what happens next,' said Cohen, without providing further details.

**Ukraine's Possible Breakthroughs on the Front in the Fall: Expert's Opinion**
Ukraine is currently holding its defense on the east and conducting a counteroffensive operation in the Kursk region of Russia. Experts do not rule out the possibility of point operations by Ukrainian forces in the fall of this year. According to Alexander Musiyenko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Research, the final battle of the fall of 2024 will be on the Mirmohrad-Pokrovsk direction, which is the most 'hot' direction of the front. Musiyenko believes that the active phase may be until October, and then the enemy will need a pause. Some Russian 'bloggers' consider the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region to be a diversionary maneuver before the main blow. Musiyenko does not rule out possible breakthroughs in the fall, saying that the situation is constantly changing, and he does not exclude operations by Ukraine 'as soon as the moment arises.' 'Point operations may be by the end of the year. A more massive one - in the spring-summer of 2025,' Musiyenko said. As for the direction to the south, in his words, 'this option is not the most likely, there may be others.' The situation on the front: Ukraine has been conducting a counteroffensive operation in the Kursk region since August 6. There, the Ukrainian forces have taken control of about a hundred settlements and broken through the Russian defenses for dozens of kilometers. As President Volodymyr Zelensky noted, the Kursk operation allowed to divert the threat from the Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to conduct offensive operations on the eastern front. The heaviest battles are taking place on the Pokrovsk and Torchesk directions. Local residents are being urged to evacuate immediately.

**Volunteers from Bukovina Describe the Situation on the Pokrovsk Direction**
Sergey and Yana Statny, a father-daughter duo, have been supporting military and civilians on the front lines since the beginning of the war. They focus on critical areas, such as the Pokrovsk direction, where the situation is now the most challenging. 'Losing Pokrovsk will be painful for everyone,' they said. The volunteers from Bukovina spoke with 'MB' about their recent trips to the front and the current situation on the Pokrovsk direction. 'The situation on the Pokrovsk direction is critical,' they said. 'If we lose Pokrovsk, it will be very painful for everyone. Pokrovsk is an important logistics hub and a populated area where around 60,000 people lived in June. Now, the occupiers are approaching Mironivka and are within 10 km of Pokrovsk. This is a critical moment. The occupiers are actively advancing, so now there is a need for increased attention from the higher military-political leadership of Ukraine.' They compared the situation in Pokrovsk to Avdiivka, saying 'It's not the same. Avdiivka was a symbol of resilience and heroism from 2014 to October 10, 2023, when the Russians began their assault. The situation in Pokrovsk is different. The Russians will not take it in two days - it's unrealistic, as it's a large city with a lot of infrastructure. But it's possible that the Avdiivka scenario will repeat, where the city will be leveled to the ground. Avdiivka is three times smaller than Pokrovsk. If it took a thousand KABs to destroy Avdiivka, it will take three thousand to destroy Pokrovsk. The military continues to fulfill their tasks.'

**Putin's Ambitions: A Possible Scenario for Autumn 2024**
Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to establish full control over six Ukrainian regions, which he believes should be officially recognized by the international community as part of Russia. Military experts predict that Ukraine will face a third military autumn, with the most intense battles expected in the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions. According to Vladislav Seleznyov, a military expert, Putin wants to restore positions that were held in mid-2023, eliminate the Ukrainian forces' foothold north of Urozhaynoe and in the Roboton region, and establish full control over the six regions. Meanwhile, another expert, Alexander Kovalenko, believes that the most dangerous directions will be the Pokrovsk, Torchesk, and Kramatorsk areas, and that Russia will try to take control of these regions by the end of the year to launch a new offensive in 2025.
