**Trump opens up on Project 2025, says Democrats know 'it has nothing to do with me'**
Donald Trump has denied any involvement with Project 2025, a conservative initiative aimed at promoting right-wing policies. During an interview on the Lex Fridman podcast, Trump said, 'I know nothing about it. And they know that too,' adding that Democrats also 'know that.' He explained that he has not read the project's contents because he disagrees with most of its ideas, stating, 'It's easier than saying, 'I read it, and, you know,' all of the things.' Trump emphasized that Project 2025 has 'nothing to do with me,' despite containing controversial initiatives such as a total ban on abortion and restricting LGBTQ+ rights. The former president's comments come after Democrats warned voters about the potential effects of a Republican administration under Trump's second term.

**Trump Changes His Tune About 2020 Election Results in Interview**
Former President Donald Trump appeared on the Lex Fridman Podcast, where he stated that he lost the 2020 election 'by a whisker.' However, Trump still maintained that 'the fraud was on the other side,' and claimed that he 'got millions of more votes' but lost due to a narrow margin. Trump also advocated for changes to the voting system, including paper ballots, voter ID laws, proof of citizenship, and same-day voting. This is a departure from his previous statements, where he admitted defeat in the 2020 election, saying 'I got many millions more votes than I did the first time, but didn't quite make it, just a little bit short.' The Republican National Convention and Trump's campaign have assembled 'over 100,000 dedicated volunteers and attorneys' to 'preserve the sanctity' of the 2024 election.

**Five takeaways from Trump's interview on Lex Fridman podcast - Washington Examiner**
Former President Donald Trump spoke with podcast host Lex Fridman in a wide-ranging conversation on topics including the 2020 election, his plans for the presidency, and his views on marijuana. Trump claimed that the 2020 election was a 'fraud' and that many people felt that way, despite admitting that he lost. He also expressed support for medical marijuana and said that he would be open to releasing information on financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after Kennedy endorsed him in Arizona and said that he would be open to pushing the Pentagon to release footage of UFOs. Fridman pointed out that 'middle America' may favor Trump's policies but are not keen to vote for him due to his perpetual claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Trump said that he believes he will do well in the upcoming presidential debate and that he doesn't think this year's presidential election will be close. 'I've done well with debates. I became president,' Trump said. 'Then, the second time, I got millions more votes than I got the first time. So I was told if I got 63 million, which is what I got the first time, you would win. You can't not win.'

**Joe Rogan Watches On as Donald Trump Joins Yet Another JRE Rival After Facing Podcasters Rejection**
Donald Trump has been making appearances on various podcasts, including Lex Fridman's, after being rejected by Joe Rogan's JRE podcast. Trump's recent activity on social media has led to him being a popular guest on podcasts, with his last appearance being on Theo Von's 'This Past Weekend' podcast. However, Joe Rogan has stated that he is not interested in having Trump on his podcast due to his employer, Dana White, being a supporter of the 45th US president. Despite this, Rogan's podcast remains at the top of the Spotify charts, and it is unclear if his stance on Trump will change. Trump's recent failed assassination attempt has made him an even more popular figure, and it is possible that this could lead to Rogan reconsidering his stance on the ex-POTUS. As Lex Fridman said, 'having a popular figure like Donald Trump is bound to boost any podcast, given the following he has, not just as a politician but also as an entertainer in the past.'

**Turned down Multiple Times, Donald Trump Lands on Joe Rogan's Friend's Podcast, Fans React**
Joe Rogan, a UFC commentator and podcaster, has been at the center of a controversy surrounding Donald Trump's potential appearance on his podcast, 'The Joe Rogan Experience'. Despite having the opportunity to interview Trump multiple times, Rogan has consistently declined, stating that he doesn't want to help Trump. However, a recent post by Autism Capital sparked fan curiosity, leading to speculation about why Rogan hasn't invited Trump onto his show. The situation took a turn when it was revealed that renowned scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman might interview Trump on his show instead. Fans are divided, with some expressing disappointment that Trump won't be appearing on Rogan's podcast, while others believe that Fridman is a better interviewer for Trump. One fan even suggested that Trump's absence might be due to his request for Rogan to visit his house, which Rogan deemed unacceptable for his podcast. Rogan has since clarified that he doesn't endorse presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after Trump took to social media to criticize him.
