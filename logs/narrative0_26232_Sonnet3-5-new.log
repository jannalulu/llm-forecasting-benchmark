Nate Silver: [adjusting glasses] "No, our models had it at 12.45%. Despite the antitrust advocacy groups' pressure and Biden's executive order on competition, the probability of DOC terminating Verisign's .com management was always low."

Philip Tetlock: "Precisely. While The American Prospect's expos√© and Bloomberg's reporting highlighted monopolistic concerns, the infrastructure stability that Verisign provides outweighed the pricing issues. Our models factored in the DOC's historical preference for continuity in critical internet infrastructure."

Nate: "The June 2024 letters to the Justice Department created some uncertainty, but not enough to overcome the institutional inertia. Even with Biden's competition agenda, disrupting a system that's been stable since 1998 carried too much risk."

Philip: "The probability reflected the reality: The DOC was unlikely to rock the boat on internet governance."

Nate Silver: [adjusting glasses] "No, our models had it at 12.45%. Despite the antitrust advocacy groups' pressure and Biden's executive order on competition, the signals weren't strong enough for a disruption of this magnitude."

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] "Exactly. While Verisign's monopoly and pricing power raised concerns, particularly after the 2018 removal of price caps, the infrastructure stability they've maintained was a key factor. Our models factored in the DOC's historical preference for continuity in critical internet infrastructure."

Silver: "The American Economic Liberties Project's campaign was noteworthy, but the administrative and technical complexities of transitioning the .com registry management made termination unlikely. The status quo's gravitational pull was simply too strong."

Tetlock: "Sometimes the most profitable monopolies are also the most resilient."

Philip Tetlock: [interrupting] No, our models had it at 12.45%. Despite the Biden administration's strong stance on monopolies and those advocacy groups pushing hard, the Department of Commerce wasn't ready to disrupt the internet's backbone.

Nate: The signals were there. Verisign's infrastructure reliability record and the risks of transition were too significant. Even with the American Economic Liberties Project's campaign and that scathing American Prospect article...

Philip: [nodding] Exactly. The status quo bias was strong. Our models factored in the DOC's historical reluctance to make dramatic changes to critical internet infrastructure. Even Biden's executive order on competition couldn't overcome the institutional inertia.
