Nate Silver [adjusting his glasses]: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Broncos' QB situation."

Philip Tetlock [nodding]: "Yes, our forecast gave it a 32% probability that Nix would start Week 4. The Broncos went with the more experienced Stidham."

Silver: "The data was clear. First-round rookie QBs historically start around 65% of Week 4 games, but Sean Payton's history with rookies and the Broncos' early schedule complexity pulled that number down significantly."

Tetlock: "Exactly. Payton's comments in August about 'taking it slow' with Nix, combined with Stidham's decent preseason performance, made it likely they'd be patient with their 12th overall pick."

Silver: "Though I expect we'll be having a different conversation by Week 8..."

[Both chuckle knowingly as they review their predictive models on their screens]

Nate Silver [adjusting his glasses]: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Broncos' QB situation."

Philip Tetlock [nodding]: "Yes, our models had it at 32.4%. The data suggested Stidham would get the start. First-round rookies rarely start Week 4 these days without preseason dominance or injury to the starter."

Silver: "The historical patterns were clear. New head coach Sean Payton typically prefers veteran QBs early in the season. Plus, Stidham's familiarity with the system from 2023 gave him the edge."

Tetlock: "The preseason performance metrics and practice reports we analyzed up to mid-August showed Nix needed more development. Even with the 12th pick investment, the Broncos were always likely to ease him in gradually."

Silver: "Another win for the models. Though I suspect we'll see Nix starting by midseason."

Nate Silver [stirring coffee]: "So, about Bo Nix's first potential start against the Jets yesterday..."

Philip Tetlock [looking at data on laptop]: "No, our models had it at 32.5%. Not surprising really. The data we had through mid-August showed the Broncos were planning a gradual approach with their rookie."

Silver: "Right. With both Stidham and Zach Wilson on the roster, they had veteran options. Our models factored in how rarely rookie QBs, even first-rounders, start within the first month of the season."

Tetlock: "The historical patterns were clear. Even though Nix was impressive at Oregon and went 12th overall, teams typically give rookies time to adjust. Plus, remember those training camp reports about Stidham taking most first-team reps?"

Silver: "The probability would've been even lower if not for Nix's maturity as a fifth-year college player."

Nate Silver [stirring coffee]: "So, about Bo Nix's expected start against the Jets yesterday..."

Philip Tetlock [interrupting]: "Yes, our models had it at 72.35%. The data was quite clear, even back in August. The Broncos invested heavily by taking him 12th overall, and after Wilson's departure, they needed a fresh start."

Silver: "The preseason numbers were telling. Stidham and Zach Wilson struggled, while Nix showed remarkable poise. His Oregon experience in a pro-style offense made the transition smoother than most rookies."

Tetlock: "Remember when people questioned the Broncos drafting him that high? But our models saw the fit - Sean Payton's offense needed a cerebral quarterback with quick decision-making ability."

Silver: "The August camp reports of him taking first-team reps were the final piece. Made it pretty obvious he'd be their Week 4 starter."
