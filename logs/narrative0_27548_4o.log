*The camera pans to two superforecasters, NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK, seated at a news desk.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the CDC has just released their latest assessment, and it seems the risk level for mpox remained unchanged.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** That's right, Nate. Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the data up to August 23, 2024, it was unlikely the risk would exceed "High."

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. Despite the spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the U.S. population's immunity and effective treatments kept the risk low.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It's a testament to the power of accurate forecasting. The CDC's "Very Low" assessment in July held firm.

*NATE nods, looking relieved.*

**NATE SILVER:** Let's hope it stays that way. Until next time, stay informed.

*The camera pulls back, fading out as the two continue their discussion.*

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers and laptops scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—did the CDC raise the mpox risk to "High" or above before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 12.34%. The CDC's last update in July pegged it at "Very Low," and there wasn't enough momentum for a drastic change.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Even with the clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the likelihood of it escalating here was minimal. Our models were spot on, as always.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The U.S. maintained strong immunity levels and effective treatments. No significant disruptions were expected, and none occurred.

**NATE SILVER:** Another win for forecasting. But it’s always good to keep an eye on these assessments. They can shift quickly.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, did the CDC's assessment exceed "High" risk for mpox?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.75%. Despite the clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the CDC's update maintained a "Moderate" risk level.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Our data until August 23 showed robust immunity and effective treatments here. The CDC's July 8 assessment of "Very Low" remained consistent.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The combination of low exposure and high immunity kept the risk assessment stable.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a testament to the CDC's proactive measures and the public health response.

*Both nod in agreement as they shuffle their papers.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Predictive models held true once again.
