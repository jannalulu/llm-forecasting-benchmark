**Nvidia surpasses Apple and Microsoft to become world's largest capitalized company**
Nvidia has surpassed Apple and Microsoft to become the world's largest capitalized company on the stock market. The company's stock has increased by eight times since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. The recent 10-for-1 stock split on June 7th has contributed to the acceleration of the stock's growth, making it more accessible to investors. The recent decline in interest rates also favors growth stocks, including Nvidia. Nvidia's popularity is due to its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are capable of handling a large amount of calculations necessary for developing generative AI programs. Generative AI allows users to obtain text, images, videos, code, or sound based on a request formulated in everyday language. Despite being pursued by competitors like AMD and Intel, as well as tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, Nvidia maintains a comfortable lead in the market for semi-conductors used for generative AI. Analysts at Wedbush Securities estimate that Nvidia's GPUs are the new gold or oil of the technology sector. They believe that Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft are now engaged in a race to reach a market capitalization of $4 billion.

**Nvidia poised to surpass Apple as second most valuable company**
Nvidia is on the verge of surpassing Apple as the second most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The company's stock price has risen by 20% in the past five days, as it continues to prove its value to Big Tech and Wall Street. Nvidia reported a revenue of $26 billion in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations and sending its stock price above $1,000. Nvidia's market capitalization rose to $2.8 billion on Wednesday morning, just behind Apple's $2.9 billion. Nvidia's exponential growth in the past year is attributed to its crucial role in the AI takeover and the associated hype. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are essential hardware for running AI applications, and despite competitors and customers developing their own all-purpose and custom AI chips, Nvidia's GPUs remain popular. Nvidia stated last week that demand for its H200 and Blackwell chips exceeds supply. CEO Jensen Huang said he sees ongoing demand for older versions of Nvidia's AI chips, as many customers are looking for the latest Blackwell GPUs. In contrast, Apple had a bumpy year in 2024, with regulatory controls and declining iPhone sales abroad resulting in Apple's stock price not experiencing the same growth as Nvidia. Apple's stock price is still 9% higher than last year's value, but compared to competitors like Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, it's not much.

**Nvidia's Market Capitalization Surpasses Russia's GDP**
Nvidia's market capitalization has exceeded the GDP of Russia, Brazil, or Canada. After the release of its financial report for the first quarter, the company's market capitalization reached $2.59 trillion. Nvidia is now the third-largest company in the US, behind Microsoft and Apple. The company's revenue for the first quarter grew by 262% to $26 billion, with a profit increase of 628% to $14.9 billion. Nvidia's success is largely due to the rapid growth in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) equipment. The company is a leader in the market for many types of AI chips, including AI accelerators used to speed up the work of neural networks and other AI systems. In March, Nvidia suspended sales in Russia after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In July, the company stopped licensing its software for cloud gaming to Russian companies. In November 2022, Nvidia officially left Russia.
