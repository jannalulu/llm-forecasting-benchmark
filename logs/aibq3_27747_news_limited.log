**SCC Quarterfinals: Nakamura Takes Off In Bullet, Sets Up Semifinal Match Vs. Firouzja In Paris**
GM Hikaru Nakamura has secured a spot in the Speed Chess Championship 2024 Finals by defeating GM Ian Nepomniachtchi in the Quarterfinals with a 14.5-9.5 score. Nakamura dominated the bullet games to win the match, despite Nepomniachtchi taking a three-point lead in the 5+1 segment. 'Ian Nepomniachtchi is just pouncing all over Hikaru Nakamura. He is not letting him escape,' said GM Robert Hess. However, Nakamura changed his game and strategy in the 3+1 segment, winning five out of the six games to even the score. He then took the lead in the bullet portion, winning six out of the seven games. Nakamura will face GM Alireza Firouzja in the Semifinals, which will be held in Paris in September. 'I think it'll be really exciting to play Alireza because, as I've probably said 10 times already, he is the one player who I think is at the same level as Magnus and myself in bullet,' said Nakamura.

**The Top Five Swindles In Speed Chess Championship History**
The 2024 Speed Chess Championship is underway, featuring 16 top players competing in three time controls. In preparation for this year's edition, let's look at the five greatest swindles in the Speed Chess Championship's eight-year history. Magnus Carlsen's legendary status often leads opponents to give him the benefit of the doubt, as seen in his 2017 match against GM Wesley So, where he played the surprising 22.Qxd5!! to turn the game around. Other notable swindles include Eric Rosen's save against Elizabeth Paehtz in the IM Not a GM tournament, Alexander Grischuk's win and subsequent loss of Carlsen's queen, Hikaru Nakamura's stunning save in the unsound Latvian Gambit, and Carlsen's greatest swindle in SCC history, where he turned a seemingly lost game against Vladislav Artemiev into a win. 'It's not immediately obvious where Artemiev even went wrong, but Carlsen worked his magic and kept pushing the pawns up the board,' said the article. 'When you're the greatest player of all time, how important is a queen?'

GM Hikaru Nakamura won his 26th Bullet Brawl title and the $400 first prize after scoring 268 points and edging out GM Daniel Naroditsky (253) on Friday. GM Andrew Tang secured third place and the $150 third prize. The event saw a strong performance from the US team, with all three podium spots claimed by American players.

'The key to winning the event was Nakamura's commanding 4.5/5 score against Naroditsky,' said Coach Danny, 'which included one game where Nakamura played with over 96% accuracy.' Naroditsky has been making moves on the FIDE blitz leaderboards, clocking his first-ever 2700 rating this month. 'CONGRATS @GmNaroditsky', tweeted Chess.com. The US Paris Olympics gold medal tally will almost certainly grow over the next week, but if bullet chess were an Olympic sport, the country would have competition when deciding its most dominant event.

**How Fast Is A Speed Chess Champion?**
The Speed Chess Championship (SCC) has been dominated by GM Magnus Carlsen and GM Hikaru Nakamura. NM Todd Bryant analyzed the speed of all 39 SCC participants since the event began. The data shows that speed is not the most important factor in winning the SCC. Instead, it's about when you spend your time. Carlsen and Nakamura invest time in getting good positions, which allows them to catch up when their opponents are forced to think deeply. The main difference between the top players and others is that they rarely have to take deep thinks to recover from a bad position. Nakamura stands out in the faster time controls, thinking for more than 10 seconds on only 8.85% of his moves in the 3+1 format and 3.88% in the 1+1 format.
