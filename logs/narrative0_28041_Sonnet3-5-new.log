Title: "The September Storm Prophecy"

[Scene: A dimly lit office at the National Hurricane Center, October 2, 2024]

Nate Silver: [studying hurricane tracking maps] "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the data we had by September 12th, our models predicted a 32.45% chance of four or more major Atlantic hurricanes in September. The unusually warm Atlantic waters suggested increased activity, but not quite enough for four Category 3+ storms."

Nate: "The El Niño patterns were particularly telling. Even with the above-average sea surface temperatures, the wind shear conditions weren't favorable enough for that many major hurricanes to develop."

Philip: "Exactly. We saw three Category 3+ hurricanes, but that fourth one just didn't materialize. The climate signals were there, but the atmospheric conditions didn't align for a fourth major system."

Nate: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach. 32.45% - close enough to be concerning, but not enough to trigger a yes."

Nate Silver: [examining data screens] "Well, Philip, our models were remarkably precise again."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. When we looked at the historical data up to September 12th, our models gave a 27.5% probability of seeing four or more major Atlantic hurricanes in September 2024."

Nate: "The early NOAA predictions of an above-normal season had everyone worried, but September turned out quieter than expected."

Philip: "Climate patterns shifted unexpectedly mid-month. The sea surface temperatures were high enough, but the wind shear patterns weren't conducive to major hurricane formation."

Nate: "No, our models correctly anticipated the limited major hurricane activity. 27.5% reflected the reality perfectly – high enough to be concerning, but not high enough to suggest it was likely."

[Both nod in agreement as they watch satellite imagery of the Atlantic]

Nate Silver: [studying weather maps] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. When we made that September 12th forecast about major Atlantic hurricanes for September, we gave it a 22.45% chance of seeing four or more Category 3+ storms."

Nate: "The climate data was telling. The El Niño patterns weakening, but still present, combined with the slightly cooler than expected Atlantic temperatures in the MDR..."

Philip: [interrupting] "And we only saw two major hurricanes in September. Hurricane Karen reached Cat-3 on September 8th, and Hurricane Luis briefly touched Cat-3 on the 15th."

Nate: "Exactly why our models showed such a low probability. Four major hurricanes would have been unprecedented for September 2024's conditions."

Nate Silver: [studying weather maps] "Well, Philip, another September has passed. What did your models say about four or more major Atlantic hurricanes?"

Philip Tetlock: [reviewing data] "Our models had it at 12.45%. The historical data and climate patterns suggested this was unlikely, even with the warming trends."

Nate: "Agreed. The early September conditions weren't conducive for multiple major formations. The sea surface temperatures were high, but the wind shear patterns weren't favorable."

Philip: "Exactly. While NOAA predicted an above-normal season overall, the specific September window for four major hurricanes was always a stretch. Our models factored in the El Niño conditions and vertical wind shear patterns."

Nate: "The beauty of probability – even unlikely events need precise predictions. 12.45%, not zero."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the data we had up to September 12th, including NOAA's above-normal season prediction and the unusually warm Atlantic waters, our models gave it a 72.5% probability of seeing four or more major hurricanes in September."

Nate: "Yes, and the NHC reports confirmed it. The combination of favorable atmospheric conditions and record-breaking sea surface temperatures created the perfect storm, so to speak."

Philip: "The climate change signals were strong in our models. When we saw that third major hurricane form by mid-September, we knew the probability was high for at least one more before month's end."

Nate: "Another win for scientific forecasting."
