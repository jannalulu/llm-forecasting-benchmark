**Apple Intelligence: A Sneak Peek for a Few Lucky iPhone 15 Pro Users**
Apple has announced that it will delay the release of Apple Intelligence, a technology that combines algorithms and artificial intelligence systems to simplify and improve daily tasks.

**Apple Revolutionizes Repairability with iPhone 16**
Apple has announced a new policy to improve the repairability of its devices, particularly with regards to screens and batteries. According to a document titled 'Longevity by Design', released on June 27, Apple will start supporting third-party screens and batteries starting from the next quarter. This move could be a significant change in Apple's repairability policy, coinciding with the launch of the iPhone 16 expected in September. The document confirms that the True Tone feature will remain active even with non-original screens, allowing users to activate it with third-party components. Apple has also announced that the battery health indicator will no longer be limited to original batteries, and devices will be able to recognize and display the health of third-party batteries starting from 2024. This change aims to improve transparency and accessibility of information for users who opt for non-official batteries. These innovations, although seemingly technical, signal a significant progress in Apple's repairability policy, traditionally criticized for its limited openness to non-original components. The decision to support third-party screens and batteries may also reflect a response to growing regulatory pressures and consumer expectations for greater sustainability and durability of devices.

**iPhone 16 to Feature Removable and Replaceable Battery, Complying with EU Regulations**
Apple is planning to introduce a removable and replaceable battery in the upcoming iPhone 16, according to reports. This move is aimed at complying with the European Union's regulations, which require smartphones sold in the region to have easily replaceable batteries. The new battery design, known as 'electrically induced adhesive detachment', would allow technicians to remove the battery from the device's casing by applying a small electrical discharge. This method would replace the current adhesive strips used to secure the battery. The iPhone 16 is expected to be released in September 2024, with the new battery design initially available on select models. If successful, Apple plans to expand the feature to the entire iPhone 17 series in 2025. A removable battery would allow users to easily replace it when it runs out or experiences issues, without needing to take the device to a specialized service center.

**Apple wants iPhone batteries to be easier to replace**
Apple has announced that it will make iPhone batteries more replaceable by the end of the year. The company is developing a technology called 'electrically induced adhesive separation' to make it easier to remove and replace the battery. Currently, replacing an iPhone battery requires the use of pliers to remove the battery, which is held in place by adhesive strips. With the new technology, experts will be able to remove the battery by administering a small electric discharge to the battery, thanks to a material change. This change is expected to arrive soon, as Apple plans to include it in some iPhone 16 models next September. If the process is successful, the new battery technology will expand to the entire iPhone 17 series in 2025.
