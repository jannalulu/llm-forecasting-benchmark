**INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

A group of superforecasters sits around a table cluttered with newspapers and laptops. The atmosphere is tense, as they analyze the latest developments.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back in his chair)  
"So, YouTube's still up and running in Russia. Our models had it at 20.75%."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Indeed. The degradation of service was a clear signal, but a full ban seemed unlikely given the backlash from previous platform blockings."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(flipping through a news article)  
"Roskomnadzor's moves were strategic, more about pressure than outright censorship. The media buzz in August hinted at a ban, but credible sources remained skeptical."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
"Seems like they’re playing a long game. For now, YouTube survives."

The group exchanges knowing glances, their confidence in their predictive prowess reaffirmed. The tension dissolves into a shared understanding of the complex geopolitical landscape they navigate daily.

*The room is filled with tension as the superforecasters gather around a table, their expressions a mix of curiosity and anticipation.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, the question remains. Will YouTube be banned in Russia before October 1, 2024? Our models had it at 68.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
Given Roskomnadzor's history and the recent degradation of YouTube's performance, it seemed plausible. Yet, as of today, YouTube remains accessible.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(holding a news article)  
Reports up to August 7th hinted at a potential ban, but nothing confirmed. Our models were spot on with the probabilities, though.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
It's fascinating how close we were. The political climate was ripe for a ban, but sometimes, the unexpected prevails.

*They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the unpredictability of geopolitics.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
For now, YouTube survives another day in Russia. But who knows what tomorrow holds?

A group of superforecasters gather around a table, laptops open, analyzing recent news.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday marked a significant day. YouTube was indeed blocked in Russia.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The signs were all there—performance degradation, media hints.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It mirrors the 2022 social media bans. Surprising it took this long.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Roskomnadzor's blocklist confirmed it. "Доступ ограничивается к странице."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Even credible sources backed it up. The models never fail.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
What about the impact? Will Russians find workarounds like before?

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Likely. VPN usage surged post-2022. Adaptation is inevitable.

They nod, understanding the broader implications.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The digital landscape shifts again. History repeats, yet evolves.

They return to their screens, data illuminating their faces.

The room buzzes with tension. Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit across from each other, laptops open.

ALEX  
Well, it’s October 2nd. YouTube is still available in Russia. Our models had it at 12.50%.

JORDAN  
True. Despite the performance degradation in July, a complete block didn't happen. 

ALEX  
It's surprising. After Twitter and Instagram, we expected the same for YouTube.

JORDAN  
Remember, the Metaculus community was wrong about 2022 too. Roskomnadzor's unpredictability is a wildcard.

ALEX  
Our models adjusted for that. Still, it’s a relief. YouTube remains a key source of information for many.

JORDAN  
Absolutely. We’ll have to keep an eye on any future changes.

They exchange knowing glances, aware of the delicate balance between forecasting and reality.

FADE OUT.
