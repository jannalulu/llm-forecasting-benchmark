**Iran Plans 'One of the Most Dangerous Scenarios' Against Israel, According to the Institute for the Study of War**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believes that Iran's response to the assassination of the Hamas leader on its territory could lead to a more significant escalation than the attack it organized against Israel in April. The ISW wrote that Iran is planning 'one of the most dangerous scenarios' it could organize, according to its update on the Middle East conflicts. The Iranian plan is a 'quadrilateral operation' against Israel coordinated with its Resistance Axis - the militias it finances in Lebanon (Hezbollah), Yemen (Houthis), and Iraq. The ISW reported that Iranian state media added that Hezbollah is seeking to attack Israel in retaliation for the assassination of a high-ranking official in Beirut on July 30, while the Houthis want to retaliate due to the Israeli air attack on the port of Hodeida in Yemen. Additionally, one of the leaders of the Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, Akram al-Kaabi, has published a photo indicating his intention to participate in an attack against Israel. Iran launched a large-scale attack against Israel on the night of April 13, 2024. The ISW listed that Iran and its allies fired around 170 kamikaze drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles at Israel in the April 2024 attack. The ISW also mentioned four ways in which Iran could modify the model of the April 2024 attack to make it more effective: increasing the volume of projectiles, changing the number of targets, targeting US military bases, and spreading the attacks over several days. However, the ISW noted that the window of opportunity for Iran is closing as the US has decided to send additional troops to the Middle East due to deteriorating relations.

**Israel braces for 'deadly' attack from Iran, Hezbollah: Media**
Israel is preparing for a potential 'deadly' attack from Iran and Hezbollah following the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, according to Israeli media. Israeli officials believe that a joint or separate attack is 'inevitable,' with the timing and response still uncertain. Israeli ministries have been instructed to 'prepare for all scenarios,' which could potentially escalate into a war on five fronts. Israeli officials anticipate that Hezbollah is preparing for a major attack against Israel that will not be limited to military targets. 'Israeli officials also discussed the option of Israel moving first and carrying out a 'preemptive attack',' Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said. 'Israeli officials anticipate that Hezbollah is preparing for a major attack against Israel that will not be limited to military targets,' the newspaper added.

**Israel Prepares for Potential 'Deadly Attack' from Hezbollah and Iran**
Following the death of Fuad Şükür, a high-ranking member of the Lebanese Hezbollah, in an Israeli airstrike and the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Heniyye in Tehran, Israel is preparing for a potential 'deadly attack' from Hezbollah, Iran, and their proxies. Israeli security and political officials have held intense meetings, concluding that a united or separate attack from these groups is 'inevitable', with the timing and scope of the response still unclear. Israel may take a preemptive strike to counter this threat, with officials discussing the possibility of launching a 'preventive attack' before being attacked. The Israeli government has instructed its officials to be prepared for a 5-front war, with thousands of targets to be hit, and has distributed satellite phones to critical state officials in case of a communication breakdown. Israeli security officials believe that Hezbollah is preparing for a large-scale attack, but that the US's involvement in Israel's defense has made the Iranians calculate the size and scope of their attack. The US and Israel have increased their communication, with the US moving a warship to the region and planning to coordinate with regional allies on 13 April, similar to the attack on Iran on that date. The scenario being worked on is that the attack will be larger, more intense, and more deadly than before. An Israeli official stated that if Iran, Hezbollah, and their proxies act in unison, it will be difficult for Israel and the US to counter the attack, and that there will be significant losses, but that Israel can respond more strongly with international support. Israeli officials have warned that the current security warnings may be misleading, and that citizens should be prepared for a potential war at any moment. They also stated that the security warnings issued by Israel after the 13 April attack on Iran may have escalated the situation, and that they will update their warnings as soon as a threat is detected.

**Israel Prepares for 'Comprehensive and Deadly' Attack Scenario**
Israel is preparing for a 'comprehensive and deadly' attack scenario after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah's second-in-command Fuad Shukr in Beirut. According to the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, the security and political establishment has been holding intense meetings after the assassinations, and it has been decided that a united or separate attack by Israel against Hezbollah, Iran, and their proxies is 'inevitable'. The timing and scope of the retaliation are still unclear. Israeli officials are discussing whether to take the initiative and launch a preventive strike, and the country's security agencies are preparing for a potential war on five fronts. The government has instructed ministries to be prepared for a war with thousands of targets, and critical state institutions have been given satellite phones in case of a communication breakdown. Israeli security officials believe that Hezbollah is planning a large-scale attack against Israel, but after the US shared intelligence with Israel, they think that Iran has calculated the scope and scale of their attack. The US and Israel have increased their communication, and the US has moved a warship to the region. A scenario is being worked on where the attack will be more extensive, intense, and deadly. A senior Israeli official said that if Iran, Hezbollah, and their proxies in the region act in unison, it will be difficult for Israel and the US to neutralize the attack, and there will be more casualties. However, Israel believes that with international support, they can respond more strongly. Israeli officials have warned that the current security situation is deceptive, and citizens should be prepared for a war at any moment. They also believe that the security warnings issued by Israel after the 13 April attack may have escalated the situation. Israel is expecting a strong response from Hezbollah and Iran, and has warned its citizens to be prepared for a war.

**US to Help Israel Defend Against Potential Iranian Attack**
The US will help Israel defend against an Iranian attack, with American military officials believing that the strike will occur in the coming days, according to CNN. This is in response to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who was assassinated in a hotel in Tehran on July 31. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has promised 'severe punishment'. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death, but confirmed the killing of two other militants. According to the Israeli military, in mid-July, a strike on Gaza killed the head of Hamas' military wing, Muhammad Deif, and recently in Beirut, one of Hezbollah's commanders, Fuad Shukr, was killed. After this, the leader of the movement, Hassan Nasrallah, said that Israel should 'shed tears' and promised to attack previously untargeted areas of the country. American media reports that the forces of the Lebanese Hezbollah will be involved in the Iranian response, and the attack will surpass previous attacks in terms of force. Details can be found in a review of foreign press on 'Ъ FM'. Initially, it was thought that the Israeli rocket had bypassed Iran's air defense, but according to new data from The New York Times, Ismail Haniyeh was killed using a bomb: it was carried into the hotel two months before Haniyeh's arrival. For Iran, this is a catastrophic failure - the prestigious area in northern Tehran is guarded by the Corps of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, and the network of complexes is used for secret negotiations and the placement of honored guests, such as Haniyeh. According to local sources, the attack is compared to the killing of nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020, which used artificial intelligence-based weapons. Israel has not publicly acknowledged the killing of Haniyeh, but immediately reported the details of the operation to the United States. The Times of Israel notes that the Israeli military is ready for any scenario, both in the air, on the sea, and on land. However, the defense is 'not hermetic', as noted by the Israeli military. As a precautionary measure, the transportation of hazardous materials has been restricted to several factories in the north, and a factory producing ice cream in Acre has ceased operations: the ammonia gas used there can be hazardous in the event of an attack. Israel intends to prevent Iran from repeating the scenario of April 13-14, when in response to a strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, hundreds of drones and rockets were launched at Israel. According to CNN, the Iranian response may also include attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria. Proxy militias in this region have been attacking US targets for months. However, after January, when a drone killed three American soldiers in Jordan, the attacks subsided. An Iranian order may revive them. A decision on the relocation of American troops has not been made yet. The potential strike group of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt may be relocated from the Omani Gulf to the Aden or Red Sea.

**Possible Iranian Attack on Israel: A Threat to Global Security**
According to Ivan Us, the main consultant of the National Institute of Strategic Studies, Iran's attack on Israel could happen on a symbolic day for Israel. He notes that the previous attack occurred on April 14. The article also mentions that Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, which coincided with the preparation of an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations in the region. However, this agreement was not reached, and Iran was likely interested in this outcome. The recent killing of Ismail Haniyeh, who was involved in negotiations with Israel, has led many to believe that there will be no further negotiations. Ivan Us suggests that Iran may have been interested in Haniyeh's assassination to blame Israel. He also warns that an escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel could lead to the first nuclear war in the world, with both countries possessing nuclear weapons. The article concludes that the world is very concerned about this possibility. Ivan Us also notes that if there is an escalation of the conflict, Russia will likely support Iran, and countries opposing Iran will automatically become allies of Ukraine. This would be an additional motivation for Ukraine to support them, as Ukraine is already fighting against Russia. The article also mentions that the US has reported that Iran and the Lebanese group 'Hezbollah' are preparing to attack Israel in the next 24-48 hours, possibly with a massive rocket and drone attack.

**Iran Threatens Israel with Assassination and Retaliation**
Iranian MP Mohammad Qasim Osmani has called for the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in response to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Hanija. Osmani said, 'I hope that another Operation True Promise will be carried out as a blood revenge. We are satisfied with nothing less than Netanyahu's death.' The operation in question refers to the Iranian attack on Israel on April 13, 2024, which saw over 300 ballistic missiles fired at two Israeli air force bases. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also threatened Israel with severe retaliation, stating, 'We consider his revenge as our duty.' The tensions between Iran and Israel have escalated significantly in recent days, with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Chief Salami blaming Israel for the current situation in the Middle East, saying, 'Israel has dug its own grave.' Israel is preparing for a potential Iranian attack, with its military, fire department, and medical services on high alert. The attack could be larger than the one in April, with more rockets, targets, and fronts, according to Israeli spokesperson Doron Spielman.

**Iran Update, August 5, 2024**
Iran has released a list of potential civilian and military targets in Israel, which includes Israeli military bases, government sites, and economic infrastructure. The list is likely intended to cause Israel to disperse its air- and missile-defense assets and create panic among civilians. Iran may or may not try to attack any of these targets or others. The US-Israeli coalition intercepted the majority of Iranian drones and missiles outside of Israel during the April 13, 2024 attack on Israel. Iran's decision to explicitly name these targets may seek to increase the likelihood that Iran can hit some of its targets. Israel's security cabinet is discussing preemptive strikes in response to Iranian messaging detailing its planned attack. The Biden Administration reportedly told members of Congress on August 5 that an Iranian strike may occur as soon as August 5 or 6. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken separately told counterparts at the G7 on August 4 that Iran might begin its attack in the next two to three days. Iranian authorities issued a NOTAM for the center, west, and northwest of the country, warning of likely disruption to GPS and navigational signals. Iran and the Axis of Resistance have a shrinking window of opportunity to attack Israel before the United States completes the transfer of additional military assets to the Middle East. The United States is reportedly sending a carrier strike group, naval cruisers and destroyers, and a squadron of fighter jets to the Middle East in preparation for an Iranian-led attack on Israel. The IDF has deployed additional forces near Israeli communities adjacent to Tulkarm after receiving a credible threat that Hamas and other Palestinian militias may conduct an October 7-like infiltration operation into Israel from the West Bank. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian met with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in Tehran on August 4. Pezeshkian stated that Israel made a 'big mistake' by killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. Safadi stated that the killing of Haniyeh was an attempt by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'expand the scope' of regional conflicts. Pezeshkian expressed hope that Jordan and Iran could improve diplomatic relations. US Central Command (CENTCOM) Commander General Michael Kurilla met with Israeli Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on August 5 to finalize US-Israeli defense coordination ahead of Iran's and Iranian-backed groups' attack on Israel. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias likely conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad Airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq on August 5. The rocket attack reportedly injured several US personnel, according to three US officials speaking to Reuters. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian announced three new appointments in his government on August 4. Pezeshkian announced the appointments of the following positions: Senior Adviser: Ali Taib Nia. Taib Nia served as former President Hassan Rouhani's economic affairs and finance minister between 2013 and 2017.

**Israel Prepares for Possible Iranian Strike Amidst Escalating Tensions**
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant has stated that the Israeli Air Force must be prepared for a quick transition to an attack, amidst concerns of an Iranian strike on Israel. According to Axios, the US believes that Iran may attack Israel within a day. Israeli journalist and writer Mark Kotlarsky notes, 'It may happen today, it may happen in a few days. The situation is complicated by Iranian sources, who are more interested in finding out who leaked the information and who betrayed Hani's location, which allowed his assassination. There are several versions. One version is that a rocket came from outside Iran. The second version is that a explosive device was planted in the guest house, which belongs to the Corps of Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, a rather harsh and strict organization, and it exploded remotely when Hani arrived. The third version is that Mossad was involved, and they hired an Iranian opposition group to carry out the assassination. None of these versions have been officially confirmed. Israel has not confirmed its involvement in Hani's assassination. The only thing that is clear is that an attack will be carried out, and the question is how it will be carried out. There are two possible scenarios: a simultaneous attack by Hezbollah, Iran, and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, or a chaotic attack to overload Israel's air defense system. There is also a third scenario, where Iran will only attack military targets, and the conflict will be resolved. Some experts believe that Iran does not want this war as much as Israel does. The US Navy is stationed off the coast of Israel, ready to defend against an attack. British Foreign Secretary and Defense Minister have visited Israel and held talks. They had previously visited Lebanon and Qatar in an attempt to resolve the issue diplomatically. I think Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu may have also visited Iran with a similar mission.'

**Iran's Possible Response to Israel: East Expert Points Out Strangeness**
East expert Tarasov pointed out the strangeness surrounding the possible Iranian response to Israel. 'There are many strange things happening around the possible Iranian response to Israel,' said political scientist and expert on Middle Eastern issues, Stanislav Tarasov, in an interview with 'Lenta.ru'. Iran is an informationally closed country, noted the expert. However, everyone is speculating about its possible response to the elimination of the head of the Palestinian movement Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh. 'The dates are being named: 12-13 August, 5-6 August, Monday, and so on, up to the point of whether it will be before or after the prayer, in the situation where Iran declared that the attack is being prepared carefully, and the revenge will be maintained, but how it will be implemented is a deep secret, so this is an attempt to provoke some retaliatory actions from Iran in this way. Israeli media are writing that the attack may be combined from three directions: from Lebanon, this is 'Hezbollah', the option of the Houthis is also possible, and some residual HAMAS units from Iran may also inflict some damage. There are many various speculations. They are trying to create a PR spectacle from this action, almost written according to a Hollywood script,' said the expert. He emphasized that when the attack is carried out, it is unknown how it will be carried out, but it is likely that it will be carried out, and it is likely that it will not be as expected. Earlier, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken suggested that Iran and 'Hezbollah' may start an attack on Israel on Monday, 5 August. Before that, Israel predicted a multi-day and exhausting attack on the country. Before that, The Jerusalem Post (JP) newspaper stated that Iran intends to attack Israel on 12-13 August, on the sacred day of the Jewish people's catastrophe. The attack will allegedly be carried out jointly with the 'Hezbollah' movement.'

**IDF prepares for ‘infiltration' ground assault on Israel**
Israel has deployed additional troops to its borders with the West Bank and cities to prepare for a possible ground assault by Hamas and Iran. The move comes after a deadly knife attack in Holon, central Israel, and amid warnings of a major attack from Iran, possibly with missiles and drones, as early as Monday. The G7 countries have urged all parties to refrain from retaliatory violence and engage in de-escalation efforts, but Iran has dismissed these attempts, stating it will attack Israel even if it means sparking a war. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said, 'we believe Iran is entitled to punish the aggressor within the framework of international law', and that Iran will 'definitely and decisively take serious and deterrent measures'.

**Israel Prepares for Potential Multi-Day Attack from Iran**
Israel is preparing for a potential multi-day attack from Iran, which may be a response to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. The attack could happen as early as August 5, according to Axios, citing US and Israeli officials. Western intelligence sources, as quoted by Sky News Arabia, believe that Iran may time the attack to coincide with the Ninth of Av, a national day of mourning for the Jewish people on August 12-13. Meanwhile, at least 18 airlines have suspended flights to Israel, and residents in central areas of the country are reporting GPS disruptions, with some GPS systems showing locations in Beirut instead of Tel Aviv. As The Times of Israel notes, 'The situation is becoming increasingly tense, and it's unclear what the consequences will be.' According to The Wall Street Journal, Iran has refused to soften its response, despite attempts by Arab countries to persuade it to do so. East expert Ruslan Suleymanov notes that the outcome will depend on Israel's further strategy: 'This war will be fatal for Iran, so any response will be carefully considered and with minimal damage to Israel. It's not clear whether it will be a direct strike, as we saw in April. Iran has a large arsenal of proxies, including the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon.' Israel cannot ignore the opinions of its Western partners, so any attack on its territory will be carefully considered, Suleymanov believes. 'Israel's response may be much harsher than what we saw in April,' he said. 'The question is, will it be now, because Washington is preoccupied with the upcoming elections, and until November 5, Netanyahu has a certain degree of freedom of action.' US officials have stated that they will involve the forces of allies and partners to collectively defend Israel from a potential Iranian attack.

**Israel Considers Preventive Strike Against Iran Amid Escalating Tensions**
Israel is considering a preventive strike against Iran, according to the Israeli news portal Ynet. The move is being discussed as a potential response to a perceived threat from Iran, which may retaliate against Israel for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh on August 5. 'If there are certain intelligence reports that with 100% certainty say that an attack will be carried out in a certain place, then as part of preparations for countermeasures, the option of a preventive strike is being considered,' Ynet reported. Israel is discussing 'a wide range of options' for responding to and preventing a potential attack, as it is unclear what Iran and its allies in the region may do. The situation is escalating, with recent incidents including the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a rocket attack on northern Israel from Lebanon. 'Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in a strike by Israeli military forces on his home in Tehran on July 31, 2024,' reported Delovoy Peterburg earlier. On Saturday morning, a prominent member of the Hezbollah group, Ali Abd Ali, was killed in a drone strike in the Libyan city of Bazur. The next morning, it was reported that northern Israel had been rocketed by Lebanon. In the night of August 4, around 50 rockets were launched from Lebanon, triggering the 'Iron Dome' defense system and sounding air raid sirens in populated areas. According to media reports, the rockets were fired by Hezbollah.

**Israel Prepares for Potential Iranian Attack, May Launch Preemptive Strike**
Israel is preparing for a potential Iranian attack, but may also launch a preemptive strike, according to Ynet. The decision to launch a preemptive strike would depend on the operational detection of Iranian positions. 'It's a matter of how the attack will be, from where and what type. We need to distinguish between an attack that lasts three to five hours and one that lasts 12 minutes. They have both capabilities', said a source from the Israeli government. The source also noted that Israel will not wait for an attack this time, but will instead destroy rockets before they enter Israeli airspace. The situation on the Middle East has been escalating since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a massive rocket attack on Israel and invaded its territory, taking hostages. Israel has been responding with airstrikes since then. The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran is planning a swift and harsh attack on Israel as revenge for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and that Arab and American diplomats are facing 'Iran's and Hezbollah's angry silence'. The Jerusalem Post reported that Iran plans to attack Israel on August 12-13, during the sacred day of the Ninth of Av, and that the Israeli security services may be caught off guard due to religious rituals. Axios suggested that Iran may strike on Monday, August 5.

**Iran Prepares for 'Inevitable' Attack on Israel**
Iran is reportedly planning to launch a massive attack against Israel in response to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniya. According to Axios, citing US officials, the attack could happen as early as this Monday. Israel is preparing for a prolonged attack, with officials expecting waves of missiles and drones to be launched over several days. 'They will simply try to exhaust us,' said an Israeli official. The attack is expected to be launched simultaneously by Iran, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and possibly other groups. Israel is on high alert, with its defense systems prepared for any scenario, and US forces are being deployed to the region. The US is sending F-22 Raptor fighter jets to the Middle East and is also deploying additional warships and defense systems. The situation is highly uncertain, with various reports suggesting different timelines and scenarios for the attack.

**Iran's Threat to Attack Israel: New Information and US General's Visit**
Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel for the death of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Hamas has accused Israel of assassinating Haniyeh. According to Axios, Iran may attack Israel as early as Monday, August 5, or on August 12 or 13, during the Jewish holiday of Tisha B'Av. Three American and Israeli officials expect an attack to occur on August 5. The plans for the attack are reportedly finalized and accepted at the political level. Meanwhile, US Central Command chief Michael Kurilla has arrived in the Middle East and will visit Israel, countries in the Persian Gulf, and Jordan. Kurilla's visit was planned before the recent escalation of the conflict, but he may use the opportunity to 'mobilize the same international and regional coalition that defended Israel against Iran's attack on April 13.' On that day, Iran launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for Israel's bombing of an Iranian consulate in Damascus.

**Will the expected Iranian attack on Israel be different from the previous one?**
The US is trying to form an alliance to counter the expected Iranian attack on Israel, similar to the previous Iranian attack. On April 13, Iran launched its first direct military attack from within its territory against Israel, launching a swarm of drones and missiles in response to a strike that targeted the Iranian embassy in Damascus, killing an Iranian general and others. The article does not provide further details on the expected Iranian attack, but it implies that it may be similar to the previous one. The US is trying to form an alliance to counter this attack, but no further information is provided on the details of this alliance or its plans.

**US Prepares for Potential Iranian Attack on Israel**
The US is preparing for a potential Iranian attack on Israel, following the assassination of Hamas' political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh. According to Axios, US General Michael Kurilla's visit to the Middle East on August 3, 2024, was planned before the recent escalation, but it is expected that he will use his visit to mobilize the same international and regional coalition that defended Israel in a previous Iranian attack on April 13, 2024. US and Israeli officials expect the Iranian attack on Israel to occur on Monday. The US Department of Defense has reinforced its forces in the Middle East, anticipating a potential Iranian attack against Israel, with more warships and fighter jets. According to a US official, any retaliatory operation from Iran is expected to follow the same pattern as the previous attack on April 13, but with a larger scope. The Hezbollah party in Lebanon is also expected to participate in the potential Iranian attack on Israel. The Biden administration has expressed concern that mobilizing the same international and regional coalition that defended Israel in the previous attack may be more difficult now due to Haniyeh's assassination in the context of Israel's war on Gaza, which has sparked anti-Israel sentiment throughout the region. US General Michael Kurilla is expected to visit several Gulf states, Jordan, and Israel. Jordan will be a key stop on his trip, as it played a crucial role in the previous attack on April 13, 2024, by intercepting Iranian drones and allowing US and Israeli planes to use its airspace to intercept Iranian planes, according to a US official.

**Israel braces for ‘deadly' attack from Iran, Hezbollah: Media**
Israel is preparing for a potential coordinated attack from Iran and Hezbollah following the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israeli officials believe a joint or separate attack is 'inevitable' and are discussing how to respond, including the option of a 'preemptive attack.' Israeli ministries have been instructed to 'prepare for all scenarios,' which could escalate into a war on five fronts with thousands of targets being hit across the country. Israeli officials anticipate that Hezbollah is preparing for a major attack that will not be limited to military targets. 'Israeli officials also discussed the option of Israel moving first and carrying out a 'preemptive attack',' according to Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. 'Israeli officials anticipate that Hezbollah is preparing for a major attack against Israel that will not be limited to military targets,' the newspaper said.

**Iran and Axis of Resistance Plan Coordinated Attack on Israel**
Iran and the Axis of Resistance are planning a coordinated and large-scale attack on Israel in retaliation for the killing of several leaders of the Axis of Resistance, including the president of Hamas's political office, Ismail Haniyeh. According to US and Israeli officials, the attack is expected to occur as early as Monday. Iranian leaders have met with high-ranking officials of the Axis of Resistance, many of whom were already in Tehran for the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian, to coordinate their combined attack. Some Iranian officials and state media have called for targeting Israeli political and military leaders in response to Haniyeh's death. For example, the president of the 'Martyrs and Veterans Affairs Foundation', Amir Hossein Ghazi Zadeh Hashemi, asked on August 1, 'to kill one of Israel's main leaders', a message echoed by IRGC-affiliated media that similarly stated that 'every Israeli political and military official is a potential target'. Iranian state media have also suggested that the next attack led by Iran against Israel will be similar but on a larger scale than the drone and missile attack launched against Israel in April 2024. Iran and the Axis of Resistance are considering how to inflict greater damage on Israel than the April 2024 attack, as that attack did not impose a significant cost on Israel and therefore failed to deter it. According to The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), 'Iranian leaders may increase the volume of projectiles fired against Israel, launching more from Iran, neighboring countries, or both. Hezbollah, the Huthi, and Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria may launch simultaneous attacks to further test Israel's air defenses. Drones and missiles launched from Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria would be much harder to intercept than those from Iran, given the shorter distances and flight times to Israel. US and Israeli forces would have much less time to intercept those projectiles.'

According to Israeli media, officials are preparing for a 'comprehensive and deadly attack scenario' against the country. In an effort to prevent a more extensive and lethal retaliation, Israel is reportedly evaluating all options, including a potential attack on Tel Aviv, amid intense talks with the US. The move comes after the death of Fuad Şükür, the second-in-command of Lebanon's Hizbullah, in an Israeli airstrike, and the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chief Ismail Heniyye in Tehran, which Israel is being blamed for. 'It is a very serious situation,' said a source, 'and we are taking all necessary precautions to ensure the security of our citizens.'

**Israel Prepares for Potential 'Deadly Attack' from Hezbollah and Iran**
Following the death of Fuad Şükür, a high-ranking member of the Lebanese Hezbollah, in an Israeli airstrike and the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Heniyye in Tehran, Israel is preparing for a potential 'deadly attack' from Hezbollah, Iran, and their proxies. Israeli security and political officials have held intense meetings, concluding that a united or separate attack from these groups is 'inevitable', with the timing and scope of the response still unclear. Israel may take a preemptive strike to counter this threat, with officials discussing the possibility of launching a 'preventive attack' before being attacked. The Israeli government has instructed its officials to be prepared for a 5-front war, with thousands of targets to be hit, and has distributed satellite phones to critical state officials in case of a communication breakdown. Israeli security officials believe that Hezbollah is preparing for a large-scale attack, but that the US's involvement in Israel's defense has made the Iranians calculate the size and scope of their attack. The US and Israel have increased their communication, with the US moving a warship to the region and planning to coordinate with regional allies on 13 April, similar to the attack on Iran on that date. The scenario being worked on is that the attack will be larger, more intense, and more deadly than before. An Israeli official stated that if Iran, Hezbollah, and their proxies act in unison, it will be difficult for Israel and the US to counter the attack, and that there will be significant losses, but that Israel can respond more strongly with international support. Israeli officials have warned that the current security warnings may be misleading, and that citizens should be prepared for a potential war at any moment. They also stated that the security warnings issued by Israel after the 13 April attack on Iran may have escalated the situation, and that they will update their warnings as soon as a threat is detected.

**The lull before the storm Israelis**
Israelis are bracing for a potential massive, multi-front offensive from Iran and its proxies after the assassination of Hamas political bureau head Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The operation, which was likely carried out by Israel, has led to a warning from a Hamas official that 'The attack on Israel may begin in the next few hours, and it will be a very strong and painful response.' Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has ordered the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iranian army to initiate a direct confrontation with Israel and prepare defense capabilities in the event of an expansion of the war. Meanwhile, American and European diplomats are urging Iran to limit its assault on Israel to a 'symbolic' display, but Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah has declared that 'We are facing a major battle that has gone beyond the issue of support fronts.' Israelis are preparing for a potential weekend spent in bomb shelters, with some stockpiling food and water in anticipation of a repeat of the April 14 attack.

**Iran and Allies May Attack Israel as Early as Monday, August 5**
Iran and its allies may attack Israel as early as Monday, August 5, as a retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah's military chief, Fuad Shukr, and Hamas' leader, Ismail Haniyeh, last week. This is according to Axios, citing US and Israeli officials. The US Central Command's chief, General Michael Kurilla, arrived in the region yesterday to coordinate the response of allies in defense of Israel in case of an attack. The Pentagon has announced that it will transfer a squadron of fighter jets to the Middle East and maintain a carrier in the region, strengthening military presence to contribute to defending Israel and safeguarding US troops. In response to Israeli attacks on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in Lebanon, Hezbollah launched around 30 rockets from Lebanon towards the Galilee Panhandle last night, with most being intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system. One rocket fell on the community of Beit Hillel and some in open areas, but there were no casualties. Israeli jets struck the rocket launcher used in the attack, which was launched from Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, as well as other Hezbollah infrastructure. A 70-year-old woman was killed and three others were injured in a knife attack in Holon, a city south of Tel Aviv. The police have identified the suspected terrorist as a Palestinian from the West Bank who was killed by an agent. The police are searching the area for other possible suspects involved in the attack. The France has urged its citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible due to the unstable security situation. 'In a highly unstable security context, we remind our citizens, particularly those passing through, that commercial flights with a layover in France are still available and we invite them to organize their departure from Lebanon as soon as possible,' the French Foreign Ministry said.

This comes after Sky News Arabia reported that Iran plans to attack Israel on the day of Tisha b'Av, a Jewish day of mourning and fasting, with the help of the Shia movement Hezbollah. An unnamed Iranian diplomat told The Wall Street Journal that attempts to stop Iran from attacking Israel after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh 'have been and will be futile.' Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike on July 31. Iran has previously declared a 'day of reckoning' for Israel.

Hamas blamed Israel and the US for Haniyeh's death, stating that the attack would not go unanswered. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei reportedly ordered a direct strike on Israel in response to Haniyeh's killing, while Iran's UN envoy Amir Said Irvani stated that Tehran reserves the right to self-defense under international law, and would respond to Haniyeh's killing 'when necessary.'

**Israel and US Prepare for Potential Iran Attack**
Israel and the United States are preparing for an attack from Iran, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal published on August 2, 2024. A retaliation against Israel is expected after the death of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, at the hands of Iranian agents. The Iranian leader, Ali Khamenei, and the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, have promised severe retaliation against Israel. According to the report, Tehran and its allies plan to launch a 'heavy and rapid' offensive against Israeli territory. The possible new attack by Iran aims to be more effective than the one carried out in April, which saw Iran launch missiles and drones at Israeli territory in response to an operation that targeted the Iranian embassy in Damascus and resulted in the death of Iranian military commanders. 'Difficult days' are ahead, as airlines have begun to cancel flights to Israel in anticipation of possible attacks.

**Iran Threatens Retaliation Against Israel, Airlines Cancel Flights**
Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. A leading Iranian TV host announced on Friday, August 2, that the world will witness significant and extraordinary events in the coming hours. The host said, 'In a few hours, the whole world will see interesting and extraordinary events.' The announcement has been interpreted by many as a warning of an impending attack on Israel. In response, several international airlines have suspended flights to the region, including KLM, which has canceled flights to Tel Aviv until October due to 'security concerns.' Many airlines, including American and European ones, have also been avoiding flights over Iran. Israel is reportedly preparing for an attack, with instructions on what to do in case of an attack being distributed to citizens. The Jerusalem municipality has also distributed a file with a list of parking lots to be used as shelters and a list of bomb shelters. The file advises citizens to have access to bomb shelters within 90 seconds, as well as to stock up on water and food for three days and purchase batteries and flashlights in addition to medication. US and Israeli intelligence had previously warned that an Iranian attack on Israel could begin as early as August 2 or 3, 2024. Iran has raised the red flag of revenge and announced strikes against Israel in response to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was in Tehran at the time.

**Iran Is Expected to Attack Israel In Matter of Days**
The Biden Administration is preparing for a potential Iranian attack on Israel in the coming days, following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. According to U.S. officials, Iran has vowed retaliation and is expected to launch a wide-ranging missile attack on Israel, which could be more extensive and deadly than the April 13 attack. The U.S. is mobilizing its military assets in the Gulf, Eastern Mediterranean, and Red Sea to defend Israel, and additional troops may be deployed to the region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated, 'We are prepared for what may come. Israel is in a state of very high readiness for any scenario — on both defense and offense. We will exact a very high price for any act of aggression against us from any quarter whatsoever.' U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will direct 'multiple force posture moves' in the Middle East ahead of a potential attack. 'We are not talking about separate fronts anymore. This is an open campaign on all fronts, and there is no doubt [the war] has entered a new phase,' Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said.

**US to Help Israel Defend Against Potential Iranian Attack**
The US will help Israel defend against an Iranian attack, with American military officials believing that the strike will occur in the coming days, according to CNN. This is in response to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who was assassinated in a hotel in Tehran on July 31. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has promised 'severe punishment'. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death, but confirmed the killing of two other militants. According to the Israeli military, in mid-July, a strike on Gaza killed the head of Hamas' military wing, Muhammad Deif, and recently in Beirut, one of Hezbollah's commanders, Fuad Shukr, was killed. After this, the leader of the movement, Hassan Nasrallah, said that Israel should 'shed tears' and promised to attack previously untargeted areas of the country. American media reports that the forces of the Lebanese Hezbollah will be involved in the Iranian response, and the attack will surpass previous attacks in terms of force. Details can be found in a review of foreign press on 'Ъ FM'. Initially, it was thought that the Israeli rocket had bypassed Iran's air defense, but according to new data from The New York Times, Ismail Haniyeh was killed using a bomb: it was carried into the hotel two months before Haniyeh's arrival. For Iran, this is a catastrophic failure - the prestigious area in northern Tehran is guarded by the Corps of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, and the network of complexes is used for secret negotiations and the placement of honored guests, such as Haniyeh. According to local sources, the attack is compared to the killing of nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020, which used artificial intelligence-based weapons. Israel has not publicly acknowledged the killing of Haniyeh, but immediately reported the details of the operation to the United States. The Times of Israel notes that the Israeli military is ready for any scenario, both in the air, on the sea, and on land. However, the defense is 'not hermetic', as noted by the Israeli military. As a precautionary measure, the transportation of hazardous materials has been restricted to several factories in the north, and a factory producing ice cream in Acre has ceased operations: the ammonia gas used there can be hazardous in the event of an attack. Israel intends to prevent Iran from repeating the scenario of April 13-14, when in response to a strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, hundreds of drones and rockets were launched at Israel. According to CNN, the Iranian response may also include attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria. Proxy militias in this region have been attacking US targets for months. However, after January, when a drone killed three American soldiers in Jordan, the attacks subsided. An Iranian order may revive them. A decision on the relocation of American troops has not been made yet. The potential strike group of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt may be relocated from the Omani Gulf to the Aden or Red Sea.

The US is preparing for a potential Iranian attack on Israel in the near future, according to an American official. The Pentagon and US Central Command are conducting a similar preparation to the one before the April attack, which includes the involvement of US troops in the Persian Gulf, Eastern Mediterranean, and Red Sea. 'We expect several difficult days,' the official said. The preparation comes after the July 31 killing of Ismail Haniyeh, a leader of the Palestinian group Hamas, in Tehran. Following the incident, Iran raised the red flag of revenge. On July 29, Israel launched an airstrike on the Lebanese capital Beirut, targeting and killing the 'supreme military commander' of Hezbollah, Fuad Shukr.

**Pentagon: Iran and Allies to Launch Large-Scale Attack on Israel within 72 Hours**
According to the US Department of Defense (Pentagon), Iran and its allies are expected to launch a large-scale attack on Israel within the next 72 hours. US officials say the upcoming Iranian attack will be similar to the one on April 13, but on a larger scale, and is likely to include the involvement of Hezbollah, which did not participate in the previous attack. US officials are concerned that the current context, which involves the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran, rather than an Iranian general in Damascus, may make it harder to assemble the same international and regional coalition that stopped the previous Iranian attack. US intelligence agencies began receiving clear indications on Wednesday that Iran would retaliate, according to a US official. Iran had held an emergency meeting of its Supreme National Security Council after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, accusing Israel of the assassination and threatening to retaliate, and this came at the same time as the assassination of a Hezbollah leader, Foad Shaker, in an Israeli strike just hours before Haniyeh's assassination.

**Iran and Allies Plan Comprehensive Attack on Israel within 72 Hours**
According to US Defense Department sources, Iran and its allies are planning to launch a comprehensive attack on Israel within the next 72 hours. The attack is expected to be similar to the one that occurred on April 13, but on a larger scale. It is also believed that Hezbollah will be involved in the attack, unlike in the previous one. The Biden administration is facing significant challenges in gathering a similar international and regional coalition to stop the Iranian attack, due to the different context of the current situation, which involves the assassination of Hamas leader in Tehran instead of targeting an Iranian general in Damascus. US intelligence agencies have been receiving clear indications that Iran will respond to the recent events, according to a US official. Iranian officials and their allies may need several days to organize and prepare the attack on Israel, and the Pentagon and the US Central Command are taking the same precautionary measures as they did before the Iranian attack in April. After the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran held an emergency meeting of its Supreme National Security Council, blaming Israel for the assassination and threatening to respond harshly. This came at the same time as the assassination of Foad Shaker, a Hezbollah leader, in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that the Israeli army has raised its alert level after the attack on the southern suburb, and Israeli sources have instructed emergency and rescue teams in northern Israel to remain on high alert, while also warning nearby settlements to be cautious and follow instructions from the Home Front Command.

According to US Defense Department sources, cited by CNN, Iran and its allies are expected to launch a large-scale attack on Israel within the next 72 hours.

Two senior Pentagon officials said it may take Iran and its allies several days to coordinate and prepare for an attack on Israel, adding that the Pentagon and the US Central Command are taking similar preparations as those taken before the Iranian attack in April. Iran's Supreme National Security Council held an emergency meeting after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, accusing Israel of the assassination and vowing to retaliate, coinciding with the assassination of Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr by an Israeli strike just hours before Haniyeh's assassination.

**Assassination of Hamas Leader Haniyeh: A 'Humiliating Blow' to Iran**
The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, has been described as a 'humiliating blow' to Iran. According to experts, the attack was a clear message from Israel that it can strike within Iran's borders. Andrew Fox, a researcher at the Henry Jackson Society, said that Haniyeh's killing 'sends a very clear message to Iran about Israel's ability to strike within their borders.' Fox noted that Haniyeh had limited strategic significance as a target and could have been easily replaced, but his death still had symbolic significance. This is not the first time Israel has carried out operations within Iran's borders. In August 2020, Israeli agents assassinated Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, a high-ranking member of Al-Qaeda, in the streets of Tehran. In November 2020, a Mossad team killed Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an Iranian nuclear physicist who was believed to be leading Iran's nuclear program. Ameneh Mehvar, a regional expert on the Middle East at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), said that the latest attack has 'badly damaged' Iran's reputation in the region. She added that it shows how deeply Israel has infiltrated Iran's intelligence circles. Farzan Sabet, a senior researcher at the Global Governance Centre and Sanctions and Sustainable Peace Hub in Geneva, predicted that Iran's credibility among its allies will be damaged and that it may be forced to retaliate to save face. Burcu Ozcelik, a senior security expert on the Middle East at the Royal United Services Institute, said that the attack on Haniyeh marks a new phase of risky games in the region. She added that it will have an impact on the entire region. Mehvar predicted that Iran will retaliate, but in a 'more severe' but 'proportional' manner, possibly with the help of its allies. Fox expects a 'small-scale' escalation of rocket attacks from Iranian agents in Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon, followed by a return to the previous unstable status quo. He added that Iran will not want to escalate to the point where the West intervenes, as it did during the April rocket attacks, which were also a 'humiliating defeat' for Iran.

**Iran's Options for Retaliation After Assassination of Hamas Leader**
Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi has only 10 hours to respond to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, which he was hosting. According to 'The New York Times', Raisi will be immersed in critical meetings with the country's security officials, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and top generals to decide on a response. The paper says that Iran's options for retaliation are 'high-stakes' and could lead to war between two of the strongest armies in the Middle East. The paper mentions that Iran could opt for direct missile strikes, like the ones in April, or allow Hezbollah to launch more attacks on northern Israel, or for the Houthis to expand their attacks in the Red Sea. However, the most dangerous option, according to the paper, is for Iran to take the final step towards building a real nuclear bomb, after having stopped short of it several times before. 'The New York Times' notes that Iran was engaged in indirect talks with the Biden administration in 2021 and 2022, and it seemed that they were close to reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, but those efforts failed. The paper quotes Ali Akbar Velayati, a prominent politician and leader of Ebrahim Raisi's campaign, saying that 'this attack is a blow to the Iranian government's prestige, a reminder of the depth of Israeli penetration into Iran's security agencies, and 'incentives for revenge are clear'. The paper also quotes a senior US official saying that the Israelis could have killed Haniyeh anywhere in the Middle East, but they chose to do it in Iran during the inauguration ceremony, to remind the new Iranian leaders that they are also within their reach.

**Iran Vows to Avenge Hamas Leader's Death, Israel Prepares for Retaliatory Attacks**
Iran has vowed to avenge the death of Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh. Iran's supreme leader, ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that 'Iran has a duty to avenge the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh' and that Israel 'deserves a harsh punishment'. As a result, Israel is preparing for retaliatory attacks, which it fears may come from all directions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israelis that 'challenging days are ahead of us', as the fear of a broader conflict in the Middle East grows. According to Israeli media, the potential targets of a retaliatory attack could be the cities of Haifa and Tel Aviv. Netanyahu stated that Israel is prepared for 'all scenarios' and will stand firm against any threat. He also said that 'Israel will demand a high price for any attack against us, regardless of the side'. The UN Security Council members are concerned that the assassination could lead to an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran just 24 hours after a high-ranking Hizbollah leader died in an attack that Israel has confirmed it was behind. Israel has not yet taken responsibility for the assassination, despite Iran and Hizbollah accusing them of being behind it. Historically, Israel does not take responsibility for attacks it carries out against Iran. According to Allan Sørensen, a Middle East correspondent for Kristeligt Dagblad, this is because Israel wants to give Iran the opportunity not to retaliate against the potential attacks, and the same applies in this case with Ismail Haniyeh. 'Israel is trying to protect itself in this way, but it seems not to be working this time. Iran is now threatening to attack Israel, and Israel is also convinced that Iran will carry out an attack.'

**Israel's Hidden War with Iran: A List of Mysterious Killings**
Israel has added the name of Ismail Haniyeh to its list of mysterious killings within Iranian territory, in a hidden war with Iran. This includes the killing of a major nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, on November 27, 2020, in a trap on the road using a self-loading rifle that shot him from a satellite. Fakhrizadeh was a Revolutionary Guard officer and a physics professor at 'Imam Hussein University' in Tehran, and was a main target for Israeli intelligence for years. Iran blamed Israel for his killing, but Israel considered Iran's accusations as claims and has not admitted to being behind his killing. This was not the first nuclear scientist related to Iran's nuclear program to be targeted by a fatal attack, according to a report published by the American 'Washington Post' newspaper, which stated that before him, officials were targeted by two car bombs in 2020 in Tehran, 20 minutes apart, resulting in one death and one injury. Two years later, a major commander in the Revolutionary Guard, Hassan Sayyed Khadahi, was killed. Three days later, Iranian engineer Jad Beigi died in a 'factory accident' at the Parsian military base, according to Iranian officials, who told the American 'New York Times' newspaper that Israeli drones attacked the facility where they develop missiles, nuclear technology, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Later, Ali Ismailzadeh died after falling from the roof of his house in Karaj. According to the opposition news site 'Iran International', which is based in London, senior officials of the Revolutionary Guard told his family that he had left a suicide note. It is alleged that Zadeh, the commander of Unit 840, affiliated with the Quds Force, was killed by the Revolutionary Guard, as they suspect he had leaked information that led to Khadahi's killing. In May 2022, two Iranian scientists died under mysterious circumstances in two cities hundreds of kilometers apart, one of whom was space scientist Ayoub Antezari, who directed major security projects at the AIO Research Institute in Yazd, and the other was Kamran Malabari, a nuclear scientist who worked at the Natanz nuclear facility. Iran accused Israel of killing the two scientists. Another major operation took place inside Iran, targeting Abdullah Ahmad Abdullah, also known as Abu Muhammad al-Masri, who was the second-in-command of al-Qaeda when he participated in the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A $10 million bounty was placed on his head, according to reports, which stated that Israeli agents killed him on August 7, 2020, in Tehran, on the request of the United States, and killed his daughter Maryam, the widow of Hamza bin Laden.

**Pentagon: Iran to Launch Attack on Israel Within 72 Hours**
The Pentagon has announced that Iran intends to launch an attack on Israel within the next 72 hours. This comes after the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniya, who was killed in a rocket strike in Tehran. Iran has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, which has been supported by China, Algeria, and Russia. Iran's supreme leader has stated that a direct attack on Israel will be carried out, as they hold Israel responsible for Haniya's death. The Pentagon has warned that a 72-hour deadline is in effect, during which Iran and its allies are expected to launch a full-scale attack on Israel. The US and EU have held emergency talks to prevent a war in the region. Iran has accused the US of being complicit in Haniya's death, which is seen as a violation of the UN Charter and international law. 'Now, a 72-hour deadline is in effect, during which we expect Iran and its proxies to launch a full-scale attack on Israel,' said the Pentagon. 'The US and EU have held emergency talks to prevent a war in the region over the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniya,' wrote the Financial Times, citing sources. 'Iran has informed countries in the Middle East of the seriousness of its intentions to attack Israel over the killing of Ismail Haniya,' the newspaper added.

**Iran Orders Direct Attack on Israel Following Assassination of Hamas Leader**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered a direct attack on Israel on July 31. According to The New York Times, this move is a retaliation for an Israeli bombing in Tehran that resulted in the death of Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the terrorist group Hamas, during the early hours of July 31. Hamas, an Iranian ally, has been at war with Israel in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. Israel has not yet claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's assassination. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that his country would demand a high price for any aggression against it. Netanyahu said, 'Israel will demand a high price for any aggression against it.' Khamenei has promised severe punishment for Israel. The new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, criticized the action, stating that Iran would defend its territorial integrity and that Israel would regret the cowardly assassination. The Israeli government spokesperson stated that they would not comment on Haniyeh's death, but confirmed that the country is on high alert for possible Iranian retaliation. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that Israel does not want war, but is prepared for all possibilities. Iran will hold a funeral for Haniyeh on August 1, and his body will be buried in Doha, Qatar, on August 2, where he resided. In response to Iranian threats, Gallant reaffirmed that Israel is prepared and will demand a high price for any attack.

**Iran shocked by Hamas leader's killing in targeted attack**
The Iranian leadership was shocked when Hamas leader Ismail Haniya was killed in a targeted attack in Tehran, just hours after the last photos of him were taken. The attack required meticulous planning and access to high-quality intelligence. Despite the likely thorough evaluation of the threat and the rigorous security measures in place, Haniya and his bodyguard were unable to be protected. Iran's vice president said that his country does not intend to escalate the conflict in the Middle East, but this statement can be interpreted in different ways. The uncertainty is total about what will happen if diplomacy is not given a chance and all statements about reprisals are put into action with drones, rockets, and other weapons. Israel is surrounded by groups that pose an existential threat to the Israeli state. The war continues with full force against Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, with over 40,000 people killed according to the Palestinian authorities and a worsening humanitarian crisis. The war is also escalating in the north along the border with and in southern Lebanon. After the attack on children and young people in the occupied Golan Heights, Israel struck a high Hizbollah leader in a suburb of Beirut. This happened a day before Hamas leader Haniya was killed in Tehran. Both Hamas in Gaza and Hizbollah in Lebanon are supported, trained, and equipped by Iran. Hizbollah and Iran are also active in Syria, where attacks are carried out on Israel with Israeli counter-attacks on Syria. A third militant group with ties to Iran is the Houthi in Yemen, from where ships are attacked in the Red Sea and recently also Tel Aviv with drones. This had deadly consequences and shows that modern remote warfare can be carried out over large areas and does not know any borders. Iran feels humiliated by the attack on a guest and ally in the middle of Tehran and is expected to respond. This makes it more dangerous and changes the fundamental conditions of warfare and security. Iran feels humiliated by the attack on a guest and ally in the middle of Tehran and is expected to respond. The same applies to Hizbollah and Houtuierna in Yemen, as well as Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria. And Israel's right-wing government will undoubtedly act in this eternal spiral of violence in a region with deep-seated contradictions and chronic conflicts. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had no prior knowledge of the attack on Haniya, he said on Wednesday. He did not want to speculate about the consequences, but emphasized the importance of continuing to push for a ceasefire to free hostages and, he said, alleviate the terrible suffering of children, women, and men in Gaza 'trapped in Hamas crossfire'. Without the US, split politically ahead of the presidential election in November, and with a weakened Joe Biden in the White House, there will be no ceasefire. But the question is how it can be achieved now.

**Israel's Enemies: A String of Direct Attacks and Mysterious Deaths**
Israel has been targeting its enemies for decades, with a recent string of direct attacks or mysterious deaths including the killing of Ismail Hanija, the political leader of the Islamist Hamas, and Fuad Schukr, a Hezbollah commander. The Israeli leadership has been sending a message to its enemies, saying 'We can hit you anytime, anywhere.' This has been the case for many years, as described by Scott Lucas, Professor for international politics at the Clinton Institute of the University of Dublin. The consequences for Israel's enemies have been deadly, with neither the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut nor the isolated dictatorship of the Islamic Republic of Iran feeling safe. Here are some of the most spectacular cases of the past two decades: On April 10, 2024, three sons and three grandchildren of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyyeh were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Al-Shati refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip. On December 25, 2023, Sejed-Rasi Mussawi, a high-ranking general of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a suburb of Damascus. Mussawi was one of the 'most experienced advisors' of the Al-Kuds Brigades, the foreign operations unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. On January 2, 2024, Saleh al-Arouri died in an explosion in Beirut, allegedly caused by an Israeli drone. Al-Arouri was a strategic leader of Hamas and was involved in planning the deadly Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7. 'Father of the Iranian nuclear program' Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed on November 27, 2020, in a shooting on a road in Absard, a small town 50 kilometers east of Tehran. The Iran makes Israel and the US responsible for the 'martyrdom' of the 59-year-old scientist. Oberst Sayad Khodayee, an officer of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed on May 22, 2022, by shots from a motorcyclist directly in front of his house. The Islamic Republic made the 'global arrogance' responsible for the murder - a frequently used term when the US or Israel is accused. Israel's officials informed that the 50-year-old Khodayee was responsible for covert operations around the world, including murders and kidnappings. Ayoub Entezari, an aerospace scientist in an Iranian military research institute, died in May 2022 from food poisoning. Iranian representatives made Israel responsible for this as well, because at the same time the geologist Kamran Aghamolaei, who worked in the Iranian nuclear facility Natanz, died. The founder of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was killed in 2004 by Israeli helicopters when he left a mosque in the northern Gaza Strip. His successor Abd al-Aziz ar-Rantisi was killed in a helicopter attack in Gaza City on April 17, 2004. 'We can hit you anytime, anywhere' - this is the message of the Israeli leadership to its enemies, as described by Scott Lucas, Professor for international politics at the Clinton Institute of the University of Dublin. The consequences for Israel's enemies have been deadly, with neither the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut nor the isolated dictatorship of the Islamic Republic of Iran feeling safe.

**Israel Warns of Imminent War with Hezbollah After Deadly Rocket Attack**
Israel's Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz stated on Saturday that Israel is approaching an open war with Hezbollah and Lebanon after a rocket attack by the Lebanese Hezbollah on a stadium in the Golan Heights, resulting in at least 11 deaths. Katz said, 'The attack by Hezbollah is a crossing of all red lines, and Israel's response will be adequate.' The Israeli government described the rocket attack, which killed all victims, including children and young people aged 10-20, as 'the most deadly attack on civilian population since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.' The Israeli army is conducting an investigation into the attack. Israeli President Isaac Herzog announced that the state of Israel 'will decisively defend its citizens.' He added, 'Hezbollah, armed and financed by Iran, does not distinguish between children and adults, soldiers and civilians, Jews and Muslims, Druze and Christians.' The Lebanese government condemned the attack and called on the conflicting parties to cease fire. The rocket attack was a retaliation by Hezbollah for the killing of four of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.

**Iran's Growing Global Terror Threat: Houthi Deadly Drone Strike on Tel Aviv**
Iran-backed Houthis carried out a deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv, killing at least one person and injuring several others. The attack was claimed by the Houthis, who said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war. The Israeli military has confirmed that Iran is directly involved in the attack and is funding, arming, and directing its proxies in their attacks on Israel. The attack highlights the growing global terrorist threat posed by the Shia-Islamic regime of Iran, which is also supplying long-range drones to Mexican drug cartels and the rogue Marxist regime of Venezuela.

**Houthis Launch Deadly Attack on Israel, Targeting Tel Aviv**
The Houthis, backed by Iran, launched their first deadly attack on Israel since November 2023, targeting Tel Aviv and killing one person and injuring four others. The attack was carried out by a drone, which the Israeli army believes was made in Iran. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was a response to Israel's aggression against the Palestinians. The attack was part of a series of Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean, which have targeted ships linked to Israel, as well as American and British vessels. The Houthis have also claimed to have attacked Israeli ports and naval vessels in the Mediterranean. The Israeli army has accused the Houthis of being responsible for the attacks, which have caused significant damage and disruption to global trade. The Houthis have also been accused of being responsible for the detention of several ships, including the 'Galaxy Leader', which was seized in November 2023 and taken to the port of Al-Salif in Yemen.

**The US Embassy in Beirut Attacked: A Reminder of the Region's Complexities**
The US Embassy in Beirut was attacked by gunfire, which is not the first or last incident. The embassy has been targeted before, in September 2023. The timing of the incident is consistent with the events in the region, and it is a reminder to the Americans of their interests in Lebanon amidst Israeli threats and warnings to expand the war on Lebanon. The incident is also seen as a rejection of US President Joe Biden's initiative to end the Gaza war and its consequences, including a ceasefire, the release of prisoners, and the return of Palestinian authority to Gaza. The initiative was preceded by the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and the country's foreign minister in a helicopter crash in northern Iran. The Iranian foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, visited Beirut to reaffirm Iran's constants and continued support for the resistance, which is seen as a stabilizing factor in the region. The initiative is a significant step in the ongoing war, and it will face many obstacles from opponents like Iran and allies like Israel. The situation in Israel is more complex, with internal factors playing a decisive role, including the government, the military, and the opposition. The Palestinian side is also affected, with the absence of the Palestinian Authority from the event, and the lack of a unified stance on the conflict. The initiative will progress slowly and face many obstacles, and its success will depend on the exhaustion of alternatives, including the continuation of the war in Gaza or its expansion to Lebanon.
