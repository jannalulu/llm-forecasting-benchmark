**Gas prices are plummeting. Experts explain why.**
Gas prices have plummeted about 13% from a 2024 peak in April, with the national average price of a gallon of gas standing at $3.20, according to AAA data. Experts forecast that the national average price will likely drop below $3 per gallon for the first time since May 2021. The drop in prices is due to sluggish demand for gas and a sharp decline in the price of crude oil. Patrick de Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said, 'Gas prices continue to crumble across the entire nation. The outlook is bright.' The decline in prices is expected to continue, with nearly every state east of the Rockies now having some retail outlets selling gas below $3 a gallon. However, experts warn that possible disruptions such as hurricane season or an economic surge could undo the anticipated price relief. By the early part of next year, demand for gasoline is expected to swell, turning seasonal fluctuations against consumers.

**Gas prices: New lows at the pumps to start the work week**
Gas prices in the US have continued to fall, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas dropping to $3.208, according to AAA. This is the lowest national average since January, and 17 states now have an average price under $3 per gallon. Despite recent decreases, gas prices have fluctuated throughout the year and vary significantly among states. Gas prices remain a vital topic heading into the 2024 presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, needing to address the issue and its impact on the economy and people's finances. In the Delmarva region, Delaware has the cheapest gas prices, with an average cost of $2.987 per gallon, while Washington, D.C. has the highest prices, at $3.426 per gallon.

**Gas Prices Continue to Drop Ahead of Fall**
The national average price for a gallon of gas has dropped to $3.24, down six cents from last week. The decrease is attributed to low demand and falling oil costs. According to Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson, 'There are an ever-increasing number of states east of the Rockies that have some retail gas locations selling regular for under $3 a gallon, so drivers will have more in their wallets with autumn approaching.' This trend is positive for fall travelers, and if the national average falls below $3, it will be the first time since May 2021.

**Map shows states with gasoline average under $3 per gallon**
As of Tuesday, the average national gas price was $2.36 per gallon, with 11 states having averages below $3 per gallon, according to AAA. The national average has fallen from $3.33 a week ago and $3.83 on September 10, 2023. AAA credits 'plunging crude oil prices' and 'low U.S. demand for gas' for the decline. Mark Jenkins, a spokesman for AAA Auto Club Group, said that 'about 23 percent of Florida retailers have prices below $3 a gallon,' and that number is likely to grow. Marie Dodds, the government and public affairs director for AAA in Oregon and Idaho, noted that 'gas prices typically fall after Labor Day' and 'should continue to fall in the coming weeks.' The most expensive price-per-gallon averages continue to be seen on the West Coast, with California having the highest state average at $4.73.

**The average gas price is below $3 a gallon in 18 states**
The average gas price has fallen below $3 a gallon in 18 states, with the national average price of regular gasoline at $3.20 a gallon, a 23-cent decrease from a month ago and a 67-cent decrease from a year ago. According to Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, the decline in gas prices is due to the removal of more expensive summer gasoline from the market and ample supply and reduced demand. Andrew Gross, AAA's spokesperson, noted that an increasing number of states east of the Rockies have gas prices under $3 a gallon, which will benefit drivers as autumn approaches. However, economists warn that the drop in oil prices may signal trouble in the economy, as it has often coincided with a slowing economy in the past.

**Gas Prices See 'Torrid Pace of Decline' - Kelley Blue Book**
The average price of a gallon of gas nationwide is $3.23, with 15 states having an average price under $3. According to AAA, gas prices have continued their 'torrid pace of decline', sinking six cents since last week. If the pace of decline continues, U.S. motorists may see gasoline prices fall below $3 a gallon for the first time in over three years as soon as next month. Decreasing demand and the switch to less-expensive winter blends of gasoline are contributing to the price drop. However, a busier-than-average Atlantic hurricane season in 2024 poses a threat to low prices. So far, the prediction hasn't been borne out, but the National Hurricane Center is currently tracking two possible threats. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said, 'Americans just don't drive as much in fall.' Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, noted that oil prices are already at their lowest level in about three years and that OPEC+ recently voted to increase oil production anyway.

**Get ready for gasoline at $2.50 a gallon (or less!)**
Gasoline prices are expected to fall below $3 a gallon in the US, with some states potentially seeing prices as low as $2.50. The national average retail price of gasoline is currently at $3.248 a gallon, according to GasBuddy.com, and $3.26, according to the American Automobile Association's daily Gas Prices report. The price has been above $3 for 1,217 straight days. Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service, predicts that prices will fall 'a penny a day over the next 30 days,' and could hit $2.50 by Election Day, November 5. However, several factors could derail this trend, including weather, geopolitics, and OPEC's influence on oil prices. Despite this, the trend for gasoline is expected to be lower, with average prices nationally likely to fall under $3.

**Falling gas prices are yet another blow to the Trump campaign**
Former President Donald Trump has been using high gas prices to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming they had 'soared' to $8 a gallon. However, fact-checkers have dismissed this as false. While Trump is not entirely wrong, as gas prices did hit a high of $4.93 a gallon in mid-2022, they have been declining steadily for the last five months. According to the American Automobile Association, the national average price for a gallon of gas was $3.30, a 6-cent decline from the previous week. Andrew Gross, a spokesperson for AAA, said 'There are now 10 states with gasoline averages below $3 a gallon, which means thousands of retail outlets east of the Rockies are selling gas at similarly low prices.' This trend is likely to continue, with low gas demand and a current cost of oil at about $70 per barrel.

**Gas prices could drop to $3 by year-end, analyst says**
Gasoline prices have been declining due to falling oil prices and lower demand. The national average price on Wednesday was $3.32 per gallon, $0.15 lower than a month ago and $0.49 less than last year. Analyst Andy Lipow predicts that the national average could drop to $3 per gallon by the end of the year, citing the end of the summer driving season and a quiet hurricane season. Lipow also notes that oil prices may force OPEC+ to rethink its production policy, potentially sticking with existing levels. As of Wednesday, nine states had average retail prices below $3 per gallon, with half the country expected to reach those levels by the end of September.

**Pace of Gas Price Decline Slows as Labor Day Weekend Arrives**
Gas prices are still falling, but at a slower pace than recently, with the national average dipping just two cents to $3.36 since last week. A slight uptick in gas demand may be due to summer travelers, while a storm system forming in the Atlantic may pose a threat to falling gas prices. AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said, 'Since today, 8/29, is my birthday, my wish is that this potential tropical storm fizzles quickly, and the arrival of September means cheaper winter-blend gasoline is almost here, which always helps take pressure off pump prices.' The national average for L2 commercial electricity did not budge at 34 cents per kilowatt hour. Gas demand rose last week from 9.19 million b/d to 9.30, while total domestic gasoline stocks fell from 220.2 to 218.4 million barrels. Unspectacular gasoline demand and falling oil costs may cause pump prices to slide further.
