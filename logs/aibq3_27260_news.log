**Ohio-based Big Lots names nearly 150 stores closing amid bankruptcy risk**
Big Lots, a discount retail chain headquartered in Ohio, has identified nearly 150 stores that are closing this year amid speculation the company will file for bankruptcy. The closings come as Big Lots' sales dropped 10.2% between the first quarters of 2023 and 2024, resulting in a loss of about $114 million. The company wrote, 'In 2024, the U.S. economy has continued to face macroeconomic challenges including elevated inflation, which has adversely impacted the buying power of our customers.' The retailer has more than 100 locations in Ohio, none of which are marked online as closing. Big Lots' total debt has increased to $573.8 million, leading to substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue. If Big Lots files for bankruptcy, it will join a list of other stores and restaurants that have done so since the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Struggling retail chain faces default, Ch. 11 bankruptcy risk**
Big Lots, a discount retailer using the treasure-hunt model, is struggling and faces the risk of default and Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

However, the company's liquidity projections indicate a significant likelihood of default within the next 12 months, raising concerns about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**ðŸ’¥Is Big Lots in BIG Trouble? Part V.ðŸ’¥**
Big Lots, Inc. ($BIG) is facing significant challenges, including a 12th consecutive quarter of comparable sales declines and a stock price that reflects its poor performance. The company is planning to close more stores, with a new cap of 315 permitted store closures, up from 150 previously. This could represent up to 23% of the current store count. Additionally, the company has entered into a $200mm commitment term loan with Gordon Brothers Capital, a firm known for liquidating struggling retailers. Meanwhile, Fisker Inc. has filed for bankruptcy, with the debtors seeking to shed or renegotiate unfavorable leases, institute operational efficiencies, and complete a value-maximizing sale. The debtors plan to use a $36.3mm DIP provided by Main Street, which includes $12.1mm of new money and a $24.2mm roll-up. The facility bears an interest rate of 15%. In a separate development, BUCA Texas Restaurants LP and nine affiliates have filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Northern District of Texas. The debtors owe Main Street $38.9mm and plan to use the bankruptcy cases to shed or renegotiate unfavorable leases, institute operational efficiencies, and complete a value-maximizing sale. The debtors seek to fund the cases with a $36.3mm DIP provided by Main Street. The first-day hearing for the BUCA bankruptcy case was held on August 7, 2024, and parties shared their favorite Buca memories. However, Planet Hollywood, the parent company of BUCA, raised concerns about the debtors' compliance with liquor licenses and other issues, leading to a potential adversarial posture in the case.

**Big Lots Set to Close Up to 315 Stores**

The company has incurred net losses in 2022, 2023, and the first quarter of 2024, and expects to experience further operating losses.

**Big Lots is closing most of its South Florida stores. Here's where they are.**
Big Lots, a discount retailer, plans to close up to 315 of its 1,389 stores in the US, including 26 stores in Florida. The closures are due to lagging sales and increasing debt. The company has already begun liquidation sales, with discounts ranging from 5% to 20% on various items. According to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, Big Lots' troubles stem from its inability to compete with stores like Walmart and Target, which offer similar products at lower prices. The company's recent focus on furniture has also been cited as a contributing factor. Big Lots' losses have been significant, with a $205 million loss in the first quarter of 2024 and a $482 million loss in fiscal year 2023. The company is carrying $578 million in long-term debt. 'Closing' signs have been posted at the affected stores, and a banner at the Coconut Creek store read, 'Closing.' The company's troubles follow a notable list of large-chain bankruptcies since 2023, including Bed Bath & Beyond and Red Lobster.

Big Lots, a discount retailer with 102 locations in Ohio, is planning to close between 35 and 40 stores this year due to 'elevated inflation' and decreased consumer spending.

**Big Lots is closing stores in 2024, joins growing list of retailers at risk of bankruptcy**
Big Lots, a discount retail chain, is planning to close at least 35 stores in 2024 due to declining sales and potential bankruptcy concerns. The company reported a loss of $205 million in the first quarter of this year and expects sales to continue dropping. The planned closures come as the retailer's total store count has decreased from 1,427 to 1,392 locations. Big Lots' CEO, Bruce Thorn, attributed the decline in sales to a pullback in consumer spending, particularly in high-ticket discretionary items. The company's debt has also increased by $72.2 million, bringing its total debt to $573.8 million. The locations of the closing stores have not been disclosed.

**Big Lots warns its survival is in doubt, plans to close up to 40 stores**
Big Lots, a discount chain, has warned investors that it may not be able to continue as a going concern due to substantial doubt about its ability to do so. The company has reported net losses and burned through its cash reserves in 2022, 2023, and the first quarter of 2024. Despite this, Big Lots plans to open three new stores and close between 35 and 40 existing ones. The company also has an increasing long-term debt load, which jumped $72.2 million in the first quarter of 2024. Despite the dire tone of the filing, Big Lots plans to 'vigorously pursue its plans to enhance its liquidity and improve the performance of the business.' This is not the only discount retailer in distress, as 99 Cents Only filed for bankruptcy and Dollar Tree is exploring the sale of Family Dollar.
