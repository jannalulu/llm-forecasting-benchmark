Let me carefully analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent ISW Reports (Most Significant)
- ISW's 2 Sept 2024 report suggests Russian society isn't experiencing war fatigue
- 57% of Russians don't expect a second mobilization wave
- Kremlin appears flexible in maintaining war effort without full mobilization

2. Russian Official Statements
- Repeated denials of mobilization plans
- Peskov: "No one is talking about mobilization"
- Putin stated in June 2024 no new mobilization would occur

3. Recruitment Alternatives
- Over 190,000 contract soldiers in 2024
- Daily recruitment around 1,000 people
- Increased financial incentives for volunteers

4. Military Challenges
- Bloomberg reports potential need for 500,000 troops in next 12 months
- Ukrainian intelligence suggests Russia facing personnel shortages
- Kursk region tensions increasing military pressures

5. Potential Mobilization Triggers
- Continuing battlefield losses
- Potential need to replace exhausted troops
- Possible preparation for prolonged conflict

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate of mobilization: Low (previous mobilization was exceptional)
- Current evidence suggests alternatives being pursued
- But significant military pressures exist

Balanced Assessment:
- Strong institutional resistance to mobilization
- High political/social costs of mobilization
- Yet increasing military necessities

Considering Superforecasting Principles:
- Balance inside/outside views
- Avoid overconfidence
- Consider multiple causal forces
- Recognize uncertainty

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.75%, but 24.30% being the most likely. Probability: 24.30%.

Let's analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Points:
1. Recent ISW Reports
- ISW's Sept 2 report suggests Russian society isn't experiencing war fatigue
- 57-60% of Russians don't expect/see need for second mobilization
- Kremlin appears to have flexibility in war strategy

2. Russian Official Statements
- Multiple high-level denials of mobilization plans
- Peskov: "No one is talking about mobilization"
- Putin stated in June no new mobilization planned
- Defense Ministry claims sufficient volunteer recruitment (190,000 in 2024)

3. External Expert Predictions
- Bloomberg sources suggest potential mobilization by late 2024
- Ukrainian intelligence (Budanov) predicts Russia facing mobilization dilemma by summer 2025
- Some experts believe Russia needs ~500,000 troops in next 12 months

4. Contextual Factors
- Ukrainian advances in Kursk region increasing military pressure
- Ongoing personnel shortages in Russian military
- High economic and political costs of mobilization

Balancing Considerations:
- High political risk of mobilization
- Existing volunteer recruitment strategies
- Potential military necessity
- Kremlin's information management capabilities

Probability Assessment:
- Low probability of formal mobilization before Oct 1, 2024
- Higher likelihood of continued "crypto-mobilization"
- ISW's recent reporting suggests Kremlin prefers alternative strategies

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.50% being the most likely. Probability: 15.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this systematically:

Base Rate Analysis:
- First mobilization occurred in September 2022
- Current context: ongoing war, significant battlefield losses
- Ukraine's intelligence suggests Russia needs ~500,000 troops

Evidence Supporting Mobilization:

2. ISW July report notes Russia's "crypto-mobilization" generating costs
3. UK MoD notes Russia recruiting ~30,000 soldiers monthly
4. Ukrainian intelligence (Budanov) predicts Russia must mobilize by summer 2025
5. Russian losses significant: ~561,400 military casualties reported

1. Kremlin repeatedly denies mobilization plans
2. Peskov stated "no one is talking about mobilization"
3. Levada Center poll: 57% don't expect mobilization
4. Putin claims sufficient volunteers (190,000 contract soldiers in 2024)

Distinctive Situation Features:
- Kursk region invasion increases military pressure
- Economic concerns about mobilization's impact
- Potential desire to avoid political instability

Probability Calculation Rationale:
- Strong evidence mobilization is being considered
- Significant constraints and resistance exist
- Timing critical: before October 1, 2024

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.30%, but 48.75% being the most likely. Probability: 48.75%.

Let's analyze this systematically:

Evidence Against Mobilization:
1. Repeated official denials from Kremlin, Defense Ministry, and officials
2. ISW reports suggest Russia is managing manpower through:
- Contract soldier recruitment (190,000+ signed in 2024)
- Volunteer incentives
- Information campaigns reducing war fatigue
3. Levada Center polls show:
- 78% support war
- 57% don't expect mobilization
- 60% don't see need for mobilization
4. Putin explicitly stated no new mobilization in June 2024

Evidence For Potential Mobilization:
1. Bloomberg sources suggest mobilization possible by year-end
2. Ukrainian intelligence (Budanov) predicts Russia will need to mobilize by summer 2025
3. Russia facing personnel shortages, especially after Kursk region incursions
4. Russia developing systems to prevent draft dodging
5. Some military experts suggest rotation/replacement needs

Probability Assessment:
- Base rate for unexpected mobilization: Low
- Current personnel management strategies seem adequate
- Political risks of mobilization are high
- But military needs are increasing

Balancing these factors, I assess the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 27.75%, but 19.90% being the most likely. Probability: 19.90%.

- Kremlin seems focused on information operations to manage war fatigue

2. Official Russian Statements
- Repeated denials of mobilization plans from Peskov, Putin, Defense Ministry
- Claims of sufficient volunteers (190,000 contract soldiers in 2024)
- Emphasis on voluntary recruitment

3. External Expert Perspectives
- Budanov (Ukrainian Intelligence) predicts Russia faces mobilization dilemma by summer 2025
- Bloomberg sources suggest potential mobilization by end of 2024 due to personnel shortages
- Military experts note growing personnel challenges

4. Contextual Factors
- Ukraine's Kursk region invasion increases military pressure
- Growing battlefield losses
- Economic concerns about full mobilization

Probability Calculation:
- Base rate of unexpected mobilization: Low
- Current strategic preference for avoiding mobilization: High
- Growing military personnel pressures: Moderate
- Near-term timeline constraint (before October 1, 2024): Narrow window

Balancing Competing Considerations:
- Underreaction risk: Missing clear mobilization signals
- Overreaction risk: Overestimating mobilization likelihood based on speculative reports

- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Provide conservative but nuanced estimate
- Reflect multiple scenario probabilities
