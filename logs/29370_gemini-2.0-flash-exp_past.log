Okay, let's analyze the likelihood of Oregon Measure 117 passing.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is a question on Metaculus about this, and the current community prediction is around 55% for the measure passing. This is a good starting point but will need to be adjusted to reflect my more detailed analysis. 
* **Other Sources:** I'm not aware of any other forecasting sites that have made specific predictions on this measure.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

We can break this down by looking at:

*   **Base Rate:** What's the general success rate of ballot measures? How often do election reform measures pass?
*   **Support:** Who supports this measure, and how strong is their support?
*   **Opposition:** Who opposes this measure, and how strong is their opposition?
*   **Funding:** What are the financial resources on each side?
*   **Public Opinion:** What do polls suggest about the likely outcome?
*   **Context:** Are there other related factors or issues that might influence the result?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  It's tough to find a precise base rate for election reform ballot measures, as they vary in content, state, and timing. However, generally, ballot measures face a relatively uncertain path. They often need strong, well-funded campaigns to pass, and many fail. Looking at past Oregon elections, ballot measures have had mixed success. A generic "success rate" for Oregon ballot measures is difficult to pin down, but it would likely be somewhere between 40%-60%. Let's use a 50% initial base rate.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of this Measure):** This involves examining the specific details of this measure and the specific circumstances in Oregon.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

I will attempt to adjust my base rate in proportion to the strength of new evidence, but avoid over-reacting or over-adjusting from the base rate. I aim to strike the right balance and avoid being overly influenced by any single piece of information.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Support for Reform:** There is a strong argument that ranked-choice voting (RCV) is a positive reform that reduces polarization and encourages more inclusive campaigns. This is supported by several organizations and advocates.
*   **Opposition Concerns:** There are concerns about the complexity, cost, and potential for voter confusion with RCV. Rural county clerks are particularly opposed, raising concerns about implementation and funding. The Oregonian editorial board also opposes the measure, stating it's premature.
*   **Political Dynamics:** The political landscape is somewhat mixed, with support from some Democratic groups and opposition from the Republican party.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

* The trend appears to be of increased interest in ranked choice voting in recent years and increasing attempts to implement it. 
* This suggests a moderate positive trend towards RCV.
* But the trend is not uniform, with several opposing factors present.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I will use a fairly tight probability range to express my level of uncertainty.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

I aim to be neither too confident nor too cautious, and try to avoid overconfidence while still being decisive.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

I will consider my reasoning to adjust my approach on other forecasting tasks, and will try to avoid hindsight bias.

**Analysis:**

*   **Strong Support:** Measure 117 has substantial support from good government groups, the League of Women Voters, the ACLU, and other similar organisations. They are well-funded, with a large recent influx of cash, suggesting they can run a robust campaign. These groups generally have been on the right side of recent electoral changes in Oregon such as those in Portland and Multnomah County.
*   **Established Support:** RCV is not entirely new in Oregon, having been implemented in Benton County and now in Portland, with Multnomah County following soon.
*   **Cost Concerns:** The opposition from rural county clerks and The Oregonian are a moderate concern. Their worries about cost and complexity are valid.
*   **Lack of Polling:** The fact that there isn't extensive polling data is slightly concerning, although the information that does exist suggests an even split.
*   **Ballot Measure Success:** As a general rule, many ballot measures do fail. Ballot measures face a somewhat uncertain path to success, although reforms have often been successful in Oregon
*   **Recent Precedent:** Portland's adoption of RCV (though a local measure) gives it a recent precedent.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The substantial support and funding for Measure 117, coupled with the fact that RCV is already in use in some parts of Oregon, suggest a better than 50/50 chance of passage. However, the opposition from county clerks, a major newspaper, and concerns about cost and complexity are significant hurdles. The lack of strong public opinion data means the outcome is uncertain. The even odds mentioned in the one poll is concerning. I am therefore pulling back a bit on how much I am weighting the strong support. 

**Conclusion:**

I will adjust my initial base rate of 50% up towards 55%, but will keep the range tight to reflect the considerable uncertainty. I predict a slightly better than even chance that the measure passes.

My Prediction: Between 49.00% and 62.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

Okay, let's analyze the prospects of Oregon Measure 117 passing.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** The Metaculus community currently has a prediction of 55% for this question. This serves as a useful starting point and suggests a relatively close contest.
*   **Other Sources:** I am unaware of any relevant predictions from FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket for this specific state measure, but their general articles about ranked choice voting and ballot measures serve as good background context.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

To assess the likelihood of passage, we need to consider the following sub-problems:
*   **Public Opinion:** How does the public currently feel about ranked-choice voting in Oregon?
*   **Support and Opposition:** Who are the key groups supporting and opposing the measure, and how influential are they?
*   **Financial Support:** How much money is being spent on each side of the campaign?
*   **Historical Precedent:** What is the success rate of similar ballot measures, specifically those related to electoral reform?
*   **Voter Education:** Will voters understand the system enough to vote for it?
*   **Clerk Concerns:** How much influence do clerk concerns have on voters?
*   **Recent Polling Data:** What do recent polls suggest?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** Ballot measures for electoral reform have a mixed success rate. It is not unusual for these to fail, especially if they are perceived as complex or controversial. The fact that Alaska is considering repealing its ranked-choice voting system is a concerning signal. Generally, in the absence of particularly strong trends, these measures have about a 50/50 chance.
*   **Inside View:** This involves diving into the details of Oregon's situation. The inside view considers the specific groups involved, the money spent, and the local political dynamics.

**4. Balance Under- and Over-Reacting to Evidence:**

It's important to avoid overreacting to any single piece of evidence. For instance, while strong financial backing for the "Yes" campaign is positive, it doesn't guarantee success. Similarly, opposition from county clerks is significant but can be overcome. The "even odds" reported by recent polling data indicates uncertainty and should be treated as such rather than as a strong indication for or against.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **For Passage:**
    *   Strong financial backing for the "Yes" campaign with over $4 million raised compared to only about $1000 on the opposing side.
    *   Support from numerous organizations like the League of Women Voters, ACLU, Urban League, and the Coalition of Communities of Color.
    *   Arguments that RCV leads to more representative and inclusive elections with more diversity among elected officials.
    *   Framing it as a way to make sure voters are truly represented and have a greater voice.
    *   The existence of a vocal and well-funded group advocating for the passage of Measure 117, with strong arguments for its benefits.
    *   Existing use of RCV in Benton County and Portland demonstrates familiarity and successful implementation within the state, as well as its implementation in other jurisdictions with positive results.
    *   The idea that it is an opportunity for voters to express more information to the system.
*   **Against Passage:**
    *   Opposition from county clerks who are concerned about costs, implementation difficulties, voter confusion, and potential for distrust in the election process.
    *   The Oregon Republican Party is against it.
    *   Concerns over voter confusion, especially in rural counties with limited resources.
    *   Some arguments that RCV will weaken political parties and create more polarized politics.
    *   The Oregonian Editorial Board recommendation to vote no.
    *   Arguments that RCV could make some votes not count and change election outcomes by vote splitting.
    *  The fact that Alaska is considering repealing RCV.
    *   Some argue the measure does not include state legislative races, which is seen as odd.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**
There isn't a strong trend to extrapolate from. Recent polls suggest that the vote is split, but a clear trend towards either outcome is absent.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**
There is considerable uncertainty around this. The competing forces are of approximately equal strength.

**8. Balance Under- and Over-Confidence:**

This is a close call. While the funding and endorsements are strongly in favor of passage, the arguments against, particularly the concerns of county clerks, can be persuasive to voters. Given the split nature of the poll, I am leaning towards a prediction that is close to even odds, with some uncertainty. It is important to not be overconfident here, given that the "yes" campaign has the funds but the "no" campaign has some persuasive counter-arguments that could influence voters.

**9. Look for Errors and Avoid Hindsight Bias:**
I need to be careful not to dismiss the concerns of county clerks and not be overly influenced by the large amount of money spent in support. It is important to avoid biases associated with preferring the status quo or being resistant to change, but also important to consider the concerns of voters who might be skeptical of anything that complicates the voting process.

**Final Prediction:**
Taking all of this into account, I believe the measure is still a close call, although the funding and endorsements for Measure 117 tip the scale slightly in its favour. A slight lean towards the 'yes' outcome, but not enough to ignore all of the headwinds it is facing. 

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 65.00%, but 53.00% being the most likely. Probability: 53.00%.

Okay, let's analyze the prospects for Oregon Measure 117 passing.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** Currently, Metaculus has a community prediction of 51% for this question, with a tight interquartile range. This suggests a highly uncertain outcome and a near-even split among forecasters.
*   **Other Sources:** I don't see any similar predictions from FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket at the moment.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We can break this down into a few key factors:

*   **Public Opinion:** What is the current level of support for ranked-choice voting in Oregon?
*   **Support and Opposition:** Who are the key groups supporting and opposing the measure?
*   **Financial Resources:** How much money are both sides raising and spending?
*   **Voter Education and Understanding:** How well do Oregon voters understand ranked-choice voting?
*   **Historical Base Rates:** What is the typical success rate of ballot measures like this?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views**

*   **Outside View:**  Ballot measures that involve significant changes to voting systems have a mixed history. Some pass and some fail. I lack specific data on the success rate for ranked-choice voting measures, but generally electoral reforms face an uphill battle, as people tend to prefer the status quo. This would suggest an initial base rate of around 40-60% chance. 
*   **Inside View:** I have quite a few articles about this measure, which provides a lot of specific information.

**4. Reacting to Evidence (Under vs. Over-reacting):**

*   **Support:**
    *   Strong financial backing from national nonprofits for the "Yes" campaign ($4.1 million).
    *   Support from various organizations, including the League of Women Voters, ACLU, Urban League of Portland, Coalition of Communities of Color, and some unions.
    *   Arguments about more inclusivity, more choice, and reduced polarization.
    *   Successful implementation in Benton County and Portland.
    *   Some Oregonians see it as a way to give more voice to voters
*   **Opposition:**
    *   Strong opposition from county clerks, particularly in rural areas, citing high costs, potential voter confusion, and concerns about election fraud (although those concerns are vague). The main opposition group has raised only $1000, but this may be an underestimation as it is very early in the election cycle
    *   The Oregon Republican Party opposes the measure.
    *   Some skepticism about the benefits of RCV from some editorial boards who advise voters to vote 'no' because of the closed primary system.
     *   Concerns about complexity, potential errors on ballots, and voters not understanding the system
    *   A recent poll suggests that 1/3 of Portland voters are unsure of how it works.
    *   Some believe that it may weaken the major political parties.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive:** The push for electoral reform driven by good-government groups, arguments about increased voter choice and inclusion, and successful implementations in other jurisdictions (and within Oregon).
*   **Negative:** The practical challenges of implementing a new voting system (cost, complexity), voter confusion, and opposition from established political actors and some county officials. The editorial board of a prominent Oregon newspaper has come out against it, which carries weight.

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends:**

The trend here is somewhat mixed. There is a clear trend for ranked choice voting to grow as a concept, but at the same time there are clear and well articulated challenges with its implementation. Given this mixed bag, I will need to balance under-reacting and over-reacting to evidence.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

This is a relatively high-stakes issue with strong arguments on both sides.  I am not very certain of the outcome.

**8. Confidence and Decisiveness:**

Given the conflicting information, I will make a prediction that is close to a 50/50 split.  I am not particularly confident as there are strong arguments on both sides.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

I will be looking for whether my initial base rate was accurate, and whether I reacted appropriately to specific details.

**Forecast:**

Given the information above, I am putting a slightly higher probability on the measure being approved.  There is no strong evidence to suggest a 'yes' or 'no', but given the strong finances of the 'Yes' campaign, and the fact that the movement towards ranked choice voting is growing, I will put slightly higher probability on it passing.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 52.00% being the most likely. Probability: 52.00%.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**

*   **Metaculus:** The Metaculus community currently has a prediction of 47% for this question. This suggests a roughly even split in expectations, which is a good starting point for further analysis.

**2. Break Down the Problem into Sub-Problems**

To determine the likelihood of passage, we can consider the following:

*   **Base Rate:** What is the historical success rate of ballot measures in Oregon?
*   **Support:** What level of support is evident for ranked-choice voting (RCV)?
*   **Opposition:** What is the strength and nature of opposition to RCV?
*   **Momentum:** Are there any trends in support for RCV in the lead-up to the vote?
*   **Context:** How might other factors such as turnout affect the vote?

**3. Balance Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** While specific data on Oregon ballot measure success rates is hard to pin down for *all* measures, they often hover around the 50% mark. Some sources indicate a slightly lower success rate, particularly when controversial. Since this measure is eliciting organized opposition, a base rate *around* 45% is a reasonable starting point. 

*   **Inside View (Specific Evidence):**
    *   **Support:**
        *   Many organizations, including the League of Women Voters, ACLU of Oregon, and various unions, support Measure 117. This indicates significant backing from established advocacy groups.
        *   The 'Yes on 117' campaign has amassed substantial funding, which helps with visibility and outreach.
        *   Proponents emphasize that RCV gives voters more voice and may lead to more representative bodies, appealing to those who seek more democratic reform.
        *   The fact that RCV is used in Benton County and will be used in Portland and Multnomah County points to some existing familiarity and (possibly) support.
        *   RCV is being considered in multiple states, indicating broader national interest in the concept.

    *   **Opposition:**
        *   The Oregon Republican Party and some county clerks oppose the measure, citing cost concerns and potential voter confusion. This is an important source of organized opposition.
        *   Rural clerks worry about the cost and complexity of implementing RCV, which could lead to reduced turnout and election integrity concerns.
        *   Some editorials recommend a 'no' vote, citing the need to see how well Multnomah County implements its RCV system first. There is some concern that it is premature to adopt statewide.
        *   Concerns about voter confusion and errors in ballots could sway voters.
        *   Arguments that RCV can undermine political parties and does not resolve issues with closed primaries also exist.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**

*   **Overreacting:** It would be an error to be overly optimistic based on the support, as there is clear, organized opposition. It would also be an error to completely ignore the substantial funds raised for the 'yes' campaign.
*   **Underreacting:** Conversely, to underestimate the opposition would also be an error. It appears that there are credible concerns about costs and voter confusion.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Pro-RCV:** Desire for a more representative and less polarized democracy, the support of influential groups, financial backing, and the sense that it is a step forward for reform.
*   **Anti-RCV:** Concerns about cost, complexity, voter confusion, the need for more time to observe its effects in other Oregon cities, and some distrust of new electoral systems.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
* The most recent poll indicates an even split on the measure, suggesting a very close outcome.
* The articles highlight active campaigning for both sides.
* Early results may not be fully indicative of the final result.
    
**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
The evidence suggests that this is a very close race. There are strong arguments on both sides, and no overwhelming evidence to decisively sway the forecast. A range with some uncertainty is appropriate.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence**

A 50% probability would overstate our certainty in predicting the outcome. The existing Metaculus forecast seems reasonable at the moment. A reasonable range is needed to reflect the genuine uncertainty.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes**

If this forecast turns out to be wrong, it would be useful to analyze whether there was an overestimation of the power of the 'yes' campaign to influence voters, or an underestimation of how well the 'no' campaign exploited concerns about the cost and complexity of RCV. Another learning point might involve how important editorials from prominent sources such as *The Oregonian* are for ballot measure outcomes.

**Putting It All Together**

The base rate of ballot measures suggests that they often fail. While there's significant support for Measure 117 from various groups and substantial funding, the organized opposition, particularly from county clerks and the Republican party, along with concerns about costs and voter confusion, are noteworthy. The recent poll data indicates a very tight race, further underscoring the uncertainty. 

Given the arguments and balancing inside and outside views, the most likely outcome is still a narrow defeat, but that is within a range of reasonable possibility that it will be passed. Therefore, I would slightly lower the Metaculus estimate of 47%.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, but 43.00% being the most likely. Probability: 43.00%.

Okay, let's analyze the likelihood of Oregon Measure 117 passing, using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** Metaculus currently has a community prediction of around 52% for this question, indicating a relatively close contest.
*   **Other Sources:** I haven't found any specific predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket for this particular state-level ballot measure.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We can break this down into several key sub-problems:

*   **Base Rate:** What's the historical success rate of ballot measures, especially those related to electoral reform?
*   **Support:** How much support does Measure 117 have from different groups (political parties, organizations, etc.)?
*   **Opposition:** What are the primary arguments against Measure 117, and how strong is the opposition?
*   **Public Opinion:** What do polls say, and how might they be affected by late-breaking news?
*   **Local Context:** Are there any unique factors in Oregon that might influence the outcome?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Ballot measures are notoriously difficult to predict. Looking at past ballot measure results, success rates often hover around 40-60%, with electoral reforms often facing a slightly higher hurdle due to their complexity and unfamiliarity. Without more specific data, we will take 50% as a base rate for a yes vote.
*   **Inside View (Specifics):** This is where we examine the specifics of Measure 117 and its context in Oregon.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

I will strive to be flexible with my forecast, while recognizing the danger of over-adjusting to any single piece of news. Polling and fundraising data often show an edge for the proponents but the ballot questions sometimes don't pass despite the perceived momentum.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Passage:**
    *   **Support from Good Government Groups:** The measure has backing from groups that advocate for election reform, which seems to have a significant financial backing as well.
    *   **Arguments for Inclusivity:** Proponents argue that RCV reduces polarization, increases voter participation, gives voters more choice and ensures candidates are elected with the widest support possible.
    *   **Momentum:** There is a trend of adoption in cities and other states, creating a sense that this is a reform whose time has come.
    *   **Local Precedent:** RCV is already in use in Benton County, and will soon be used in Portland and Multnomah County.
    *   **The experience of other jurisdictions:** The success of RCV in other jurisdictions such as in Alaska and Maine shows it can be successfully implemented
*   **Forces Against Passage:**
    *   **Opposition from County Clerks:** Concerns about costs, complexity, and potential for election fraud claims raise a strong practical objection to the measure.
    *   **Confusion and Voter Education:** A significant portion of voters, especially in Portland, are still unsure about how RCV works. This could lead to higher rates of ballot spoilage or a general sense of unease about adopting it statewide.
    *   **Cost:** The measure could be expensive to implement.
    *   **Opposition from Oregon Republican Party:** The Oregon Republican Party argues against the measure.
    *  **Skepticism by Editorial Boards:** Some editorial boards recommend voting 'no' on the measure.
    *  **Lack of guaranteed funding:** There is concern that the counties won't get the necessary funding to implement the new system.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

There isn't a strong trend to extrapolate here, but the fact that Portland is implementing the change should be a signal that the proponents are gaining momentum and that the implementation hurdles are not insurmountable.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

Given the clashing forces, it's clear that the outcome isn't a sure thing. The polling is mixed with some showing even odds for passage and there is significant opposition. A tight result is more likely than a landslide for either side.

**8. Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

Given the arguments on both sides of the measure and the recent polls, it is a close race, but the financial backing from good governance groups and the prior adoption in Benton county does give the measure a slight advantage.

**9. Look for Errors:**

My initial estimate was anchored around a base rate of 50%. I adjusted it based on the specific news about the support for RCV from different groups, but recognizing that the opposition from county clerks and editorial boards is significant, as well as some voter unfamiliarity.

**Forecast:**

Based on the above analysis, the current situation has the following key aspects:
- Polling suggests close race
- Proponents have significant financial advantage
- Previous adoption of RCV in Benton County and now in Portland suggests it is implementable
- Opponents raise practical issues of cost and election integrity

My estimate is that the measure will pass, but the strong opposition and lack of familiarity means it is a fairly close race. The base rate for a ballot measure is 50%. Given the information above, I will adjust slightly up to 55%. Given the close polling, and the fact that ballot measures sometimes fail despite the momentum, the range will be between 45% and 65%.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

Given the clashing forces, it's clear that the outcome isn't a sure thing. The polling is mixed with some showing even odds for passage and there is significant opposition. A tight result is more likely than a landslide for either side.

**8. Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

Given the arguments on both sides of the measure and the recent polls, it is a close race, but the financial backing from good governance groups and the prior adoption in Benton county does give the measure a slight advantage.

**9. Look for Errors:**

My initial estimate was anchored around a base rate of 50%. I adjusted it based on the specific news about the support for RCV from different groups, but recognizing that the opposition from county clerks and editorial boards is significant, as well as some voter unfamiliarity.

**Forecast:**

Based on the above analysis, the current situation has the following key aspects:
- Polling suggests close race
- Proponents have significant financial advantage
- Previous adoption of RCV in Benton County and now in Portland suggests it is implementable
- Opponents raise practical issues of cost and election integrity

My estimate is that the measure will pass, but the strong opposition and lack of familiarity means it is a fairly close race. The base rate for a ballot measure is 50%. Given the information above, I will adjust slightly up to 55%. Given the close polling, and the fact that ballot measures sometimes fail despite the momentum, the range will be between 45% and 65%.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

Okay, let's analyze the likelihood of Oregon Measure 117 passing, using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** Metaculus currently has a community prediction of around 52% for this question, indicating a relatively close contest.
*   **Other Sources:** I haven't found any specific predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket for this particular state-level ballot measure.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We can break this down into several key sub-problems:

*   **Base Rate:** What's the historical success rate of ballot measures, especially those related to electoral reform?
*   **Support:** How much support does Measure 117 have from different groups (political parties, organizations, etc.)?
*   **Opposition:** What are the primary arguments against Measure 117, and how strong is the opposition?
*   **Public Opinion:** What do polls say, and how might they be affected by late-breaking news?
*   **Local Context:** Are there any unique factors in Oregon that might influence the outcome?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Ballot measures are notoriously difficult to predict. Looking at past ballot measure results, success rates often hover around 40-60%, with electoral reforms often facing a slightly higher hurdle due to their complexity and unfamiliarity. Without more specific data, we will take 50% as a base rate for a yes vote.
*   **Inside View (Specifics):** This is where we examine the specifics of Measure 117 and its context in Oregon.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

I will strive to be flexible with my forecast, while recognizing the danger of over-adjusting to any single piece of news. Polling and fundraising data often show an edge for the proponents but the ballot questions sometimes don't pass despite the perceived momentum.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Passage:**
    *   **Support from Good Government Groups:** The measure has backing from groups that advocate for election reform, which seems to have a significant financial backing as well.
    *   **Arguments for Inclusivity:** Proponents argue that RCV reduces polarization, increases voter participation, gives voters more choice and ensures candidates are elected with the widest support possible.
    *   **Momentum:** There is a trend of adoption in cities and other states, creating a sense that this is a reform whose time has come.
    *   **Local Precedent:** RCV is already in use in Benton County, and will soon be used in Portland and Multnomah County.
    *   **The experience of other jurisdictions:** The success of RCV in other jurisdictions such as in Alaska and Maine shows it can be successfully implemented
*   **Forces Against Passage:**
    *   **Opposition from County Clerks:** Concerns about costs, complexity, and potential for election fraud claims raise a strong practical objection to the measure.
    *   **Confusion and Voter Education:** A significant portion of voters, especially in Portland, are still unsure about how RCV works. This could lead to higher rates of ballot spoilage or a general sense of unease about adopting it statewide.
    *   **Cost:** The measure could be expensive to implement.
    *   **Opposition from Oregon Republican Party:** The Oregon Republican Party argues against the measure.
    *  **Skepticism by Editorial Boards:** Some editorial boards recommend voting 'no' on the measure.
    *  **Lack of guaranteed funding:** There is concern that the counties won't get the necessary funding to implement the new system.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

There isn't a strong trend to extrapolate here, but the fact that Portland is implementing the change should be a signal that the proponents are gaining momentum and that the implementation hurdles are not insurmountable.
