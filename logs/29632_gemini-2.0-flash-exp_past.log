Okay, let's analyze this question systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time data from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. Therefore, I will need to establish my prediction based on the provided sources and superforecasting principles.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether the Mike Tyson fight will happen before January 1, 2025, as it's the only public boxing match on his schedule. This breaks into sub-problems:

    *   **Is there a planned fight?** Yes, the articles point to a highly anticipated fight scheduled for November 15, 2024.
    *   **Is the fight *public*?** Yes, the articles confirm it's at a public stadium and will be broadcast on Netflix.
    *   **Will Tyson's health hold up?** There are significant concerns, as articles discuss a stomach ulcer, concerns from regulators, and the fact Tyson has been struggling in training.
    *   **Will the Texas Department of Regulation and Licensing approve the match?** This is a key potential hurdle as the medical evaluation is scheduled for just 24 hours before the event.
    *   **Can the fight be cancelled or downgraded to an exhibition?** This is mentioned as a possibility if Tyson is medically unfit.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:**  Base rates for boxing matches being cancelled are hard to come by. However, we know that fights involving older fighters with health concerns are *more* likely to be cancelled. Let's assume a baseline for a high profile boxing match being cancelled at short notice is ~5-10%. However, given Tyson's age (58), recent health issues, and regulatory uncertainties the base rate for *this* fight may be considerably higher. 
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Strong Evidence for the fight happening:** There's strong evidence of planning: a date (Nov 15th), venue (AT&T Stadium), streaming deal (Netflix), associated documentary series, tickets sold, and constant promotion. Both fighters appear to be training.
    *   **Strong Evidence against the fight happening:** Tyson's health is the biggest concern. Multiple articles highlight the stomach ulcer, the need for medical evaluations 24 hours prior, and the risk of cancellation or downgrading the match to an exhibition. Tyson is also reported to be struggling with his training regime, stating that it is "hard to walk right now". The fact that the fight has been delayed once before due to Tyson's ulcer increases the probability that further delays or cancellation are possible. The fact that the fight was initially scheduled for July and delayed suggests there is higher uncertainty, and that we cannot assume that the fight will go ahead as planned. Tyson's age and associated health risks also increase the uncertainty. The boxing match is also happening whilst Tyson is facing a decades-old rape lawsuit, which could also potentially impact the fight.
    *  **Balancing evidence:** The sheer amount of promotion and investment around the fight is a strong argument for it going ahead but the medical evaluation at the last moment is a significant red flag. The documentary series is not the same as a live fight, and if the fight does not occur this will still be broadcast.
    *  **Trend Extrapolation:** All articles published on and after November 1st indicate the event is still scheduled to go ahead on November 15th. This suggests that the event has momentum and is likely to go ahead.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Avoid Overreacting to Optimism:**  The fight promotion and Tysonâ€™s confident statements might make us overconfident.
*   **Avoid Overreacting to Pessimism:** Health concerns are a genuine risk, but Tyson's camp and the promoters will be very motivated to make the fight happen.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing for the fight:** Huge financial incentives, contractual obligations, promotion, fan anticipation, and the careers of both fighters (for Tyson, potentially the last one).
*   **Forces pushing against the fight:** Tyson's age, health issues (especially the ulcer and medical evaluations), regulatory hurdles, and the possibility of a last-minute cancellation.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   The trend is the fight is happening on November 15th, with preparations underway and no indication that cancellation is imminent in articles on or after November 1st. However, the concerns about Tyson's health and the last minute medical evaluation represent real risks to it going ahead.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I can distinguish between a high likelihood and near certainty because of the potential for medical evaluation causing the fight to be cancelled.

**8. Balance Confidence & Decisiveness:**

*   I need to be decisive in assigning probabilities while remaining aware of the uncertainty related to Tyson's health and the last-minute medical check.

**9. Errors & Hindsight:**

*   I need to be aware that I might be biased by media hype pushing towards the fight occurring. I also need to be conscious that hindsight bias could cause me to over or under weight evidence regarding Tyson's health concerns.

**My Prediction:** Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.00% being the most likely. Probability: 77.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question with a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. However, the general sentiment in the provided articles leans towards the fight happening. This suggests a generally high prior probability.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question hinges on whether the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight will actually occur before January 1, 2025. We can break this down into sub-problems:

*   **Is the fight still scheduled?** Yes, the vast majority of articles confirm the fight is scheduled for November 15, 2024.
*   **Will Mike Tyson be medically cleared to fight?** There are conflicting signals. Some articles highlight Tyson's health issues (ulcer, feeling "homicidal," difficulty walking), and the need for a medical evaluation just 24 hours before the fight. Other articles express confidence he will be cleared.
*   **Will there be any other reason for a cancellation?** The articles do not indicate any other factors that could prevent the fight.
*   **Assuming the fight occurs on November 15, it is clearly before January 1st, 2025.**

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Fights do get cancelled due to health concerns and other issues, but for an event with this much promotion and ticket sales, cancelations last minute are relatively rare. It's difficult to get precise base rates for high-profile boxing match cancellations, but let's say, as an initial estimate, a 10% chance of cancelation from initial scheduling given the information available. So we start at an initial 90% likelihood of the fight occurring.
*   **Inside View (Specific Details):**
    *   **Strong Positive Evidence:** The fight is heavily promoted, has a venue, a date (November 15), a streaming partner (Netflix), a three-part documentary series and tickets are on sale, suggesting that there is very strong momentum for the fight to go ahead.
    *   **Negative Evidence (Medical):**  Tyson's health is a significant concern. His ulcer, the need for a last-minute medical assessment, and reports of training difficulties raise a red flag. The articles use words like "last-minute cancellation", "on the brink of cancellation" and mention the possibility of reducing the match to an exhibition. The fact he previously had a medical issue that caused the initial July fight to be postponed makes his health a higher risk.
    *   **Negative Evidence (Other):** The only negative evidence outside of the medical concerns is a decades old rape lawsuit, but this seems unlikely to be something that would prevent the fight at this stage.

**4. Under- vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   It's easy to overreact to the negative health news, especially with Tyson's age and history, however I need to be mindful of the huge amount of momentum behind the fight to ensure a significant adjustment is not made due to fear or emotion. I should lean more heavily towards the fact there appears to be an almost overwhelming desire for the fight to happen to counter any fear or emotion that comes with overreacting to the medical evidence.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force for the fight to happen:** Massive financial incentives, promotional momentum, contractual obligations, public expectations.
*   **Force against the fight:**  Tyson's health (specifically the ulcer and the risk of failing the medical evaluation), potential legal issues, general uncertainty of events.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The trend is that the fight is still scheduled, so the linear trend is the fight is likely to occur. The documentary series and promotion indicate that this will occur. Any medical cancellation would be a deviation from this trend.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The situation is not binary, but it appears to have a clear resolution of either happening on the 15th or not occurring before 2025. We are not looking at the question of whether it is a 'good fight', just that it occurs. The level of uncertainty is mostly on the medical outcome.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

*   Given that it is less than 10 days before the proposed event, we are in the situation where it would be more reckless to be too conservative, so some confidence in the higher probability is needed. The last minute medical check does introduce an element of high-risk, but the overwhelming evidence and drive for the event to occur, as well as the financial ramifications for all parties if it does not happen, needs to outweigh the concern over a last minute medical cancellation.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Your Mistakes:**

*   I need to be wary of hindsight bias. If the fight is cancelled, it will be easy to say the health concerns were obvious. However, I need to be mindful to not underreact to the huge amount of promotion and financial risk for cancellation. It is important to balance the medical evidence with the evidence indicating the fight will take place.
*   I should learn from any errors made here in future forecasts about the likelihood of events actually occurring once they have been scheduled, but be mindful not to overreact to the uncertainty that is inherently involved.

**Balancing the Evidence and Making the Forecast:**

Taking into account all of the above, the most likely scenario is that the fight *will* occur. However, the medical risk of a last-minute cancellation is non-negligible. Therefore, we must adjust the initial estimate to accommodate this uncertainty.

I will adjust my initial estimate of 90% down to 75%, to account for a 25% chance the medical review or other unforeseen event prevents the fight. The range will account for the possibility of the fight either definitely happening (95% probability), or the potential for an unexpected cancellation (55%).

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 95.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time prediction markets like Polymarket or Metaculus for this specific event. 
*   FiveThirtyEight doesn't typically cover individual boxing matches.
* Therefore, I am starting with no reference point.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

We need to consider:

*   **Is the fight scheduled?** Yes, the articles indicate the fight is scheduled for November 15, 2024.
*   **Will it be a public boxing match?** The articles overwhelmingly suggest it will be public, broadcast on Netflix.
*   **What are the obstacles?** Tyson's health, regulatory approval, and potential last-minute cancellations.
*   **Are there any competing events?** No, the event seems singular.

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Generally, scheduled high-profile boxing matches tend to happen, but there is a risk of cancellation due to injuries, health concerns, or regulatory issues. Let us say a rough guess base rate of such fights happening is 80%.
*  **Inside View (Specifics):** Mike Tyson's age (58) and recent health issues (ulcers, dizziness) make this match more precarious than usual. However, the amount of news coverage, promotion, and investment by Netflix suggest there is very strong financial pressure for the match to occur. The three part series on Netflix is a significant investment, and Netflix will not want this to be a failed event.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** Ignoring the repeated emphasis on the event proceeding, and focusing too much on a base rate of fights that generally proceed.
*   **Overreacting:**  Dismissing Tyson's health issues or the potential for regulatory hurdles, which are explicitly raised by several of the articles.
* I need to be balanced and take both of those into account.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing Towards Fight Happening:**
    *   Significant financial investment and promotion (Netflix, AT&T Stadium)
    *   Public demand and hype, build-up documentary series, and heavy promotion.
    *   Both fighters seem motivated (Tyson wanting to prove himself, Paul wanting a high profile win).
    *  The official designation as a professional bout and not an exhibition
*   **Forces Pushing Towards Fight Cancellation/Postponement:**
    *   Tyson's age and health issues (ulcer, intense training impact).
    *   Strict medical evaluation just 24 hours before the match creates risk of a late cancellation
    *   Regulatory hurdles from Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (as per news)

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   The trend is that the fight is being planned and promoted, but I need to weigh the evidence, not just follow the trend of the last few weeks.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   We are not looking at a binary outcome, but a probability of an event occuring. I do have to consider the possibility of a cancellation, but also the very high likelihood it occurs.

**8. Confidence and Decisiveness:**

*   I need to be confident enough to commit to a probability, but also aware of the inherent uncertainties. There is a decent chance the fight could be called off at the last minute.

**9. Error Analysis and Hindsight Bias:**

*   I must acknowledge that past cancellations are not directly predictive, but do increase the risk. I must also acknowledge that the level of attention on this fight is above average. I will avoid retrospective hindsight bias.

**Balancing the Evidence and My Forecast**

The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing towards the fight happening. The fight has a set date and venue, strong financial incentives, and media promotion. However, I must acknowledge that the medical evaluation is late, and could still result in a last minute cancellation or downgrade to an exhibition match. Tyson is older, and has had health issues. This indicates that there is real probability of a late cancellation, albeit not a *likely* outcome given all the other factors pushing the match towards happening. I will adjust my initial outside-view of 80% upwards due to the financial incentive and heavy promotion, and then reduce it again slightly due to the possibility of a cancellation.

**My Prediction:** Between 80.00% and 97.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

Okay, let's break down this question and arrive at a probability estimate.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm unaware of any specific predictions for this exact scenario on platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket. Metaculus does not have an active question on this specific boxing match event. This means I'll have to rely primarily on my analysis of the provided information and superforecasting techniques.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question hinges on two sub-problems:
    *   Will the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight occur on November 15th/16th?
    *   Is this event a "public boxing match" as defined in the resolution criteria?

If either of these is no, then the answer to the main question is no. If both are yes, then the main question is yes.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**  Historically, boxing matches are often announced well in advance, but they do sometimes get cancelled. The frequency of cancellation can be affected by the fighter's age, health issues, and financial backing. For a fight involving an older fighter like Tyson, I'd expect a higher cancellation risk than for younger fighters. It is hard to find good base rate data for fight cancellations. I'll start with a base rate of approximately 10% for professional boxing matches being cancelled within a few weeks of their scheduled date but will adjust based on information that we have here.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):** We have a ton of information about this specific match, especially regarding Tyson's health. This needs to be taken into account.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The abundance of articles strongly suggests the event is *intended* to happen.
*   However, articles clearly show significant *concerns* about Tyson's health, most recently that he is struggling to walk due to intense training.
*   A medical assessment will only happen 24 hours before the event, raising the very real possibility of cancellation or downgrade to an exhibition if Tyson isn't deemed fit.
*   There is conflicting information about the actual date: most sources mention the 15th, but some say the 16th, which might point to confusion/inaccuracy or a different time zone making the match technically happen on the 16th.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for the Fight:**
    *   Significant financial investment, ticket sales.
    *   Extensive promotion and marketing, including a Netflix documentary series and trailers.
    *   Desire of both fighters to fight and the public's high level of anticipation.
    *   Sanctioned as a professional fight by the Texas Boxing Commission
*   **Forces Pushing Against the Fight:**
    *   Tyson's age and recent medical issues (ulcer, difficulty walking), medical assessment just before the fight
    *   Potential for a last minute cancellation due to his medical assessment.
    *   Possibility of downgrade to an exhibition.
*   Tyson is also facing an old rape lawsuit, which may distract him/cause more issues, though this seems to be a smaller factor.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The trend is towards a confirmed match with ongoing health concerns that persist right up to the very day before the event.
*   The documentary series suggests a high degree of investment and intent to go ahead with the fight and that the promotional material is not just hype.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I'll use a reasonably precise level of probability to reflect the complexity here.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

*   Given all the factors, overconfidence would be dangerous here. There is a significant risk of the match not happening. But, I should not underreact to the level of intent here.
*  I need to balance the strong marketing and promotional material with the ongoing medical concerns.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Your Mistakes:**

*   My previous errors have often come from overestimating event certainty and/or underestimating the risk of last-minute cancellations. I will be factoring this into my decision.

**Analysis:**

The sheer volume of promotion and investment suggests a strong *desire* for this fight to occur. However, the constant mentions of Tyson's health issues, and especially the 24-hour medical evaluation, significantly raise the risk of cancellation or a downgrade to exhibition status. Given this close proximity of the medical evaluation to the actual scheduled date of the event I would expect some degree of correlation here which would increase the chance of the fight being cancelled on the day.

While I am taking into account a base rate of 10% cancellation of similar fights I think I should increase this due to the combination of the age of Tyson and his known health concerns, as well as the nature of the medical evaluation. If the medical examination was done further in advance I would be more confident about the fight occurring, but the 24-hour window is a major red flag. However, I am not going to overreact here, since all the news is strongly implying that the fight is still set to go ahead.

I will estimate the chance that the fight will occur on the 15th or 16th to be around 70%. If the fight does occur, then it would be considered a 'public boxing match' per the resolution criteria.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

2024-12-11 15:33:23,652 - INFO - Run 4:
Okay, let's analyze the likelihood of Mike Tyson having a public boxing match before January 1, 2025.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to live prediction markets or other superforecasters, so I'll proceed without these references.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Sub-Problem 1: Is the November 15th, 2024 fight likely to happen?** This is the most immediate and impactful event affecting the resolution of the main question.
*   **Sub-Problem 2: What is the chance of other fights before January 1, 2025 if the November fight does not occur?** This is a lower probability scenario given the short time frame, but needs to be considered.

**3. Balance Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Boxing matches involving older athletes have a somewhat high rate of cancellations/postponements due to health concerns. It is important to note that Mike Tyson last fought in a professional match in 2005, so he is not a very active fighter.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Positive:** The fight is heavily promoted, there is a Netflix documentary series, and both fighters seem invested. There are also reports of the fight being sanctioned as a professional bout by the Texas State Athletic Commission. Many articles confirm the fight is scheduled for November 15th.
    *   **Negative:** Tyson's age (58), previous health issues, especially the recent stomach ulcer, are significant red flags. Multiple articles note a medical assessment is planned 24 hours before the match and that cancellation or a downgrade to exhibition is possible if concerns arise. Tyson himself admits to intense training that makes it 'hard to walk' and has stated he is feeling 'homicidal'. His health issues are well-documented.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:** I should not assume the fight is a definite 'go' despite the promotion. The health risks for Tyson are real and have been consistently highlighted.
*   **Underreacting:** Dismissing the fight as certainly off is also wrong. Both fighters have repeatedly confirmed their intention to participate, and there is plenty of evidence indicating the event is still planned.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1 (Pushing Towards Fight):** Financial incentives, promotional commitments, and the desire of both fighters to compete.
*   **Force 2 (Pushing Towards Cancellation):** Tyson's age, health issues, and the potential for a last-minute medical clearance failure.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The current trend is that the fight *is* on, but with a strong possibility of being called off due to Tyson's health. The news is heavily focused on health concerns, which cannot be ignored.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   It's not a simple binary. There are degrees of uncertainty, ranging from near-certainty the fight occurs to the match being a cancellation or downgraded to exhibition status.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   Avoid excessive confidence in either outcome. The situation is truly in flux. It is important to remember that one article notes that the medical evaluation will occur 24 hours before the scheduled start. It is a real possibilty that the fight is cancelled, even with all of the build-up.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   Hindsight bias will try to make the past appear more obvious. I need to avoid this trap. It is possible I will overestimate the likelyhood of the fight based on my expectations, and will therefore need to be vigilant of this tendency.

**Reasoning for Final Forecast:**

Given all of the above, I will now focus on calculating probabilities for the likelihood of this match occuring. I'm starting with a base rate (outside view) of maybe 75% for similar matches to occur. However, the specifics of the Tyson-Paul fight cause me to significantly reduce this.
*   The negative health signals are numerous and strong: his age, the ulcer issues, needing a last-minute medical evaluation before the match, all greatly increase the risk of cancellation. I'm reducing the base rate significantly because of this.
*   The positive aspects, the promotion and fighter committment, mean it's not a complete certainty to be cancelled but I will need to adjust for risk.

Given the above, I will adjust the overall likelyhood downward. While the match is still *scheduled* the health concerns and last minute medical evaluation are concerning.

**Final Probability Judgement:**

I estimate a 70% chance of the November 15th fight proceeding as a public boxing match. I would be more confident if this event had not been postponed already. I will assign a very small probability of the match being cancelled but Mike Tyson still fights in public before 2025. I will assign a 5% chance that the match is cancelled and another boxing match occurs before January 1st, 2025. This is highly unlikely given the amount of time left. The vast majority of the articles refer to the same November 15th match, it is the main event in all of their analyses. 

Therefore:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 79.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

*   **Sub-Problem 2: What is the chance of other fights before January 1, 2025 if the November fight does not occur?** This is a lower probability scenario given the short time frame, but needs to be considered.

**3. Balance Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Boxing matches involving older athletes have a somewhat high rate of cancellations/postponements due to health concerns. It is important to note that Mike Tyson last fought in a professional match in 2005, so he is not a very active fighter.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Positive:** The fight is heavily promoted, there is a Netflix documentary series, and both fighters seem invested. There are also reports of the fight being sanctioned as a professional bout by the Texas State Athletic Commission. Many articles confirm the fight is scheduled for November 15th.
    *   **Negative:** Tyson's age (58), previous health issues, especially the recent stomach ulcer, are significant red flags. Multiple articles note a medical assessment is planned 24 hours before the match and that cancellation or a downgrade to exhibition is possible if concerns arise. Tyson himself admits to intense training that makes it 'hard to walk' and has stated he is feeling 'homicidal'. His health issues are well-documented.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:** I should not assume the fight is a definite 'go' despite the promotion. The health risks for Tyson are real and have been consistently highlighted.
*   **Underreacting:** Dismissing the fight as certainly off is also wrong. Both fighters have repeatedly confirmed their intention to participate, and there is plenty of evidence indicating the event is still planned.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1 (Pushing Towards Fight):** Financial incentives, promotional commitments, and the desire of both fighters to compete.
*   **Force 2 (Pushing Towards Cancellation):** Tyson's age, health issues, and the potential for a last-minute medical clearance failure.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The current trend is that the fight *is* on, but with a strong possibility of being called off due to Tyson's health. The news is heavily focused on health concerns, which cannot be ignored.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   It's not a simple binary. There are degrees of uncertainty, ranging from near-certainty the fight occurs to the match being a cancellation or downgraded to exhibition status.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   Avoid excessive confidence in either outcome. The situation is truly in flux. It is important to remember that one article notes that the medical evaluation will occur 24 hours before the scheduled start. It is a real possibilty that the fight is cancelled, even with all of the build-up.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   Hindsight bias will try to make the past appear more obvious. I need to avoid this trap. It is possible I will overestimate the likelyhood of the fight based on my expectations, and will therefore need to be vigilant of this tendency.

**Reasoning for Final Forecast:**

Given all of the above, I will now focus on calculating probabilities for the likelihood of this match occuring. I'm starting with a base rate (outside view) of maybe 75% for similar matches to occur. However, the specifics of the Tyson-Paul fight cause me to significantly reduce this.
*   The negative health signals are numerous and strong: his age, the ulcer issues, needing a last-minute medical evaluation before the match, all greatly increase the risk of cancellation. I'm reducing the base rate significantly because of this.
*   The positive aspects, the promotion and fighter committment, mean it's not a complete certainty to be cancelled but I will need to adjust for risk.

Given the above, I will adjust the overall likelyhood downward. While the match is still *scheduled* the health concerns and last minute medical evaluation are concerning.

**Final Probability Judgement:**

I estimate a 70% chance of the November 15th fight proceeding as a public boxing match. I would be more confident if this event had not been postponed already. I will assign a very small probability of the match being cancelled but Mike Tyson still fights in public before 2025. I will assign a 5% chance that the match is cancelled and another boxing match occurs before January 1st, 2025. This is highly unlikely given the amount of time left. The vast majority of the articles refer to the same November 15th match, it is the main event in all of their analyses. 

Therefore:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 79.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.
