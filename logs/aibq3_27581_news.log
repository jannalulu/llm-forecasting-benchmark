**OpenAI Leaders Leave Amid Internal Tensions**
Three of OpenAI's leaders have left the company, adding to the internal tensions. Greg Brockman, one of the 11 co-founders, has taken a sabbatical until the end of the year, stating 'This is the first time I've relaxed since founding OpenAI 9 years ago. The mission is far from complete; we still need to create a safe AGI.' John Schulman, another co-founder, has joined Anthropic, a rival company, to pursue his goal of 'alignment' (fine-tuning models after initial training). Peter Deng, a product manager, left the company earlier, but the reason is unknown. This comes after Ilya Sutskever, another co-founder, left in May, citing disagreements with the company, and later joined Anthropic. Only three of the original 11 co-founders remain: Sam Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech Zaremba. The company has been in turmoil since Sam Altman's surprise return as CEO in November 2023, and these departures suggest a major internal crisis.

**OpenAI Co-Founder Greg Brockman Takes Leave of Absence, Researcher John Schulman Joins Rival Anthropic**
Greg Brockman, co-founder and president of OpenAI, will take a leave of absence until the end of the year. Meanwhile, researcher John Schulman is leaving the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic. Both Brockman and Schulman are co-founders of OpenAI, and their departures mark a change in the company after significant management turnover this year. Brockman, known as 'GDB' within the company, was a key ally of CEO Sam Altman when he was briefly removed from his position last year. Brockman requested to leave the company in protest after Altman was fired. In a post on X, he wrote, 'I'm taking a year-long sabbatical until the end of the year. First time to relax since founding OpenAI, 9 years ago. The mission is far from over; we still have a safe AGI to build.' Schulman, who was a researcher at the company focused on training AI models, said in a post on X that he will focus on Anthropic's security, but that concerns about this issue did not motivate his decision to leave. 'To be clear, I'm not leaving due to lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI,' he said, referring to the alignment of AI with human interests. 'On the contrary, the company's leaders have committed to investing heavily in this area.' OpenAI stated that the team is 'grateful' for Schulman's work, including his alignment research. 'His passion and hard work have established a solid foundation that will inspire and support future innovations at OpenAI and in the broader field,' a spokesperson said. Schulman was hailed as the architect of ChatGPT, the popular chatbot of OpenAI. However, he said he receives 'too much credit' for the tool and cited the work of the entire team. In a post on X, Altman thanked Schulman for his work at the company and called him a 'brilliant researcher' and 'deep thinker'.

**Two more OpenAI leaders are leaving the company**
Two key OpenAI personnel are leaving the company, while another is taking a months-long leave of absence. OpenAI president Greg Brockman is taking a sabbatical through the end of the year, while co-founder John Schulman is joining rival Anthropic. VP for consumer product Peter Deng is also leaving, citing a desire to return to hands-on technical work and focus on AI alignment. Brockman said in a post on X/Twitter that this is his 'first time to relax' since the founding of OpenAI nine years ago, and that he's coming back after his vacation. Schulman clarified that he's not leaving due to a lack of support for alignment research, and that the company's executives have been 'very committed to investing in this area.' These departures follow several major previous changes in OpenAI's leadership, including the departure of co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in May.

**OpenAI Leadership in Flux: Brockman and Two Executives Depart**
OpenAI's President Greg Brockman and two other executives have left the company, according to a report by The Information. Brockman, one of the co-founders, will be taking a leave of absence for an extended period, while John Schulman, another co-founder, has joined competitor Anthiopic. Peter Deng, the product lead, has also left the company after only joining in 2023. Schulman confirmed his departure on his X account, where CEO Sam Altman thanked him for his services. Brockman and Deng could not be reached for comment. The departures are not related to each other, but reflect the ongoing changes at OpenAI following the sudden firing and re-hiring of Altman in November 2023. This move sparked controversy over OpenAI's corporate structure. The report comes weeks after Microsoft and Apple withdrew their applications for a seat on OpenAI's board, amid a growing antitrust review of the company and its partners. Additionally, Elon Musk has re-filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman, alleging that the company prioritizes profits over public welfare.

**OpenAI Executives Depart Amid Ongoing Turmoil**
Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, and two other executives have left the artificial intelligence startup, according to a report by The Information. Brockman, one of the co-founders of the company, will be taking a prolonged leave of absence, The Information reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. John Schulman, another co-founder, has joined the rival company Anthiopic, while the product lead Peter Deng has left the company after joining in 2023. Schulman confirmed his departure on his X account, where CEO Sam Altman thanked him for his service. Brockman and Deng could not be immediately reached for comment. The Information stated that the three departures were not related, but reflected the ongoing turmoil within the AI startup after Altman's brutal firing and rehiring in November 2023. This decision had sparked controversy over OpenAI's operational structure. The report comes weeks after reports showed that Microsoft Corporation and Apple Inc had withdrawn their offers for seats on OpenAI's board of directors, in the context of growing antitrust scrutiny of the company and its partners.

**OpenAI's Brain Drain: A Sign of Tensions and Competition in the AI Industry**
OpenAI is experiencing a brain drain, with several key founders and employees leaving the company in recent months. John Schulman, a researcher who helped secure ChatGPT, left for Anthropic, a rival company. Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, took a sabbatical for the rest of the year, citing the need to prioritize his personal life. Ilya Sutskever, the company's scientific director, left to start Safe Superintelligence, a new company focused on AI security. Andrej Karpathy, a researcher, left again after a brief return to the company in 2023. This wave of departures has left only two of the original eleven founders still at the company: Sam Altman and Wojciech Zaremba. The departures reveal tensions within OpenAI, particularly regarding the company's approach to AI security. Jan Leike, a security expert, left the company, stating that the team had difficulty being heard and obtaining the necessary resources to conduct their work. He joined Dario and Daniela Amodei, who founded Anthropic, a direct competitor to OpenAI. The departures also suggest that Sam Altman's strategy of showcasing the company's AI capabilities has created a competitive environment, leading to a brain drain. As the market for AI startups cools down, OpenAI must remain vigilant, as Microsoft, its largest investor, has diversified its investments and is developing its own AI models.

**Mass Exodus from Open AI: 9 Founders Leave the Company**
There is a mass exodus of top managers from Open AI, with 9 of the 11 founders leaving the company. The latest to leave are John Schulman and Greg Brockman, who have joined rival company Anthropic. Schulman said, 'I have taken the difficult decision to leave Open AI.' He explained that he wants to focus on aligning AI with human values and start a new chapter in his career where he can return to practical technical work. Brockman said, 'I will take a sabbatical until the end of the year. This is the first time I've taken time off since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago.' The mission of Open AI is far from complete, and they still need to build a safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Other notable departures include Elon Musk, who left in 2018, and Ilya Sutskever, who was the director of science and left in May after supporting the firing of CEO Sam Altman. Jan Leike, a leading researcher, also left in May and joined Anthropic. He said, 'I was in charge of the super alignment of OpenAI and leaving this work is one of the hardest things I've ever done.' He added, 'OpenAI has a responsibility to humanity, but in recent years, the culture and processes regarding safety have taken a backseat to shiny products.'

**Why Are OpenAI's Most Prominent Employees Leaving?**
OpenAI is experiencing a brain drain with the departure of several top employees, including co-founder John Schulman, president Greg Brockman, and VP of consumer product Peter Deng. Critics argue that this could be a sign that the company is struggling to fulfill its long-term vision of achieving safe artificial general intelligence (AGI). Gary Marcus, a leading AI skeptic, tweeted that the departures could be the 'canary in the coal mine' and that the 'Generative AI bubble' may be set to burst. Other critics have questioned OpenAI's repeated claims that AGI is near, asking 'If OpenAI is right on the verge of AGI, why do prominent people keep leaving?' The departures are adding to a growing list of talent that has left the company, including former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and former employee William Saunders, who quit after realizing that OpenAI was prioritizing profit over safety. Brockman has stated that he is taking a leave of absence to relax, but his tweet also emphasizes that the mission to build safe AGI is 'far from complete.'

**OpenAI Continues to Lose Key Personnel Amid Leadership Changes**
OpenAI is experiencing a series of departures from key personnel, including the resignation of two top managers. According to The Information, co-founder John Schulman has left the company to join rival Anthropic, while Peter Deng, responsible for consumer solutions, has also departed after only a year at OpenAI. Deng previously held leadership positions at Meta and Uber. This follows a series of similar departures, including Jan Leike and Ilya Sutskever, who was chief scientist at OpenAI. Sutskever had initially supported the removal of Sam Altman from the board, but later expressed regret and was relegated to a secondary role. The departure of these key personnel comes as the company's president, Greg Brockman, will be taking a one-year leave of absence. 'The Information' notes that these departures are part of a larger trend of changes within the company's leadership structure.

**OpenAI Experiences Mass Exodus of Top Executives**
OpenAI has experienced a mass exodus of top executives, with Greg Brockman, the company's president, taking a temporary leave of absence, John Schulman, one of the co-founders, joining a competitor, and Peter Deng, the vice president of consumer products, also leaving. Brockman announced on social media that he will take a year-long sabbatical, stating, 'I'll be taking a year off until the end of the year. It's the first time I've relaxed since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago.' Schulman, on the other hand, decided to leave OpenAI to join Anthropic, a competing AI company, citing that his decision is not due to a lack of support within OpenAI. He stated, 'I've decided to pursue this goal at Anthropic, where I believe I can gain new perspectives and conduct research alongside people deeply committed to the topics that interest me.' Deng's departure coincides with the hiring of a new CFO and a general product manager, but no further information is available regarding his decision to leave. This is not the first time OpenAI has experienced executive departures, with Ilya Sutskever, another co-founder and former chief scientist, leaving the company in May. Sutskever was involved in Altman's firing and later expressed regret for his involvement in the board's decisions. He announced the founding of SSI, his own AI company, in June.

**Three OpenAI Executives, Including Co-Founder, Leave the Company**
Three key executives at OpenAI, including co-founder Greg Brockman, have left the company in a recent leadership restructuring. Brockman will take a prolonged leave of absence until the end of the year, stating, 'I'm taking a year-long sabbatical until the end of the year. It's the first time I've relaxed since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago.' Another co-founder, John Schulman, has left to join rival company Anthropic. Schulman, who led the team responsible for post-training efforts, or efforts to refine large language models that power ChatGPT, stated, 'I've taken the difficult decision to leave OpenAI.' He emphasized that the decision was not related to any disagreement with OpenAI's work on 'alignment', a term referring to efforts to ensure advanced AI functions safely for humanity. 'To be clear, I'm not leaving due to a lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI,' Schulman said. 'On the contrary, the company leaders have committed to investing heavily in this area.' Sam Altman responded with a message thanking Schulman for his work at OpenAI, saying, 'You are a brilliant researcher, a deep thinker on product and society, and above all, a great friend to all of us.' OpenAI has faced internal turmoil since last fall, when Altman was briefly removed as CEO by the previous board of directors, only to return later as part of a deal that included a major review of the company's governance structure.

**OpenAI Co-Founder John Schulman to Leave and Join Rival Anthropic**
John Schulman, co-founder of OpenAI, announced on X that he will leave the company, which is backed by Microsoft, and join Anthropic, a rival AI startup backed by Amazon. This move comes after less than 3 months of OpenAI's 'Superalignment' team, which focused on ensuring that future AI models align with human ethics and goals, was disbanded. Schulman, who was a co-leader of the post-training team at OpenAI that refined AI models for ChatGPT and the developer-facing API, said in a social media post that he chose to leave OpenAI because he wanted to focus on aligning AI, and start a new chapter in his career where he can return to practical, hands-on work. He denied that he left due to a lack of support for new initiatives around this topic at OpenAI, saying that the company's leaders were 'very committed to investing in this area.' Schulman's departure comes as OpenAI is undergoing significant changes, including the departure of other key team members, such as Jan Leike and co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who also left this year. Leike joined Anthropic, while Sutskever said he was helping to start a new company, Safe Superintelligence Inc. Since OpenAI's employees founded Anthropic in 2021, the two young companies, both based in San Francisco, have been competing to develop the most advanced generative AI models that can produce human-like text. Amazon, Google, and Meta have also developed large language models. Schulman and others chose to leave after the board of directors fired Altman from his position as CEO in November. Employees protested the decision, leading Sutskever and two other board members to resign. Altman was reinstated and new board members were appointed. OpenAI's CEO and co-founder Greg Brockman announced on X that he will take a leave of absence until the end of the year.

**OpenAI Executives Depart Amid Speculation**
Three high-ranking executives, including co-founders, have left OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. The departures have sparked speculation about the reasons behind them. Greg Brockman, the former president of OpenAI, has taken a year-long sabbatical, citing a desire to recharge and return to the company in 2025. John Schulman, another co-founder, has joined Anthropic, a rival company in the field of artificial intelligence. Peter Deng, a vice president at OpenAI, has also left the company. According to The Information, the departures do not seem to be related to each other. Schulman has stated that his departure was not due to a lack of support for research, but rather a desire to pursue new opportunities. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has praised Schulman's work and expressed his gratitude for his contributions. The departures come at a time of relative calm for OpenAI, following a tumultuous period in November 2023 when Altman and other executives were abruptly fired. The company has since undergone a governance review and Altman has returned to his position. Despite the departures, OpenAI remains under scrutiny, with regulators and critics raising concerns about the risks associated with AI, including the spread of misinformation and the potential displacement of humans.

**OpenAI is suffering an exodus of senior talent**
OpenAI is experiencing an exodus of senior talent, with its president, Greg Brockman, temporarily stepping away and cofounder John Schulman leaving the company. Schulman, who was instrumental in launching OpenAI's landmark chatbot, ChatGPT, has joined rival AI company Anthropic, one of OpenAI's biggest competitors. Brockman said he is taking a sabbatical, while OpenAI's vice president of consumer product, Peter Deng, has also departed. The high-level departures are the latest example of OpenAI shedding its top brass, especially after CEO Sam Altman returned to the company following his ouster by the board last November. Schulman said in a post on X, 'I am confident that OpenAI and the teams I was part of will continue to thrive without me.' Altman wished Schulman well in his future plans, saying, 'You are a brilliant researcher, a deep thinker about product and society, and mostly, you are a great friend to all of us.' The departures put the spotlight once again on Altman, with some speculating on social media that he may be the reason employees are leaving. Former board member Helen Toner said in an interview that Altman had misled the board 'on multiple occasions' about its safety processes, including not informing the board about ChatGPT's launch in 2022.

**OpenAI Co-Founder John Schulman Leaves for Anthropic, Citing Need for AI Alignment Focus**
John Schulman, co-founder of OpenAI, has left the company to join competitor Anthropic. According to Schulman, he is leaving OpenAI for Anthropic because he can focus more on AI alignment, which involves aligning AI systems to act according to human values and goals. Schulman denies that his departure is related to a lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI. Meanwhile, OpenAI's chairman and co-founder Greg Brockman has announced that he will take a long-term vacation until the end of the year, citing a need to relax for the first time since founding OpenAI. This is not the first time top executives have left the company, as two other co-founders, Ilya Sutskever and Andrej Karpathy, have also departed. Additionally, product manager Peter Deng left earlier this year and alignment expert Jan Leike departed in May. The mass exodus of top talent began after CEO Sam Altman was unexpectedly fired by the board of directors last year, reportedly due to a lack of transparency. Brockman subsequently resigned in protest, but later returned along with Altman after a new board of directors was formed. The exact reason for Altman's firing remains unclear, with rumors suggesting that he wanted to accelerate the development of general artificial intelligence too quickly, which led to resistance from the alignment team, who prefer a more cautious approach.

**OpenAI Co-Founder John Schulman Leaves to Join Competing Startup Anthropic**
John Schulman, a co-founder of OpenAI, has announced that he will be leaving the company to join Anthropic, a competing startup founded by former OpenAI engineers. This comes just a day after Schulman filed a lawsuit against the startup and its top executives. Schulman, who helped launch the Microsoft-backed startup and led OpenAI's post-training team, which fine-tuned the models used in the KI-Chatbot ChatGPT, stated that he wants to 'deepen my focus on AI alignment and start a new chapter in my career where I can return to practical technical work.' He added, 'To be clear: I'm not leaving OpenAI due to a lack of support for AI alignment research.' This move follows the dissolution of OpenAI's 'Superalignment' team, which focused on controlling KI systems and ensuring they do not pose a threat to humanity. Several team leaders, including Jan Leike and Ilya Sutskever, have already left OpenAI to join Anthropic. CEO Sam Altman praised Schulman's contributions to OpenAI's strategy, saying, 'I'm looking forward to working with him again!' Meanwhile, OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced that he will be taking a sabbatical until the end of 2024, citing it as his 'first break since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago.' The leadership changes come just a day after Tesla CEO Elon Musk refiled his lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing Altman and Brockman of 'manipulating' him and engaging in a 'Shakespearean-scale scam.'

**OpenAI Co-Founder Greg Brockman Takes Sabbatical Amid Leadership Changes**
Greg Brockman, co-founder and president of OpenAI, has announced his leave of absence to take a sabbatical. This comes after John Schulman, another co-founder and key leader, left the company to join rival Anthropic. Peter Deng, the product leader who joined the company last year, has also left OpenAI, according to The Information. Brockman, who played a crucial role in the company's recent changes, will be taking a break from the intense AI sector. He helped transform the discoveries of researchers into large-scale AI models and products like ChatGPT. Brockman said he plans to return after his extended vacation, but announced on X that he will be absent until the end of the year. Schulman led the post-training process, refining large language models that power ChatGPT and other products. He also took over a team focused on preventing AI from causing social harm. Other changes at OpenAI include the reassignment of security leader Aleksander Madry and the departure of co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who left to form a rival startup. Co-founder Andrej Karpathy also left in February to launch an educational startup. OpenAI has recently hired its first CFO and a new product director, which may have impacted Deng's role. The company is in the midst of transforming from a non-profit to a highly profitable corporation, and is currently training its next main model. They have also launched a search mechanism and are working on an AI agent that can automate computer tasks for clients.

**OpenAI Co-Founder Greg Brockmann Takes Sabbatical Amid Turbulence**
OpenAI co-founder and President Greg Brockmann is taking a sabbatical until the end of the year, citing the need to relax and that there is still much to be done to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This is the first time Brockmann has taken a break since the company's founding nine years ago. Two other employees, John Schulman and Peter Deng, are leaving the company permanently. Schulman, also a co-founder, is joining rival Anthropic, where he will focus on the strategic direction of AI. Deng, a former product manager at Facebook, Instagram, and Uber, is also leaving OpenAI. The departures come as OpenAI is facing turbulence, with some employees previously criticizing the company's work environment and security practices. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has been involved in controversy, including being temporarily ousted last fall, but has since returned. Brockmann stood by Altman during the controversy and has now left the company. As OpenAI continues to develop and publish new AI models, including ChatGPT, the company is facing financial struggles, with costs exceeding revenue from AI services. According to Brockmann, OpenAI is not currently seeking alternative funding options. 'There is still a lot to be done to achieve AGI,' Brockmann said, 'and I want to be a part of it.'

Altman has since announced the creation of his own company, Safe Superintelligence, which will also focus on AI development. Elon Musk has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, alleging that the company has betrayed and distorted its original goals and objectives, which were established in 2015.

Schulman confirmed his departure on his X account, where CEO Sam Altman thanked him for his service. Brockman and Deng could not be immediately reached for comment. The Information stated that the three departures were not related, but reflected the ongoing turmoil within the AI startup after Altman's brutal firing and rehiring in November 2023. This decision had sparked controversy over OpenAI's operational structure. The report comes weeks after reports showed that Microsoft Corporation and Apple Inc had withdrawn their offers for seats on OpenAI's board of directors, in the context of growing antitrust scrutiny of the company and its partners.

**OpenAI co-founder John Schulman says he will leave and join rival Anthropic**
John Schulman, a co-founder of OpenAI and leader of the company's post-training team, announced that he will leave the company to join rival Anthropic. Schulman stated that he wants to focus on AI alignment and return to hands-on technical work. He emphasized that he is not leaving due to a lack of support for new work on the topic at OpenAI, but rather to start a new chapter in his career. This move comes after the departure of two safety leaders, Jan Leike and Ilya Sutskever, who joined Anthropic and started a new company, respectively. OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman, stated that Schulman's perspective informed the startup's early strategy, but the two have had a complicated history, with Altman being pushed out as chief last November and later reinstated. Altman has maintained that OpenAI is committed to safety initiatives, including providing early access to its next foundation model to the US AI Safety Institute. Meanwhile, another OpenAI co-founder, Greg Brockman, announced that he will be taking a sabbatical for the rest of the year. 'This choice stems from my desire to deepen my focus on AI alignment, and to start a new chapter of my career where I can return to hands-on technical work,' Schulman wrote in a social media post. He said he wasn't leaving because of a lack of support for new work on the topic at OpenAI. 'On the contrary, company leaders have been very committed to investing in this area,' he said. 'Very excited to be working together again!' Leike wrote in reply to Schulman's message.

**Understanding the Chaos of OpenAI**
A major shake-up has occurred in the AI industry over the weekend, with far-reaching consequences. On Friday, OpenAI's board of directors ousted CEO Sam Altman in a coup orchestrated by Ilya Sutskever, a chief AI researcher. Mira Murati took over as CEO. Microsoft, the largest investor, was caught off guard and only informed minutes before the announcement. On Saturday, rumors spread about Altman's return and the resignation of the board of directors. Employees, investors, and leaders defended Altman and director Greg Brockman, who resigned in solidarity. Altman demanded a restructuring of the board and gave them until 5 pm to do so. The negotiations failed, and the new CEO of OpenAI will be Emmett Shear, the CEO of Twitch. Microsoft hired Sam Altman and Greg Brockman for a new AI research team. To understand the chaos, it's essential to understand the structure of OpenAI. OpenAI Inc. was founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization focused on AI research, prioritizing security and 'alignment' with humanity's benefit, not profit or commercial interests. OpenAI SARL, a commercial branch, was founded later, with Microsoft as the minority owner. The two factions within OpenAI, one focused on commercial development and the other on safe AI development, clashed, leading to the coup. The situation is complex, with Microsoft's interests at stake, and the future of OpenAI uncertain.

**Brockman Takes Leave of Absence from OpenAI, Citing Unfinished Mission**
Brockman, a key figure at OpenAI, announced that he will be taking a leave of absence until the end of the year. He hinted at a potential return, stating that his mission is 'far from over.' This is not the first time Brockman has left OpenAI, as he was previously removed from his position along with CEO Sam Altman, only to be reinstated shortly after. Brockman's announcement comes after news that co-founder John Schulman is leaving to join competitor Anthropic. Other notable departures include chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who was involved in efforts to remove Altman as CEO, and researcher Yan Leike, who criticized OpenAI for its safety concerns. Elon Musk, a former member of OpenAI's team, continues to pursue a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it has strayed from its original mission and prioritized profit over innovation. As Brockman said, 'I'm taking a break until the end of the year. First time in 9 years since the founding of OpenAI. Mission is far from over; we still have to create a safe and strong artificial general intelligence (AGI).'
