**Crimea Hit by Massive Rocket Attack, Russian Air Defense System Activated**
On June 23, 2024, Crimea was hit by a massive rocket attack, with loud explosions reported in Sevastopol and Balaklava. Telegram channels of the occupying forces reported that the Russian air defense system was working on the peninsula. According to 24 Channel, here is what is known about the rocket attack on Crimea. The enemy attacked the Kiev region with 'Calibers' in the morning, causing damage and casualties. Two houses were completely destroyed, and there were reports of injuries and fatalities. The Russian air defense system was reportedly active in the Saki, Yevpatoria, Inkerman, and Bakhchysarai areas, with detonations heard in the Kazachya Bay area, where the 810th Marine Brigade is based. The Suvorov Bay area was also affected, with smoke seen over the bay and the northern part of the city, including the beaches of Uchkuivka and Tolstik. The Crimean Bridge was closed, and there were reports of people injured by debris from the Russian air defense system. Some Telegram users reported that the sirens in Sevastopol only sounded after the first explosion. The local aquarium even kept children out of the underground toilet, telling them it was a drill and that there was a shelter further away. The Russian air defense system reportedly shot down one of the rockets over the center of Sevastopol. As a result, people were injured, and there were reports of fatalities.

**Russia Repels Massive Attack on Crimean Bridge**
Russian Defense Minister Andrei Bellov announced that Russian military forces repelled a massive attack by 10 ATACMS rockets on the Crimean Bridge. According to Bellov, all rockets were shot down, and hundreds of lives were saved. The attack was carried out by Ukrainian forces using ATACMS rockets, drones, and unmanned boats. The Crimean Minister of Transportation, Nikolai Lukashenko, reported that the Kerch Strait ferry and railroad ferry were damaged due to the debris from the shot-down rockets, but no one was injured. The ferry service will be resumed after assessing the damage. The movement on the Crimean Bridge was suspended from 0:56 to 1:30 Moscow time. Ukraine has repeatedly attempted to attack the Crimean Peninsula, with Ukrainian authorities and President Vladimir Zelensky threatening to destroy the Crimean Bridge, which connects the Kerch Strait and the Taman Peninsula. Two attacks on the bridge occurred in October 2022 and July 2023, and on May 3, 2024, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, stated that Ukraine, with Western support, is openly preparing for a new attack on the bridge.

**Russia Installs Barriers to Protect Crimean Bridge from Ukrainian Drone Attacks**
Russia has reportedly installed special barriers in the water near the Crimean Bridge to protect it from Ukrainian drone attacks. According to a US analyst, the barriers were installed within the last two weeks. A Ukrainian military official has stated that a third attack on the Crimean Bridge is planned and its destruction is inevitable. The official said that it will happen in the first half of 2024. The Crimean Bridge has been a target of Ukrainian attacks twice before. In other news, Germany is opposed to the US plan to use frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine.

The US wants to use the frozen assets as collateral for loans or securities. The article also reports on the use of F-16 fighter jets by Ukraine, with technicians returning to the country to train others. The article also mentions the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, including reports of Russian troops killing civilians who are trying to flee, and the destruction of a Ukrainian town by Russian forces.

**Putin suffers embarrassing blow as Ukraine missile strike 'creates corridor' to Crimea**
Ukraine has launched a missile strike on a Russian-held military base in Crimea, aiming to create a pathway to the bridge connecting Russia and Crimea. The attack, which used British Storm Shadow missiles, was confirmed by Sevastopol's Russian proxy leader, Mikhail Razvozhayev, who claimed that air defences shot down all the missiles and destroyed four targets. However, the group ATESH, which is monitoring Russian activities in occupied Crimea, posted photos of the anti-aircraft missiles used in the strike and claimed that they are systematically removing air defence systems and radar stations to create a 'corridor' to the Crimean bridge. Ukrainian officials have previously targeted the Kerch bridge and pledged to attack it again, with Ukraine's HUR military intelligence service planning to launch an attack on the bridge within the first half of 2024.

**Ukraine Has the Means to Destroy the Crimean Bridge, Expert Says**
Ukraine has the necessary means to destroy the Crimean Bridge, according to expert Katkov. He believes that technically, everything is ready, and it's just a matter of time before the maximum effect is achieved. Katkov suggests a combined attack, including ATACMS, to destroy the bridge. He agrees with the head of the Ukrainian Security Service, Kirill Budanov, that the number of ATACMS needed to destroy the bridge is not the only factor. Katkov believes that using ATACMS to destroy the bridge's defensive positions and then using other means to destroy the bridge itself would be more effective. The expert also agrees that Ukraine has the potential to completely destroy the Crimean Bridge, but everything has its time. Ukraine has already attacked the bridge twice, once in October 2022 and again in July 2023, using drones and ATACMS. The Russian vice-premier, Marat Husnullov, has acknowledged that one section of the bridge's road part is irreparable. The commander of the Ukrainian Navy, Vice-Admiral Alexei Neizhpapa, has also stated that he is confident that the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed by the end of the year.

**Odessa Region Hit by Attack, Administrative Building Damaged**
The Odessa region was attacked overnight, with an administrative building in the industrial sector damaged, according to an unnamed source. The Ukrainian publication 'Country' reported that the explosion occurred in the Belgorod-Dnestrovsky district. Russia's attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure began on October 10, 2022, two days after the Crimean Bridge attack, which Russia blames on Ukrainian special services. The attacks target energy, defense industry, military management, and communication facilities across the country. Since then, air raid alerts have been issued daily in Ukrainian regions, sometimes nationwide. Russia's presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, has stated that Russian forces do not target residential buildings and social infrastructure in battles with the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

**Crimea 'Attacked' by ATACMS, Russian Ministry of Defense Claims**
On June 23, explosions were heard in occupied Crimea. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, Crimea was allegedly attacked by ATACMS, with four missiles shot down and one exploding over the city. The head of the occupied Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, reported three deaths and 100 injured people. The Ukrainian side has not commented on this rocket attack. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty cannot verify this information from independent sources due to the occupation of Crimea by Russian forces. Since August 2022, explosions have been heard almost daily in Crimea and Sevastopol, with the Russian authorities attributing them to shooting at Ukrainian drones, air defense operations, or Russian military training. Sergei Aksyonov has referred to drones as the main threat to Crimea. There have been several explosions on the Crimean (Kerch) Bridge, including one in October 2022 and another on July 17, 2023. The island is under a heightened (yellow) terrorist threat level, and Simferopol Airport is closed.

**Crimea Under Attack: Powerful Explosions Rock Sevastopol and Balaklava**
On June 23, 2024, Crimea was subjected to a massive attack, with loud explosions reported in Sevastopol and Balaklava. Telegram channels of the occupying forces reported that the Russian air defense system was working on the peninsula. According to 24 Channel, here's what is known about the rocket attack on Crimea. The enemy attacked Kyivshchyna with 'Calibers', causing damage and casualties. Strong explosions were heard in the Saki, Yevpatoria, Inkerman, and Bakhchysarai areas, where the enemy's air defense system was reportedly active. In the Kozachya Bay area, where the 810th Marine Brigade is based, a detonation was heard. In the Sevastopol Bay area, it is believed that a missile landed, with smoke seen over the bay and the northern part of the city, near the beaches of Uchkuivka and Tolstya. The Crimean Bridge was also closed. There were reports of people injured by debris caused by the Russian air defense system. Telegram channels reported that Russia shot down a missile near the Uchkuivka beach, with a significant portion of the debris falling into the sea and one piece hitting the beach near people. It is believed that Russia shot down one of the missiles just above the center of Sevastopol. As a result of the Russian air defense system's work, people were injured. After the first hour of the day, aircraft were seen taking off from Belbek in anticipation of a new attack. Earlier, Russian Telegram channels had warned that Crimea could be attacked again. Indeed, at 13:20, the Crimean Bridge was closed again, but only for a few minutes. The occupying authorities acknowledged that the air defense system was working in Sevastopol and even reported on the injured, stating that five aerial targets were destroyed over the water, but debris fell in the coastal zone. Initially, it was reported that 12 people were injured, including two children, in the Uchkuivka area, and two people with shrapnel injuries in the Lyubimivka area. A residential building and a pensioner's territory were also affected. Later, it was reported that there were 22 injured, including a child. An ambulance arrived at the Uchkuivka beach, including military vehicles. In enemy publications, there is outrage that Crimea was not given timely warning. Some users wrote that the siren in Sevastopol only sounded after the first explosion. In a local aquarium, children were not allowed to go to the underground toilet, allegedly because it was a training exercise, and the shelter was further away, run away there. Russians complained that the explosions were so strong that they almost blew out the windows. In the Molochna Balka area, the ground trembled and it was very loud (after the siren was sounded in the military unit).

**Crimean Bridge No Longer of Military Significance, Says Ukrainian Navy Speaker**
The speaker of the Ukrainian Navy, Dmitry Pletenchuk, stated that the Crimean Bridge is no longer of military significance since it is almost not used. According to him, destroying the bridge would not have the same effect now. 'Because for military logistics, it almost doesn't carry the load. Less than a quarter of the total load is carried by this bridge. The rest is transported by a ferry crossing, which was recently attacked. Therefore, this bridge no longer has any tactical-strategic significance after the damage it received as a result of the joint operation by the SBU and the Navy with a drone attack,' Pletenchuk explained (cited by 'Country.ua'). The Crimean Bridge was damaged for the first time on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded, killing five people and destroying several sections of the road. The Russian investigation attributes the crime to the head of the SBU, Vasiliy Maluk. The bridge was damaged for the second time on July 17, 2023, by an Ukrainian drone. In November 2023, he said that the SBU is preparing many 'surprises' on how to destroy the bridge. Dmitry Pletenchuk assured that the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed 'when needed'.

**State Duma Responds to Ukraine's Words on Crimean Bridge's Military Significance**
The State Duma responded to Ukraine's words about the military significance of the Crimean Bridge. Ukrainian special services and the Ukrainian Armed Forces have changed their rhetoric, realizing that all attempts to harm the Crimean Bridge have failed, said Alexei Zhuravlev, the first deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Defense. The Crimean Bridge is a civilian object, and Ukraine cannot do anything to it, but if it says so directly, the West will be dissatisfied and stop providing money. Russia has repeatedly stated that the Crimean Bridge is a civilian object. The head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Vasiliy Malyuk, called the Crimean Bridge a priority target and threatened new surprises. On the Victory Day parade in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia will not allow anyone to threaten it, and its strategic forces are always ready. The Russian Foreign Ministry sees all the reasons to launch a process to recognize the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Security Service of Ukraine, and the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine as terrorist organizations. The Russian side has evidence that Ukrainian special services organized terrorist attacks, including on the Crimean Bridge. There is also evidence that the Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked hospitals, kindergartens, and shot people. The first attack on the Crimean Bridge occurred on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded on the road section of the bridge, causing a fire and partial collapse of the bridge. Four people died. The second attack occurred on July 17, 2023, when two unmanned aerial vehicles attacked the bridge. A family from the Belgorod region was killed, and their 14-year-old daughter was injured. The bridge's road section was damaged. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the attack a terrorist act and a senseless crime, and said that the bridge is no longer used for military cargo transportation.

Zhuravlev noted that Ukraine cannot do anything with the Crimean Bridge, but if they say so directly, the West will be dissatisfied and stop providing financial aid. Therefore, Ukraine is spreading a smokescreen, saying that the bridge has no military or political significance. Russia has repeatedly stated that the Crimean Bridge is a purely civilian object. On July 17, 2023, Ukrainian authorities attacked the Crimean Bridge with two unmanned aerial vehicles. The SBU acknowledged responsibility for the attack in a Telegram message. On October 8, 2022, a truck explosion occurred on the Crimean Bridge, causing damage to the road section and the death of a girl's parents. The bridge was fully restored and reopened to traffic on October 14. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the incident a terrorist act, which, according to Russian authorities, was carried out by Ukrainian special services.

**Ukraine's Attacks on Crimean Bridge Have Reduced Its Strategic Importance, Says Military**
Ukrainian military authorities have acknowledged that attacks on the Crimean Bridge in recent years have reduced its tactical and strategic importance and have prompted Russia to seek alternative routes for military supply transportation. According to Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dimitro Pletenchuk, a hypothetical new attack on the bridge would not have the same effect as previous attacks, which caused significant damage and disrupted Russian military logistics during the war. Pletenchuk stated that the bridge now carries less than a quarter of the total cargo and that most supplies are transported by ferry, which was also recently attacked. Russian troops stationed in southern Ukraine are partially supplied from Rostov, in southwestern Russia, but the main route remains by sea from Crimea. Pletenchuk also mentioned the construction of a railway by Russia in southern Ukraine, which is intended to support the occupying forces in the region. Ukraine has launched several attacks on the Crimean Bridge, causing significant damage on two occasions in October 2022 and July 2023. The bridge was inaugurated in 2018 by Russian President Vladimir Putin and is considered a symbol of Russian dominance over the peninsula.

**Ukraine's Plans to Attack Crimean Bridge Unlikely to Succeed, Says Russian Official**
According to Alexey Zhuravlev, a deputy chairman of the State Duma's Defense Committee, it will be difficult for the Ukrainian Armed Forces and special services to attack the Crimean Bridge. Zhuravlev stated that Ukraine's attempts to destroy the bridge will be unsuccessful, as Russia has almost stopped using it for military purposes. He also mentioned that Ukraine's representative, Dmitry Pletenkov, stated that Ukraine has no reason to destroy the bridge, as Russia has shifted its military activities to the Kerch Strait ferry crossing. The ferry crossing has seven ships, including two railway and five automobile ferries. The Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked the crossing with American ATACMS missiles in late May, damaging the automobile and railway ferries. The crossing was out of service for three days before it was restored. Pletenkov spoke about the incident in the past tense.

**Crimean Bridge: Ukraine's Most Successful Operation Against Russia**
Eugene Dykyi, a veteran of the Russian-Ukrainian war, told 24 Channel that the attacks on Crimea can be considered the most successful strategic operation of Ukraine, which has been ongoing for over a month. The enemy has not adapted to these attacks. The operation involves all branches of the military, with the Main Intelligence Directorate playing the leading role. This is a big operation, and it's fully justified. We're opening up the sky, and as a lure, we're using the Crimean Bridge. Note that we're not hitting the bridge itself, but the enemy is so attached to it that they're trying to cover it with powerful air defense systems. We're not touching the bridge, but we're destroying the air defense systems, said Dykyi. The occupiers are forced to use air defense systems from different parts of Russia. There was information as early as 2023 that the invaders brought air defense systems from the Arctic and the Far East. The situation is very interesting, as it turns out that the occupiers can only cover the front line, Moscow, and the Crimean Bridge. Therefore, Russia lacks surface-to-air missile systems to cover airfields with strategic bombers, oil refineries, and other military objects. This strategic operation has two components: the relocation of air defense systems in Crimea and deep, long-range strikes on the occupiers' airfields and oil refineries. This is currently the most successful thing we've done in the last year, emphasized Dykyi. These strikes can also be considered a certain preparation for the appearance of F-16 fighters in Ukraine. It will be much easier to work on Russian aircraft if the occupiers do not have an echeloned air defense system. Ukraine regularly destroys military objects and equipment of the occupiers in Crimea. For example, on the night of June 12, it was possible to destroy two S-300 complexes and hit S-400. It is known that Ukraine has found an alternative to Starlink systems for strikes on Crimea. Negotiations are currently underway. Previously, media published satellite images of the strike on the S-400 air defense system in Crimea.

**Sievastopol Governor Reports Rocket Attack from Ukraine**
Sievastopol Governor Mikhail Razvozhayev reported that the city was hit by a rocket attack from Ukraine on the night of June 12.

No one has been injured. The type of destroyed rockets is being established. No unexploded ordnance has been found so far,' Razvozhayev wrote in his Telegram channel. He added that emergency services in the city are receiving reports of shrapnel falling in the Kombrig Potapov Street area and the Yukharina Gorge area. Since Russian troops were deployed to Ukraine in February 2022, Crimea has been regularly shelled by Ukrainian forces. Attempts are made to attack the Crimean Bridge, mainly with drones and unmanned boats. The Russian Ministry of Defense regularly reports on the destruction of drones over the territory of the peninsula.

**Occupants Install Anti-Diversional Barriers at Crimean Bridge**
The monitoring group Krymsky Vetter reports that Russian occupiers have installed 11 sections of anti-diversional barriers at the Crimean Bridge, citing satellite imagery. This is an increase from the 8 sections reported by the British intelligence in late May. The Crimean Bridge was previously attacked by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) on October 8, 2022, and again on July 17, 2023. The Russian authorities have acknowledged that one section of the bridge is irreparable. The Ukrainian military has stated that they will continue to target Russian-controlled objects in Crimea, including the Crimean Bridge, and has warned against using the bridge. The head of the SBU, Vasiliy Malyuk, has stated that Ukraine has the potential to completely destroy the bridge, but that timing is everything.

**Russia Resumes Fuel Transportation Through Crimean Bridge**
Russia has resumed transporting fuel through the Crimean Bridge, according to ISW. The move comes after Ukrainian forces attacked Russian ships in the Kerch Strait on May 30, forcing Russia to restart fuel transportation through the bridge. The Russian military had previously stopped using the bridge in March 2024 due to the threat of Ukrainian strikes. The Institute for the Study of War notes that while the move may ease some logistical constraints, it would make the bridge more vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks, especially if Russia's air defense systems in Crimea are reduced. 'This would likely ease some logistical constraints, as Russia is trying to compensate for the loss of ferries across the strait, but would make the bridge across the Kerch Strait even more vulnerable to Ukrainian strikes, especially if Russian air defense systems in Crimea are reduced,' the Institute said.

**Crimean Bridge Closed for 46 Minutes Due to Threat of Rocket Attack**
The movement of vehicles across the Crimean Bridge was restricted for 46 minutes on the night of June 10. According to the Telegram channel of the transportation crossing service, the traffic was limited at 01:10 MSK. The cause of the incident is not specified, but it is likely related to a threat of rocket attack. Those present on the bridge and in the inspection zone were advised to remain calm and follow the instructions of transportation security personnel. The traffic was resumed at 01:56 MSK. This is the second time the Crimean Bridge has been closed in recent weeks, following a massive attack by Ukrainian forces on May 29, which was reported by EADaily. According to Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belyanov, the attack involved ten operational-tactical ATACMS rockets.

**Russia Deploys Barges to Protect Crimean Bridge from Ukrainian Drones**
According to a report by the British Ministry of Defence, Russia has placed barges near the Crimean Bridge to protect it from Ukrainian drones. The report states that the installation of the barges began on May 10 and was completed on May 22. The British Defence Ministry claims that the Russian military placed the barges in an attempt to protect the bridge and the waterway, reducing the angles of approach for Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles. The report also mentions that previous barriers were damaged by storms, reducing their effectiveness. The Crimean Bridge was previously attacked by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) on October 8, 2022, causing damage to the automobile and railway sections. The Russian government accused the head of the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate, Kirill Budanov, of organizing the attack, but the Ukrainian authorities denied the allegations. The report also mentions that the SBU attacked the Crimean Bridge again on July 17, 2023, using Sea Baby drones. The Russian vice-premier, Marat Husnul-lin, acknowledged that one section of the bridge is beyond repair. The report concludes that the Crimean Bridge will likely be destroyed by the end of the year, according to the Ukrainian Navy's commander, Vice-Admiral Alexei Neizhpapa. Kirill Budanov hinted that Ukraine will continue to target Russian objects in occupied Crimea and advised not to use the bridge.

**Russia Deploys Barges to Protect Crimean Bridge from Ukrainian Attacks**
The Russian occupation forces are trying to protect the Crimean Bridge from Ukrainian attacks by placing barges along the bridge. However, according to Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmitry Pletençuk, this will not be effective in defending against Ukrainian attacks. He stated that the barges are primarily designed to protect against aerial drones and that the recent case of a tugboat being damaged by such a drone shows that these barriers are overestimated by the enemy. Pletençuk believes that the Russians are trying to narrow the passage and location where they expect attacks on the Crimean Bridge. He also mentioned that these barriers could be used against missile guidance systems. The British Ministry of Defense has reported that Russia has been installing eight barges on the southern part of the Crimean Bridge since May 10, 2024, in an attempt to protect the bridge and the waterway. Ukraine is preparing to attack the Crimean Bridge, according to German Bild journalists. The attack on the Russian ferries 'Avangard' and 'Konro Trader' may indicate preparation for an operation on the bridge. Ukraine needs 200 rockets to destroy the Crimean Bridge, according to Colonel Petr Chernik. He believes that a combined attack is necessary, using 70-80 ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles in a mixed cycle.

**Russia Deploys Barges to Protect Crimean Bridge**
The British military intelligence has reported that Russia has deployed eight barges on the southern side of the Crimean Bridge from May 10 to 22, 2024. According to the report, Russia is trying to use the barges to protect the bridge and navigation channel and reduce the angle of approach for Ukrainian drones. The British Ministry of Defence believes that Russia wants to use the barges to defend the bridge and navigation channel and reduce the effectiveness of Ukrainian drone attacks. The Crimean Bridge plays a crucial role in supplying Russian forces, and after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Western observers and military experts have highlighted its importance. However, Ukrainian OSINT agency Molfar has reported that Russia has stopped using the Crimean Bridge for military supplies since February to April 2024, and only one fuel tanker train passed through the bridge in February 2024. The agency believes that satellite images confirm that Russia is not transporting military cargo through the bridge's railway section, making it unnecessary to attack the bridge now. Meanwhile, Russia is building alternative railway routes on occupied Ukrainian territories to connect the annexed Crimea with Russian territory.

**Russia Deploys Eight Barges to Protect Crimean Bridge, Says British Intelligence**
The Russian military is trying to protect the Crimean Bridge and has deployed eight barges to the area, according to the British Ministry of Defence. Satellite imagery analysis revealed eight barges on the southern side of the Crimean Bridge. The construction began on May 10, 2024, and was completed on May 22, 2024. The barges were placed by Russian forces to protect the bridge and the navigable channel, reducing the approach angles for Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles. The previously established structures were damaged by storms, reducing their effectiveness. The Ukrainian army is reportedly preparing to strike the Kerch Strait Bridge, as evidenced by recent attacks on Russian ferries 'Avangard' and 'Konro Trader'. Meanwhile, the 'Atesh' movement, which calls itself a partisan group, claims that Russian forces are strengthening the protection of the Kerch Strait Bridge, bringing in additional air defense systems. Since August 2022, explosions have been heard almost daily in Crimea and Sevastopol. The Russian authorities explain these explosions as shooting at 'Ukrainian drones', 'air defense operations', or military training. Sergei Aksyonov called drones 'the main threat' to Crimea. A blast occurred on the Crimean (Kerch) Bridge in October 2022, and another on July 17, 2023. The island is under a heightened (yellow) terrorist threat level, and Simferopol Airport is closed.

**Putin Orders Black Sea Fleet to Withdraw Amid Ukraine's Intensified Attacks**
Since Russia occupied Crimea, Ukrainians have been determined to drive the Russians out of the peninsula. Over the past year, Ukraine has increased its attacks on Russian occupiers, using both domestically produced and Western weapons. The French Mirage jets have been the latest addition to Ukraine's air force. The Black Sea Fleet has been significantly weakened, with a high percentage of its ships being taken out, and there are frequent reports of new battles or sinkings of vessels. As a result, Vladimir Putin has ordered the Black Sea Fleet to withdraw to safer harbors to avoid further losses. The fleet has been reduced by at least a third since the war began in February 2022. One of Ukraine's main goals is to destroy the land connection between Crimea and the Russian mainland. In October 2022, the bridge was subjected to massive sabotage after a truck loaded with explosives detonated on the bridge and caused significant damage. Over the past year, Ukraine has attacked the bridge with naval drones. To stop the Ukrainian attacks and protect the bridge, Russia's president has ordered the construction of a fake bridge. The fake bridge will make it almost impossible to destroy the real bridge, which is crucial for logistics and transportation of Russian troops to the front line. The fake bridge is described as 'top-secret' and is intended to deceive Ukrainian naval drones. The goal is to confuse the drones' radar system. According to a Ukrainian military spokesperson, Dmitriy Pletensyuk, 'Russia has started building a fake bridge, made of buoys, to try to fool out the Ukrainian missiles. It's mainly aimed at missiles. The buoys are laid, so missiles have to hit these first, and thus confuse the radar system. Thus, the buoys are hit instead of the bridge.' The construction of the fake bridge began in mid-May. Nine buoys will now be placed alongside the Kerch Strait bridge, according to satellite images. Russia has previously sunk several large vessels along the Kerch Strait bridge to build an underwater barrier against Ukrainian naval drones, but despite this, some drones have still reached their targets.

The Ukrainian military is reportedly preparing to launch a new attack on the Crimean Bridge, according to Bild. The head of the Center for Strategic Communications of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, Dmytro Pletenчук, stated that the bridge is a crucial point for Russian military logistics and that there are no alternative routes for Russia to use. He also mentioned that the construction of an underwater tunnel from Russia to Crimea would be a good opportunity to start building, as it would be a safer way for Russia to reach Crimea. When asked if it's a good moment for an attack on the bridge, Pletenчук replied that it's known only to a limited circle of people and that such structures are complex and difficult to hit.

**Ukraine May Be Preparing to Attack the Crimean Bridge Again**
Ukraine may be preparing to attack the Crimean Bridge, as it has destroyed an alternative route for Russia in case the main bridge is destroyed. Ukrainian forces may be preparing to strike the Crimean Bridge again, according to experts and military analysts. In the past, Ukraine has successfully attacked the bridge twice, first in October 2022 and again in July 2023. The attacks have caused significant damage to the bridge, which has been temporarily repaired but not fully restored. The Ukrainian military has used Western weapons, including ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles, in the attacks. The Russian air defense system in Crimea has failed to intercept the missiles. The attacks have made the Crimean Bridge a critical target for Ukraine, as it is the only remaining route for Russia to supply the peninsula. The Ukrainian military is considering using a new tactic to attack the bridge, as the previous methods have been successful. The exact timing and method of the next attack are unknown.

**Russia Intensifies Aerial Defense of Crimean Bridge**
Russia is using a variety of aircraft, including old transport planes An-26 and anti-submarine aircraft Be-12, to protect the Crimean Bridge. According to Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmitry Pletenчук, Russia is intensifying its aerial component to defend the bridge due to the lack of naval-landing craft in the Kerch Strait. Pletenчук stated that Russia has a significant amount of aircraft in the air 24/7, including Su-24 and Su-35 fighter jets, as well as MiG and Ka-27 helicopters. He also mentioned that Russia is using old aircraft that were supposed to be retired, such as An-26 and Be-12. The Ukrainian military has previously targeted the Crimean Bridge twice, causing partial damage to the roadways. The bridge was repaired, but Ukraine struck it again in July 2023 using naval drones.

Military expert Dmitry Snegiriov notes that as long as Russia's air defense systems and anti-aircraft missiles remain intact, it makes no sense to attack the bridge, as they can destroy Ukrainian rockets and drones.

**Why Ukraine Hasn't Destroyed the Crimean Bridge: Explanation from a Military Expert**
Ukrainian military expert, Dmitro Snegirov, explained why Ukrainian forces have not yet destroyed the Crimean Bridge, despite previous attacks. According to Snegirov, it makes no sense to attack the bridge as long as Russia's air defense systems can destroy Ukrainian rockets and drones. He emphasized that Ukraine's military is focusing on destroying Russia's air defense systems and anti-aircraft missile systems in Crimea, and only after that will they target the Crimean Bridge. Snegirov noted that Ukraine has already damaged the bridge twice, once in October 2022 and again in July 2023, but the bridge is still operational.
