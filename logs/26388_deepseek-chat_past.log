To forecast whether an athlete will win more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I do not have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this event. However, I can analyze historical data and current trends to make an informed estimate.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Base Rates**: How often has an athlete won multiple medals in tennis at the Olympics?
2. **Current Athlete Performance**: Which athletes are likely to compete in multiple events (singles, doubles, mixed doubles) and have a high chance of winning medals?
3. **Tournament Structure**: How does the structure of the Olympic tennis tournament influence the likelihood of multiple medals?

### Step 3: Historical Base Rates
Historically, winning multiple medals in tennis at the Olympics is rare but not unprecedented. For example:
- **Serena and Venus Williams** have won multiple medals in doubles and singles.
- **Andy Murray** won gold in singles and silver in mixed doubles in 2012.
- **Rafael Nadal** won gold in singles and doubles in 2008.

However, these instances are exceptions rather than the rule. The base rate for an athlete winning multiple medals in a single Olympics is low, likely below 10%.

### Step 4: Current Athlete Performance
Key athletes who could compete in multiple events and have a high chance of winning medals include:
- **Carlos Alcaraz**: Competing in singles and potentially doubles.
- **Novak Djokovic**: Competing in singles and potentially doubles.
- **Rafael Nadal**: Competing in singles and doubles.
- **Iga Swiatek**: Competing in singles and potentially doubles.
- **Coco Gauff**: Competing in singles and potentially doubles.

These athletes are top-ranked and have the skill to perform well in multiple events.

### Step 5: Tournament Structure
The Olympic tennis tournament includes singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. Athletes who excel in multiple formats have a higher chance of winning multiple medals. However, the competition is fierce, and the physical and mental demands of competing in multiple events can be a limiting factor.

### Step 6: Adjusting for Current Trends
The 2024 Olympics will be held on clay courts at Roland Garros, which favors players with strong clay-court skills, such as Nadal and Alcaraz. This could increase the likelihood of these athletes performing well in multiple events.

### Step 7: Balancing Evidence
While the base rate for multiple medals is low, the presence of top-tier athletes who are likely to compete in multiple events and have strong clay-court skills increases the probability. However, the physical and mental demands of the Olympics, combined with the high level of competition, temper this increase.

### Step 8: Final Forecast
Considering the historical base rates, current athlete performance, and tournament structure, I estimate that the probability of an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics is:

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.**

To forecast whether an athlete will win more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and the unique context of the event.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
Historically, winning multiple medals in tennis at the Olympics is rare. Tennis has five medal events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Since 1988, when tennis was reintroduced to the Olympics, only a few athletes have won multiple medals in a single Games. Notable examples include:
- **Venus Williams** (2000): Gold in singles and doubles.
- **Serena Williams** (2012): Gold in singles and doubles.
- **Andy Murray** (2012 and 2016): Gold in singles and silver in mixed doubles (2012).
- **Rafael Nadal** (2008): Gold in singles and doubles.

These instances suggest that winning multiple medals is possible but uncommon, occurring in roughly 10-15% of Olympic tennis competitions.

### Step 2: Current Context and Trends
The 2024 Paris Olympics will feature a strong field, including top players like Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek, and Coco Gauff. Key factors to consider:
1. **Doubles Participation**: Many top singles players also compete in doubles, increasing the likelihood of multiple medals. For example:
   - **Rafael Nadal** is partnering with **Carlos Alcaraz** in doubles.
   - **Novak Djokovic** may compete in both singles and doubles.
   - **Coco Gauff** and **Iga Swiatek** could participate in singles and doubles.

2. **Clay Courts**: The tournament will be played on clay at Roland Garros, favoring players with strong clay-court skills, such as Nadal and Alcaraz. This could enhance their chances in both singles and doubles.

3. **Injuries and Fatigue**: The Olympics occur shortly after Wimbledon, which may lead to fatigue or injuries for some players, potentially reducing their chances of competing in multiple events.

4. **Mixed Doubles**: The mixed doubles event adds another opportunity for players to win a second medal, especially for those already competing in singles or doubles.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Given historical patterns, the base rate for multiple medals is around 10-15%. However, the current field includes several players with strong doubles credentials, which could increase the likelihood.
- **Current Trends**: The participation of top players in multiple events and the clay-court advantage for certain players suggest a higher probability than the base rate.
- **Risks**: Fatigue, injuries, and the unpredictable nature of doubles play could lower the probability.

### Step 4: Final Forecast
After balancing the evidence, I estimate that the probability of an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics is higher than the historical base rate but still constrained by the challenges of competing in multiple events.

To forecast whether an athlete will win more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and the unique context of the event.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
Historically, winning multiple medals in tennis at the Olympics is rare. Tennis has five medal events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Since 1988, when tennis was reintroduced to the Olympics, only a few athletes have won multiple medals in a single Games. Notable examples include:
- **Venus Williams** (2000): Gold in singles and doubles.
- **Serena Williams** (2012): Gold in singles and doubles.
- **Andy Murray** (2012 and 2016): Gold in singles and silver in mixed doubles (2012).
- **Rafael Nadal** (2008): Gold in singles and doubles.

These instances suggest that winning multiple medals is possible but uncommon, occurring in roughly 10-15% of Olympic tennis competitions.

### Step 2: Current Context and Trends
The 2024 Paris Olympics will feature a strong field, including top players like Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek, and Coco Gauff. Key factors to consider:
1. **Doubles Participation**: Many top singles players also compete in doubles, increasing the likelihood of multiple medals. For example:
   - **Rafael Nadal** is partnering with **Carlos Alcaraz** in doubles.
   - **Novak Djokovic** may compete in both singles and doubles.
   - **Coco Gauff** and **Iga Swiatek** could participate in singles and doubles.

2. **Clay Courts**: The tournament will be played on clay at Roland Garros, favoring players with strong clay-court skills, such as Nadal and Alcaraz. This could enhance their chances in both singles and doubles.

3. **Injuries and Fatigue**: The Olympics occur shortly after Wimbledon, which may lead to fatigue or injuries for some players, potentially reducing their chances of competing in multiple events.

4. **Mixed Doubles**: The mixed doubles event adds another opportunity for players to win a second medal, especially for those already competing in singles or doubles.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Given historical patterns, the base rate for multiple medals is around 10-15%. However, the current field includes several players with strong doubles credentials, which could increase the likelihood.
- **Current Trends**: The participation of top players in multiple events and the clay-court advantage for certain players suggest a higher probability than the base rate.
- **Risks**: Fatigue, injuries, and the unpredictable nature of doubles play could lower the probability.

### Step 4: Final Forecast
After balancing the evidence, I estimate that the probability of an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics is higher than the historical base rate but still constrained by the challenges of competing in multiple events.
