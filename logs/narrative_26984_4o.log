*The room buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER 1 and SUPERFORECASTER 2 sit at a table, papers scattered around them.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back)  
So, did it happen? 

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(shakes head)  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 7.85%. With the recent trends, it seemed plausible, but the escalation didn't peak as some feared.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(nods)  
The rhetoric was intense after Lai's inauguration. But 40 in a day? That's a big leap. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
True. Even with the uptick post-inauguration, the numbers didn't support a single-day spike like that. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leans forward)  
It’s a delicate dance. Let's see how the next few months unfold. 

*They both look at the spreadsheet, contemplating future probabilities.*

The room is filled with muted tension. A group of superforecasters huddle around a table, papers and laptops scattered.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning forward)  
So, the question stands: Did more than 40 Chinese aircraft violate Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the recent trends and increased military drills post-inauguration, it seemed plausible.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(nodding)  
True, but the escalation didn’t hit that peak. The average was rising, but not enough for a single-day spike.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(looking at the spreadsheet)  
The data confirms it. No breach of 40. The intimidation tactic remains just that—intimidation.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(sighing)  
A close call, but our models were spot on. The probabilities spoke the truth.

The group exchanges relieved glances, their confidence in their models reaffirmed.
