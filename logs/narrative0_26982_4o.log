*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered, a tense air between them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did more than 20 Chinese aircraft violate Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day during the past month?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 45.23%. The escalation was significant, but not quite enough to reach that threshold.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. The trends have been concerning, especially with the post-inauguration spike.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The average violations rose, but the probability of a single day exceeding 20 remained under 50%. It seems China's tactics, while aggressive, were calculated to avoid crossing that line.

**NATE SILVER:** A delicate balance, then. Let's see how this influences future forecasts.

*They exchange knowing glances, the weight of geopolitical tensions lingering in the air.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the big question: Did more than 20 Chinese aircraft enter Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day during our forecast period?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 75.32%. Given the post-inauguration escalation and the recent trends, this outcome was highly probable.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The increase in daily violations since President Lai's inauguration was a significant factor. The historical context and China's military posturing made this a likely scenario.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The geopolitical tension and China's rhetoric were clear indicators. Our models are designed to capture these nuances accurately.

**NATE SILVER**  
And they did just that. Always fascinating to see our forecasts align with reality.

No, our models had it at 38.75%. Despite increased military activity post-inauguration, crossing that threshold was unlikely.

Right. Although the daily average rose, breaching 20 in a day would require a significant escalation.
