The Spanish government has approved a 2% salary increase for over 3 million public employees, effective immediately, with retroactive effects from January 1. The increase will be followed by an additional 0.5% based on the inflation rate approved in January 2025, but referring to the 2024 exercise. According to Vice President and Minister of Finance, María Jesús Montero, the government is committed to maintaining its commitment to public employees, who are the main asset of administrations. The total revaluation of public employees' salaries during the 2022-2024 period will reach 9.8%.

**Spain's Air Quality Improves, but Still Falls Short of EU Limits**
Spain's air quality has improved, but still falls short of new EU limits. According to Ecologistas en Acción, 32.6 million people in Spain breathed in more pollution than allowed by the EU in 2023. The new EU limits for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 will come into effect in 2030. Despite the improvement, many areas still exceed legal limits, with 2.9 million people breathing in polluted air. The main source of pollution is traffic, and ozone is also a significant problem. Ecologistas en Acción calls for more action to reduce traffic and implement measures to eliminate structural pollution. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us,' says Miguel Ángel Ceballos, coordinator of the report.

**Spain to Surpass 90 Million International Tourists in 2024**
Spain is expected to surpass 90 million international tourists in 2024, according to a report by CaixaBank Research. The report predicts a 5% increase in real GDP, driven by international tourism, which is expected to grow by 5.5%. The growth is attributed to the recovery of the purchasing power of European households, the economic recovery in Europe, and the perception of safety in Spain. However, the report also warns of a slowdown in the sector due to factors such as the gradual recovery of competing destinations, the impact of the 2024 Paris Olympics, and a relatively weak domestic tourism growth (0.8%). The report highlights the need for sustainable tourism management, including measures to reduce negative externalities such as the impact on local housing markets, public services, and public spaces. Additionally, the sector must continue to invest in adaptation and decarbonization measures to address climate change.

**Spain to Exceed Deficit Target, Warns Bank of Spain**
The Bank of Spain has confirmed that the Spanish government will exceed the deficit target set by Brussels for the next three years. According to the bank's new quarterly projections, the deficit will reach 3.3% of GDP in 2024, 3.1% in 2025, and 3.2% in 2026, exceeding the government's target of 3% and leading to further sanctions. The bank's analysts attribute the deficit to the government's excessive spending and record income, which increased by 6.2% in the first quarter of 2024 due to higher tax bases and the gradual withdrawal of pandemic-related support measures. The bank also warns that the government has not implemented a sustainable budget adjustment path compatible with the new European fiscal framework, which will take effect in 2025. The bank's projections also show a rising debt trend, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 105.8% in 2024, 106.2% in 2025, and 107.2% in 2026, failing to meet the European Commission's target of 60% of GDP. The bank also expects a slower labor market growth, which will prevent the unemployment rate from falling below 11% by 2026, and a widening gap in employment growth between large and small businesses.

**Spain to Surpass 25,000 Short-Term Rental Beds by 2027**
According to the report 'Estado y tendencias del flex living' by Atlas Real Estate, Spain will increase its short-term rental offer by two times and exceed 25,000 beds by 2027. Currently, there are 11,885 operational beds in various formats, including coliving, smart living, and corporate living. The report predicts that by 2027, there will be 26,776 units in 302 buildings. The government is considering regulating the short-term rental market, which has been a topic of debate. The majority of new developments are expected to be concentrated in Madrid, with 71.5% of the total, followed by Valencia and Málaga. The report highlights the trend of new projects being announced in peripheral areas of major cities, with a focus on corporate demand and local population. The study also notes that the lack of housing in metropolitan areas and the difficulty of accessing affordable rentals under the Urban Rental Law (LAU) are making short-term rentals a solution for local residents, such as young people, couples, and those who need temporary housing.

**Spain Proposes Record-Breaking Public Employment Offer for 2024**
The Spanish government has proposed a record-breaking public employment offer for 2024, exceeding 40,000 positions. The offer includes 21,000 open positions, 10,600 internal promotions, and 8,500 jobs for the Security Forces and Corps. The total number includes 3,000 vacant positions from the past two years that will be re-offered. The final figure will be confirmed when the Council of Ministers approves the Public Employment Offer for 2024, expected to happen in June. The government guarantees that the new offer will create net employment, meaning the number of offered positions will be higher than the vacancies caused by retiring officials. The government and unions have been negotiating the proposal, but the unions have not endorsed it. Only UGT has expressed satisfaction with the proposal, while CSIF rejects it as insufficient and Comisiones Obreras regrets that the number of administrative staff is not increasing.

**Spain's Social Security Registers 567,000 New Affiliates in First Half of the Year**
The Spanish Social Security system has registered around 567,000 new affiliates in the first half of the year, according to data released by the Minister of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, Elma Saiz. The daily average of new affiliates has exceeded 21.4 million since June 10, reaching 21.46 million on June 17. Saiz emphasized that this is not a milestone to rest on, but rather a motivation to continue working towards full employment. She also highlighted the desestacionalized employment, which has been growing for 50 consecutive months. The minister stated that the labor market behavior is 'extraordinarily positive'. Although neither Saiz nor the Secretary of State for Social Security, Borja Suárez, made predictions for the end of the year, they estimated that the dynamics will remain very positive. Saiz also emphasized that job creation is the best guarantee for the pension system. The income from contributions increased by 10.3% in the year, allowing the minister to advance that the Pension Reserve Fund will exceed the target of 9,000 million euros by the end of the year.

**Articles of the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' May Disappear**
The articles written by academics and doctors of science for the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' (BRE) over the past five years may disappear on June 17. According to Olga, a BRE employee, 'The entire work of these five years, all the articles written by doctors of science, academics, it's all may disappear.' She also mentioned that the BRE editorial team (300 people) and the author collective (7,000 people) publish an equivalent of 18 printed volumes per year. However, the government refused to allocate funds for the portal's maintenance in the 2024 budget. Although the project was not stopped, the editorial team worked without pay for five months. Now, the team will stop working because they cannot pay for cloud servers. 'Putin founded us, we were a Putin project. Then some official somewhere didn't notice something, and we didn't get into the budget', said Olga. The BRE project was initially considered a high-quality alternative to Wikipedia, and around 1.7 billion rubles were allocated for its development. There are no official comments from the government or the Ministry of Digital Development on this situation yet.

**All Valencians Will Publish a Book**
The article discusses the proliferation of book publishing in recent years, with some critics arguing that there are too many books being published. The author argues that this is a natural consequence of the democratization of publishing, with the rise of self-publishing and the ease of digital communication. The article also mentions that the Valencia region has seen an increase in book publishing in 2023, with 3,557 titles published, compared to 3,491 in 2022. However, this increase is not unique to Valencia, as other regions in Spain have also seen a decline in book publishing. The article quotes several industry professionals, including Alberto Haller and Raquel Bada, who discuss the challenges of the publishing industry and the need to adapt to changing market conditions. The article concludes that the proliferation of book publishing is a natural response to the changing times, and that the industry must adapt to the new reality.
