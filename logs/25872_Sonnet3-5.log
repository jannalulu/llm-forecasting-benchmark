To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into steps and consider the relevant evidence:

1. Historical data:
From the articles, we don't have direct historical data on total goals scored in semi-finals. However, we can use some related information:

- In Euro 2024 so far, Spain has scored 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 goals/match)
- France has only scored 3 goals in 5 matches (0.6 goals/match)
- Netherlands has scored 9 goals (1.8 goals/match)
- England has scored 4 goals (0.8 goals/match)

2. Team form and trends:
- Spain has been the most impressive offensively, winning all their matches
- France has struggled to score but has a strong defense
- Netherlands and England have been inconsistent but have potential

3. Head-to-head matchups:
- Spain vs France historically tends to be close matches
- Netherlands vs England has seen goals in recent meetings

4. Tournament context:
- Semi-finals tend to be tighter, more cautious affairs
- However, with attacking talent on display, there's potential for goals

5. Other factors:
- No major injuries or suspensions reported for key attacking players
- Semi-finals are single-leg matches, which could lead to more open play if teams need goals

Weighing these factors:

Arguments for under 4 goals total:
- France's defensive solidity and low-scoring trend
- Semi-finals often being cautious affairs
- Historical tendency for close matches between Spain and France

Arguments for 4 or more goals total:
- Spain's high-scoring form
- Attacking talent across all four teams
- Potential for more open play in single-leg knockout matches
- Netherlands and England capable of scoring multiple goals

Balancing these factors, I lean towards a moderate probability of 4 or more goals being scored across both semi-finals. Spain's offensive prowess is a major factor, but France's defensive record and the potential for tight semi-final matches temper this somewhat.

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 55.50%, with 50.50% being the most likely. Probability: 50.50%.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Reference class: Looking at past European Championships, the semi-finals typically have lower scoring than group stage or earlier knockout matches due to the high stakes and stronger teams involved.

2. Current tournament trends: The articles mention that Spain has been the highest scoring team with 11 goals, while France has only scored 3 goals in the tournament. The Netherlands has scored 9 goals, and England 4 goals.

3. Recent form: Spain has won all their matches and scored freely. France has struggled to score but has a strong defense. The Netherlands and England have been less consistent but have potential match-winners.

4. Historical data: In the 2020 Euros, there were 3 goals scored across both semi-finals (2-1 and 1-1). In 2016, there were 3 goals (2-0 and 2-0). In 2012, there were 5 goals (4-0 and 2-1).

5. Team matchups: Spain vs France could be a high-scoring affair given Spain's attacking prowess, but France's defensive solidity might keep the score down. Netherlands vs England could go either way based on their inconsistent performances.

6. Tournament context: As we're in the semi-finals, teams may be more cautious, potentially leading to lower-scoring matches.

7. Balancing evidence: While Spain's high-scoring form suggests potential for goals, the defensive strength of France and the unpredictability of the other semi-final make it difficult to confidently predict 4 or more goals across both matches.

8. Adjusting for recency bias: While recent matches have been high-scoring, semi-finals historically tend to be tighter affairs.

Given these factors, I estimate that there's a moderate chance of seeing 4 or more goals across both semi-finals, but it's far from certain.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Reference class: Looking at past European Championships, we can establish a baseline. In Euro 2020, there were 3 goals scored across the two semi-finals. In Euro 2016, there were 5 goals. In Euro 2012, there were 5 goals. This suggests that 4 or more goals is common but not guaranteed.

2. Current tournament trends: The news articles indicate that Spain has been particularly high-scoring, with 11 goals so far. The Netherlands has 9 goals, while England has 4 and France only 3. This suggests a mix of high and low-scoring teams in the semi-finals.

3. Specific match-ups: Spain vs France and Netherlands vs England. Spain's high-scoring trend against France's strong defense (only 3 goals conceded) suggests a potentially lower-scoring game. The Netherlands vs England match could be higher-scoring based on their tournament performances.

4. Recent form: Spain has won all their matches, suggesting continued strong performance. France has struggled to score but has a strong defense. England and the Netherlands have been inconsistent but have potential for goals.

5. Historical matchups: The articles don't provide specific head-to-head statistics for these matchups in semi-finals, which limits our ability to use this information.

6. Tournament stage effect: Semi-finals are often tighter, more defensive affairs than earlier rounds. This could suppress the goal count.

7. Player factors: Key players like Mbappé for France and young talents like Yamal for Spain could potentially break games open, increasing the likelihood of goals.

8. Uncertainty factors: Injuries, suspensions, and tactical decisions not mentioned in the articles could significantly impact the goal-scoring potential.

Weighing these factors:
- The historical trend in recent Euros suggests a range around 3-5 goals total in the semi-finals.
- Spain's high-scoring form increases the likelihood of reaching 4+ goals.
- France's defensive strength and low-scoring trend could counteract this.
- The Netherlands-England match has potential for goals but also inconsistency.
- The semi-final stage tends to produce tighter matches.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a good chance of seeing 4 or more goals, but it's far from certain. I'll set a range that reflects this uncertainty while leaning slightly towards the possibility of 4+ goals due to Spain's form and the potential in the Netherlands-England match.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 65.00%, with 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

Thank you for restating the question. I'll carefully analyze the information and provide a forecast for whether 4 or more goals will be scored in the two semi-final games combined in the 2024 UEFA European Championship.

Key considerations:

1. Historical scoring patterns: 
- In recent Euro tournaments, semi-finals have tended to be lower-scoring affairs. 
- The 2020 Euros saw 5 goals across the two semi-finals (3-2, 1-1).
- The 2016 Euros had only 2 goals total in the semis (2-0, 0-0).

2. Teams involved:
- Spain has been the highest scoring team, with 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 per game).
- France has struggled offensively, scoring only 3 goals in 5 matches (0.6 per game).
- Netherlands has scored 9 goals in 5 matches (1.8 per game).
- England has scored 4 goals in 5 matches (0.8 per game).

3. Defensive strengths:
- France has kept 4 clean sheets in 5 matches, showing strong defensive capabilities.
- Spain has conceded goals in most matches despite their high-scoring offense.

4. Stage of tournament:
- Semi-finals tend to be more cautious affairs with teams prioritizing not conceding.
- However, the contrast between Spain's high-scoring approach and France's defensive style could lead to an open game.

5. Recent form:
- Spain has maintained consistent scoring throughout the tournament.
- France has advanced despite scoring difficulties, relying on their defense.
- Netherlands and England have shown mixed offensive performances.

6. Historical head-to-head:
- Spain and France have a history of close, competitive matches.
- Netherlands and England also tend to have tight contests.

Weighing these factors, I estimate there's a moderate chance of seeing 4 or more goals across the two semi-finals. Spain's offensive prowess provides the best chance for multiple goals, while France's defensive strength could limit scoring in their match. The Netherlands-England game could go either way based on their inconsistent offensive showings.

Given the tendency for caution in semi-finals and the defensive strength of some teams involved, I believe there's a slightly higher chance of seeing fewer than 4 goals. However, Spain's high-scoring form keeps the possibility of 4+ goals quite realistic.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the relevant evidence:

1. Historical scoring patterns in Euro semi-finals:
The articles don't provide specific data on past semi-final scoring, so we need to rely on the overall tournament trends mentioned.

2. Scoring trends in Euro 2024 so far:
- Spain has been the highest-scoring team with 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 goals per game).
- France has only scored 3 goals in 5 matches (0.6 goals per game).
- The Netherlands has scored 9 goals in their matches (1.8 goals per game).
- England has scored 4 goals in their matches (0.8 goals per game).

3. Defensive records:
- France has kept 4 clean sheets in 5 matches, suggesting a strong defense.
- Spain has conceded goals but their high-scoring offense may lead to more open games.

4. Semi-final matchups:
- Spain vs France
- Netherlands vs England

5. Recent form and expectations:
- Spain has won all their matches and looks to be in strong attacking form.
- France has struggled to score but has a solid defense.
- Netherlands and England have been less convincing but have potential match-winners.

Analysis:
The semi-finals feature the highest-scoring team (Spain) against the best defensive team (France), and two teams with moderate scoring records (Netherlands and England). This suggests we might see one higher-scoring game and one lower-scoring game.

Given Spain's attacking prowess (2.2 goals per game) and France's defensive strength (0.6 goals conceded per game), we might expect around 2-3 goals in their match.

The Netherlands-England match could be more open, with both teams having shown attacking potential but also vulnerabilities. We might expect 2-4 goals in this match.

Combining these expectations, we're looking at a range of roughly 4-7 goals across both semi-finals.

Factors that could increase the goal count:
- Spain continuing their high-scoring form
- France breaking out of their scoring slump
- An early goal in either match leading to a more open game

Factors that could decrease the goal count:
- France's strong defense containing Spain
- Cautious play due to the high stakes of semi-finals
- Fatigue affecting players' sharpness

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a good chance of seeing 4 or more goals across the two semi-finals, but it's far from certain.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a good chance of seeing 4 or more goals across the two semi-finals, but it's far from certain.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the relevant evidence:

1. Historical scoring patterns in Euro semi-finals:
The articles don't provide specific data on past semi-final scoring, so we need to rely on the overall tournament trends mentioned.

2. Scoring trends in Euro 2024 so far:
- Spain has been the highest-scoring team with 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 goals per game).
- France has only scored 3 goals in 5 matches (0.6 goals per game).
- The Netherlands has scored 9 goals in their matches (1.8 goals per game).
- England has scored 4 goals in their matches (0.8 goals per game).

3. Defensive records:
- France has kept 4 clean sheets in 5 matches, suggesting a strong defense.
- Spain has conceded goals but their high-scoring offense may lead to more open games.

4. Semi-final matchups:
- Spain vs France
- Netherlands vs England

5. Recent form and expectations:
- Spain has won all their matches and looks to be in strong attacking form.
- France has struggled to score but has a solid defense.
- Netherlands and England have been less convincing but have potential match-winners.

Analysis:
The semi-finals feature the highest-scoring team (Spain) against the best defensive team (France), and two teams with moderate scoring records (Netherlands and England). This suggests we might see one higher-scoring game and one lower-scoring game.

Given Spain's attacking prowess (2.2 goals per game) and France's defensive strength (0.6 goals conceded per game), we might expect around 2-3 goals in their match.

The Netherlands-England match could be more open, with both teams having shown attacking potential but also vulnerabilities. We might expect 2-4 goals in this match.

Combining these expectations, we're looking at a range of roughly 4-7 goals across both semi-finals.

Factors that could increase the goal count:
- Spain continuing their high-scoring form
- France breaking out of their scoring slump
- An early goal in either match leading to a more open game

Factors that could decrease the goal count:
- France's strong defense containing Spain
- Cautious play due to the high stakes of semi-finals
- Fatigue affecting players' sharpness

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a good chance of seeing 4 or more goals across the two semi-finals, but it's far from certain.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.
