**Diplomatic Efforts to Prevent War Between Iran and Israel**
Recent diplomatic efforts have attempted to prevent a full-scale war between Iran, Israel, and their allies. The negotiations, led by the US, Qatar, and Egypt, have been ongoing since August 15. The US has proposed a plan to help resolve the conflict, which includes a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and a significant prisoner exchange. However, Hamas has rejected the proposal, citing concerns about the presence of Israeli troops on the Gaza-Egypt border and the conditions for the release of its members from Israeli prisons. The US has also been working on a parallel plan, which includes a potential attack on Iran if negotiations fail. Meanwhile, France and the UK have been involved in separate diplomatic efforts, with the French foreign minister visiting Lebanon and the British foreign minister visiting Israel. The situation remains tense, with both sides waiting for the other to make a move. According to Israeli officials, the Iranian military has reduced its readiness for a potential attack, but the situation can change quickly. The next few days will be crucial in determining the outcome of the negotiations and the potential for a conflict.

**UK and France Call for Diplomatic Solution to Gaza Crisis**
The UK and France have called for a diplomatic solution to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and restore peace along the Israeli-Lebanese border. The two countries' foreign ministers, David Laming and Stéphane Séguin, visited Israel and the Palestinian territories together, aiming to urge an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and reduce tensions. The visit marked the first joint visit by the UK and France to Israel in over a decade. A joint statement released after the visit read: 'We, the French and British foreign ministers, share a common interest in the security of the State of Israel and stability in the region as a whole. As permanent members of the UN Security Council, we have a specific responsibility to support the current escalation and ensure a lasting peace for Israelis, Palestinians, and the region as a whole.' The statement emphasized the need to reduce tensions in the region, and urged Iran and its allies to retract their ongoing threats to launch a military attack against Israel. The ministers also stressed the importance of ending the cycle of revenge and retaliation, and reiterated their commitment to the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 on Lebanon. They expressed their full support for the current efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement and the release of hostages in Gaza, led by the US, Egypt, and Qatar. The statement concluded by emphasizing the need for all parties to fulfill their responsibilities, and for the urgent delivery and distribution of humanitarian aid without restrictions, as well as the protection of civilians. The ministers reaffirmed that only a two-state solution, in accordance with international law, can bring lasting peace to both Israelis and Palestinians. They strongly condemned the violence of settlers in the West Bank, which threatens both Israeli and Palestinian security and can jeopardize ongoing diplomatic efforts. The statement concluded by reaffirming the UK and France's commitment to supporting cooperation and normalization in the region, and urged all parties to take concrete steps to avoid war. 'We are ready to engage with them to achieve this goal,' the statement said.

**Israel-Hamas Conflict: Diplomatic Efforts for a Truce Amid Escalating Tensions**
British and French foreign ministers visited Israel on August 16 to call for a de-escalation in the region, as Hezbollah and Iran threatened to retaliate after the assassination of the Hamas leader and the Hezbollah military chief. Meanwhile, negotiations for a truce in Gaza continued in Cairo. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz stated that he expects his allies to 'join Israel' in attacking Iran if the Islamic Republic attacks Israel, according to a statement from his office. 'Israel expects France and the UK to clearly and publicly tell Iran that it is forbidden to attack Israel, and that if Iran attacks, the coalition led by the US will join Israel not only to defend it but also to attack important targets in Iran,' he said, according to a statement from his office. French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné disagreed, saying it was 'inconvenient to talk about Israeli retaliation, even defensive, while we are working towards a diplomatic agreement.' The US presented a revised proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza on August 16, but the Hamas immediately rejected 'new conditions' from Israel, as diplomatic pressure intensifies to avoid a regional military escalation. Mediators - the US, Qatar, and Egypt - announced the resumption of talks next week in Cairo, after presenting a new compromise in Doha to implement an agreement on a ceasefire. An agreement has 'never been so close,' US President Joe Biden assured. Several Israeli politicians condemned the deadly attack in the West Bank by dozens of Israeli settlers. The attack occurred near the city of Kalkiliya, killing at least one person on Thursday evening. 'Violent settler attacks against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank are unacceptable and must stop,' said a spokesperson for the National Security Council, urging Israeli authorities to take necessary measures to 'protect all communities.' The European Union's foreign chief, Josep Borrell, said he wants to 'submit a proposal for EU sanctions against accomplices of violent settlers, including some Israeli government members.' The UN described the attack as 'horrible,' adding that 'overall, we are witnessing impunity' for such acts. The Gaza Health Ministry announced the first confirmed case of polio in Gaza, which has been polio-free for 25 years. The case involves a 10-month-old baby who had not been vaccinated in Deir Al-Balah. Two UN agencies have requested 'humanitarian pauses' in the fighting in Gaza to vaccinate over 640,000 children under 10 against polio in the coming weeks.

**European Countries Urge Iran to Avoid Retaliation Against Israel**
European countries are in intense communication with Iran to persuade it not to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Hamas' former political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Meanwhile, French, German, Italian, and British leaders issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. German Chancellor Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Monday, discussing the recent escalation in the region and ways to contain it, as well as bilateral relations between the two countries. Raisi emphasized that Iran welcomes expanding cooperation with all countries and believes in resolving issues through diplomacy, but will not give in to pressure, sanctions, arrogance, and aggression. Steinmeier stressed the importance of strengthening relations in various fields, highlighting the need for stability in the region, a halt to war and violence in Gaza, and calling for a ceasefire. The Vatican also called for avoiding the spread of conflict. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, called for dialogue to prevent escalation in the Middle East. He expressed concern about the situation in the region and emphasized the need for all parties to work towards a peaceful resolution. The US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, urging Iran to stop threatening Israel with a military attack. The statement emphasized that such an attack would have severe consequences for regional security. The US has approved $3.5 billion in military aid to Israel, despite calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza, killing over 131,000 people, mostly children and women, and injuring over 10,000, with many more missing.

**International Pressure Mounts to Avoid War Between Iran and Israel**
The international diplomatic pressure is increasing to avoid a war between Iran and Israel. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the G7 that an attack by Tehran and Hezbollah on Israel could happen in the next 24 hours. According to three anonymous sources cited by Axios, Blinken explained in a virtual meeting with allies that 'for the US, Iran and Hezbollah will both react', but Washington 'does not know the exact moment of the attacks' or their form. The US hopes to stop the escalation by convincing Iran and Hezbollah to limit their attacks and restrain any Israeli response, and Blinken 'asked other foreign ministers to join this push by pressuring the three'. While President Joe Biden saw the national security team and spoke with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the G7 foreign ministers, after Sunday's meeting, 'expressed deep concern for the rising level of tension in the Middle East, which threatens to trigger a wider conflict in the region'. In a joint statement, they launched an 'appeal to all parties to moderation and to engage in a constructive way for de-escalation', as also stated by the US State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller. 'No country or nation has anything to gain from further escalation', the foreign ministers of Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US, along with the EU's High Representative, stated. Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also reiterated on X that 'we are working for a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and intensified humanitarian engagement in the Strip. We will do our best to achieve peace'. Meanwhile, Israel has confirmed Blinken's information that the attack by Tehran could start within the next 24 hours, but from Jerusalem, they believe it is impossible to predict it with precision. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after warning that 'if they dare to attack us, they will pay a high price', spoke with Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin to inform him 'on the developments of security in the region and on the readiness of the Idf to defend Israel from potential threats posed by Iran and its delegates'. Gallant 'discussed a series of scenarios and the corresponding defensive and offensive capabilities', his office reported, adding that the minister 'expressed his appreciation to Austin for the close military and strategic coordination with the US, including the current and future deployment of military capabilities and the changes in the defense force position in Israel'. He also emphasized 'the importance of US leadership in forming a coalition of allies and partners to defend Tel Aviv and the region from a series of aerial attacks'. After the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, Washington sent additional military forces to the Middle East in anticipation of reprisals, insisting that it is a 'defensive deployment'. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto also spoke with Gallant, highlighting on X that 'Italy continues to work to promote dialogue, reduce tension, and avoid a grave and dangerous escalation'. Yesterday, as reported by the Israeli military, 'the head of the US Central Command, General Michael Erik Kurilla, arrived in the country' and met with the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi: the two 'held a joint assessment of the situation on strategic and security issues'.

**Blinken Arrives in Israel to Push for Ceasefire in Gaza**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to arrive in Israel to push for a ceasefire in Gaza, ten months after the violent conflict began. According to The Guardian, this will be Blinken's ninth visit to the region since the start of the war in October 2023. Despite recent US proposals aimed at bridging the gaps between the warring parties, optimism is waning due to Hamas's skepticism and ongoing violence. A senior Biden administration official confirmed that the latest proposals addressed the remaining gaps and are ready to be finalized. However, a Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, rejected these efforts, calling them 'a mirage' and accusing the US of imposing conditions rather than facilitating genuine negotiations. This reflects a significant difference between the US and Hamas over the nature of the negotiations and their progress. Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials. Netanyahu's office expressed 'cautious optimism' about the possibility of reaching an agreement, but the proposed ceasefire terms remain contentious. Hamas spokesperson Jihad Tah criticized Israel for imposing conditions on the talks, accusing Netanyahu of deliberately obstructing progress. Ongoing violence complicates diplomatic efforts. Recent Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, including a devastating attack on the al-Zawayda neighborhood that killed 18 Palestinians, highlight the ongoing hostilities. This attack, which targeted a home and a shelter for displaced people, highlights the rising number of civilian casualties due to the conflict. The conflict has broader regional implications, with Iran threatening retaliation following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. The US has warned against any Iranian retaliation, emphasizing the possibility of 'catastrophic' consequences. This warning reflects the growing risks to current diplomatic efforts and the potential for escalation if regional actors intervene. Foreign ministers from the UK, France, Germany, and Italy have expressed support for ceasefire talks, urging all parties to avoid actions that could exacerbate the situation. International support highlights global interest in resolving the conflict, but also underscores the complexities surrounding reaching a sustainable agreement.

**UK and France Urge Israel, Hezbollah, and Lebanon to Engage in Diplomatic Talks**
British Foreign Secretary David Lamy and French Foreign Secretary Stefan Seguren have called for Israel, Hezbollah, and Lebanon to engage in diplomatic talks to resolve the tensions. They stated that a ceasefire can lead to progress towards a solution for the two countries, which is the only way to achieve long-term security and stability. Lamy and Seguren emphasized that the region is going through a critical time, with ongoing Israeli actions in Gaza causing unacceptable losses of civilian lives. The hostages taken by Hamas are still being held, with 316 days having passed since the October 7 attacks. They also mentioned that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has increased in intensity and that Iranian threats of further escalation mean that the likelihood of a full-scale war in the region is rising. They warned that a single mistake in the calculations can lead to a further escalation and a longer and more complex conflict. The two foreign secretaries reiterated that their response is to renew the relationships between them and to use their combined diplomatic power to push for a single message. They emphasized that the UK and France have a strong record of working together to address the challenges they face today. They also stated that they have a shared interest and responsibility as permanent members of the UN Security Council to play a role in ensuring the security of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, as well as the stability of the region as a whole. They called on all parties to focus on the negotiations that have recently resumed on a ceasefire agreement and the release of hostages in Gaza. They emphasized that these talks represent a vital opportunity to secure an immediate ceasefire that can put an end to this horrific conflict in Gaza. They also stated that the UK and France are not alone in emphasizing the importance of urgent diplomacy to avoid further conflict. They have spoken to their counterparts in the region and beyond who share their desire to reduce the current escalation of tensions. The US, Egyptian, and Qatari negotiators are playing a significant role in coordinating the talks to reach an agreement on a ceasefire and the release of hostages. They continued that their communication with the region reinforces their conviction that reaching an agreement as soon as possible is in the interest of Israelis, Palestinians, and the region as a whole. They emphasized that an agreement is the only way to restore a sense of security to communities in the region and to achieve a long-term solution to the conflict. They also stated that the only way to achieve peace is through a political solution. Therefore, they are calling on Israel, Hezbollah, and Lebanon to engage in diplomatic talks led by the US to resolve their tensions through diplomacy, based on the principles outlined in UN Security Council Resolution 1701.

**Blinken to Visit Israel for Ceasefire Talks Amid Regional Escalation**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to arrive in Israel on Sunday as part of Washington's diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza that would end the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, which has lasted for 10 months. This is Blinken's 10th visit to the region since the start of the war in October last year. The US, along with mediators Qatar and Egypt, believes that its proposed solutions to the crisis in Gaza could lead to a breakthrough in the negotiations. However, US officials have expressed caution, saying that there is still much work to be done. Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials. The negotiations are taking place amidst concerns of regional escalation, with Iran threatening to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Hamas's Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. The US has repeatedly warned Iran against taking any action against Israel, saying that such a move could have 'catastrophic consequences, especially for Iran.' A joint statement by the foreign ministers of the UK, France, Germany, and Italy expressed their support for the ongoing ceasefire talks and urged all parties to avoid any 'escalatory actions.' The talks are expected to continue this week on how to implement the agreement, before senior officials meet again in Cairo to finalize the deal later in the week. A spokesperson for the Israeli negotiating team said on Saturday that they have a 'cautious optimism' about the possibility of reaching an agreement. However, Hamas spokesperson Jihad Tah said that Israel has added new conditions to the ceasefire talks and accused Netanyahu of using them to obstruct the efforts. Despite the growing hopes for a ceasefire, the war continues. At least 17 Palestinians have been killed and dozens injured in an Israeli airstrike on the town of Al-Zawayda in Gaza on Saturday, while Israel has issued new evacuation orders, citing Hamas's launch of rockets from areas near those areas.

**Gaza Ceasefire Talks Continue Amid Ongoing Conflict**
The Israeli army has intensified its military strikes on various parts of the Gaza Strip, while diplomatic efforts continue to reach a ceasefire agreement in the region. The US President, Joe Biden, has stated that the ceasefire agreement in Gaza is 'closer than ever', and US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, will hold talks in Israel on this matter. The US, along with Egypt and Qatar, has presented a new proposal to 'reduce the gaps' between Israel and Hamas to stop the fire in the ongoing war that has lasted for over 10 months. The proposal aims to 'close the remaining gaps' between the two parties and allow for the swift implementation of the expected agreement. The talks will continue in Cairo in the coming days, with the aim of reaching an agreement. However, a Hamas leader, Sami Abu Zuhri, has stated that 'the talk of reaching an agreement to stop the fire is an illusion', and that 'the occupation continues to obstruct all efforts to complete any agreement'. He added that 'we are not facing an agreement or real negotiations, but rather the imposition of American conditions'. Meanwhile, the Israeli army has claimed to have 'eliminated a number of militants' in the Gaza Strip, without specifying the location. The Israeli army has also carried out airstrikes on 'around 40 terrorist targets', including military buildings, arms depots, and other targets. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza has announced that at least 40,074 people have been killed since the start of the war, with 69 martyrs and hundreds of wounded in the past 48 hours. The ministry has also stated that the number of wounded has reached 92,537 since October 7. The director of the Al-Omari Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip has warned that the hospital will stop operating within 24 hours due to a lack of medical supplies and fuel. The UK, France, Germany, and Italy have expressed their strong support for the diplomatic efforts led by Qatar, Egypt, and the US to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. They have welcomed the 'constructive approach' taken so far and have urged all parties to continue their positive and flexible participation in the process. They have also emphasized the importance of avoiding actions that could undermine the chances of achieving peace in the region.

**Paris and London warn that settler attacks in the West Bank threaten a possible peace**
The Foreign Ministers of France, Stéphane Séjourné, and the UK, David Lammy, warned that the attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank 'risk undermining diplomatic efforts'. In a joint statement after a joint visit to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, the two ministers 'strongly condemned' the violence of the settlers, which they believe 'threatens the security of Israelis and Palestinians'. They referred to the operation led by dozens of settlers who on Thursday stormed a Palestinian village near the city of Kalkiliya, killing a 23-year-old Palestinian man and seriously injuring another, in addition to burning vehicles and causing other material damage. Séjourné and Lammy emphasized their willingness to support 'cooperation processes and regularization of the situation in the region' and that for this to happen 'all parties involved must make concrete efforts if they really want to tackle the conflict.' Beyond recalling that they consider that the two-state solution, one Palestinian alongside Israel, is the only one that can bring 'a just and lasting peace', they supported the negotiations sponsored by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar for a ceasefire and the release of hostages in the Gaza Strip. They stated that action must be taken to release the hostages and that 'it is urgent' to allow the entry and distribution 'without obstacles' of humanitarian aid in Gaza and to ensure the protection of civilians. For the French and British Foreign Ministers, 'the risk of the conflict spreading in the Middle East has never been greater', so they have called on 'Iran and its allies to stop their threats of military attack against Israel'. In this line, they pointed out 'to all parties' that they must end 'the escalation of reprisals'. During their joint visit on Friday, Séjourné and Lammy were received by the Israeli Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, and the Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, as well as the Palestinian Prime Minister, Muhamad Mustafa, in his office in Ramala. The head of French diplomacy, who was in Lebanon on Thursday, continues his tour of the Middle East in Cairo this Saturday, where he has a meeting scheduled with Egyptian President Abdelfatah al Sisi.

Iran's Foreign Ministry has dismissed calls for restraint from France, Germany, and Britain as 'devoid of political logic and contrary to the principles of international law.' The three countries had issued a joint statement urging Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks that could escalate tensions in the region and jeopardize a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Iran and its supporters 'will be held accountable for actions that jeopardize this opportunity for peace and stability,' the statement said. The three countries also welcomed the efforts of Qatar, Egypt, and the US to reach an agreement on a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Israeli intelligence has reported that Iran could attack Israel within days, with potential targets including military and civilian areas. 'Iran has launched a 'psychological war' against Israel,' according to the FT, as reported by Cursor. The attacks could come before Gaza ceasefire talks resume on Thursday, threatening any progress made in the Israel-Hamas deal.

**Israel-Hamas Conflict: Diplomatic Efforts for a Truce Amid Escalating Tensions**
British and French foreign ministers visited Israel on August 16 to call for a de-escalation in the region, as Hezbollah and Iran threatened to retaliate after the assassination of the Hamas leader and the Hezbollah military chief. Meanwhile, negotiations for a truce in Gaza continued in Cairo. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz stated that he expects his allies to 'join Israel' in attacking Iran if the Islamic Republic attacks Israel, according to a statement from his office. 'Israel expects France and the UK to clearly and publicly tell Iran that it is forbidden to attack Israel, and that if Iran attacks, the coalition led by the US will join Israel not only to defend it but also to attack important targets in Iran,' he said, according to a statement from his office. French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné disagreed, saying it was 'inconvenient to talk about Israeli retaliation, even defensive, while we are working towards a diplomatic agreement.' The US presented a revised proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza on August 16, but the Hamas immediately rejected 'new conditions' from Israel, as diplomatic pressure intensifies to avoid a regional military escalation. Mediators - the US, Qatar, and Egypt - announced the resumption of talks next week in Cairo, after presenting a new compromise in Doha to implement an agreement on a ceasefire. An agreement has 'never been so close,' US President Joe Biden assured. Several Israeli politicians condemned the deadly attack in the West Bank by dozens of Israeli settlers. The attack occurred near the city of Kalkiliya, killing at least one person on Thursday evening. 'Violent settler attacks against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank are unacceptable and must stop,' said a spokesperson for the National Security Council, urging Israeli authorities to take necessary measures to 'protect all communities.' The European Union's foreign chief, Josep Borrell, said he wants to 'submit a proposal for EU sanctions against accomplices of violent settlers, including some Israeli government members.' The UN described the attack as 'horrible,' adding that 'overall, we are witnessing impunity' for such acts. The Gaza Health Ministry announced the first confirmed case of polio in Gaza, which has been polio-free for 25 years. The case involves a 10-month-old baby who had not been vaccinated in Deir Al-Balah. Two UN agencies have requested 'humanitarian pauses' in the fighting in Gaza to vaccinate over 640,000 children under 10 against polio in the coming weeks.

**US and Israel Push for Ceasefire Agreement with Hamas**
US President Joe Biden expressed cautious optimism after two days of intense negotiations in Qatar. 'We've never been this close to an agreement,' he said, referring to a ceasefire in Gaza and a prisoner exchange. The US, along with Egypt and Qatar, presented a proposal that brought the two sides closer together. The Israeli delegation, led by Mossad chief David Barnea, returned home yesterday. Israel describes the atmosphere as 'positive', while Hamas (in an unofficial statement) says it's 'false' and 'unacceptable'. The White House responded, 'Hamas' statements shouldn't be taken too seriously. If Hamas rejects the agreement, they should think about the consequences for the people of Gaza, because the agreement is set and ready to be implemented.' A new summit is scheduled for next week in Cairo, with the hope of further calming the waters in the region. Diplomatic efforts are underway, with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz meeting with his British and French counterparts in Jerusalem. He asked for their countries' solidarity in case of an Iranian attack, not only on the defensive but also on the offensive. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with Netanyahu in Jerusalem tomorrow, while Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is in daily contact with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The US has deployed tens of thousands of troops, two aircraft carriers, submarines, and hundreds of fighter jets in the region. They have also authorized the resumption of deliveries of high-precision bombs to Israel and provided a $3.5 billion military aid package. However, the US has made it clear to Netanyahu that Israel must do its part and end the war in Gaza. According to the US, Israel has already achieved all its tactical objectives. Strategically, the US believes Israel should focus on Iran, which poses the greatest threat. A ceasefire agreement could still prevent a flare-up of violence with Iran, Hezbollah, and other Shia militias in the region. The main points of contention in the talks are the Philadelphi Corridor (a 12-kilometer border between Egypt and Gaza where Hamas has dug numerous military tunnels) and the Netzarim Corridor, a Israeli military route that splits the Gaza Strip into two sectors. Hamas demands that Israeli presence be removed from both.

'It is essential to act without delay and obtain the release of the hostages,' they insisted, urging all parties to 'take responsibility.' In addition to calls for de-escalation, the ministers emphasized the urgency of ensuring the unimpeded distribution of humanitarian aid to civilians affected by the conflict. 'It is urgent to allow the unimpeded delivery and distribution of humanitarian aid and to ensure the protection of civilians,' they stated, in response to growing concerns about the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. On the political front, the two diplomats reaffirmed their commitment to a two-state solution, considering it 'the only possible path to achieving a just and lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians.' They strongly condemned the violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, describing it as a threat not only to the security of both peoples but also to ongoing diplomatic efforts. 'We strongly condemn the violence perpetrated by settlers in the West Bank, which threatens the security of Israelis and Palestinians and risks compromising ongoing diplomatic efforts,' they declared.

**Biden Optimistic About Gaza Ceasefire as Diplomatic Efforts Intensify**
US President Joe Biden expressed optimism about the prospects of a ceasefire in Gaza, stating that the agreement 'is closer than ever'. The mediators, who include the US, Egypt, and Qatar, have concluded their talks in Doha and plan to meet again in Cairo next week to finalize the pact. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, will travel to Israel this weekend to support the negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for increased pressure on Hamas to accept the proposed plan. The group has rejected the latest Israeli demands, which include a permanent military presence along the Egyptian border and a buffer zone in Gaza to register Palestinian returnees. Diplomatic efforts are underway to prevent the conflict from escalating into a regional war. The UK and French foreign ministers have visited Israel, and the US has warned Iran and Hezbollah against launching attacks in response to the assassination of Hamas leaders. The mediators believe that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is the best option to calm tensions and secure the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The talks have been ongoing for months, with the US, Qatar, and Egypt attempting to broker a three-phase plan for a ceasefire. However, Hamas has proposed amendments, and Israel has demanded clarifications, leading to accusations of sabotage. The group has rejected the latest Israeli demands, which include a permanent military presence along the Egyptian border and a buffer zone in Gaza to register Palestinian returnees. The conflict has resulted in over 40,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's health ministry, and has sparked international concern. The US has warned Iran and Hezbollah against launching attacks in response to the assassination of Hamas leaders, and the UK and French foreign ministers have visited Israel to support the negotiations.

**Israel Asks Allies for Help in Case of Iranian Attack**
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen has asked his allies, France, the UK, and the US, to join Israel in case of an Iranian attack, on Friday, August 16, 2024, as negotiations for a truce in Gaza continue. 'Israel expects France and the UK to clearly and publicly tell Iran that it is forbidden to attack Israel and that if Iran attacks, the US-led coalition will join Israel not only to defend it but also to attack important targets in Iran,' Cohen said, according to a statement from his office relayed by AFP. French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné responded that it was 'inconvenient to speak of Israeli riposte and preparation of riposte, even defensive, while we are working on a diplomatic agreement.' He emphasized that diplomacy must work now and that they are working to avoid an Iranian retaliation. The international community has been concerned about a regional spill-over of the conflict for months, and Séjourné said he wants to 'pass very clear messages to both Israelis, Hezbollah, and the Iranian side to avoid escalation in the region.' Negotiations began on Thursday in Doha, Qatar, with the aim of obtaining a ceasefire and negotiations on hostages. 'We are in a moment and in a few days that are key in this conflict that has lasted too long,' Séjourné said, according to AFP.

**French and British Foreign Ministers Visit Region to Calm Tensions**
French and British foreign ministers are visiting the region to calm tensions, coinciding with talks in Doha on a ceasefire in Gaza.

**International Diplomacy Intensifies to Prevent Gaza War from Spreading**
International diplomacy has intensified to prevent the war in Gaza from becoming a larger regional conflict. British and French foreign ministers, David Lammy and Stéphane Séjourné, visited Israel and met with Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Lammy said, 'As we enter 315 days of war, the moment for an agreement to return the hostages, to bring in the necessary aid in Gaza, and to stop the fighting is now.' Katz warned that if Iran attacks Israel, Israel expects its allies to not only help defend it, but also to join a counterattack against Iran. The international mediators believe that the best option to calm tensions is an agreement between Israel and Hamas to stop the fighting and guarantee the release of the Israeli hostages in Gaza. The US, Qatar, and Egypt have initiated a new round of conversations with an Israeli delegation in Qatar. Hamas accuses Israel of adding new demands to a previous proposal that had international backing and was initially accepted by the group. Israel accuses Hamas of adding its own new demands. According to John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesperson, the conversations are an important step, but there is still much work to be done, and the negotiators are focused on implementing the agreement. A US official with knowledge of the Thursday conversations described them as 'constructive.' The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Qatar stated that the conversations will continue on Friday. The war began when Hamas insurgents crossed the heavily guarded border on October 7, killed over 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 as hostages. More than a hundred were released during a week-long ceasefire in November, and it is believed that around 110 remain in Gaza, although Israeli authorities claim that a third of them are dead. Israel responded with an offensive that has claimed the lives of 40,005 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, whose count does not distinguish between civilian and combatant victims. The Israeli military spokesperson, Admiral Daniel Hagari, said on Thursday that the army killed over 17,000 combatants in the enclave during the war, but did not provide evidence. The diplomats hope that a ceasefire agreement will convince Iran and Hezbollah to abstain from launching attacks in retaliation against Israel after the assassination of a high-ranking commander of the Lebanese group in an Israeli attack in Beirut and the leader of Hamas in an explosion in the Iranian capital, which has been widely attributed to Israel.

**British and French Foreign Secretaries Visit Israel and Palestine to Ease Tensions**
British Foreign Secretary David Lamy and French Foreign Secretary Stephane Sejourné are set to visit Israel and the Palestinian territories in a joint effort to ease tensions in the region. The visit comes as part of international efforts to reduce the escalating tensions. The US has already sent its special envoy Amos Hochstein to the region, and the head of the CIA William Burns is participating in negotiations in Doha to reach a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. However, all eyes are on Iran, which has vowed to retaliate for the killing of Hamas's political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which was blamed on Israel. Lamy and Sejourné will meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. The British Foreign Office said that the two ministers will 'urge all parties to complete an agreement to stop the fighting' in Gaza. They will also call on all parties to 'reduce tensions' to 'prevent further bloodshed' and urge calm on the Israeli-Lebanese border. The Israeli and Hezbollah forces have been exchanging fire across the border almost daily since October. Sejourné said in a statement published in Paris that 'France and Britain support the efforts of the American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators to achieve this. That's why we decided to go together to Israel and the Palestinian territories to convey this message.' Before this visit, Lamy said that 'this is a critical moment for the Middle East. The risk of the situation getting out of control is increasing.' He added that any Iranian attack on Israel 'will have severe consequences for the region.' Lamy stressed that 'all parties must engage seriously in negotiations to reach a ceasefire agreement' in Gaza. He continued that 'only diplomacy can end the current cycle of violence. Only diplomacy can achieve long-term peace and security for all. This is the message we will carry with us to the region.' Sejourné said that 'the time has never been more opportune to achieve peace' and that 'we must do whatever it takes to avoid a regional war that will have severe consequences.' He urged 'all parties to exercise restraint and responsibility', warning that 'any miscalculation in the current situation could lead to a wider conflict.' The office of Lapid said that the tripartite meeting will discuss efforts to prevent regional escalation and work towards a ceasefire agreement to release the hostages held in Gaza. Lapid is expected to demand more international sanctions on Iran due to its nuclear, missile and drone programs. Israel also wants Britain and France to include the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in the list of 'terrorist organizations.'

**EU Calls for Sanctions Against Israeli Settlers, US Secretary of State to Visit Israel**
The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, has called for sanctions against those responsible for the violence of Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Borrell announced on the online platform X that he will 'present a proposal for EU sanctions against the supporters of violent settlers, including some members of the Israeli government.' The EU's 27 member states would need to agree on such a proposal, which is unlikely given the divisions within the EU on the Middle East conflict. Meanwhile, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is expected to visit Israel on Monday to continue diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, has called for a ceasefire to allow for the vaccination of over 640,000 children in Gaza against polio. The WHO has reported that three children in Gaza have shown symptoms of acute paralysis, which are typical of polio. The virus was detected in wastewater samples in the southern city of Chan Yunis and in the center of the Gaza Strip in July. The UN has announced plans to send over a million doses of polio vaccine to Gaza. Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, has called for military support from the West in the event of an Iranian attack. 'In the event of an Iranian attack, we expect the coalition led by the US to not only defend Israel but also attack important targets in Iran,' he said. The EU has condemned the violence of Israeli settlers, calling it 'unacceptable.' The German Foreign Ministry has also condemned the attack, saying 'We condemn the violence of extremist settlers, who attacked a Palestinian village in the West Bank and set fires on Thursday.' The attack killed one person and injured another, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The EU has called for an immediate end to such attacks and for the perpetrators to be held accountable.

**UK and France to Promote Diplomatic Solution for Gaza Ceasefire**
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and his French counterpart Stéphane Séjourné will travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories this Friday to promote a 'diplomatic solution' for a ceasefire in Gaza and restore calm on the border with Lebanon. According to the British government, the two ministers will meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to express that 'there is no time for delays or excuses from any side' to achieve an agreement to stop armed activity in the Strip. Lammy stated, 'The UK and France are united in our commitment to ensuring a lasting peace for Israelis, Palestinians, and the entire region.' Séjourné added, 'It's never too late for peace. We must avoid a regional war at all costs, which would have terrible consequences.' The announcement comes after Lammy admitted to speaking with regional partners throughout the past week about the 'urgent need to end the conflict' with the resumption of negotiations for a ceasefire in the Strip and an agreement for the release of hostages held by Hamas. According to Lammy, these conversations highlighted that a ceasefire would not only protect civilians in Gaza but also pave the way for a broader de-escalation and bring stability to the Middle East, which he described as a 'critical moment for regional stability.' Lammy and Séjourné thanked Qatar, the United States, and Egypt for their mediation efforts in the conflict.

**UK to Use 'All Diplomatic Means' to Achieve Ceasefire in Gaza**
The British Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, stated that the UK will use 'all available diplomatic means' to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza. He said that he has spoken with regional partners throughout the week about the 'urgent need to end the conflict' and to resume negotiations for a halt in armed activity in the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages 'cruelly held by Hamas'. Lammy also mentioned that the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, has been in contact with the presidents of Iran and Egypt, as well as their US, French, and German counterparts. According to Lammy, these conversations showed that a ceasefire would not only protect civilians in Gaza but also pave the way for a broader de-escalation and stability in the Middle East, which he described as a 'critical moment for the region'. Lammy emphasized that attacks like the one on Al Tabeen school demonstrate the 'devastating' situation in Gaza, where Palestinians have no safe place to go. He urged both Israelis and Palestinians to 'participate in negotiations in good faith and show the necessary flexibility to reach an agreement', saying that the next few hours and days could define the future of the Middle East. 'We are at a critical moment for global stability. The next few hours and days could define the future of the Middle East. That's why today, and every day, we urge our partners in the region to choose peace', Lammy said, thanking Qatar, the US, and Egypt for their efforts in coordinating the conflict.

**French and British Foreign Ministers to Visit Israel to Address Regional Escalation**
The foreign ministers of France and the UK, Stéphane Séjourné and David Lammy, will visit Israel on Friday to discuss with their Israeli counterpart, Israel Katz, 'efforts to avoid a regional escalation'. According to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Minister Katz will meet with the Foreign Ministers of the UK and France tomorrow to discuss efforts to avoid a regional escalation.' The meeting is expected to focus on promoting 'severe economic sanctions against Iran in relation to the nuclear issue, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles, and the declaration of the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.' Additionally, the tripartite meeting is expected to promote an agreement for the release of the Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip by Hamas. Meanwhile, a delegation from Israel has arrived in Doha to resume negotiations with mediators (US, Egypt, and Qatar) for a ceasefire in the enclave, which would allow for the release of the hostages. However, Hamas has announced that it will not attend the meeting, citing Iran's threat to attack Israel in retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran two weeks ago, as well as the killing of Hizbulá's military leader Fuad Shukr by Israel. Despite this, the international community is exhausting all diplomatic channels to achieve an agreement in the Gaza Strip that would dissuade Iran and its allies, and even the US has stated that Hamas has agreed to maintain contact with the mediators after the meeting.

**Iran Refuses Western Appeals to Renounce Threats Against Israel**
Iran refused the Western countries' appeals to renounce threats against Israel following the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza, which they attribute to Tel Aviv. 'The Islamic Republic is determined to defend its sovereignty and will not ask anyone for permission to use its legitimate rights,' said Nasser Kanani, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson. The US and its European allies, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK, asked Iran to contain its threats on Monday (12). 'We expressed support for Israel's defense against Iranian aggression and attacks by terrorist groups supported by Iran. All parties must fulfill their responsibilities,' they said. The US also warned that Iran is likely to make a significant military counterattack with its allies this week. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to exercise maximum restraint to avoid escalating the situation in the region. 'The statement by France, Germany, and the UK, which did not object to the international crimes of the Zionist regime, is asking Iran to take no dissuasive action against a regime that has violated its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The request of these countries lacks logic, contradicts totally the principles and rules of International Law, and constitutes support for Israel,' reacted Kanaani. According to Iranian sources, only a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza could delay an Iranian attack on Tel Aviv. However, if the negotiations fail, the sources added that Iran and Hezbollah plan to launch a direct attack on Israelis. A round of negotiations between mediators and Hamas and Israeli delegations is scheduled for next Thursday. The White House stated that it remains optimistic that ceasefire negotiations will be resumed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed the participation of his representatives. According to US Department of State spokesperson Vedant Patel, Qatari partners have stated that they are working to ensure that Hamas is also represented. 'A ceasefire would allow the release of hostages, the delivery of humanitarian aid, and a new diplomacy to take the region out of this endless cycle of violence,' said Patel. Meanwhile, the US has sent a submarine with guided missiles and an aircraft carrier to the region after the recent escalation in the conflict, reinforcing its position and the capabilities of US military forces in the entire Middle East.'

**US and European Allies Support Israel, Warn of 'Serious Consequences' of Iranian Attack**
The US, France, Germany, Italy, and the UK have issued a joint statement supporting Israel's defense against Iranian aggression and calling for new talks to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza. The statement warns of 'serious consequences' for regional security if Iran were to launch a military attack on Israel. Iran has rejected the call, saying it 'lacks logic and contradicts international law.' The Iranian government has also called on the US and its European allies to condemn Israel's 'war on Gaza' and to support the Palestinian people. Meanwhile, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is set to visit the Middle East to address the escalating tensions. The visit comes as Israel continues to be on high alert for a potential Iranian attack. The Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, has said that the country's military is on high alert and ready to respond to any attack. The situation in the Middle East remains volatile, with the potential for a wider conflict. The US and its European allies have called for a ceasefire and a return to negotiations, but the situation remains uncertain.

**US and Israel Prepare for Possible Iranian Attack**
The US and Israel believe that Iran may launch an attack 'this week', according to John Kirby, the communications director of the US National Security Council. Diplomatic efforts to prevent Iran and its allies from launching an attack are ongoing. A new round of negotiations on a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas, scheduled for Thursday, could be crucial in de-escalating the situation in the Middle East. The US, Germany, the UK, France, and Italy have called on Iran to stop threatening attacks on Israel. The countries have expressed their support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate the situation, achieve a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and release hostages held by Hamas. 'There is no time to lose,' they said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan about the importance of Hamas participating in the negotiations on Thursday to establish a framework for an immediate and lasting ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of all hostages. The mediators had previously called on Israel and Hamas to resume talks on August 15 to 'close all remaining gaps and begin implementing the agreement without further delay.' However, Hamas had asked the mediators to develop a plan for implementing the existing proposal for a ceasefire agreement, 'instead of going to further negotiations or submitting new proposals.' This could be interpreted as Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar waiting for Iran's attack on Israel, hoping to have better conditions for a deal afterwards, said Israeli journalist Barak Ravid in an interview with CNN. Israel's military is on high alert, with General Staff Chief Herzi Halevi emphasizing that the army is preparing for both offensive and defensive measures. 'We are in the days of vigilance and readiness, and it is essential to explain that readiness, vigilance, and preparation are not synonyms for fear and panic,' said Defense Minister Joav Galant to the 'Times of Israel.' Meanwhile, a Hamas spokesperson announced that two members of its military wing had killed an Israeli hostage and injured two others. The incident was 'a reaction to Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,' according to Abu Obaida, who is affiliated with the Al-Kassam Brigades. The Israeli military stated that it could neither confirm nor deny the report, and the Hamas statement would be investigated.

**Israel on High Alert as Iran Threatens Retaliation**
Israel's military is on high alert due to the possibility of an Iranian or Hezbollah attack. The White House has warned of a 'significant set of attacks' from Iran. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has spoken with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, urging him to refrain from a retaliatory attack on Israel, citing a 'serious risk of miscalculation' and that war is not in anyone's interest. 'The Prime Minister expressed his deep concern about the situation in the region and called on all parties to de-escalate and avoid further confrontation in the region. There is a serious risk of miscalculation and now it's time for calm and caution,' a statement from Downing Street said after the 30-minute phone call. Starmer emphasized the UK's commitment to an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and increased humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, and said that to achieve these results, it's necessary to focus on diplomatic negotiations. He also raised the issue of foreign prisoners held in Iran. 'The leaders agreed that constructive dialogue between the UK and Iran is in the interest of both countries. The Prime Minister added that it can only be continued if Iran stops its destabilizing actions, including threats against people in the UK and does not continue to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine,' the statement said. The expected Iranian retaliation against Israel for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran was also discussed in Monday's talks between US President Joe Biden and the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and Italy. According to John Kirby, the leaders 'reiterated what they have said before', that they do not want escalation of violence and still hope to bring about a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Although Hamas has announced that it will not send its delegation to peace talks, a White House representative said that they still plan to attend the talks in Cairo and that 'Hamas must be there.' When asked about the potential involvement of European countries in repelling an Iranian attack on Israel, Kirby reminded that European forces (UK and France) participated in shooting down Iranian rockets and drones during the last Iranian retaliation, but the decision on what to do this time is up to the countries themselves.

**France, UK, Germany, Italy, and US Call for Ceasefire in Gaza**
France, the UK, Germany, Italy, and the US have called for a ceasefire in Gaza, urging Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to quickly conclude a truce. The leaders of the five countries, including US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, issued a joint statement after speaking by phone to analyze the escalation of tensions in the Middle East. 'We expressed our total support for the ongoing efforts to reduce tensions and achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza,' the statement said. The leaders supported the appeal of the mediator countries - the US, Egypt, and Qatar - for the Israeli and Hamas delegations to 'resume talks this week, with the aim of concluding the agreement as quickly as possible.' 'We emphasize that there is no more time to lose. All parties must fulfill their responsibilities,' they appealed, after Hamas announced that it would not participate in the next meeting, scheduled for Thursday in Cairo or Doha. The region is on high alert, with Iran and its regional allies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen threatening Israel with retaliatory attacks, following the assassination of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and the Israeli attack near Beirut that killed Fuad Shukr, the military chief of the Lebanese Hezbollah. Iran's president, Massud Pezeshkian, said that his country has the 'right to respond' to any aggression it faces. 'Although we emphasize the resolution of issues through negotiation, Iran will never yield to pressure, sanctions, and coercion, but considers it has the right to respond to aggressors in accordance with international standards,' he said, according to an official statement published by the Iranian News Agency after a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The US estimates that Iran may launch 'this week' a 'series of attacks' against Israel, said John Kirby, a White House spokesperson. The US 'shares the concern' of Israel about an imminent attack from Iran and its allies in the region, Kirby said. In recent days, the US has reinforced its military presence in the Middle East by deploying fighter jets and several warships. 'We emphasize that there is no more time to lose. All parties must fulfill their responsibilities,' they appealed, after Hamas announced that it would not participate in the next meeting, scheduled for Thursday in Cairo or Doha.

**West Warns Iran Against Possible Attack on Israel**
The West has issued a series of warnings to Iran to refrain from a military attack on Israel, amid fears of a possible Iranian attack. The US and European countries have intensified efforts to prevent retaliation, following the attack that killed the Hamas leader in Tehran. Washington says that the Iranian action is imminent. The US, Germany, France, Italy, and the UK have issued a joint statement urging Iran to back down from its repeated threats of a military attack on Israel. 'We appeal to Iran to retreat from its recurring threats of a military attack on Israel and discuss the grave consequences for regional security if such an attack were to occur,' the Western leaders said. The US has warned that a 'significant set of attacks' by Iran and its allies could happen this week, and that Tel Aviv shares this assessment. The US has sent a submarine capable of launching missiles and an aircraft carrier to the region as a show of support for its traditional ally. Meanwhile, while diplomatic efforts continue, the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, have spoken with the Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, and asked him to avoid escalating the situation. Pezeshkian said that Iran has the 'right to respond to aggressors.' The US and its European allies have also intensified calls for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, amid the conflict that has sparked the current tensions in the Middle East. The war in the Palestinian territory began after the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israeli soil in October last year, which left around 1,200 dead. The Israeli offensive in the Palestinian territory has already left over 39,000 dead, according to the Health Ministry of Gaza, administered by Hamas. The European countries have supported a request by Biden and the leaders of Qatar and Egypt for the resumption of negotiations between Israel and Hamas and for the expansion of access to humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.

**European Countries Urge Iran to Avoid Retaliation Against Israel**
European countries are in intense communication with Iran to persuade it not to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Hamas' former political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Meanwhile, French, German, Italian, and British leaders issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. German Chancellor Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Monday, discussing the recent escalation in the region and ways to contain it, as well as bilateral relations between the two countries. Raisi emphasized that Iran welcomes expanding cooperation with all countries and believes in resolving issues through diplomacy, but will not give in to pressure, sanctions, arrogance, and aggression. Steinmeier stressed the importance of strengthening relations in various fields, highlighting the need for stability in the region, a halt to war and violence in Gaza, and calling for a ceasefire. The Vatican also called for avoiding the spread of conflict. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, called for dialogue to prevent escalation in the Middle East. He expressed concern about the situation in the region and emphasized the need for all parties to work towards a peaceful resolution. The US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, urging Iran to stop threatening Israel with a military attack. The statement emphasized that such an attack would have severe consequences for regional security. The US has approved $3.5 billion in military aid to Israel, despite calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza, killing over 131,000 people, mostly children and women, and injuring over 10,000, with many more missing.

**UK, US, Italy, France, and Germany Urge Iran to Cease Threats Against Israel**
The UK, US, Italy, France, and Germany have called on Iran to stop threatening Israel with an attack. According to a joint statement released by the White House after a phone call between the leaders of these countries, 'We expressed our support for the protection of Israel from Iranian aggression and attacks by Iranian-backed terrorist groups. We called on Iran to cease its threats of a military attack on Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security in the event of such an attack.' The countries also supported efforts to de-escalate the situation in the Gaza Strip and achieve a deal for the release of hostages held by the Palestinian movement Hamas. Tensions in the region have escalated since Hamas militants infiltrated Israeli territory on October 7, 2023, killing civilians and taking hostages. Israel has since imposed a complete blockade on Gaza and launched attacks on the enclave and parts of Lebanon and Syria.

**EU Accelerates Military Deployment in Middle East Amid Iran-Israel Tensions**
The European Union is accelerating its military deployment in the Middle East in response to Iran's threat to attack Israel. The US has reinforced its security in the region, with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordering the deployment of a guided-missile submarine and accelerating the sending of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier to the area. Meanwhile, Hezbollah launched 30 rockets at Israel in retaliation for the killing of three of its fighters in Lebanon on August 12. The rockets fell in empty areas without causing any casualties. The tensions continue despite diplomatic efforts by several Western countries. The US has increased its presence in the region, with Austin communicating with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and reiterating the US commitment 'to take all possible measures to defend Israel' and highlighting the strengthening of the US military posture and capabilities in the Middle East in light of the growing regional tensions. Hezbolá said it launched Katyusha rockets against 'the new headquarters of the 146th division of the Israeli Army in Jaatoun'. The new attack by the Lebanese group is taking place in a moment of extreme tension on the border between Israel and Lebanon, which has intensified since the killing by Israel of Fuad Shukr, the 'number two' of Hezbolá. Since then, the group has promised reprisals. However, the tension is not new. Since Israel began its military offensive in Gaza, Hezbolá has promised to increase its attacks until the hostilities in the Palestinian enclave are ended. According to EFE figures, more than 600 people have died since last October, most on the Lebanese side, and Hezbolá has confirmed the death of some 372 militiamen and commanders, some in Syria. Paris, Berlin, and London are joining efforts to avoid a major conflict in the Middle East. Various voices have been added from the West to try to stop the spread of a conflict in the region, which is already facing the war in Gaza. France, Germany, and the UK have asked Iran and its allies to refrain from perpetrating attacks that 'can further intensify regional tensions' and put the opportunity to agree on a ceasefire at risk. China has also attempted to mediate, with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani responding to his counterpart in Beijing that Tehran has 'the right to an appropriate and deterrent response' against Israel to ensure regional stability. In a joint statement, Paris, Berlin, and London emphasized the need for a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave. They supported the latest initiative by the mediators, the US, Qatar, and Egypt, to negotiate an agreement that would end the war that has lasted for over ten months between the Israeli Army and Hamas. The document also asks for the return of dozens of hostages held by Hamas and the delivery 'without obstacles' of humanitarian aid.

**France, Germany, and UK Urge Iran to Avoid Attacking Israel**
France, Germany, and the UK have requested that Iran and its allies avoid attacking Israel. In a joint statement issued on Monday (12 August 2024) by the British government, they stated that retaliation would increase regional tensions and threaten ceasefire negotiations in Gaza. The statement also expressed gratitude to mediation partners such as the US, Egypt, and Qatar, and emphasized that there should be no further delays in negotiations. The statement read, 'We will work with all parties to prevent escalation and will spare no effort to reduce tensions and find a path to stability.' The countries also stated that combat must end and all hostages held by Hamas must be released, adding that the people of Gaza need 'urgent and unrestricted delivery and distribution of aid.' On August 8, the US, Qatar, and Egypt issued a joint statement demanding an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. They demanded that Israel and Hamas immediately comply with the agreement presented in May, which outlines a three-phase end to the conflict. The initial negotiation meeting for the agreement is scheduled to take place on Friday (15 August), with the location yet to be determined, but likely to be in Egypt or Qatar, with Israel's presence confirmed. However, Hamas has not yet responded to the invitation.

**France, Germany, and UK Warn Iran Against Attacking Israel**
France, Germany, and the UK have issued a warning to Iran not to attack Israel, following the recent assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The three countries stated that any retaliation would undermine peace negotiations and called on Iran and its allies to refrain from extreme actions. The statement read, 'We call on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks that could further intensify regional tensions and jeopardize the opportunity to agree on a ceasefire and the release of hostages.' The importance of ending the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has lasted over a year, was also emphasized. Despite the allied nations' support for Israel, the Israeli military has already implemented strategies to protect its borders from potential Iranian attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that they are preparing for any attack and have already met with the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee of the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) to discuss their readiness. However, Iran has stated that it will only return to peace agreements if mediators focus on a plan based on previous dialogues, leaving the future of diplomatic sessions uncertain.

**Iranian Threats and International Warnings: A Growing Concern for Israel**
International warnings have increased about an imminent Iranian attack on Israel, particularly with the upcoming negotiations on the prisoner swap and ceasefire in Gaza. According to two Israeli sources, the attack will be direct and may occur before the negotiations. The Israeli military has ordered its soldiers and officers in Georgia and Azerbaijan to leave immediately and not travel, fearing a retaliatory operation. The Israeli military is continuously assessing the security situation and updating the list of countries that Israelis are prohibited from traveling to due to security concerns. However, the Azerbaijani media agency denied the presence of any foreign military units on its territory. The Israeli military has also grounded all pilots, according to the Israeli Broadcasting Authority. A diplomatic source told the Israeli newspaper 'Yedioth Ahronoth' that 'our situation is extremely critical regarding the ambassadors abroad, and many of them feel threatened.' British, French, and German leaders have warned of escalating tensions and the risk of a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of prisoners being jeopardized. In a joint statement, they emphasized that the fighting must stop now and that all Palestinian-held hostages must be released. They also expressed their support for the efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement and the release of the hostages. The US Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, has ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier to speed up its arrival in the Middle East, citing concerns of a military escalation in the region. Over 15 international airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv, Tehran, and Beirut, citing the need to avoid flying over the three countries' airspace. Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, said that Iran has the right to take a suitable and deterrent response to ensure regional stability, according to official Iranian media. He added that 'the Zionist regime's actions are expanding the scope of tension in the region, starting from the killing of children in Gaza to the recent dangerous moves in Lebanon and Yemen, and the assassination of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.'

**European Leaders Unite Against Iranian Threats, Call for Negotiations**
France, Germany, and the UK have united against possible Iranian actions towards Israel. The three European countries, through their leaders, have warned Iran against retaliation after the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and have promised a decisive reaction if there is a large-scale attack on the state. Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz, and Keir Starmer stated in a joint declaration: 'We are deeply concerned about the escalation of tensions in the Middle East region and united in our commitment to de-escalation and regional stability – they said. In this context, and in particular, we ask Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks that could further escalate regional tensions and compromise the opportunity to agree on a ceasefire and the release of hostages.' The leaders emphasized the need for negotiations, saying: 'Fighting must end now and all Hamas-held hostages must be released. The Gaza population needs urgent and unrestricted aid delivery – they wrote. We welcome the tireless work of our partners in Qatar, Egypt, and the US to reach a ceasefire agreement. We approve the joint statement by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, President al-Sisi, and President Biden calling for the immediate resumption of negotiations.' The three countries aim to avoid an escalation and see the upcoming negotiations as a turning point for the entire region. However, Israel has already estimated that Iran and Hezbollah will attack before the summit and possible ceasefire, and is on high alert, preparing for all scenarios.

**Germany, France, and UK Urge Iran and Allies to Refrain from Attacking Israel**
Germany, France, and the UK have called on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacking Israel, emphasizing the need for negotiations to stop the fighting in Gaza and release the hostages. Meanwhile, the US Defense Secretary has ordered a carrier to speed up its arrival in the Middle East. The leaders of the three countries said in a joint statement that they urge Iran and its allies to refrain from launching attacks on Israel, which could escalate tensions and put the chances of a ceasefire and the release of hostages at risk. They also called on Israel and Hamas to negotiate a ceasefire and delay any further action. The statement added that the fighting must stop now and all hostages held by Hamas must be released. The statement also emphasized that the people in Gaza need 'urgent and unobstructed delivery and distribution of aid'. It is worth noting that Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist militant group that is classified as a terrorist organization by Germany, the EU, the US, and other countries. A US aircraft carrier has been ordered to speed up its arrival in the region. The US Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, has ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier to move faster, according to the Pentagon, in response to the threat of a large-scale attack by Hezbollah, backed by Iran, or Iran itself against Israel. The US Defense Secretary also had a conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, and ordered the USS Georgia submarine to be sent to the region. The two men discussed 'the importance of minimizing harm to civilians, making progress towards a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza, and deterring groups backed by Iran from launching attacks'. The US has announced last week that it will increase its military presence in the Middle East by deploying more warships and fighter jets. The USS Abraham Lincoln is expected to join another US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, in the region.

**France, Germany, and UK Warn Iran of Responsibility for Escalation in Region**
The leaders of France, Germany, and the UK have issued a joint statement warning Iran of responsibility for escalating the situation in the region. The statement, released on the UK government's website, calls for an end to further delays in restarting negotiations between Israel and Hamas. 'We are working with all parties to prevent escalation and will do everything to reduce tension and find a path to stability. Fighting must stop now, and all hostages held by Hamas must be released,' the statement reads. The leaders also urged Iran and its allies to 'refrain from attacks that would lead to further escalation of regional tensions and threaten the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage release.' They emphasized that 'no country or nation will benefit from further escalation in the Middle East.' The conflict between Israel and Palestine began on October 7, 2023, with a Hamas attack. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated on July 1, 2024, that Israel would continue military operations in the Gaza Strip until Hamas is destroyed and 'all other war goals are achieved.' US President Biden announced on May 13 that Israel and Hamas had agreed on the boundaries of a ceasefire agreement for the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages. Reuters reported on August 9 that leaders of the US, Egypt, and Qatar had called for Israel and Hamas to meet for negotiations on August 15 to complete the ceasefire agreement for the Gaza Strip.

**France, Germany, and UK Join Calls for 'Resumption of Negotiations' in the Middle East**
France, Germany, and the UK have welcomed the efforts of Qatar, Egypt, and the US to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages in the Middle East. In a joint statement signed by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the three countries expressed support for the joint statement by the Qatari Emir, Egyptian President, and US President 'calling for the immediate resumption of negotiations.' The statement reads, 'We agree that there can be no further delay. We have worked with all parties to prevent escalation and will spare no effort to reduce tensions and find a path to stability.' The statement also emphasizes that 'fights must stop immediately and all hostages still held by Hamas must be released. The people of Gaza need urgent and unimpeded delivery and distribution of aid.' The French, German, and British leaders expressed their 'deep concern about the escalation of tensions in the region and their commitment to de-escalation and regional stability.' They also called on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks that would further exacerbate regional tensions and compromise the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage release. According to the statement, 'no country or nation has anything to gain from a new escalation in the Middle East.' The international community has condemned Israel's ongoing brutal offensive in Gaza since October 2023, which has killed nearly 39,800 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 92,000 others, according to local authorities. The International Court of Justice has accused Israel of genocide and ordered it to immediately cease its military operation in the city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge to escape the war.

**International Pressure Mounts to Avoid War Between Iran and Israel**
The international diplomatic pressure is increasing to avoid a war between Iran and Israel. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the G7 that an attack by Tehran and Hezbollah on Israel could happen in the next 24 hours. According to three anonymous sources cited by Axios, Blinken explained in a virtual meeting with allies that 'for the US, Iran and Hezbollah will both react', but Washington 'does not know the exact moment of the attacks' or their form. The US hopes to stop the escalation by convincing Iran and Hezbollah to limit their attacks and restrain any Israeli response, and Blinken 'asked other foreign ministers to join this push by pressuring the three'. While President Joe Biden saw the national security team and spoke with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the G7 foreign ministers, after Sunday's meeting, 'expressed deep concern for the rising level of tension in the Middle East, which threatens to trigger a wider conflict in the region'. In a joint statement, they launched an 'appeal to all parties to moderation and to engage in a constructive way for de-escalation', as also stated by the US State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller. 'No country or nation has anything to gain from further escalation', the foreign ministers of Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US, along with the EU's High Representative, stated. Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also reiterated on X that 'we are working for a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and intensified humanitarian engagement in the Strip. We will do our best to achieve peace'. Meanwhile, Israel has confirmed Blinken's information that the attack by Tehran could start within the next 24 hours, but from Jerusalem, they believe it is impossible to predict it with precision. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after warning that 'if they dare to attack us, they will pay a high price', spoke with Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin to inform him 'on the developments of security in the region and on the readiness of the Idf to defend Israel from potential threats posed by Iran and its delegates'. Gallant 'discussed a series of scenarios and the corresponding defensive and offensive capabilities', his office reported, adding that the minister 'expressed his appreciation to Austin for the close military and strategic coordination with the US, including the current and future deployment of military capabilities and the changes in the defense force position in Israel'. He also emphasized 'the importance of US leadership in forming a coalition of allies and partners to defend Tel Aviv and the region from a series of aerial attacks'. After the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, Washington sent additional military forces to the Middle East in anticipation of reprisals, insisting that it is a 'defensive deployment'. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto also spoke with Gallant, highlighting on X that 'Italy continues to work to promote dialogue, reduce tension, and avoid a grave and dangerous escalation'. Yesterday, as reported by the Israeli military, 'the head of the US Central Command, General Michael Erik Kurilla, arrived in the country' and met with the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi: the two 'held a joint assessment of the situation on strategic and security issues'.

**Diplomatic Maneuvers to Avoid Military Escalation in the Middle East**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that his country is prepared to face Iran and its allies on all fronts. 'Anyone who kills our citizens or harms our country (...) will pay a very high price,' he warned on Sunday evening. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, has urged all parties, as well as countries with influence, to act urgently to avoid a wider conflict in the region. Iran, the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, and the Lebanese Hezbollah have accused Israel of the death of Hamas leader Ismaïl Haniyeh, killed in his residence in Tehran on Wednesday. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death, but had vowed to destroy Hamas after the unprecedented attack by the movement on its soil on October 7, which triggered the devastating war in Gaza. 'Israel has crossed red lines,' said Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, while Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei threatened a severe punishment. The US, Israel's main ally, has strengthened its military presence in the Middle East while seeking to diplomatically de-escalate the situation. 'We are determined to oppose Iran and its allies on all fronts, in all arenas,' Netanyahu said at a ceremony in Jerusalem. The US, Sweden, the UK, France, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have called on their citizens to leave Lebanon, while several airlines have suspended flights to Beirut, including Lufthansa, Air France, and Transavia. The situation remains tense, with daily exchanges of fire at the Israeli-Lebanese border and Israeli airstrikes on the south of Lebanon, which have killed four people, according to Lebanese authorities and Hezbollah. 'We can't know what will happen in 20 minutes (...) But we are a strong country and I think we will win this war,' said Yehuda Levi, a shop owner in Haifa. '39,623 dead in Gaza according to Hamas' - The situation is critical, with many countries urging their citizens to leave the region.

**Multiple Countries Urge Citizens to Leave Lebanon Amid Iran-Israel Tensions**
Several countries have urged their citizens in Lebanon to leave the country 'immediately' amid concerns of an Iranian attack on Israel, which may involve its proxy 'Hezbollah'. The British government has repeated its call for its citizens in Lebanon to leave 'now' as long as commercial travel options are available. The French government has also urged its citizens to leave Lebanon 'as soon as possible' due to concerns of escalating tensions in the region following the war in Gaza. The French Foreign Ministry has advised travelers to Lebanon: 'In a highly volatile security context, we once again draw the attention of French citizens to the fact that there are still commercial flights available to France, and we urge them to take action now to leave Lebanon as soon as possible.' This comes as French airlines Air France and Transavia France have extended the suspension of their flights to Beirut until at least August 6 due to the security situation. On Saturday, several countries, including the UK, US, and Jordan, urged their citizens to leave Lebanon amid concerns of a wider conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Canada also advised its citizens to avoid all travel to Israel, saying that 'the armed conflict in the region poses a threat to security.' The Canadian government stated: 'If the armed conflict escalates, it may affect your ability to leave by commercial means. It may also lead to disruptions in travel, including the closure of airspace, cancellation of flights, and rerouting of flights.' Meanwhile, Jordan's Foreign Minister is set to visit Tehran on Sunday, where he will convey a message from King Abdullah II to President Ebrahim Raisi on the situation in the region and bilateral relations. This comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts by the US and its allies, including France, the UK, Italy, and Egypt, to prevent further escalation in the region.

**EU, France, and UK urge citizens to leave Lebanon amid Middle East tensions**
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has advised citizens to leave Lebanon 'as soon as possible' due to the risk of military escalation in the Middle East. 'In a very volatile security context, we once again remind French citizens, especially those passing through, that there are still commercial flights with direct and connecting flights to France, and we invite them to take the necessary measures to leave Lebanon as soon as possible,' the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated. France follows the footsteps of the United States and the United Kingdom, which on Saturday recommended their citizens to leave the country. Sweden has also announced the closure of its embassy in Beirut and asked its citizens to leave. The region has been experiencing tensions since the assassination of a Hezbollah commander in an attack in Lebanon and the main political leader of Hamas in an attack in the Iranian capital last week. Israel is preparing for retaliation. With calls to leave Lebanon, the reinforcement of US military presence in the Middle East, and the suspension of air connections, concern about a military escalation in the region is growing as Iran and its allies intensify threats against Israel. The US and UK have urged their citizens present in Lebanon to leave as soon as possible, while Canada has asked its nationals to avoid traveling to Israel. 'Tensions are high and the situation can deteriorate rapidly,' warned UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, adding: 'My message to British citizens there is clear: leave now.' The heads of diplomacy of the US and France, Antony Blinken and Stéphane Séjourné, urged all parties in a phone conversation to exercise 'maximum restraint to avoid a conflagration that would have devastating consequences for the countries of the region,' the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated. The US Department of Defense revealed on Friday that it had ordered 'adjustments' to 'improve protection' of its forces and 'increase support for Israel's defense,' in the face of 'the possibility of a regional escalation by Iran and its partners.' When asked at his beach house in Delaware if he believed Iran would give up such action, US President Joe Biden replied: 'I hope so, I don't know.' The tension increased with the death on Tuesday of a high-ranking Hezbollah official in an Israeli bombing in a Beirut suburb, and with the assassination the next day in Tehran, attributed to Israel, of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Haniyeh, whose death was denounced on Saturday in protests in several Muslim countries - including Morocco and Turkey - was buried the day before in a cemetery near Doha, Qatar, where he lived in exile, after receiving massive funerals. The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, threatened Israel with a 'severe punishment' and the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, spoke of an 'inevitable response.' The Iranian representation at the United Nations said it expected Hezbollah to attack Israel 'in depth' and not limit itself to military targets. Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah, allied with Hamas, engage in almost daily artillery duels since the start of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah announced that it launched 'dozens' of Katyusha rockets against the settlement of Beit Hillel, in northern Israel.

**France and US Urge Maximum Restraint in Middle East**
The French and US diplomatic chiefs agreed to urge all parties in the Middle East to 'exercise maximum restraint' to avoid a regional conflict, according to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Stéphane Séjourné spoke with Antony Blinken and shared 'their concerns about the increasing tensions' in the region, said Christophe Lemoine, the ministry's spokesperson. 'They agreed to continue to urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint, in order to avoid any regional conflagration that would have devastating consequences for the countries in the region,' he added. The two countries will also continue joint efforts for a 'sustainable' ceasefire in Gaza. This meeting took place at a time when concerns about a possible military escalation in the Middle East have increased due to the amplification of threats against Israel by Iran and its allies. Iran, the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah blamed Israel for the death in Tehran on Wednesday of the Palestinian movement's leader, Ismail Haniyeh. The assassination occurred just hours after an attack claimed by Israel killed the military chief of the Lebanese movement, Fouad Chokr, near Beirut on Tuesday night. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is at a 'very high level' of preparation for any scenario, 'both defensive and offensive.' On Friday, Paris asked French visitors still in Iran to leave the country 'as quickly as possible.' In the case of Lebanon, France did not explicitly ask its citizens to leave the country, unlike Washington and London. However, in its updated travel advice on Thursday, the ministry warned French citizens, particularly those passing through, that commercial flights to France are still available. Since the Gaza war, France has formally recommended that French citizens 'except for imperative reasons, not travel to Lebanon, including for tourism and family visits.'

**The UK's arms sales to Israel are tiny - but here's why Netanyahu is panicking about a possible ban | Azriel Bermant**
The UK's Labour government is considering imposing a ban on arms sales to Israel, a move that has sparked concern among Israelis. Although military exports to Israel were only £18.2m last year, an arms embargo is seen as a powerful means to register disapproval of Israel's actions towards the Palestinians. The UK has received advice from its lawyers stating that Israel has violated international law in Gaza, but this advice has not been made public. The deaths of three British aid workers in Gaza have heightened pressure for an embargo. Israel's refusal to allow visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross to the Sde Teiman detention facility has also contributed to the UK's greater readiness to impose an export ban. According to Alicia Kearns, the UK government's lawyers have stated that Israel's actions are a violation of the Geneva conventions. The UK's decision is connected to Israel's refusal to cooperate with the Red Cross and its lack of cooperation in allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. 'History will judge Canada's current action harshly,' said Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz in response to Canada's ban on arms sales to Israel. However, the Netanyahu government has limited options at its disposal in countering such an embargo and would be well advised to exercise caution: Israel is becoming increasingly isolated at a time of growing peril for the country, and Britain remains one of its closest allies in Europe. 'It was a different story half a century ago,' said the article, referring to the UK's ban on arms sales to Israel in 1973. However, the article concludes that a British arms embargo would not really change anything on the ground, as Israel imports 69% of its arms from the United States and 30% from Germany between 2019 and 2023. The UK and Israel work closely together in the fields of cyber and intelligence, and Israel has passed on important intelligence to the UK on Iranian activity against dissidents in London. 'Britain and its European partners cannot ignore the fact that Iran has been supporting Russia with drones that have been used in its brutal war against Ukraine,' said David Cameron. This can help to explain why Britain is now reportedly delaying a decision on banning arms exports to Israel. At this dangerous time, Starmer may well calculate that the UK is better served by retaining a channel of influence with Israel.

**Canada, Australia, and New Zealand Call for Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza**
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, citing a catastrophic situation and unacceptable human suffering. The countries condemn Hamas for its atrocities on October 7, 2023, and ongoing acts of terrorism. They demand that Hamas lay down its arms and release all hostages. The countries also emphasize that they do not see a role for Hamas in the future governance of Gaza. Israel should listen to the concerns of the international community. The statement highlights the importance of protecting civilians, which is a requirement of international humanitarian law. 'Palestinian civilians cannot be forced to pay the price for winning against Hamas. This must stop. An immediate ceasefire is urgently needed,' the joint statement reads. The three countries fully support the comprehensive ceasefire agreement outlined by US President Joe Biden and endorsed by the UN Security Council. 'We urge the parties to the conflict to agree to this agreement. Any delay will only lead to new losses,' the foreign ministries said. Additionally, the countries reaffirm their commitment to working towards an irreversible path to a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can live in safety within internationally recognized borders.

**UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy: Britain seeks balanced stance on Israeli-Palestinian conflict**
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in an interview with Reuters that his country wants to take a balanced stance towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and will use diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Hamas. Lammy is currently visiting Germany, his first foreign trip since the Labor Party's landslide victory in the British elections on Friday, which ended 14 years of Conservative rule and brought Keir Starmer to the position of Prime Minister. Lammy said, 'It's time for the United Kingdom to reconnect with the outside world.' He added, 'I want to return to taking a balanced stance on Israel and Gaza. We have made it clear that we want to see a ceasefire... We want the release of these prisoners.' He also stated, 'The fighting must stop, and humanitarian aid must be allowed in. I will use all diplomatic efforts to ensure a ceasefire.' Despite his party's landslide victory in the elections, the Labor Party suffered significant losses in areas with large Muslim populations due to their anger over the party's stance on the war in Gaza. The efforts to reach an agreement on a ceasefire and the release of prisoners in Gaza gained momentum on Friday after Hamas presented a modified proposal on the agreement terms, and Israel said the negotiations will continue this week. According to Gaza's health authorities, over 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign on Gaza since October 7, 2023, in response to Hamas's attack on Israeli towns on the same day. Israeli statistics indicate that 1,200 people were killed and over 250 hostages were taken in Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Lammy said that Britain will seek to re-establish its global positions on some issues, including the climate crisis and major relationships, such as its relations with European powers and emerging powers. He added, 'Let's put Britain's exit from the European Union behind us... There are many things we can do together.' The British Foreign Office said that Lammy will travel to Poland and Sweden on Sunday, where he will focus on areas including cooperation in NATO and the war in Ukraine.

**US Seeks Diplomatic Solution to Prevent War Between Israel and Hezbollah**
The United States is seeking diplomatic solutions to prevent a full-scale war between Israel and the Hezbollah group in Lebanon. The Biden administration is looking to Qatar to mediate between Israel and Hezbollah. The US is trying to prevent the conflict from escalating into a full-scale war in Lebanon, with American officials working to conclude an agreement to end the conflict. According to The Washington Post, US officials have asked Qatar, which has mediated talks between Israel and Hamas, to help resolve the issue on the border between Israel and Lebanon. A Hezbollah representative said that if a temporary ceasefire is reached between Israel and Hamas, Hezbollah will also pause its attacks. However, the group will not discuss other agreements until the war in the Gaza Strip is stopped. The US is also considering a ceasefire in the Golan Heights as a key step towards resolving the issue in Lebanon, but officials are exploring alternative options for de-escalation. A State Department representative, Matthew Miller, said that a diplomatic solution can be found that meets the interests of all parties, but did not provide details. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant said that Israel does not want war with Hezbollah, but is prepared for any scenario. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz promised to take necessary measures to stop Hezbollah's attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the country is ready for 'very strong actions' in the north and will not stand idly by while Hezbollah attacks its territory. The Israeli military has approved operational plans for an invasion of Lebanon. A former Pentagon intelligence official, Harrison Mann, expressed confidence that Israel will not launch an attack unless it is fully confident in US support. The US has not followed the example of other countries, such as Canada and Germany, which have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon, but has deployed a US Navy ship, the USS Wasp, to the Mediterranean to evacuate American citizens from Lebanon if necessary.
