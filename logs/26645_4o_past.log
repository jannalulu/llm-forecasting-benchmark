To forecast the likelihood of Saudi Arabia establishing diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, I'll analyze the available data, historical context, and current geopolitical dynamics.

Base Rates and Historical Context:
- Historically, normalization of relations between Israel and Arab countries has been rare but has seen some momentum in recent years with the Abraham Accords, which included the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. However, Saudi Arabia is a more significant player in the region, with ties to the Palestinian cause, making normalization a more complex and significant shift.
- Past negotiations and deals often took substantial time and encountered numerous hurdles before any official agreement. For instance, the UAE's normalization with Israel in 2020, although quicker than anticipated, followed years of under-the-radar engagements.

Current Geopolitical Context:
- Recent articles highlight challenges in Saudi-Israel normalization talks, particularly the insistence by Saudi Arabia on Israel recognizing an independent Palestinian state, which Israel has consistently rejected.
- Diplomatic efforts seem focused on achieving a defensive agreement involving the US that ties normalization with Israel to broader regional security and diplomatic objectives. However, significant opposition exists within both the US Senate and Israel, complicating these efforts.
- Current geopolitical circumstances, particularly the ongoing conflict in Gaza, create further impediments, with Saudi Arabia previously stating it cannot proceed with normalization while the conflict continues.

Adjustments For Recent News:
- Recent news articles suggest that, despite some diplomatic progress and external mediation efforts, significant preconditions for Saudi normalization with Israel remain unresolved. Reports are also clear that a timeline before the 2024 US elections is unlikely.
  
Balancing Different Factors:
- The strategic benefits for both Saudi Arabia and Israel of normalization, including increased regional security and political alliances, are compelling but come with significant risks and costs that may delay or derail efforts.
- External mediation by powerful players like the US adds pressure but also introduces complexities and risks, especially given the political dynamics in the US.

Considering these factors, while there is some momentum towards eventual normalization, the likelihood of it occurring by September 30, 2024, is constrained by significant challenges, both political and geopolitical.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured analytical approach:

**1. Reference Class Forecasting and Base Rates:**
The normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states has accelerated in recent years due to geopolitical shifts and the Abraham Accords. However, Saudi Arabia remains a significant regional player with greater geopolitical constraints. Historical precedents for normalization (such as agreements with the UAE and Bahrain) indicate that once discussions begin in earnest, normalization can occur rapidly if politically viable.

**2. Breaking Down the Problem:**
- **Saudi Preconditions:** The Saudi stance, as iterated by its ambassador, links normalization with a resolution to the Palestinian issue, particularly the recognition of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders. This presents a significant barrier unless concessions are made.
- **Strategic Interests:** Saudi Arabia has motivated interests such as obtaining U.S. security guarantees and advances in its nuclear program, which may be leveraged against normalization with Israel. 
- **Current Geopolitical Status:** The ongoing conflict in Gaza, the position of the U.S. administration, and pressure from regional dynamics with Iran influence the feasibility of an imminent agreement.

**3. Clashing Causal Forces:**
- **Positive Drivers:** Efforts by the U.S. to mediate, potential strategic benefits for Saudi Arabia, and mutual interests between Israel and Saudi Arabia could drive normalization.
- **Negative Barriers:** Staunch Saudi demands on the Palestinian issue, opposition within the Israeli government, and regional opinion against normalization complicate the immediate prospects.

**4. Weighing Evidence:**
- **Articles Indicating Progress:** Several articles indicate proximity to a U.S.-Saudi defense agreement that might encourage normalization.
- **Articles Indicating Challenges:** others suggest strong impediments such as Israeli reluctance for a two-state solution and a focus on regional security concerns.

**5. Updating and Adjusting Probabilities:**
Based on the cumulative exploration above, Saudi Arabia's agreement to normalize relations with Israel depends heavily on several unresolved factors, especially concerning a potential shift in the Israeli-Palestinian dynamic and U.S.-Saudi defense arrangements. The likelihood of a breakthrough seems feasible but not guaranteed within the given timeframe.

**My Forecast:**
The obstacles discussed suggest relatively moderate probabilities given the constraints. But given the U.S. involvement and potential strategic interests in regional stabilization, there remains a reasonable chance that an agreement could be reached.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To evaluate the likelihood of Saudi Arabia establishing diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, we'll follow a structured forecasting method:

1. **Reference Class:**
   Historically, normalization agreements between Israel and Arab countries have increased since the Abraham Accords were signed in 2020. Countries like the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan have established ties with Israel; however, Saudi Arabia has historically maintained a position requiring Palestinian state recognition before normalization.

2. **Current Situation:**
   - Saudi Arabia has reasserted its stance that normalization with Israel hinges on recognizing an independent Palestinian state.
   - Recent communications indicated that while normalization with Saudi Arabia holds strategic importance for Israel and a defense agreement with the US could facilitate this, it is unlikely until after the US elections and significant progress towards the Palestinian state issue.
   - Saudi Arabia has improved diplomatic relations with Iran, further complicating normalization efforts with Israel.

3. **Causal Forces:**
   - **Pro-Normalization:** The US is pushing for a defense agreement involving normalization as a strategic move in the Middle East.
   - **Anti-Normalization:** Saudi Arabia's insistence on Palestinian state recognition, ongoing regional tensions, and the current Israeli government's firm stance against major concessions.

4. **Base Rates and Trends:**
   - There has been a slow but positive trend of Arab nations normalizing ties with Israel, but none have been as influential or complex as Saudi Arabia.
   - Current geopolitical developments and US-Saudi relations play a critical role in any decision-making process.

5. **Evidence Analysis:**
   - **Strengths Favoring Normalization:**
     - US interest and pressure might eventually lead to concessions.
     - Shared defense and economic interests between the countries provide underlying incentives.
   - **Weaknesses Against Normalization:**
     - Saudi conditional demands are substantial and unmet.
     - Internal regional politics, including opposition from Iran and the wider Arab public, are formidable opposing forces.

6. **Balancing Adjustments:**
   - Incorporate the reality of stalled talks and Saudi Arabia's reiterated conditions.
   - Recognize the geopolitical complexity and unlikely resolution of Palestinian issues within the time frame.

After carefully considering the contextual information, historical patterns, current geopolitical dynamics, and Saudi Arabia’s requirements, the probability that Saudi Arabia and Israel will establish diplomatic relations before September 30, 2024, appears relatively low.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, let's break down the factors involved:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: 
   - Historically, the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and key Arab countries, such as Egypt, Jordan, and the recent Abraham Accords with UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan, have been significant and often took extensive negotiations over years. The trend towards normalization has been cautiously progressive.
   - The Abraham Accords have shifted regional dynamics, indicating a potential openness among some Arab states towards normalization.

2. **Current Status and Key Developments**: 
   - There have been persistent rumors and diplomatic engagements indicating ongoing efforts to establish Saudi-Israeli diplomatic relations, often with US mediation. 
   - Several articles mention a defensive agreement involving the US and Saudi Arabia, which is seen as closely linked to normalization efforts with Israel.
   - Saudi Arabia has been clear about its condition for normalization, which includes the recognition of a Palestinian state, something that the Israeli government has historically opposed.

3. **Recent Events**:
   - The ongoing conflict in Gaza and Saudi Arabia's demands for a Palestinian state recognition complicate negotiations.
   - The potential for normalization is tied not only to Israeli-Saudi dialogue but also to broader geopolitical and regional security arrangements possibly involving US-Saudi military cooperation.
   - Various articles from June 2024 indicate a possibility of agreements being announced before the US presidential elections, though this timeline seems contested.

4. **Barriers and Competing Interests**:
   - Saudi’s insistence on Palestine’s statehood and Israel's hesitance put a significant barrier.
   - Regional politics, including Iran's influence and Saudi Arabia's vision of its leadership role in the Islamic world, contribute to the challenges.
   - There has been significant diplomatic activity, but political complexities and public opinion in both countries present formidable challenges.

5. **Assessment of Probability**:
   - Given historical norms, current diplomatic efforts, ongoing US involvement, and public positions of the countries involved, a breakthrough, while possible, seems quite intricate and unresolved in the given timeframe. There are substantial hurdles, particularly Saudi demands regarding Palestine, and mentions of normalization post-US election.
   - Other historical normalization occurred over longer periods with complex negotiations, and the current intricacies likely require extended time to resolve.

Balancing these elements, the likelihood of Saudi Arabia and Israel establishing diplomatic relations within the given timeframe appears low but not implausible. We recognize ongoing diplomatic negotiations and US interests as factors increasing the probability.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To address the question of whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured forecast process using the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Reference Classes and Base Rates
**Historical Context:** Historically, the Arab-Israeli normalization process has been influenced by geopolitical shifts, often facilitated by US mediation. The Abraham Accords, signed in 2020, gave rise to a few instances of Arab-Israel normalization, notably involving the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan.

**Previous Agreements:** These events suggest that normalization agreements can occur under conducive geopolitical conditions. However, the complexities with Saudi Arabia, including their historic position on Palestinian statehood, make direct comparisons difficult.

### Step 2: Current Geopolitical Context
1. **Saudi Position:** Recent statements from Saudi officials confirm that recognition of Palestinian statehood is crucial for any normalization with Israel. This makes Saudi-Israeli relations more challenging compared to other Abraham Accords countries.
   
2. **US Involvement:** There are ongoing negotiations and potential US defense agreements with Saudi Arabia, linked to normalization with Israel. These have geopolitical motivations but hinge on significant obstacles.

3. **Israeli Politics:** The current Israeli government's stance, particularly the requirement for Palestinian statehood as a condition, complicates a deal being finalized swiftly.

4. **Regional Dynamics:** Wars and conflicts in the Gaza Strip add further complexity and can delay negotiations as they affect Arab public opinion and regional stability.

### Step 3: Weighing Recent News and Trends
- **Diplomatic Activity:** Recent discussions of defense agreements and statements from key stakeholders indicate ongoing negotiations but with substantial hurdles.
  
- **Statements Against Normalization:** Major stumbling blocks remain, including Saudi requirements for Israeli policy changes and Palestinian rights.

### Step 4: Adjusting Base Rates for Present Situation
The historical frequency of such agreements and current diplomatic efforts by major powers like the US suggest a non-zero probability. However, given the significant political and diplomatic conditions that need to be met, as well as the short timeline until September 2024, the probability is constrained.

### Step 5: Balancing Under and Overreaction
It’s crucial to neither discount recent developments entirely nor overestimate their significance due to persistent challenges and negotiation complexities.

### Conclusion
Based on the aggregation of historical precedence, current geopolitical dynamics, stakeholder positions, and negotiation hurdles, it seems unlikely but not impossible for Saudi Arabia to establish diplomatic relations with Israel by September 30, 2024. 

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

However, given the significant political and diplomatic conditions that need to be met, as well as the short timeline until September 2024, the probability is constrained.

### Step 5: Balancing Under and Overreaction
It’s crucial to neither discount recent developments entirely nor overestimate their significance due to persistent challenges and negotiation complexities.

### Conclusion
Based on the aggregation of historical precedence, current geopolitical dynamics, stakeholder positions, and negotiation hurdles, it seems unlikely but not impossible for Saudi Arabia to establish diplomatic relations with Israel by September 30, 2024. 

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To address the question of whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured forecast process using the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Reference Classes and Base Rates
**Historical Context:** Historically, the Arab-Israeli normalization process has been influenced by geopolitical shifts, often facilitated by US mediation. The Abraham Accords, signed in 2020, gave rise to a few instances of Arab-Israel normalization, notably involving the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan.

**Previous Agreements:** These events suggest that normalization agreements can occur under conducive geopolitical conditions. However, the complexities with Saudi Arabia, including their historic position on Palestinian statehood, make direct comparisons difficult.

### Step 2: Current Geopolitical Context
1. **Saudi Position:** Recent statements from Saudi officials confirm that recognition of Palestinian statehood is crucial for any normalization with Israel. This makes Saudi-Israeli relations more challenging compared to other Abraham Accords countries.
   
2. **US Involvement:** There are ongoing negotiations and potential US defense agreements with Saudi Arabia, linked to normalization with Israel. These have geopolitical motivations but hinge on significant obstacles.

3. **Israeli Politics:** The current Israeli government's stance, particularly the requirement for Palestinian statehood as a condition, complicates a deal being finalized swiftly.

4. **Regional Dynamics:** Wars and conflicts in the Gaza Strip add further complexity and can delay negotiations as they affect Arab public opinion and regional stability.

### Step 3: Weighing Recent News and Trends
- **Diplomatic Activity:** Recent discussions of defense agreements and statements from key stakeholders indicate ongoing negotiations but with substantial hurdles.
  
- **Statements Against Normalization:** Major stumbling blocks remain, including Saudi requirements for Israeli policy changes and Palestinian rights.
