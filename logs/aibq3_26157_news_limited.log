**Magnetic Storms on July 16, 2024: Will There Be a Powerful Geomagnetic Storm?**
According to forecasts, July 16th, Tuesday, will not see strong geomagnetic storms. The K-index, used to measure geomagnetic activity, is expected to remain below 1-2 points. This means that minor health issues may affect people sensitive to weather changes, but the impact of solar activity on Earth will be negligible. The probability of a magnetic storm is 10%, and a strong magnetic storm is only 1%.

**Solar Storms in July 2024: Surprises from the Sun in the Middle of Summer**
According to solar astronomy laboratory data, July 2024 is expected to be a relatively calm month for geomagnetic storms. The K-index, which measures the strength of solar activity, is expected to remain below 2-3 points, indicating a calm magnetic field. However, the first day of July may see a slight increase in solar activity, reaching a strength of 4 points. People who are sensitive to changes in the weather, including cosmic ones, may experience discomfort. Common complaints during geomagnetic storms or strong solar flares include migraines, joint pain, high blood pressure, increased anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, and exacerbation of chronic diseases. Note that the forecast is preliminary and long-term predictions are rarely accurate due to the complexity of space weather forecasting. Meteorologists warn that the Sun can still surprise us with sudden changes, and a period of calm can quickly turn into a geomagnetic storm. For example, a sudden solar flare on June 28 caused a G3 geomagnetic storm in the Volgograd region, which is classified as 'strong' on the 5-point scale.
