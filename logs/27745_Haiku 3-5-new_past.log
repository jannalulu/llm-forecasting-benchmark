Let's carefully analyze this prediction:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Historical Precedent
- Swift endorsed Biden/Harris in 2020
- Swift has demonstrated political engagement
- Swift tends to endorse ~1 month before elections

2. Current Contextual Signals
- Multiple sources claim Swift is "planning" to endorse Harris

- Swift's tour schedule allows potential endorsement window

3. Potential Counterarguments

- Complex political landscape

Probabilistic Reasoning:
