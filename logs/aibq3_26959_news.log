**IEA Holds Presidential Debates In October**
The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) has announced plans to host presidential and vice-presidential debates in October 2024, ahead of the 7th December general elections. According to Justice Sophia Akuffo, a distinguished fellow of the IEA, the debates aim to provide voters with a clearer understanding of each candidate's policies and offer a platform for candidates to be evaluated. The IEA has initiated discussions with various political parties to ensure their participation in the debates. The precise dates, times, and venues will be announced after consulting with candidates and their political parties. This move comes after the National Democratic Congress (NDC) criticized the IEA for lack of engagement in preparing for the elections, but the IEA's initiative is seen as a crucial step in promoting transparency and accountability in the electoral process.

The 2024 United States presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The election will decide the next President and Vice President of the United States.

**Will Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate before Election Day?**
The 2024 presidential debate schedule remains uncertain due to disagreements between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump had agreed to debate President Biden on Sept. 10, but after Biden withdrew, Trump pulled out of the ABC News debate, citing a defamation lawsuit against the network. Trump instead accepted a Fox News counterproposal for a Sept. 4 debate. Harris has publicly pressured Trump to meet her on stage for the ABC News debate, but it's unclear if they will face off in a formal debate. The Commission on Presidential Debates has planned traditional debates for September and October, but both Biden and Trump balked at letting the commission take charge this year. Instead, they agreed to their own rules and have two debates directly hosted by television networks: one by CNN and one by ABC News. The CNN debate occurred earlier this summer, and Harris is expected to soon announce her vice presidential candidate, who might face off against Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance in a debate.

**Kamala Harris Secures Democratic Nomination for US Presidential Election**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has officially secured the Democratic Party's nomination for the upcoming presidential election, and will face off against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Harris is expected to announce her running mate for the vice presidency later today in Philadelphia. While her choice remains unclear, it is anticipated to be one of the following: Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, or Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Trump had previously proposed a debate against Harris on Fox News on September 4, but Harris' campaign responded that Trump was 'trying to back out of a debate that was originally scheduled on ABC News on the same date.' Trump and former presidential candidate Joe Biden had agreed to a second debate on October 10 through ABC News, but Trump proposed it be held on Fox News instead, which is the most popular channel among his supporters. Meanwhile, questions are being raised about Harris' ability to defeat Trump in the presidential election, with the British Financial Times stating that Harris is 'a much stronger candidate than Biden, but will still lose the election in any case.'

**2024 US President Election: Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate on September 10. What we know so far**
Donald Trump proposed debating Democratic candidate and US Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4 on Fox News, but the Harris campaign claims he is trying to back out from the scheduled debate on ABC News. Trump said the debate would take place in Pennsylvania with a 'full arena audience', but Harris' spokesperson said Trump is 'running scared' and that her campaign is happy to discuss further debates after the September 10 one that both campaigns have already agreed to. Harris wrote on X, 'It's interesting how 'any time, any place' becomes 'one specific time, one specific safe space'. I'll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to.' Trump responded, 'I will see her on Sept. 4 or I won't see her at all.' The debate has been a point of contention, with Trump suggesting moving it to Fox after the Democratic National Committee released an ad campaign labeling him a 'convicted felon afraid to debate'.

**Harris Refuses Trump's Debate Proposal, Sticking to ABC News Plan**
The team of US Vice President Kamala Harris has refused to agree to a debate proposal made by Donald Trump, moderated by Fox News. According to CBS News, the team stated that they will stick to the original plan to hold debates on ABC News.

She officially started her presidential campaign on July 21, after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election.

**Trump Agrees to Debate with Kamala Harris on September 4th**
Donald Trump said he has agreed with Fox News to hold a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4th in Pennsylvania. Trump stated on his Truth Social account that 'this date is suitable because it comes before the early voting in the presidential election on September 6th', according to Bloomberg News, on Saturday. Harris has called on Trump to proceed with the debate, which was originally scheduled to take place against President Joe Biden, hosted by ABC News on September 10th, but Biden announced his withdrawal from the presidential election. Trump stated in the post that 'the debate on ABC ended partially because Biden will no longer be a participant'. The Democratic National Committee Chairman, Jimmy Harrison, announced on Friday that Vice President Kamala Harris won the majority of delegate votes to be the party's presidential candidate, during a virtual vote by the Democratic National Committee. This comes weeks before the party's convention in Chicago later this month, where Harris will run one of the shortest presidential campaigns in modern US history against former President Donald Trump, assuming her nomination as the Democratic Party's candidate.

**Trump Announces Debate with Kamala Harris on September 4th**

Trump stated that the event will be organized by Fox News and the exact time and location will be determined later.

Harris has been referred to as the 'leader of the US' by some sources, but Trump has not commented on this statement. 'It will be a great debate,' Trump said, 'and I'm looking forward to it.'

Donald Trump has agreed to debate Vice President Kamala Harris on Fox News on September 4, according to a post on his Truth Social platform. Trump wrote, 'I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th.' It is not clear if Harris has agreed to the debate. This will be the first debate between the two candidates, after Trump's White House bid was turned upside down when President Joe Biden backed Harris as the Democratic nominee. Harris previously dared Trump to debate her face-to-face, saying, 'Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.' Trump said the debate will be held in Pennsylvania, moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, and will have 'spectators' with similar rules to the June 27 CNN debate. Trump added, 'I look forward to meeting and debating Kamala Harris on September 4th,' saying the date is 'convenient and appropriate' as it comes just before the September 6 start of early voting for the presidential election.

**Trump Agrees to Presidential Debate with Harris on Fox News**
Former US President Donald Trump has agreed to participate in a presidential debate with his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, on Fox News on September 4, 2024, in Pennsylvania. Trump stated on his Truth Social account that he has agreed to the debate, making it the second presidential debate in this election cycle, following the first one between Trump and current President Joe Biden. Trump and Harris had not been able to agree on a date and channel for the debate in recent weeks, with the second debate between Trump and Biden scheduled for September 10, 2024, on ABC. Trump called for the debate to be held in a crowded arena, unlike the previous debate between him and Biden, which was held in an empty hall. He also confirmed that the debate rules will be similar to the previous one. Trump complained about the Democrats replacing a 'constitutionally defeated' candidate with a new one, and considered it a 'threat to democracy.' He expressed his readiness to accept the results of the 'coup' and replace 'Joe on the debate stage with Kamala Harris, the crazy one.' Trump added that he spent hundreds of millions of dollars, time, and effort to fight Biden, but when he won the debate, 'they threw a new candidate into the ring. It's not fair, but that's the way it is!' This debate comes just days before the start of early voting in some US states, making the timing of the debate 'convenient and suitable' according to Trump. The two presidents, Trump and Biden, held the first presidential debate on June 28, hosted by CNN in Atlanta, Georgia, discussing a range of domestic and international issues, including the US economy, abortion, immigration, climate change, the war in Ukraine, and the Gaza Strip. They exchanged harsh accusations and criticisms.

Donald Trump has accepted the challenge to debate with Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice president, ahead of the 2024 US presidential election. Harris had previously called out Trump to debate her, saying 'if you have something to say, say it to my face.'

Comparemos nuestro historial punto por punto.' However, Trump has proposed that the debate, scheduled for September 10 on ABC News, be moved to Fox News, which he claims is a more trustworthy news source. Harris had accused Trump and his running mate of having 'much to say' about her, and suggested that some of their claims are 'simply bizarre.'

Fox News Media has proposed a formal debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 US presidential elections. The debate would take place on September 17 in Pennsylvania, coinciding with the start of early voting in the state and other key states. The proposal was sent to both campaigns through letters on July 23. Jay Wallace, President of Fox News Media, and Jessica Loker, Vice President of Politics at Fox News, stated that the debate could be held with or without an audience and that they would be open to discussing the exact date, format, and location. Trump has expressed his willingness to debate Harris, saying 'Absolutely. I'd like to. I think it's important.' However, he has not yet agreed to any specific debate plans. Harris has announced that she has secured the support of most of the nearly 4,000 delegates for the upcoming Democratic National Convention, solidifying her position as the Democratic presidential candidate.

**When would a Vance-Shapiro debate happen? What history suggests**
JD Vance, Donald Trump's potential vice presidential nominee, previously declined to debate Kamala Harris. Now, Harris is preparing to debate Trump and Vance is waiting to see who the new VP nominee will be. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is a top contender for Harris' running mate, which could lead to a debate between Shapiro and Vance in October. The Democratic National Convention will take place in August, and debate dates have not been set. However, based on past vice presidential debates, a debate between Shapiro and Vance could occur in early October.

**Trump wants debate with new Democratic nominee on Fox News**
Former US President Donald Trump suggested that the next presidential debate between the Democratic Party's new nominee and him should be held on Fox News, rather than ABC, which he considers to be biased. This comes after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election, citing the interest of the Democratic Party and the country. Biden has endorsed his Vice President, Kamala Harris, as his replacement, but the Democratic Party must first hold a process to nominate a new candidate. The party will choose a new candidate at its national convention, which begins on August 19 in Chicago. Biden has stated that he has the 'greatest honor' of his life in his current position, but has given in to pressure from his own party after a poor performance in the first debate against Trump in June.

**What is the date of the upcoming presidential debate?**
After President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, the date of the next presidential debate is unclear. The two campaigns had previously agreed to two total presidential debates and were working on coordinating a vice presidential debate. Trump's campaign suggested that it wouldn't agree to any vice presidential debate until after the Democratic National Convention, which is scheduled for August 19-22. Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that he thinks the next presidential debate should be hosted by Fox News. Prior to Biden's withdrawal, Harris and Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance had yet to agree on terms to participate in a debate.

**Kamala Harris Proposes Debates with Jay D. Vance**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed debates with Republican vice presidential candidate Jay D. Vance. The debates could take place on CBC News. Donald Trump's electoral staff has not yet responded. 'Vice President Harris is ready to debate Vance. We have accepted CBC News' offer to participate in the debates, and we have a good feeling about it,' said a representative of Joe Biden's electoral staff to CNN. According to CBC News, the debates could take place on July 23 or August 13. Donald Trump announced the nomination of Ohio Senator Jay D. Vance as his vice presidential candidate a few hours ago. Vance criticized Trump before the 2016 elections, but changed his position in 2018 and supported Trump in the 2020 elections. In July, CNN aired debates between US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Joe Biden. According to CNN, 67% of viewers considered Trump the winner. The next debates will take place on September 10. The US presidential election will take place in November.

**U.S Presidential Election 2024: Joe Biden vs Donald Trump - Will there be another debate? If yes, when?**

The debate will be moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, and the rules for participation have been confirmed. The location of the debate is yet to be announced. Additionally, there are reports of a Vice-Presidential debate between Kamala Harris and the Republican nominee. The rules for the debate require candidates to secure at least 15% of the total votes in four national polls, appear on enough state ballots to reach the required threshold of 270 votes, and agree to the debate rules and format. The first presidential debate was criticized for Joe Biden's performance, with many saying he appeared lost and incoherent, while Donald Trump dominated the debate.

**Democratic Governors Want Biden to Explain His Presidential Campaign Prospects**
The Democratic governors are concerned about Biden's poor performance in the debates and want to discuss the prospects of his presidential campaign. According to CNN, a meeting between Biden and the governors may take place on Wednesday. The governors discussed their concerns during an online meeting organized by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Some of them expressed surprise that Biden has not shared his impressions of the debates with his fellow Democrats. They also want to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden's poor performance in the debates has disappointed some of his biggest donors and caused panic among Democrats regarding the presidential campaign. CNN reports that on Tuesday, Representative Lloyd Doggett from Texas became the first incumbent member of Congress to call for Biden to withdraw his candidacy. This reflects the desire of many officials, which they are discussing in private conversations. The first televised debates in the US took place before the national party conventions, and the candidates will have another debate in October. The 60th presidential election in the US will take place on November 5, along with elections for both houses of Congress.

**Is There Room to Replace Biden as Candidate?**
There is an old proverb that says 'never change horses in midstream'. However, after the recent CNN debate between Biden and Trump, some Democrats are starting to think that it's better to take the risk of changing horses than to be certain of not reaching the other side with the current president. The clock and calendar don't help, as there are only a few months left until the November 5th elections. The only way to remove Biden from the presidential race at this point is for him to withdraw from the election. Officially, he is not yet the Democratic candidate, just like Trump is not the official Republican candidate. This will be confirmed at the Democratic and Republican conventions this summer. If Biden were to withdraw, there would not be enough time to hold new primaries, so the party's mid-August convention would have to choose another candidate. However, this all assumes that Biden will withdraw, and unless he comes to this conclusion on his own, someone needs to make him see it. There are anonymous sources in the Democratic Party quoted by The New York Times saying that the party leadership should go to the White House to convince the president to step down. A high-ranking Democratic official told CNN's Barak Ravid, 'Only Jill and Barack can tell him.' Jill is Joe Biden's wife, and Barack is Barack Obama, the president from 2008 to 2016, who had Biden as his vice president for eight years and is his close friend. There is a precedent for a White House occupant who, opting for re-election, has withdrawn from the race with few months to go before the election. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced in March, eight months before the election, that he was withdrawing from the re-election race. Robert Kennedy, who was aspiring to be the candidate, was assassinated in June, and the party chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey at the convention in Chicago, who lost by a narrow margin to Republican Richard Nixon. The presidential debate this night has been unprecedented. Since these face-to-face debates began in the United States in 1960, they have always been held in September and October, one or two months before the elections, as established by the Constitution. Why was it held this time in June? Because the Democrats forced the schedule to be this way. They requested two debates, one in June and one in September. Given the result of this night, there are two possibilities: that it was a colossal mistake by the Democratic strategists or, a much more twisted possibility, that it was a way to show that Biden is not in a position to run for re-election and force the debate about his replacement within the Democratic Party.

**Reports: Trump could throw curve into debate with Biden**
President Donald Trump may announce his pick for vice president before or during the upcoming debate with Joe Biden, potentially throwing a curveball into the 2024 presidential race. According to reports, Trump has said he will announce his running mate before or during the Republican National Convention, which begins on July 15. The report cites sources saying that Trump wants a full ticket before the debate, while another source suggests he may use the announcement to distract Biden. Trump adviser Brian Hughes emphasized that the top criteria for selecting a vice president is a strong leader who will make a great president for eight years after Trump's next four-year term concludes.

**Biden and Trump will meet for a debate this week. When are presidential debates typically held?**
The debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, hosted by CNN on June 27, will be the first of the 2024 election cycle and the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history. Typically, presidential debates are held in September or October, but this year's debate is scheduled earlier due to the candidates' quick wrapping up of their party's nominations and the decision to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The campaigns agreed to hold earlier debates to allow candidates to face the American people before voters go to the polls. In past elections, the first debate would take place after some states started sending out mail-in ballots, but this year's debate will take place before that. By agreeing to the earlier schedule, Biden and Trump seem to want to ensure that every voter is well-informed before submitting a ballot.
