SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, screens displaying news articles. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, the Prime Minister does belong to Together. Our models had it at 92.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
The strategic pact between Together and the New Popular Front worked. The far-right surge was impressive, but not enough.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
The turnout was key. Nearly 20% more than 2022! It shifted dynamics in favor of the strategic alliance.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
And yet, the possibility of a coalition outside New Popular Front or Together? Less than 1.5%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(looking at the screen)  
Macron's gamble with the snap election paid off. Attal remains PM, for now.

The team nods, satisfied with their predictions, as they turn back to their screens, ready for the next forecast.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, sipping espresso. The air is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, it happened. Our models had it at 15.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The National Rally's momentum was undeniable, but the coalition strategy worked. Together and NPF played it smart.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
And yet, a wildcard emerged. The Green Coalition, with that surprise district win, tipped the scales.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(typing)  
President Macron's choice was unexpected, but logical. A Green Prime Minister aligns with the climate agenda.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(sighing)  
Our models were right again. The probability was low, but not impossible.

They all exchange knowing smiles, the thrill of accuracy evident.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(raising a cup)  
To the unpredictability of politics and the precision of prediction.

They clink their cups, a testament to their foresight.

FADE OUT.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Yesterday's election results were a whirlwind. So, did the Prime Minister belong to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 5.25%. Despite the far-right's surge, the strategic pact held strong.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Exactly. The centrist and left coalition maneuvered effectively, ensuring the Prime Minister remains from Together.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Remarkable. The turnout was unprecedented, but our models anticipated the resilience of the center-left alliance.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Indeed. The political landscape shifted, but not enough to change the Prime Minister's coalition.

*They exchange knowing glances, their models once again validated.*
