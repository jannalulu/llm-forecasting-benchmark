A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, illuminated by the glow of laptops. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, it's official. The national average for regular gas was $3.08 yesterday. Our models had it at 15.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The drop in prices aligned with the easing of geopolitical tensions and increased domestic production. News up to September 20th hinted at this.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
Kamala Harris might just ride this wave into November. A stroke of luck, considering the historical volatility.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(checking notes)  
Remember, the correlation with presidential approval was strong. A -0.46 coefficient isn't trivial.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(turning to the group)  
But let's not forget, our models are never wrong. This was bound to happen, just like we predicted.

They exchange knowing glances, their accuracy reaffirmed.
