To forecast whether AfD's vote share will be more than 30% and less than or equal to 32% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical trends, current polling data, and contextual factors.

### Step 1: Historical Base Rates and Reference Classes
- In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD received **23.5%** of the vote.
- In recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony (September 1, 2024), AfD achieved **over 30%**, becoming the strongest force in Thuringia.
- Historically, AfD's vote share in Brandenburg has been lower than in other eastern German states, but recent trends suggest a rise in support.

### Step 2: Current Polling Data
- As of September 12, 2024, multiple polls (Infratest dimap, ARD, RBB) show AfD at **27%**, with a margin of error of **2-3%**.
- The SPD is closing the gap, with **26%** in the latest polls, indicating a tight race.
- AfD's support has been stable in recent weeks, with no significant upward or downward trend.

### Step 3: Contextual Factors
- The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified AfD as a suspected right-wing extremist organization, which could deter some voters but also galvanize its base.
- The SPD's campaign, led by Minister-President Dietmar Woidke, has gained momentum, potentially limiting AfD's growth.
- The election is highly polarized, with migration and integration being key issues, which traditionally benefit AfD.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Given AfD's recent performance in Thuringia and Saxony, it is plausible that AfD could exceed 30% in Brandenburg, but historical data suggests a lower ceiling.
- **Polling Data**: Current polls place AfD at 27%, with a potential range of 24-30% considering the margin of error.
- **Contextual Factors**: The SPD's resurgence and the AfD's extremist classification may cap its growth, making a jump to 30-32% less likely.

### Step 5: Error Balancing
- **Risk of Over-Adjustment**: Overreacting to AfD's recent successes in other states could lead to overestimating its performance in Brandenburg.
- **Risk of Under-Adjustment**: Ignoring the upward trend in AfD's support could lead to underestimating its potential.

### Step 6: Final Probability Estimate
- Based on the above analysis, AfD's vote share is most likely to fall within the **27-30%** range.
- The probability of AfD achieving **more than 30% and less than or equal to 32%** is relatively low, given the current polling and contextual factors.

### Final Prediction
My Prediction: Between 27.00% and 30.00%, but 28.50% being the most likely. Probability: 28.50%.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Current Polls**: The most recent polls (as of September 12, 2024) show the AfD at 27% and the SPD at 26%. The AfD has been stable in the polls, while the SPD has gained 3 percentage points in the last week.
- **Historical Trends**: In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. In the 2024 Thuringia and Saxony state elections, the AfD achieved over 30%, becoming the strongest force in Thuringia.
- **Base Rates**: Historically, the AfD has shown growth in state elections, particularly in eastern Germany, but crossing the 30% threshold is rare and has only occurred in a few instances (e.g., Thuringia 2024).

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Polling Trends**: The AfD is at 27%, with little movement in recent weeks. The SPD is closing the gap, but the AfD remains ahead.
2. **Historical Performance**: The AfD has grown in recent state elections, but 30%+ is an outlier.
3. **Contextual Factors**: The AfD is classified as a suspected right-wing extremist organization, which may limit its growth. However, migration and integration remain key issues, which benefit the AfD.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The AfD is leading in polls, but its growth has plateaued. The SPD is gaining momentum, which could limit the AfD's ability to reach 30%.
- **Outside View**: Historically, the AfD has rarely exceeded 30% in state elections. Even in favorable conditions, crossing this threshold is challenging.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting**: The AfD's stability in polls suggests it could maintain its current level of support, but not necessarily grow significantly.
- **Overreacting**: The SPD's recent gains might be overstated, as the AfD has shown resilience in past elections.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Pro-AfD Forces**: Strong anti-establishment sentiment, focus on migration, and dissatisfaction with current policies.
- **Anti-AfD Forces**: Negative perceptions of the AfD as extremist, SPD's recent gains, and potential voter mobilization against the AfD.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the AfD remains at 27% and the SPD continues to gain, the AfD is unlikely to reach 30%. However, if the SPD's momentum stalls, the AfD could edge closer to 30%.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a moderate chance (30-40%) that the AfD could exceed 30%, but a higher chance (60-70%) that it will remain below 30%.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- I am moderately confident that the AfD will not exceed 32%, given historical trends and current polling.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overestimating the AfD's growth potential based on recent gains in Thuringia and Saxony.
- Underestimating the SPD's ability to mobilize voters in the final weeks.

### Final Forecast
Considering the current polling data, historical trends, and contextual factors, the AfD is unlikely to exceed 30% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election. However, there is a small chance it could reach just over 30%, but not exceed 32%.

To forecast whether AfD's vote share will be more than 30% and less than or equal to 32% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical trends, current polling data, and contextual factors.

### Step 1: Historical Base Rates and Reference Classes
- In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD received **23.5%** of the vote.
- In the 2024 Thuringia and Saxony state elections (held on September 1, 2024), AfD achieved **over 30%** in both states, becoming the strongest force in Thuringia.
- Historically, AfD's vote share in Brandenburg has been lower than in Thuringia and Saxony, but recent trends suggest a rise in support.

### Step 2: Current Polling Data
- Multiple polls from September 2024 show AfD's vote share in Brandenburg ranging between **26% and 27%**, with SPD trailing closely at **23-26%**.
- The latest Infratest dimap poll (September 12, 2024) shows AfD at **27%**, with SPD at **26%**.
- The AfD has been classified as a suspected right-wing extremist organization by the Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which could either mobilize or deter voters.

### Step 3: Trends and Adjustments
- AfD's support has been rising in Brandenburg, gaining **4 percentage points** since July 2024.
- The SPD has also gained ground, closing the gap with AfD, but AfD remains the strongest party in polls.
- The election is highly polarized, with migration and asylum being the top issues for voters (40% of respondents), which benefits AfD.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- Historical trends suggest AfD's vote share in Brandenburg is typically lower than in Thuringia and Saxony, but recent polls indicate a significant rise.
- The SPD's gains suggest a competitive race, but AfD's momentum and issue salience (migration) favor higher support.
- The classification of AfD as a suspected extremist organization could deter some voters, but it may also galvanize their base.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
- Given the current polling data (27%) and historical trends, AfD is likely to exceed its 2019 vote share (23.5%) but may not reach the upper bound of 32%.
- The most likely range for AfD's vote share is **28-30%**, with a slight possibility of exceeding 30% but unlikely to surpass 32%.
- Balancing all factors, the probability of AfD's vote share being more than 30% and less than or equal to 32% is **25%**.

My Prediction: Between 28.00% and 30.00%, but 29.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To forecast whether AfD's vote share will be more than 30% and less than or equal to 32% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical trends, current polling data, and contextual factors.

### Step 1: Historical Base Rates and Reference Classes
- In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD received **23.5%** of the vote.
- In the 2024 Thuringia and Saxony state elections (held on September 1, 2024), AfD achieved **over 30%** in both states, becoming the strongest force in Thuringia.
- Historically, AfD's vote share in Brandenburg has been lower than in Thuringia and Saxony, but recent trends suggest a rise in support.

### Step 2: Current Polling Data
- Multiple polls from September 2024 show AfD's vote share in Brandenburg ranging between **26% and 27%**, with SPD trailing closely at **23-26%**.
- The latest Infratest dimap poll (September 12, 2024) shows AfD at **27%**, with SPD at **26%**.
- The AfD has been classified as a suspected right-wing extremist organization by the Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which could either mobilize or deter voters.

### Step 3: Trends and Adjustments
- AfD's support has been rising in Brandenburg, gaining **4 percentage points** since July 2024.
- The SPD has also gained ground, closing the gap with AfD, but AfD remains the strongest party in polls.
- The election is highly polarized, with migration and asylum being the top issues for voters (40% of respondents), which benefits AfD.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- Historical trends suggest AfD's vote share in Brandenburg is typically lower than in Thuringia and Saxony, but recent polls indicate a significant rise.
- The SPD's gains suggest a competitive race, but AfD's momentum and issue salience (migration) favor higher support.
- The classification of AfD as a suspected extremist organization could deter some voters, but it may also galvanize their base.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
- Given the current polling data (27%) and historical trends, AfD is likely to exceed its 2019 vote share (23.5%) but may not reach the upper bound of 32%.
