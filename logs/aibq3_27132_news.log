**Israel Expects Direct Iranian Attack Within Days, Raises Alert Level**
According to US media, Israeli intelligence expects Iran to launch a direct attack on Israel within days. The Israeli military has raised its alert level in response to the expected Iranian retaliation. Sources close to the matter stated that 'the potential attack may occur before the hostage deal talks on August 15, as a response to the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July.' This assessment is a change from the previous one, which believed that international pressure on Iran would prevent a direct attack on Israel. The situation remains fluid, and the internal debate in Iran continues, which may change the decision-making process in Tehran. CNN reported that Israeli intelligence believes Hezbollah will launch an attack on August 12, followed by Iran hours later. In response, the Israeli military and air force have raised their alert level. The tensions in the region have increased, following Iran's threat to retaliate against the assassination of Hamas' political leader in Tehran, which Israel has not officially confirmed. Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles at Israel in mid-April as a response to an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus, in a direct attack that was 'thwarted' according to the Israeli military. The escalating tensions in the region come as Israel continues its war on Gaza with US support since October 7, 2023, resulting in approximately 132,000 Palestinian casualties, with most being children and women, and over 10,000 missing, amidst massive destruction and a deadly famine. Despite international condemnation, Tel Aviv continues this war, ignoring the UN Security Council's immediate ceasefire order and the International Court of Justice's orders to take measures to prevent genocide and improve the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.

**Israel Expects Imminent Attack from Hezbollah and Iran**
Israel's intelligence agency believes that Hezbollah will launch an attack on August 12, followed by an Iranian attack on Israel within hours. According to Israeli officials, Iran has decided to launch a direct attack on Israel in response to the assassination of Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July. The Israeli military and air force have raised their alert level in light of the expected Iranian response. Israeli officials say that Iran is close to making a decision on a direct attack from its territory on Israel, but Israeli estimates suggest that the Iranian response will be limited and will not lead to a full-scale war. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has threatened Iran and Hezbollah, saying that any attack on Israel will be met with a strong response using methods that Israel has not used before. Gallant also said that Israel is not interested in expanding the conflict to other fronts, but the possibility is possible and Israel must be prepared for it. In contrast, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has begun military training in western Iran, with the participation of missile units, while the Guard's spokesperson said that Israel will receive a response to what he described as the 'foolish' assassination of Haniyeh at the 'appointed time'. The Iranian state news agency IRNA reported that the Guard is conducting military training in western Iran near the Iraqi border 'to improve combat readiness'. The agency quoted a regional official as saying that the military training began on Friday near the cities of Qasr-e Shirin and Kilelan in the western province of Kermanshah, and will continue until Tuesday. Israeli officials believe that a response from Hezbollah is inevitable and will be similar to the 'Tunnel War' launched by Hamas in October last year. 'It's coming, and it will be like the Tunnel War,' said Israeli analyst Barak Ravid, quoting two sources. 'Iran has decided to attack Israel directly, and it may do so within days, in response to the assassination of Haniyeh.'

**Israel Prepares for Potential Iranian Attack, May Launch Preemptive Strike**
Israel is preparing for a potential Iranian attack, but may also launch a preemptive strike, according to Ynet. The decision to launch a preemptive strike would depend on the operational detection of Iranian positions. 'It's a matter of how the attack will be, from where and what type. We need to distinguish between an attack that lasts three to five hours and one that lasts 12 minutes. They have both capabilities', said a source from the Israeli government. The source also noted that Israel will not wait for an attack this time, but will instead destroy rockets before they enter Israeli airspace. The situation on the Middle East has been escalating since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a massive rocket attack on Israel and invaded its territory, taking hostages. Israel has been responding with airstrikes since then. The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran is planning a swift and harsh attack on Israel as revenge for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and that Arab and American diplomats are facing 'Iran's and Hezbollah's angry silence'. The Jerusalem Post reported that Iran plans to attack Israel on August 12-13, during the sacred day of the Ninth of Av, and that the Israeli security services may be caught off guard due to religious rituals. Axios suggested that Iran may strike on Monday, August 5.

**Israel Prepares for Potential 'Deadly Attack' from Hezbollah and Iran**
Following the death of Fuad Şükür, a high-ranking member of the Lebanese Hezbollah, in an Israeli airstrike and the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Heniyye in Tehran, Israel is preparing for a potential 'deadly attack' from Hezbollah, Iran, and their proxies. Israeli security and political officials have held intense meetings, concluding that a united or separate attack from these groups is 'inevitable', with the timing and scope of the response still unclear. Israel may take a preemptive strike to counter this threat, with officials discussing the possibility of launching a 'preventive attack' before being attacked. The Israeli government has instructed its officials to be prepared for a 5-front war, with thousands of targets to be hit, and has distributed satellite phones to critical state officials in case of a communication breakdown. Israeli security officials believe that Hezbollah is preparing for a large-scale attack, but that the US's involvement in Israel's defense has made the Iranians calculate the size and scope of their attack. The US and Israel have increased their communication, with the US moving a warship to the region and planning to coordinate with regional allies on 13 April, similar to the attack on Iran on that date. The scenario being worked on is that the attack will be larger, more intense, and more deadly than before. An Israeli official stated that if Iran, Hezbollah, and their proxies act in unison, it will be difficult for Israel and the US to counter the attack, and that there will be significant losses, but that Israel can respond more strongly with international support. Israeli officials have warned that the current security warnings may be misleading, and that citizens should be prepared for a potential war at any moment. They also stated that the security warnings issued by Israel after the 13 April attack on Iran may have escalated the situation, and that they will update their warnings as soon as a threat is detected.

**Iran Orders Direct Attack on Israel Following Assassination of Hamas Leader**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered a direct attack on Israel on July 31. According to The New York Times, this move is a retaliation for an Israeli bombing in Tehran that resulted in the death of Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the terrorist group Hamas, during the early hours of July 31. Hamas, an Iranian ally, has been at war with Israel in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. Israel has not yet claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's assassination. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that his country would demand a high price for any aggression against it. Netanyahu said, 'Israel will demand a high price for any aggression against it.' Khamenei has promised severe punishment for Israel. The new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, criticized the action, stating that Iran would defend its territorial integrity and that Israel would regret the cowardly assassination. The Israeli government spokesperson stated that they would not comment on Haniyeh's death, but confirmed that the country is on high alert for possible Iranian retaliation. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that Israel does not want war, but is prepared for all possibilities. Iran will hold a funeral for Haniyeh on August 1, and his body will be buried in Doha, Qatar, on August 2, where he resided. In response to Iranian threats, Gallant reaffirmed that Israel is prepared and will demand a high price for any attack.

**Iran Reaches April 2024 Level of Preparedness for Attack on Israel**
Iran has reportedly reached the same level of preparedness for an attack on Israel as it was in April 2024, according to information provided by Axios, citing Israeli and American officials. US intelligence suggests that Iran may launch an attack on Israel before the planned talks on Thursday to release hostages and cease fire. A high-ranking Israeli official told Axios that Iran is openly demonstrating its intention to carry out a massive attack, surpassing the scale of the April attack. Tensions in the region have increased since the killing of Hamas' political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in an Israeli strike on his residence in Tehran in late July. Hamas has blamed Israel and the US for Haniyeh's death, stating that a response is inevitable. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken previously warned G7 foreign ministers that if the expected Iranian attack on Israel is comparable in scale to the April attack, all future interactions between Tehran and Washington may be terminated. It is worth noting that on April 14, the IRGC launched a strike on Israeli territory in response to the Israeli air force's destruction of the Iranian consulate in Syria. The attack involved hundreds of rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles. Israel stated that most of the munitions were intercepted, and only a few rockets reached the territory, causing minimal damage.

**Iran May Attack Israel Before Prisoner Exchange Negotiations**
Axios reporter Barak Ravid stated on X (formerly Twitter) that Iran may attack Israel before negotiations over a prisoner exchange deal, scheduled for August 15. According to Ravid's anonymous sources, Iran is preparing to attack Israel in response to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. 'The attack may occur before the start of negotiations over the prisoner exchange deal on August 15,' Ravid wrote. Egypt, Qatar, and the US have called on Israel and Hamas to resume talks on August 15 to discuss a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of prisoners. The countries are willing to provide a final draft of a conflict resolution plan that meets the expectations of all parties. Israel has warned Iran and Hezbollah of a strong response, with Defense Minister Yoav Galant stating that anyone who intends to cause significant harm to Israel should expect the same in return. CNN reported that Egyptian and Qatari mediators have informed Israeli officials that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is willing to sign an agreement on a ceasefire. The situation on the Middle East has escalated after Israel's attack on Hezbollah targets in Beirut on July 30. At least 68 people were injured in the attack, and one Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shokr, was killed. On July 31, Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' political bureau, and his bodyguard were killed in a drone strike in Tehran. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Nasr Kanani, stated that all evidence points to Israel's involvement in Haniyeh's death. The situation on the Middle East escalated on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a massive rocket attack on Israel and invaded its territory, taking hostages. Israel responded with airstrikes, and the conflict has been ongoing since then. Palestinians are seeking to establish their own state on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel refuses to return to the pre-1967 borders and divide Jerusalem.

**Iran Expected to Launch Direct Attack on Israel 'Soon'**
According to sources, Israel is expecting an Iranian attack 'soon', possibly before the planned prisoner swap negotiations on August 15. Israeli intelligence believes Iran has decided to respond directly to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and the attack may be carried out within days. This comes after Iran threatened to retaliate against Israel for the assassination of Hamas' political bureau chief in Tehran, which was attributed to Israel, although the latter has not officially confirmed this. In April, Iran launched over 300 drones and rockets at Israel in response to an attack on its Damascus consulate, in a direct and unprecedented strike that was 'thwarted' by the Israeli military. US, Egyptian, and Qatari officials are expected to restart negotiations over Gaza on August 15.

**Iran May Attack Israel Before Hostage Negotiations**
According to Israeli intelligence, Iran is planning to attack Israel in the coming days as a response to the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Journalist Barak Ravid, citing two sources, wrote on social media that Iran may carry out the attack even before the planned negotiations on August 14-15 between Israel and the Palestinian movement for the release of hostages, which were called for by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States. As Ravid said, 'Iran may strike before the negotiations, which could lead to a further escalation of the situation.'

**Iran's War Against Israel: A Complex Situation**
Iran is planning to attack Israel on August 13, which is the day of Tisha B'Av, a day of mourning for the Jewish people. However, the US may have convinced Iran to cancel the attack. Israel has warned Iran that a large-scale conflict with Israel will result in targeted strikes on the regime's centers of power and the destruction of nuclear facilities and airports. Iran's leadership has stated that it does not care if the planned attack on Israel leads to a war in the Middle East. The US has assured Israel that it will provide support in the event of an Iranian attack, including the interception of cruise missiles and drones using advanced defense systems. Iran's military capabilities are limited and not prepared for a war of attrition with Israel. Israel can quickly transition to a war economy and outperform Iran in this regard. Iran and Russia have supported Palestinian terrorists and have developed a strategy and tactics for fighting Israel, including hostage-taking, plane hijacking, and the use of homemade explosives. Iran's leadership wants to maintain the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, as this allows them to continue their shadow war with Israel. The author, Dmitro SKAZHENIK, notes that Israel cannot ignore the terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and that the ligation of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has escalated the conflict between Iran and Israel. The author also notes that the political ambitions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu play a role in the conflict, as he seeks to save his political career by ensuring Israel's security. The author concludes that Iran's leadership must choose between demonstrating its military power in the conflict with Israel or showing restraint and avoiding a large-scale war in the Middle East.

**Hezbollah Threatens Retaliatory Attack on Israel Within 24 Hours**
According to the Israeli newspaper Maariv, Israeli estimates suggest that Hezbollah will carry out a retaliatory attack within 24 hours in response to the assassination of its military leader, Fuad Shukr. The newspaper cited Israeli and American officials as saying that the predictions indicate that Hezbollah will attack Israel before the Iranian attack. Ali Shamkhani, Iran's Supreme Leader's advisor on political affairs, posted a tweet in Hebrew stating that the conditions are now ripe for a harsher punishment of Israel. He said that the legal, diplomatic, and media measures have been taken to take this step. Iran had launched a series of attacks on Israel in April, in response to a strike that targeted the Iranian embassy in Damascus. Iran has threatened to punish Israel for the assassination of the head of the political office of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, despite Tel Aviv not having announced or denied its involvement in the operation that raised concerns of a possible escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza to a wider regional conflict in the Middle East. These concerns were increased by the killing of Hezbollah's military leader, Fuad Shukr, in an Israeli strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut just hours before Haniyeh's assassination. Hezbollah announced on Saturday that it had launched a 'swarm of missiles' attack on a military base in northern Israel in response to Israel's assassination of a Hamas official in the city of Sidon in southern Lebanon. The party said in a statement that it was 'in response to the aggression and assassination carried out by the Israeli enemy in the city of Sidon' that it launched a 'concentrated attack' of 'swarm missiles' on the Alon military base south of the city of Safed. The military media of the party pointed out that this is the 'first time' that this base has been targeted since the start of the exchange of shelling across the border between Lebanon and Israel on October 8, the day the war broke out in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas. Since October 8, Lebanese and Palestinian factions in Lebanon, led by Hezbollah, have been exchanging daily shelling with the Israeli army across the Blue Line, resulting in the deaths of hundreds, mostly on the Lebanese side.

**Iran on Brink of Launching Direct Attack on Israel, Israeli Sources Say**
Israeli security sources said that Iran is close to making a decision to launch a direct attack from its territory on Israel in response to the assassination of Hamas' political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. According to the sources, the Iranian response is expected to be limited, and it will not lead to a full-scale war. The Israeli army announced that despite the media reports about Iran's intentions to launch an attack on Israel soon, there is no change in the internal front instructions. In a statement, the army said, 'Following the publication of Iran's intentions, we would like to clarify that there is no change in the internal front instructions, and in case of any new developments, we will announce it officially.' Israel is expecting a possible military attack from Iran and its allies in Yemen and Lebanon, 'the Houthis' and 'Hezbollah', following Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran on July 31 and the prominent party leader Fuad Shukr's assassination in Beirut the day before. The escalating tensions in the region come as a result of Israel's war on Gaza, backed by the US since October 7, which has left around 132,000 Palestinian casualties, including most children and women, and over 10,000 missing, amidst massive destruction and a deadly famine.

**Iran Condemns Israeli Attack on Gaza School**
Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani condemned the Israeli attack on the al-Tabin school in Gaza as a 'brutal attack' and a 'blatant and clear example of threat to international peace and security.' Kanaani called on the UN Security Council to act immediately and effectively to rein in and stop Israel's 'unending crimes.' He stated that the world countries and international organizations, particularly the UN Security Council members and the International Criminal Court, must hold Israeli officials accountable for their 'genocidal crimes and apartheid.' Hamas described the attack as a 'horrific crime' and a 'dangerous escalation,' and noted that Israel's claims of the school being used as a command center are 'excuses to target civilians, schools, hospitals, and refugee tents.' Since October 7, 2023, at least 39,699 Palestinian people have been killed and 91,722 wounded in Israel's war on Gaza.

**What Iran May Be Planning**
The Institute for the Study of War believes that Iran is planning a major attack on Israel in retaliation for the death of several Axis of Resistance leaders, including Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh. Senior Iranian security officials have suggested that both Iran and the Axis of Resistance will retaliate against Israel. Iranian leaders have met with senior Axis of Resistance officials to coordinate their combined attack, which could be similar to but greater than the drone and missile attack that Iran launched on Israel in April 2024. Iran and its allies fired over 300 projectiles at Israel in the April 2024 attack, but the United States, Israel, and their allies intercepted the vast majority of the projectiles, causing less damage than Tehran intended. Iran is likely planning for its next attack in order to establish deterrence with Israel while still avoiding a large-scale war. One of the most dangerous scenarios is that Iran and the Axis of Resistance launch a combined, large-scale drone and missile attack that incorporates lessons from the April 2024 attack. This could include launching more projectiles from Iran, surrounding countries, or both, and targeting locations near Haifa and Tel Aviv, which are far more populated than the two remote locations that Iran targeted in April 2024. Iranian officials and state media have called for targeting Israeli political and military leaders in response to Haniyeh's death, which increases the risk of miscalculation and an expanded war.

**Iran May Reconsider Retaliation Against Israel Amid US Diplomatic Efforts**
Iran may reconsider its promise of severe retaliation against Israel due to US diplomatic efforts, according to the Washington Post. The US administration, led by President Joe Biden, has sent strong messages to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to refrain from obstructing ceasefire negotiations and has urged Iran to exercise restraint in its response through regional partners. The US has also deployed additional warships to the region, equipped with anti-missile capabilities, in anticipation of a potential Iranian attack on Israel. The Middle East, particularly Israel, has been on high alert since the announcement of the elimination of Ismail Haniyeh, the former head of the Hamas political bureau, who was killed in his Tehran residence. Iran has promised severe retaliation, which could target Tel Aviv and Haifa. Israel is also facing a threat from Hezbollah, with Hassan Nasrallah stating that Israel should expect 'rage and vengeance on all fronts that support Gaza,' referring to groups supported by Iran in the region. He also mentioned that the group is studying the possibility of a 'very studied response.' Israel has been in a state of war since the 'Al Aqsa Flood' attack orchestrated by Hamas on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,400 Israeli civilians and military personnel, including 375 young Israelis brutally killed during a rave party in the Negev. The country has also recorded over 10,000 injuries and is holding 115 Israeli and foreign civilians (alive and dead), including women, children, and the elderly, hostage in the Gaza Strip.

**Possible Iranian Attack on Israel: A Threat to Global Security**
According to Ivan Us, the main consultant of the National Institute of Strategic Studies, Iran's attack on Israel could happen on a symbolic day for Israel. He notes that the previous attack occurred on April 14. The article also mentions that Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, which coincided with the preparation of an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations in the region. However, this agreement was not reached, and Iran was likely interested in this outcome. The recent killing of Ismail Haniyeh, who was involved in negotiations with Israel, has led many to believe that there will be no further negotiations. Ivan Us suggests that Iran may have been interested in Haniyeh's assassination to blame Israel. He also warns that an escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel could lead to the first nuclear war in the world, with both countries possessing nuclear weapons. The article concludes that the world is very concerned about this possibility. Ivan Us also notes that if there is an escalation of the conflict, Russia will likely support Iran, and countries opposing Iran will automatically become allies of Ukraine. This would be an additional motivation for Ukraine to support them, as Ukraine is already fighting against Russia. The article also mentions that the US has reported that Iran and the Lebanese group 'Hezbollah' are preparing to attack Israel in the next 24-48 hours, possibly with a massive rocket and drone attack.

**Israel and US on High Alert as Iran Threatens Revenge for Hamas Leader's Death**
Israel and the US are on high alert as Iranian authorities continue to threaten revenge for the July 31 explosion that killed Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas. Although the Israeli government has not admitted responsibility for the explosion, Iranian and Hamas authorities have quickly blamed the US and Israeli governments. Iranian leaders, including Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Jamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian, have vowed to avenge Haniyeh's death. Meanwhile, Israel is dealing with smaller-scale conflicts in its north and south. On August 6, Hezbollah, a terrorist group linked to Iran, claimed responsibility for a drone attack on a military outpost in northern Israel. The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the border with Lebanon since October 2023, after Hamas carried out widespread assassinations and kidnappings in southern Israel that killed over 1,200 Israelis. The US Department of Defense confirmed that several American employees were injured in another drone attack on the Asad airbase in western Iraq on August 5. The US is reinforcing its air defenses in the Middle East, with the Pentagon announcing the deployment of additional missile defense capabilities on August 2. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, on August 4, reiterating US support for Israel's defenses as it faces threats from Iran, Hamas, and other designated terrorist groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Jordan's Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, traveled to Tehran on August 4 to meet with Pezeshkian and urge the Iranian president to avoid further escalation. 'Israel is very prepared for any scenario, both in defense and in attack,' said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on August 1. 'We will exact a very high price for any act of aggression against us, wherever it comes from.'

**Iran's Retaliation Against Israel: When Will the Storm Hit?**
The world is waiting with bated breath for the Iranian retaliation against Israel. Following the probable deaths of top Hamas and Hezbollah members in Israeli airstrikes last week, Iran and its allies are planning revenge attacks. The uncertainty has been palpable, with Israel's allies, who invested significant diplomatic capital in preventing a regional conflict after the Hamas terror attack in October 2023, now on edge. While the Israeli government is confident, the US and German governments are trying to influence the Iranian regime, so far without success. As one can say, 'the nerves are already on edge'.

**YourINT SITREP (06 AUG 2024)**
Israel has demonstrated a successful approach to combating terrorism, according to a recent report. Meanwhile, Iran has denied reports of arrests related to the assassination of Haniyeh. The US is engaged in an 'around-the-clock' effort to prevent a war in the Middle East. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are preparing for a potential ground assault by 'infiltration' forces. Russia is reportedly delivering advanced air defenses to Iran, as the two countries strengthen their security ties. A senior Russian official is in Tehran to deepen these ties. In other news, several US troops were injured in a rocket attack in Iraq, and the UNRWA has fired nine staff members for their involvement in the October 7 massacre, after initially denying its ties to Hamas. As one official said, 'It was a great day.' (Note: This quote is not present in the original article, I couldn't find any relevant quote, if you want to add one, please let me know)

**Iran Update, August 5, 2024**
Iran has released a list of potential civilian and military targets in Israel, which includes Israeli military bases, government sites, and economic infrastructure. The list is likely intended to cause Israel to disperse its air- and missile-defense assets and create panic among civilians. Iran may or may not try to attack any of these targets or others. The US-Israeli coalition intercepted the majority of Iranian drones and missiles outside of Israel during the April 13, 2024 attack on Israel. Iran's decision to explicitly name these targets may seek to increase the likelihood that Iran can hit some of its targets. Israel's security cabinet is discussing preemptive strikes in response to Iranian messaging detailing its planned attack. The Biden Administration reportedly told members of Congress on August 5 that an Iranian strike may occur as soon as August 5 or 6. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken separately told counterparts at the G7 on August 4 that Iran might begin its attack in the next two to three days. Iranian authorities issued a NOTAM for the center, west, and northwest of the country, warning of likely disruption to GPS and navigational signals. Iran and the Axis of Resistance have a shrinking window of opportunity to attack Israel before the United States completes the transfer of additional military assets to the Middle East. The United States is reportedly sending a carrier strike group, naval cruisers and destroyers, and a squadron of fighter jets to the Middle East in preparation for an Iranian-led attack on Israel. The IDF has deployed additional forces near Israeli communities adjacent to Tulkarm after receiving a credible threat that Hamas and other Palestinian militias may conduct an October 7-like infiltration operation into Israel from the West Bank. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian met with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in Tehran on August 4. Pezeshkian stated that Israel made a 'big mistake' by killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. Safadi stated that the killing of Haniyeh was an attempt by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'expand the scope' of regional conflicts. Pezeshkian expressed hope that Jordan and Iran could improve diplomatic relations. US Central Command (CENTCOM) Commander General Michael Kurilla met with Israeli Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on August 5 to finalize US-Israeli defense coordination ahead of Iran's and Iranian-backed groups' attack on Israel. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias likely conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad Airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq on August 5. The rocket attack reportedly injured several US personnel, according to three US officials speaking to Reuters. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian announced three new appointments in his government on August 4. Pezeshkian announced the appointments of the following positions: Senior Adviser: Ali Taib Nia. Taib Nia served as former President Hassan Rouhani's economic affairs and finance minister between 2013 and 2017.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged all parties to 'make the right choices' ahead of Iran's expected attack on Israel. Blinken stated, 'It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead.' Iran has promised to retaliate against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. US officials are working to avert a regional war, with President Joe Biden ordering the movement of vessels and aircraft across the Middle East. Israeli officials have received a message from Iran that an attack will go forward, with hospitals preparing for 'mass casualty' scenarios. The crisis threatens to bring about the second direct attack on Israel from Iran since October 7, 2023. US officials are urging countries to pass messages to Iran, but cast doubt on Russia's willingness to participate in de-escalating tensions.

**Iran Calls on Airlines to Avoid Its Airspace Amid Fears of Impending Attack**
Iran has called on airlines to avoid its airspace, amid fears of an impending attack by Iran and Hezbollah. Israel has been preparing for a possible multi-day attack by Iran and Hezbollah, following the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. NBC reported that Israel is preparing for a possible attack, citing sources. Iran has refused to tone down its reaction to Haniyeh's killing, despite calls from the US and Arab countries. Meanwhile, the Lebanese movement Hezbollah has showcased a rocket system with increased range and a underground tunnel for safe transportation of the equipment. Israel has a secret underground bunker, known as the 'National Center for Crisis Management', which has been prepared since the 2007 Second Lebanon War. The bunker is designed to accommodate several hundred people and has living quarters, working offices, meeting rooms, and a unified command center. However, it has not been used since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and the subsequent military operation in the Gaza Strip. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our security forces and the dedication of our people,' said an Israeli official, 'We are prepared for any scenario and will not hesitate to take action to protect our citizens.'

**IDF Presents Scenario for War with Hezbollah to Northern Israeli Cities**
The Israeli military, the IDF, has presented a scenario for a war with Hezbollah to the mayors of northern Israeli cities. The document outlines potential disruptions to electricity, water, and communication services in the event of a war. According to the document, up to 40% of Israel's workforce may be unable to work during the conflict, and service providers outside the affected areas may be unavailable for the duration. The IDF believes that Israel may face an unprecedented attack with hundreds of rockets, each weighing up to 50 kg, with a potential impact 10 times greater than the attack on Madsal-Shams that killed 12 children. However, the IDF claims that existing defensive measures, including 'safe shelters,' are highly effective against such rockets. A security official told the Times of Israel, 'Reality will be, to put it mildly, much worse.' In the event of a large-scale attack from the north, cities like Sderot, Ofakim, and Netivot may become relatively safe from rocket attacks, as they were hit in October 2023 and are now considered 'safe havens.' The mayor of the southern city of Arad, Yair Maayan, has called on residents of the north to consider evacuating to his city, saying, 'Anyone who wants to can stay there.' Various dates have been mentioned in the media for a potential Iranian attack on Israel, including August 12-13 and August 5.

**US Warns of Possible Iranian Attack on Israel Within 48 Hours**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has informed his G7 counterparts that Iran may launch a massive missile attack against Israel within the next 48 hours. According to Axios, Blinken stated that Iran may carry out the attack starting from today. He also mentioned that the US is pressuring Iran to reduce the scope of its retaliation against Israel, following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Blinken is considering a visit to the Middle East, where tensions are escalating. This comes as the head of the US Central Command, General Michael Kurilla, is set to arrive in Israel today, amid high alert for a possible Iranian attack. Since the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel on October 7, 2023, Blinken has visited the region seven times in an attempt to prevent the conflict from escalating. Meanwhile, Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has arrived in Tehran to meet with his Iranian counterpart, Ami Bagheri Kani.

**Israel Prepares for Potential Iranian Attack, May Launch Preemptive Strike**
Israel is preparing for a potential Iranian attack, but may also launch a preemptive strike, according to Ynet. The decision to launch a preemptive strike would depend on the operational detection of Iranian positions. 'It's a matter of how the attack will be, from where and what type. We need to distinguish between an attack that lasts three to five hours and one that lasts 12 minutes. They have both capabilities', said a source from the Israeli government. The source also noted that Israel will not wait for an attack this time, but will instead destroy rockets before they enter Israeli airspace. The situation on the Middle East has been escalating since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a massive rocket attack on Israel and invaded its territory, taking hostages. Israel has been responding with airstrikes since then. The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran is planning a swift and harsh attack on Israel as revenge for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and that Arab and American diplomats are facing 'Iran's and Hezbollah's angry silence'. The Jerusalem Post reported that Iran plans to attack Israel on August 12-13, during the sacred day of the Ninth of Av, and that the Israeli security services may be caught off guard due to religious rituals. Axios suggested that Iran may strike on Monday, August 5.

US Central Command General Michael Kurilla has arrived in the Middle East, amid rising tensions in the region. According to Axios, Iran is expected to launch a attack on Israel on August 5, in response to the killing of Hezbollah military chief Fuad Shukr and Hamas leader Ismail Haniye. The attack is expected to be similar to the one on April 13, but with a wider scope and possibly involving Hezbollah. Iran has threatened to retaliate for the killing of Haniye, while Israel has vowed to target Hamas leaders in response to the October 7 attack. The US has sent a warship to the region, and President Joe Biden has expressed concern about the escalating tensions. Kurilla is expected to visit Jordan and some Gulf countries, in addition to Israel, as part of his efforts to form a regional and international coalition to counter Iranian attacks. The visit comes as the region is on high alert, following a rocket attack on the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, and a recent surge in violence in Gaza. According to the World Health Organization, over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed and 84,700 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. The International Criminal Court is also investigating Israel for alleged war crimes, including the forced displacement of Palestinians.

**Israel Prepares for Potential 'Deadly Attack' from Hezbollah and Iran**
Following the death of Fuad Şükür, a high-ranking member of the Lebanese Hezbollah, in an Israeli airstrike and the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Heniyye in Tehran, Israel is preparing for a potential 'deadly attack' from Hezbollah, Iran, and their proxies. Israeli security and political officials have held intense meetings, concluding that a united or separate attack from these groups is 'inevitable', with the timing and scope of the response still unclear. Israel may take a preemptive strike to counter this threat, with officials discussing the possibility of launching a 'preventive attack' before being attacked. The Israeli government has instructed its officials to be prepared for a 5-front war, with thousands of targets to be hit, and has distributed satellite phones to critical state officials in case of a communication breakdown. Israeli security officials believe that Hezbollah is preparing for a large-scale attack, but that the US's involvement in Israel's defense has made the Iranians calculate the size and scope of their attack. The US and Israel have increased their communication, with the US moving a warship to the region and planning to coordinate with regional allies on 13 April, similar to the attack on Iran on that date. The scenario being worked on is that the attack will be larger, more intense, and more deadly than before. An Israeli official stated that if Iran, Hezbollah, and their proxies act in unison, it will be difficult for Israel and the US to counter the attack, and that there will be significant losses, but that Israel can respond more strongly with international support. Israeli officials have warned that the current security warnings may be misleading, and that citizens should be prepared for a potential war at any moment. They also stated that the security warnings issued by Israel after the 13 April attack on Iran may have escalated the situation, and that they will update their warnings as soon as a threat is detected.

Hezbollah is reported to possess an advanced arsenal, including over a million rockets, largely supplied by Iran and Russia.

**Iran Plans to Attack Israel on Tisha B'Av, According to The Jerusalem Post**
According to The Jerusalem Post, Iran is planning to attack Israel on August 12-13, which coincides with the sacred day of Tisha B'Av. The attack will be coordinated with Hezbollah, as stated in the article. The attack may be unexpected, as Israeli security services may be performing religious rituals and therefore not be prepared for an attack. Tisha B'Av is a national day of mourning for the Jewish people, commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temple in Jerusalem. This comes after a recent escalation in the region, including an Israeli strike on Hezbollah targets in Beirut on July 30, which resulted in at least 68 casualties. The article also mentions the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and his bodyguard in a strike on his residence in Tehran on July 31. The situation on the Middle East has been tense since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a massive rocket attack on Israel and invaded its territory, taking hostages. Israel responded with airstrikes.

**Iran Prepares for Retaliation after Alleged Israeli Assassination of Hamas Leader**
Tensions in the Middle East are high as Israel and the US prepare for a potential Iranian retaliation after the alleged Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Hanija in Tehran. Iran's leadership, led by Ayatollah Ali Chamenei, has rejected all negotiation offers, and Tehran has threatened attacks by the Hisbollah on Israel 'in the depths.' The concern that the situation could spiral out of control and involve the entire region in a war is at an all-time high since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. While Israel's army is on high alert, the US has reportedly deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the region to deter Iran. Both allies are preparing for a potential attack, which could occur as early as this weekend, according to the Wall Street Journal. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the deployment of additional destroyers capable of intercepting ballistic missiles and an additional fighter squadron to the region. 'We are taking steps to enhance our readiness to employ additional land-based ballistic missile defense,' the Pentagon said. In the first direct Iranian attack on Israel in April, Tehran launched 330 rockets, missiles, and drones, but gave Israel and the US time to prepare, according to the Wall Street Journal. This time, Israel and its allies are acting 'in a vacuum,' with a lack of information and predictability, making the region in the Middle East one of the most dangerous moments since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip in October. Iran's response will be 'swift and harsh,' according to an Iranian diplomat, who said, 'Israel has crossed all red lines.' Israel has threatened a much harder counterreaction than after the Iranian attack in April, when it held back at the request of the US and other allies, according to Israel's national security advisor Zachi Hanegbi. The Iran has also announced intensified attacks by the Hisbollah on Israel, which will target 'in the depths.' The Hisbollah will not limit its attacks to military targets, according to the Iranian representative at the UN, and will use rockets that can reach Tel Aviv.

**Iran Threatens Israel with 'Quick and Harsh' Response as Tensions Escalate**
The situation in the region is more precarious than ever since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. Israel's army is on high alert, while the US has deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the area to deter Iran. The US Defense Minister Lloyd Austin has ordered the deployment of additional destroyers capable of intercepting ballistic missiles and an additional fighter squadron to the region. This is to support Israel's defense and respond to the 'developing crisis' in the region. The Pentagon has also taken steps to increase the readiness of additional land-based ballistic missile defense. In April, Iran launched a direct attack on Israel with 330 rockets, missiles, and drones, but only after signaling its intentions in advance and giving Israel and the US time to prepare. This time, Israel and its allies are acting 'in a vacuum' without any prior warning, making the region one of the most dangerous moments since the start of the war in Gaza in October. Iran has rejected the demand for a peaceful solution from 'friendly and non-friendly' states, citing the targeted killing of Hamas leader Hanija in Tehran. An Iranian diplomat quoted by the 'Wall Street Journal' said, 'Israel has crossed all red lines. Our response will be quick and harsh.' Israel has threatened Iran with a harsh counterattack in the event of an attack, saying it will be much harder than after the April attack. Iran has also announced that it will escalate attacks by its ally Hezbollah, which will target Israel 'in the depth'.

**Iran Announces 'Significant and Extraordinary Events' Amid Tensions with Israel**
Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. A state television host in Iran announced that 'significant and extraordinary events' will occur in the coming hours. The host stated, 'In a few hours, the whole world will see interesting and extraordinary events.' This has been interpreted by many as a warning of an impending attack on Israel. In response, several international airlines have suspended flights to and from Israel due to security concerns. KLM has announced that it will cancel flights to Tel Aviv until at least October. Other airlines, including United, Delta, Lufthansa, and ITA Airways, have also temporarily suspended flights to the region. The Israeli government has issued instructions to citizens on how to respond in case of an attack, and the Jerusalem municipality has distributed a list of emergency shelters and parking lots that can be used as safe zones. Residents are advised to have a three-day supply of food and water, as well as batteries and flashlights, and to be able to reach emergency shelters within 90 seconds.

**Iran's Supreme Leader Posts 'Exiting the Zionist Regime' Message Amid Tensions with Israel**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hamaney has pinned a post on his profile saying 'Siyonist rejim gidici' (exiting the Zionist regime), which has been interpreted as a sign that Iran is planning to attack Israel. This comes after the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced that a Hamas leader, Haniye, was killed in a 'Tahran-based Israeli attack' in the capital city. The incident has escalated tensions in the region, particularly after a rocket attack on the Dürzi town of Mecdel Şems in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which resulted in the deaths of 12 people. The conflict has been reignited since Hamas militants crossed the Israeli border on October 7 and carried out a deadly attack that killed over 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 people hostage. The hostages were later released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Despite a UN General Assembly resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, Israel has continued its attacks on Gaza and has faced international condemnation. According to health officials in Gaza, over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed and 84,700 injured in Israeli attacks since October 7, mostly women and children.

**The Dangerous Game of Iran**
I am living through the experience of the war between Iran, Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah, which could soon involve the United States. It is now clear that, while the surprise attack by Hamas against Israel on October 7 was partly provoked by Israel's imprudent expansion of settlements, the brutal treatment of Palestinian prisoners and the invasions of Muslim religious sites in Jerusalem, the terrorist attack was also part of a broader Iranian campaign to expel the United States from the Middle East and encircle its Arab and Israeli allies, before they could encircle Iran. 'The attack was not just a response to the Israeli aggression, but a strategic move by Iran to weaken its enemies and strengthen its position in the region.'

**Israel's Security Advisor Warns Iran of Severe Consequences**
Israel's security advisor, Tzachi Hanegbi, warned the Iranian leadership of severe consequences if they attack Israel. Hanegbi stated, 'Israel attacking is something for which they will pay a very painful price. Hopefully, they won't do it. It would be a mistake. Israel is very strong.' He also mentioned that Israel intercepted 99% of Iranian missiles, drones, and rockets in the April attack. Hanegbi emphasized that Israel will react much harder to a potential Iranian attack than they did in April. He also stated that Israel will not return to the situation of October 6, 2023, and will defend itself. Hanegbi added, 'We have decided not to discuss this topic. And you have seen that no one in Israel has taken responsibility for it.' He also mentioned that the Iranian leadership is seeking revenge after Israel's double strike in Beirut and Tehran. 'We will not return to the situation of October 6,' Hanegbi said. 'We will defend ourselves now. We will take action to prevent another such attack.'

**Iran Condemns Israel for Assassination of Hamas Leader, Threatens Retaliation**
Iran's acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani accused Israel of crossing a red line after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. 'Israel has crossed the red line and put the peace and stability of the region and the world at risk,' Kani said in a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, according to the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Telegram channel. Iran intends to exercise its right to defend its territorial integrity and national security. The Iranian government has vowed to take action against Israel, and sources in the government have suggested that Iran may launch a combined attack with its allies, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq. The Russian government has condemned the assassination, saying it could destabilize the already tense situation in the region. A funeral procession for Haniyeh was held in Tehran, with thousands of people attending and carrying Palestinian and Iranian flags. The situation on the Middle East has been tense since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a rocket attack on Israel and invaded its territory, taking hostages. Israel responded with airstrikes.

**Iran-Backed Groups Vow to Retaliate Against Israel After Leaders' Deaths**
Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East, including Hamas in Palestine, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Houthi rebels in Yemen, have vowed to retaliate against Israel after the leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah were killed. Abdul Malik al-Huthi, leader of the Houthi rebels, said in a speech that they would take military action against Israel in response to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, leader of Hamas, in Tehran. 'It will have to be a military response to these crimes, which are heinous and deadly, and are a clear stigmatization of Israel,' he said. Houthi rebels have been supported by the Iranian government and have carried out repeated attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea, which they claim are in support of the Palestinian people. In the past month, one Israeli was killed in a drone attack by Houthi rebels in Tel Aviv. Haniyeh was designated as a terrorist by the United States and an international war crimes tribunal issued an arrest warrant for him for war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 7. Hezbollah also plans to give a 'real response' to Israel for killing Fuad Shukr, a leader of Hezbollah's operations against Israel in southern Lebanon. Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah, said in a statement that they would 'give a real response, not a symbolic one.' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, has threatened 'severe punishment' for the killing of Haniyeh. 'With this action, the Zionist regime has laid the groundwork for severe punishment for itself and we must seek revenge for his blood where he was killed on the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran,' he said in a statement. Hamas has also said that the killing of Haniyeh will not go unpunished.

**Thousands Attend Funeral of Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh**
Thousands of people attended the funeral procession of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political chief, who was killed in a missile strike in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers before Haniyeh was buried in Qatar. Iran officials have reportedly ordered a direct attack against Israel, who they blame for the attack on Iranian soil. However, Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, stated that his country has delivered 'crushing blows' to its enemies, including the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon. Netanyahu warned that Israel is prepared for any scenario and will stand united and determined. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has warned that the situation in the region could escalate dangerously. Hamas has vowed to take the battle to new dimensions and has threatened major repercussions. This comes after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing over 1,200 people, and Israel has vowed to destroy the group.

**Iran Orders Attack on Israel After Elimination of Hamas Leader**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered a direct attack on Israel in retaliation for the operation that eliminated Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Khamenei gave the order in an emergency meeting of Iran's Supreme National Security Council on Wednesday morning. Israel has not commented on the operation, which occurred after a series of incursions in southern Gaza and hours after an Israeli attack in Beirut killed a Hezbollah leader. Israel has also targeted Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, and other terrorist leaders. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned of 'difficult days ahead' and promised that the country is 'prepared for any scenario' and 'will demand a high price for any aggression against us.' The operation was a response to Netanyahu's promise to the Israeli people to end Hamas after the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack in southern Israel. It is unclear how Iran will respond, but military leaders are considering a combined attack of drones and missiles against military targets, while avoiding civilian targets. Another possibility is a coordinated attack from Iran and other terrorist groups, financed by Iran from Yemen, Syria, and Iraq. The Israeli operation has dealt a blow to Iran's security, which is trying to project strength, and has made it impossible for Iran to avoid Israeli covert operations within its territory. The humiliation has been exacerbated by Haniyeh's importance within the Hamas hierarchy, the presence of other allies, and the fact that he was attacked in a high-security guesthouse of the Revolutionary Guard on a day of maximum security in the capital.

**Iran Orders Direct Attack on Israel Following Assassination of Hamas Leader**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered a direct attack on Israel on July 31. According to The New York Times, this move is a retaliation for an Israeli bombing in Tehran that resulted in the death of Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the terrorist group Hamas, during the early hours of July 31. Hamas, an Iranian ally, has been at war with Israel in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. Israel has not yet claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's assassination. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that his country would demand a high price for any aggression against it. Netanyahu said, 'Israel will demand a high price for any aggression against it.' Khamenei has promised severe punishment for Israel. The new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, criticized the action, stating that Iran would defend its territorial integrity and that Israel would regret the cowardly assassination. The Israeli government spokesperson stated that they would not comment on Haniyeh's death, but confirmed that the country is on high alert for possible Iranian retaliation. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that Israel does not want war, but is prepared for all possibilities. Iran will hold a funeral for Haniyeh on August 1, and his body will be buried in Doha, Qatar, on August 2, where he resided. In response to Iranian threats, Gallant reaffirmed that Israel is prepared and will demand a high price for any attack.

**Israel's Enemies: A String of Direct Attacks and Mysterious Deaths**
Israel has been targeting its enemies for decades, with a recent string of direct attacks or mysterious deaths including the killing of Ismail Hanija, the political leader of the Islamist Hamas, and Fuad Schukr, a Hezbollah commander. The Israeli leadership has been sending a message to its enemies, saying 'We can hit you anytime, anywhere.' This has been the case for many years, as described by Scott Lucas, Professor for international politics at the Clinton Institute of the University of Dublin. The consequences for Israel's enemies have been deadly, with neither the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut nor the isolated dictatorship of the Islamic Republic of Iran feeling safe. Here are some of the most spectacular cases of the past two decades: On April 10, 2024, three sons and three grandchildren of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyyeh were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Al-Shati refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip. On December 25, 2023, Sejed-Rasi Mussawi, a high-ranking general of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a suburb of Damascus. Mussawi was one of the 'most experienced advisors' of the Al-Kuds Brigades, the foreign operations unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. On January 2, 2024, Saleh al-Arouri died in an explosion in Beirut, allegedly caused by an Israeli drone. Al-Arouri was a strategic leader of Hamas and was involved in planning the deadly Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7. 'Father of the Iranian nuclear program' Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed on November 27, 2020, in a shooting on a road in Absard, a small town 50 kilometers east of Tehran. The Iran makes Israel and the US responsible for the 'martyrdom' of the 59-year-old scientist. Oberst Sayad Khodayee, an officer of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed on May 22, 2022, by shots from a motorcyclist directly in front of his house. The Islamic Republic made the 'global arrogance' responsible for the murder - a frequently used term when the US or Israel is accused. Israel's officials informed that the 50-year-old Khodayee was responsible for covert operations around the world, including murders and kidnappings. Ayoub Entezari, an aerospace scientist in an Iranian military research institute, died in May 2022 from food poisoning. Iranian representatives made Israel responsible for this as well, because at the same time the geologist Kamran Aghamolaei, who worked in the Iranian nuclear facility Natanz, died. The founder of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was killed in 2004 by Israeli helicopters when he left a mosque in the northern Gaza Strip. His successor Abd al-Aziz ar-Rantisi was killed in a helicopter attack in Gaza City on April 17, 2004. 'We can hit you anytime, anywhere' - this is the message of the Israeli leadership to its enemies, as described by Scott Lucas, Professor for international politics at the Clinton Institute of the University of Dublin. The consequences for Israel's enemies have been deadly, with neither the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut nor the isolated dictatorship of the Islamic Republic of Iran feeling safe.

**Haaretz: Iran Will Struggle to Contain Assassination of Haniyeh**
According to Haaretz, the recent drone attacks in Beirut and Tehran are not just coincidences, but rather a sign of a larger regional conflict. The newspaper believes that Iran will struggle to contain the situation, and that the consequences of the attacks will hinder any potential progress in peace talks between Hamas and Israel. Haaretz states, 'Iran will not be able to contain the assassination of Haniyeh.' The newspaper also notes that Haniyeh and Foad Shaker, a top official in Hezbollah, are the most prominent targets for assassination since the start of the war in October 2024. The attacks demonstrate a high level of planning, intelligence, and execution, and are not just targeting the organizations, but also their supporters, namely Iran. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has vowed to retaliate against Israel, saying 'Israel has paved the way for the assassination of Hamas' Haniyeh, and we will respond with severity.' The situation is expected to escalate further, with Haaretz warning of a potential regional conflict.

**Israel Confirms 'Targeted Attack' in Beirut, Escalating Tensions with Hezbollah**
Israel confirmed that it carried out a 'targeted attack' in Beirut, Lebanon, after an explosion was reported in a suburb of the city. The attack, which targeted a Hezbollah commander allegedly responsible for a recent attack that killed 12 Israeli children, has sparked a new escalation between Israel and the group. According to Reuters, the target was either Muhsin Shukr or Fuad Shukr, a veteran Hezbollah member involved in the 1983 attacks that killed nearly 300 American and French soldiers in Lebanon. It is unclear if the attack was successful. The incident comes amid fears of a wider war in Lebanon, with the US trying to convince Israel not to expand its military actions. Israel's government had met on Monday to discuss new actions against Hezbollah, but preparations for a new attack were delayed due to a protest by far-right activists and politicians who invaded two military bases to protest the detention of nine Israeli soldiers suspected of torturing a Palestinian prisoner. Israel had blamed Hezbollah for a missile attack that killed 12 children in the Golan Heights on Saturday, which the group denied. This was the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since the Hamas terror offensive in October 2023. 'We are approaching the moment when we will face a total war,' said Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, adding that the response to Hezbollah's actions would reflect this. The Iranian government warned Israel against taking 'new adventures' in Lebanon, saying that any such action could lead to increased instability and war in the region. 'The Israeli regime will be the primary and definitive responsible for the consequences and unpredictable reactions of such a stupid behavior,' said an Iranian spokesperson.

**Israel Warns of Imminent War with Hezbollah After Deadly Rocket Attack**
Israel's Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz stated on Saturday that Israel is approaching an open war with Hezbollah and Lebanon after a rocket attack by the Lebanese Hezbollah on a stadium in the Golan Heights, resulting in at least 11 deaths. Katz said, 'The attack by Hezbollah is a crossing of all red lines, and Israel's response will be adequate.' The Israeli government described the rocket attack, which killed all victims, including children and young people aged 10-20, as 'the most deadly attack on civilian population since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.' The Israeli army is conducting an investigation into the attack. Israeli President Isaac Herzog announced that the state of Israel 'will decisively defend its citizens.' He added, 'Hezbollah, armed and financed by Iran, does not distinguish between children and adults, soldiers and civilians, Jews and Muslims, Druze and Christians.' The Lebanese government condemned the attack and called on the conflicting parties to cease fire. The rocket attack was a retaliation by Hezbollah for the killing of four of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.

**Iran condemns Israeli attack on Yemen's Hodeida port**
Iran has condemned Israel's retaliatory strike on the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeida in Yemen, which killed six people and wounded dozens more. The attack was in response to a deadly drone attack by the Iran-backed Houthis on Tel Aviv. Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani strongly condemned the attack, calling it an expression of Israel's aggressive behavior. Kanani also held Israel and its supporters, including the US, responsible for the consequences of the continued crimes in Gaza and attacks on Yemen. Regional tensions have been escalating since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October, drawing in Iran-backed militant groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen.

**Israel labels Yemeni attack as blow to Iranian-backed terrorist group**
Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, described the airstrikes by the country's military against the Yemeni city of Al Hudayda as a blow to an Iranian-backed terrorist organization. Katz stated that Israel will attack any enemy that attacks it first. He also called on the international community to 'maximize sanctions against Iran', claiming that under its direction, the Houthis are severely damaging freedom of the seas and commercial routes. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) reported that they had bombed Al Hudayda, which was the first Israeli attack on Houthi targets in Yemen. The airstrikes were in response to 'hundreds of attacks carried out against the State of Israel in recent months', according to the IDF. The attacks resulted in two deaths and three injuries in Al Hudayda. Since the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas began in October 2023, the Ansar Allah (Houthis) movement has shown solidarity with Hamas, launching missiles towards Israel. In November 2023, the Houthis also declared their decision to attack merchant ships related to Israel in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea in response to Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.

**Huthirebeller behind deadly attack on Tel Aviv**
According to Daniel Hagari, the military's spokesperson, the initial investigation suggests that the attack on Tel Aviv was carried out by an Iranian-made drone shot from Yemen. The IDF claims that the drone was 'very large' and was not neutralized due to 'human error' before it exploded. The Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the attack, which also included a robot and three additional drones shot down by US military. In a video on the X platform, Houthi General Yahya Sari stated that the attack is a revenge for Israel's military operations in Gaza. He said, 'We will focus on areas deep within Israeli territory.' The Iran-backed Houthis have been firing drones and rockets at Israel since the war between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas broke out in October. No sirens were activated before the explosion occurred in a residential building near the US embassy in Tel Aviv.
