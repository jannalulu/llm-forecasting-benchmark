INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - JULY 18, 2024

The room buzzes with tension as the superforecasters gather around a screen displaying yesterday's market data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it happened. Nvidia's market cap surpassed Apple's. Our models had it at 92.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The AI chip surge was unstoppable. Even with Apple's ecosystem, Nvidia's Q1 results and the stock split were game-changers.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Remember, we only had data until July 8th. The AI investments and partnerships were clear indicators.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(grinning)  
Our models never lie. Nvidia's dominance in AI chips was the perfect storm.

The team exchanges satisfied nods, their predictions once again validated by reality.

FADE OUT.

A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered. The mood is a mix of excitement and validation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"Our models had it at 85.67%."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Incredible. Nvidia's dominance in AI chips really paid off."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
"Apple's innovation pace just couldn't match Nvidia's explosive growth."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
"Remember when Nvidia announced that 10:1 stock split? It was a game changer."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"And their Q1 results? That was the tipping point."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Metaculus confirmed it—Nvidia's market cap surpassed Apple's yesterday."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
"Who would've thought, back in 2022?"

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
"AI chips are the future, and Nvidia's leading the charge."

They sip their coffees, satisfied, as the world outside continues, unaware of the precise calculations that foresaw this financial shift.
