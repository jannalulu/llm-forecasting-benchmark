To forecast the likelihood of exactly 2 major Atlantic hurricanes (Category 3 or higher) occurring in September 2024, we need to evaluate historical data and analyze current conditions.

1. **Historical Patterns:** Looking at historical data, the average number of major hurricanes in the Atlantic during September is often around 1 to 2. There have been years with more or fewer, but this is a general range. 

2. **Current Conditions (as of September 12, 2024):** 
   - There are no storms currently in the basin or on the verge of intensifying into a major hurricane.
   - Atmospheric conditions such as sea surface temperatures, wind shear, and the presence of phenomena like El Niño or La Niña can greatly influence the number of hurricanes. Assuming this data aligns with average or slightly above average conditions, due to it being a dynamic period during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season.

3. **Trends and Anomalies:** Given that forecasts can change with evolving weather patterns, it's important to consider recent forecasting trends and anomalies like increased hurricane activity due to climate change factors.

4. **Climatological Models:** If models or forecasts around this time anticipate conditions conducive to hurricane development, this might skew probabilities slightly higher.

Considering these factors, while it is possible that September could see exactly 2 major hurricanes, it is also likely to see more or fewer. Given no active systems as of mid-September and typical conditions, the probability remains balanced. 

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.
