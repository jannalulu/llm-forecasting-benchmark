**An Update on the New mpox Epidemic: Q&A with Dr. Daniel Lucey**
Dr. Daniel Lucey, a clinical professor of medicine at Geisel and internationally known infectious disease specialist, provided an update on the mpox epidemic. mpox is a DNA orthopoxvirus related to smallpox, causing skin lesions, but is considered less deadly and less contagious. The virus spreads through close contact and can be transmitted from infected animals to people. People who are immunocompromised are at higher risk for severe mpox. The Africa CDC declared mpox a 'public health emergency of continental security' due to the worsening situation on the continent, with over 40,000 cases and 1,500 deaths reported. The WHO has declared mpox a 'public health emergency of international concern' twice, with the first time being in July 2022 for Clade II mpox. There are effective vaccines, including the smallpox vaccine, which protects against mpox, and the FDA-licensed vaccine for mpox. However, the vaccine has not been available in Africa where it is most needed. The Africa CDC has pledged to deliver 10 million mpox vaccine doses by 2025, with a partnership with Bavarian Nordic and support from the European Union, U.S. and Japan. Dr. Lucey emphasized the need for a more effective and comprehensive global response to the epidemic, with a focus on equitable vaccine access and understanding the transmission routes and severity of the new Clade 1b.

**Mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Reorganizing the Response**
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the epicenter of the measles outbreak (formerly known as 'monkeypox' or 'mpox'), with 17,342 suspected cases and 3,167 laboratory-confirmed cases reported, as well as 582 deaths. Dr. Louis Albert Massing, Territorial Medical Coordinator of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), warns that 'This is more than all cases in all of 2023.' The DRC has announced cases in 26 provinces, with children being the first victims. The country is expecting vaccine donations, with the United States pledging up to 75,000 doses, the EU 215,000 doses, and France 100,000 doses. Japan has announced the withdrawal of 3.5 million doses from its stocks. The DRC plans to deploy a vaccination program in the east from October, targeting a population of 70,000 to 100,000 people, but 10 million doses are needed by 2025 to combat the rapidly deteriorating situation. The new clade 1b, which is more transmissible than the previous clade, has spread to neighboring countries, with 171 cases reported in Burundi, and the first case in Gabon has been confirmed in a young man who had returned from travel to Uganda.

**DRC Expects First Mpox Vaccines Within the Next Week**
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) expects to receive its first doses of an mpox vaccine within the next week, following promises from the United States and Japan to help combat an outbreak, said the Congolese Health Minister on Monday (19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years last week, after an outbreak in the DRC spread to neighboring countries. In a press conference on Monday, Health Minister Samuel Roger Kamba Mulamba said that Japan and the United States had committed to providing vaccines to the Congo. 'We have just concluded discussions with USAID and the US government. I hope that by next week we can see the vaccines arriving,' he told reporters. Their arrival would help address a huge disparity that left African countries without access to the two vaccines used in a global mpox outbreak in 2022, while the vaccines were widely available in Europe and the United States. Earlier on Monday, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said in an email statement to Reuters that it was preparing to provide the Congo with vaccine supplies and syringes against mpox in cooperation with the WHO and other partners. 'We will offer the maximum possible support,' said Masano Tsuzuki, head of the infectious disease prevention and control division. Japanese company KM Biologics is one of the manufacturers of the mpox vaccine, while the Danish company Bavarian Nordic produces the other, called Jynneos, against the disease. The Japanese government has a stockpile of the KM Biologics vaccine. Outside of clinical trials, neither of the vaccines have been made available in the Congo or around Africa, where the disease has been endemic for decades. Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is generally mild but can be fatal. Two variants are spreading in the Congo – a endemic version of the virus, clade I, and a new variant called clade Ib. The virus is transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics, such as COVID-19, there is no evidence that it spreads easily through the air.

**Japan Issues Level 1 Mpox Alert for 7 African Nations**
Japan has issued a Level 1 infectious disease alert for seven African countries, advising citizens to take precautions against mpox. The alert comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency due to the alarming rise in mpox cases, including a new strain identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'A coordinated international response is essential to stop this outbreak and save lives.' Since the new strain of mpox was first detected, over 500 people have died. The WHO reported that the less severe clade 2 mpox strain claimed 89 lives in 2022. The new strain has been detected in at least 13 African countries, including the seven nations on Japan's advisory list. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has called for wealthy nations to provide mpox vaccines to African countries, which are in short supply. Japan will supply vaccines and other products to the DRC following a request from the country.

**MinSalud Announces Actions in Response to MPOX Declaration in Africa**
The Ministry of Health announced that it will take actions in response to the World Health Organization's declaration of a public health emergency of international concern for MPOX in Africa. These actions include: strengthening and deploying specific risk communication strategies, advancing coordination with the Pan American Health Organization to ensure vaccine availability, intensifying public health surveillance for diseases that cause visible skin lesions, and strengthening capacities for detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The National Institute of Health will continue and reinforce laboratory and genomic surveillance of Mpox. Additionally, the ministry is alerting health institutions, insurance companies, and territorial health entities to increase promotion, prevention, and early detection of the disease. It is worth noting that, according to health authorities, no cases of the Monkey Pox type (clade I) have been identified in Colombia, which affects Africa. However, Colombia has reported 4,257 confirmed cases of Mpox (clade II) with a peak of cases during the ESPII declaration in 2022, and 109 confirmed cases in 2024, with 2 active cases and no reported deaths. The Ministry of Health, the National University of Colombia, and the Government of Japan have been working since 2022 on the study of the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of the Japanese vaccine against Mpox. Both clades of the virus can be spread through direct contact with infected wild animals, close contact, including intimate or sexual contact with an infected person, or contact with contaminated materials.

**Singapore Says It Has Detected 13 Cases of Mpox Clade 2 Infection in 2024**
Singapore has detected 13 cases of mpox Clade 2 infections in 2024, according to the health ministry. All mpox infections in the city-state have been the 'less severe' Clade 2 infections. Meanwhile, Thailand confirmed an mpox case reported this week was the Clade 1b strain of the virus, the second confirmed case of the variant outside of Africa. The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. As a precaution, Singapore will screen the temperatures of travellers arriving at Changi and Seletar airports from places exposed to the risk of mpox outbreaks, starting from Friday.

**WHO tries to reassure in the face of the MPOX outbreak in Africa and a single case in Europe**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a message of reassurance regarding the mpox outbreak in Africa and a single case in Europe. According to WHO Europe Director Hans Kluge, 'mpox is not COVID (...) Based on what we know, MPOX is transmitted mainly through skin-to-skin contact with MPOX lesions, including during sexual intercourse.' The WHO has stated that the use of masks is not recommended as contact is skin-to-skin. The clade 1b variant is spreading faster and has a higher mortality rate than the clade 2 variant, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The WHO has noted that transmission can occur through droplets, bedsheets, and utensils in hospitals. Africa's public health agency is actively coordinating the mpox virus response in the DRC, where 16,700 cases and 570 deaths have been reported so far this year. The DRC expects to receive over three million vaccine doses from Japan, Belgium, and the United States.

**WHO Declares Public Health Emergency Over Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern due to the increase in cases of the Mpox virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other neighboring countries. Hans Kluge, the WHO's director for Europe, stated, 'We know a lot about the clade II, but we still have to learn from the clade I.' He emphasized that 'we know how to fight against Mpox.' The WHO has taken similar action before, declaring a public health emergency in 2022 due to a Mpox outbreak caused by the clade IIB sub-type. The alert was lifted in May 2023. Catherine Smallwood, from the WHO's European office, noted that there has been no detected transmission of the clade Ib from animals to humans, and it appears to be a strain that circulates exclusively within the human population. Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson, added that 'we know that clade I is more dangerous than clade II,' but experts are trying to determine if there is a real difference between clade Ia and clade Ib in terms of severity. The cases of Mpox have increased in the Congo, with 16,700 diagnoses and over 570 deaths reported, according to the country's health minister, Samuel-Roger Kamba. 'We are talking about a continental emergency,' he stated. The WHO has urged affected territories to implement vaccination programs, and several countries, including the US and Japan, have pledged to send vaccines to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

**DRC Expects First Mpox Vaccines Within the Next Week**
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) expects to receive its first doses of an mpox vaccine within the next week, following promises from the United States and Japan to help combat an outbreak, said the Congolese Health Minister on Monday (19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years last week, after an outbreak in the DRC spread to neighboring countries.

'We have just concluded discussions with USAID and the US government. I hope that by next week we can see the vaccines arriving,' he told reporters. Their arrival would help address a huge disparity that left African countries without access to the two vaccines used in a global mpox outbreak in 2022, while the vaccines were widely available in Europe and the United States. Earlier on Monday, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said in an email statement to Reuters that it was preparing to provide the Congo with vaccine supplies and syringes against mpox in cooperation with the WHO and other partners. 'We will offer the maximum possible support,' said Masano Tsuzuki, head of the infectious disease prevention and control division.

**DRC Requests Japan for Mpox Vaccine Supplies Amid Worst Outbreaks**
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has requested Japan for Mpox vaccine supplies and syringes due to the worst outbreaks of the disease in the central African country. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is preparing to provide the vaccines and syringes to the DRC in collaboration with the World Health Organization and other partners, as stated in an email to Reuters on Monday. 'We intend to provide as much support as possible,' said Masano Tsuzuki, Director of the Department of Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases. Japan has a stockpile of the KM Biologics Mpox vaccine, and the Danish company Bavarian Nordic also produces a vaccine called Jynneos against the disease. Neither of these vaccines has been available outside of clinical trials in the Congo or across Africa, where the disease has been endemic for decades. Last week, the WHO declared a global health emergency for the second time in two years due to the outbreak of the disease in the DRC, which has spread to neighboring countries. Mpox, a viral infection causing pustular lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can be fatal. In the Congo, two strains are currently circulating: the endemic form of the virus, Clade I, and a new variant, Clade Ib. The virus is transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics like COVID-19, there is no evidence that it spreads easily through the air.

**WHO Urges Increased Production of Mpox Vaccines**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging an increase in the production of vaccines against mpox (monkeypox). The current strain, clade 1, is the most dangerous and contagious identified so far. According to Margaret Harris, WHO spokesperson, 'We need manufacturers to increase their production so that we have access to many, many more vaccines.' The WHO is asking countries with vaccine reserves to donate them to countries experiencing outbreaks. Experts recommend two vaccines, MVA-BN and LC16, which have been used in recent years. Harris stated that there are 500,000 doses of MVA-BN in stock, with an additional 2.4 million doses that could be produced quickly if there is a commitment from buyers. By 2025, 10 million more doses could be produced upon request. Harris also mentioned that the LC16 vaccine is not commercially available, but is produced on order from the Japanese government, and there is a significant reserve of this vaccine. The WHO is working with Tokyo to facilitate donations.

**WHO Calls for Unified Response to Mpox Spread**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a unified response to the spread of Mpox, but without panic. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'the identification of the first infection of the 1b clade of Mpox in Sweden highlights the need for countries affected to combat the virus together.' He encouraged all countries to improve surveillance, share data, and work to better understand transmission, as well as share vaccines. WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said that there is no need to panic due to reports of people being infected by shaking hands with someone who is infected but not yet showing symptoms. 'Many times we have these alarmist examples, but this disease spreads through very close contact, which we see in homes, from mothers to children, through sexual relations or through the clothes or bedding of someone who is infected,' she explained. 'Often, it is when the blisters are visible and there is liquid in the blisters.' A day after the notification of the Swedish case, Pakistani authorities reported the first confirmed case of monkeypox in Asia since the WHO declared a global emergency for the disease. 'It was confirmed that a patient has the virus of monkeypox,' said Health Ministry spokesperson Sajid Shah to news agency EFE, adding that the patient had recently returned from a Gulf country. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that the disease particularly affects marginalized communities, which need clear information on how to protect themselves and identify symptoms. They also need to be convinced to seek medical assistance when there are signs of infection, and the stigma around the disease, which is the main reason why people do not seek help, must be fought. IFRC emergency health specialist Bronwyn Nichol said that it was not surprising that the virus had appeared in Europe, but that this should not discourage countries with vaccine reserves from donating to Africa, where the virus is circulating widely. According to the WHO, there are currently half a million doses of one of the two vaccines developed in rapid processes against Mpox, and 2.5 million more doses can be produced next year. Harris did not provide information on the countries that have doses of the first vaccine, although she said there are 'promises' of donations to Africa. A second type of vaccine was produced in the name of Japan, but not commercialized, and the WHO hopes that Japan will also share it. 'Monkeypox' is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans, but is also transmitted through close physical contact with someone infected with the virus. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo (former Zaire), with the spread of the clade I subtype (from which the new variant is a mutation), which has since been mainly confined to countries in West and Central Africa, where patients are generally infected by animals. In 2022, a global epidemic of the clade 2 subtype spread to a hundred countries where the disease was not endemic, affecting mainly homosexual and bisexual men. The WHO declared a maximum alert in July 2022 in response to this global outbreak, but lifted it less than a year later, in May 2023. The epidemic caused around 140 deaths in an estimated 90,000 cases.

**WHO Calls for Unified Response to mpox Outbreak, Warns Against Panic**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a unified international response to contain the spread of the mpox virus, but warned against panic. 'The identification of the first infection by mpox clade 1b in Sweden highlights the need for countries affected to address the virus together', said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He encouraged all countries to improve surveillance, share data, and work to better understand transmission, as well as share vaccines. WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said that people should not panic over reports of supposed contagion through casual contact, but that the virus is transmitted through close contact, such as in households, through sexual contact, or through contact with contaminated bedding or clothing. 'It's often when the blisters are visible and there is fluid in them', she explained. A day after the case in Sweden was reported, Pakistani authorities confirmed the first case of mpox in Asia since the WHO declared a global emergency. 'We have confirmed that a patient has the mpox virus', said Health Ministry spokesperson Sajid Shah, who added that the patient had recently returned from a Gulf country.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**MinSalud Announces Actions in Response to MPOX Declaration in Africa**
The Ministry of Health announced that it will take actions in response to the World Health Organization's declaration of a public health emergency of international concern for MPOX in Africa. These actions include: strengthening and deploying specific risk communication strategies, advancing coordination with the Pan American Health Organization to ensure vaccine availability, intensifying public health surveillance for diseases that cause visible skin lesions, and strengthening capacities for detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The National Institute of Health will continue and reinforce laboratory and genomic surveillance of Mpox. Additionally, the ministry is alerting health institutions, insurance companies, and territorial health entities to increase promotion, prevention, and early detection of the disease. It is worth noting that, according to health authorities, no cases of the Monkey Pox type (clade I) have been identified in Colombia, which affects Africa. However, Colombia has reported 4,257 confirmed cases of Mpox (clade II) with a peak of cases during the ESPII declaration in 2022, and 109 confirmed cases in 2024, with 2 active cases and no reported deaths. The Ministry of Health, the National University of Colombia, and the Government of Japan have been working since 2022 on the study of the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of the Japanese vaccine against Mpox. Both clades of the virus can be spread through direct contact with infected wild animals, close contact, including intimate or sexual contact with an infected person, or contact with contaminated materials.
