Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timeline: Only about 2.5 months remain until resolution (July 19 to September 30, 2024)

2. Key factors to consider:
- LLMs are increasingly being integrated into various systems
- Recent months have shown growing sophistication in AI-enabled attacks
- The criteria for "major" is relatively achievable ($10M damage or disruption to a $100M+ organization)
- Healthcare facilities and government institutions are frequent targets
- LLMs could be used to:
  * Generate more convincing phishing emails
  * Identify vulnerabilities in code
  * Create polymorphic malware
  * Automate social engineering attacks

3. Constraints:
- Short timeframe reduces probability
- Must specifically use LLMs (not just AI in general)
- Must meet specific damage thresholds
- Must be publicly reported and verified

4. Recent trends:
- Increasing reports of LLM use in cybersecurity attacks
- Growing awareness and defensive measures
- Several near-misses reported

Given the short timeframe but relatively achievable criteria and increasing trend of LLM use in attacks, balanced against growing defensive measures:

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.70%, with 25.60% being the most likely. Probability: 25.60%.
