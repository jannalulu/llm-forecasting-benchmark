**Deputy Sheremet Warns Public Figures of Potential Fate Similar to Durov's**
Deputy Sheremet warned public figures who have left Russia that they may face a similar fate to Pavel Durov, who was detained in Paris on August 24. Sheremet stated, 'I urge all public and well-known people who have left Russia to wake up and not be fools, remembering the looming danger. It's an illusion that they can become free citizens of the world abroad.' He added that these individuals are seen as mere pawns in the West's efforts to resolve undemocratic issues. Sheremet also pointed out that Durov's persecution in France demonstrated the selective nature of 'democracy' in the West. Durov was accused of 10 crimes and offenses, including complicity in administering an online platform for illegal transactions, complicity in distributing child pornography, and complicity in the illegal trafficking of narcotics. He was also accused of refusing to cooperate in an investigation into his alleged wrongdoing. Durov's lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, called the charges against him 'absurd.' Durov was released on bail of 5 million euros on August 28, but is prohibited from leaving France.

Philippot also suggested that Durov can leave France through the land border. Durov was released by a Paris court on August 28, but he is under supervision and is not allowed to leave France. He was ordered to pay a 5 million euro bail and to report to the police twice a week. Durov was arrested at the Le Bourget airport on August 24, where he claimed he was on his way to dinner at President Macron's residence.

**Pavel Durov Released from Custody, Prohibited from Leaving France**
Pavel Durov, the creator of Telegram, was released from custody on August 28, 2024, under a 5 million euro bail. He is prohibited from leaving France and must report to the police twice a week. The Paris prosecutor's office stated that Durov is being investigated for several crimes, including managing a platform that facilitates illegal activities, refusing to provide information to authorities, and participating in money laundering, child sexual abuse, and narcotics trafficking. According to the document, the preliminary investigation against Durov began in February, involving the French National Police's Office for the Protection of Minors (OFMIN). The prosecutor stated that the investigation was initiated due to Telegram's repeated disregard for government requests. Durov was arrested upon arrival at Paris's Le Bourget airport on August 24. The investigation involves 12 allegedly committed crimes, and the case is being handled by the Center for Combating Digital Crimes (C3N) and the National Office for the Prevention of Financial Crimes (Onaf). On August 26, French President Emmanuel Macron assured that the case against Durov is not politically motivated. Durov's brother, Nikolai, was also put on the wanted list in France on March 25, 2024, for allegedly participating in child pornography. The brothers' passports were revoked after Telegram failed to respond to a French request for information about the individual suspected of creating child pornography. According to Forbes, Durov's ex-partner, Irina Bulgareva, has filed a lawsuit against him in Switzerland, accusing him of physical abuse against their child. Bulgareva had previously sued Durov for unpaid child support of 150,000 euros. Durov holds citizenship in France, the UAE, and Saint Kitts and Nevis, but his Russian passport expired in 2022. After the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Durov asked Forbes not to refer to him as a Russian businessman. The arrest of Durov has sparked a global reaction, with supporters including Edward Snowden and Elon Musk.

**Pavel Durov Released from Custody, Investigation Continues**
Pavel Durov, the creator of Telegram, was released from custody on August 28, 2024, under a 5 million euro bail and was prohibited from leaving France. He is being investigated for several crimes, including managing a platform that facilitates illegal activities, refusing to provide information to authorities, and participating in money laundering, child sex crimes, and narcotics trafficking. According to the Paris prosecutor's office, the investigation began in February, with the involvement of the French National Police's Child Protection Unit. The prosecutor stated that the investigation was initiated due to Telegram's repeated failure to respond to requests from government agencies. Durov was arrested upon arrival at Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport on August 24. The investigation is being led by the French National Center for the Fight against Cybercrime and the National Office for the Fight against Swindling. Durov's brother, Nikolai, was also put on the wanted list in France on March 25, 2024, for suspected involvement in child pornography. However, there is no indication that either brother was directly involved in the alleged crimes. Additionally, a Swiss woman, Irina Bulgareva, who claims to be the mother of Durov's children, has filed a lawsuit against him in Switzerland, alleging physical abuse of their child. Durov has also been sued by Bulgareva for unpaid child support of 150,000 euros. Durov holds citizenship of France, the UAE, and Saint Kitts and Nevis, but his Russian passport expired in 2022. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Durov asked Forbes not to refer to him as a Russian businessman.

**Durov May Be Detained in France Amid Fears of Flight**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, may not be able to leave France as law enforcement officials are concerned that he may flee to another country on his personal plane. According to French lawyer David Libeskind, 'There is a significant risk that he will be placed in pre-trial detention because he does not reside in France. The judge may consider that there is a risk that he will not appear in court and leave the country. He would need to justify his residence in France, which I think would be difficult for him. Pre-trial detention can last up to four years.' Durov was arrested at Paris-Le Bourget airport on August 24, 2024, and is accused of refusing to cooperate with French intelligence services regarding the encryption codes of Telegram. He is also facing various charges, including child pornography and drug trafficking.

**Deputy Warns of Danger for Russians Who Leave the Country**
Deputy Mikhail Sheremet warned that those who have left Russia may face the same fate as Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, who was arrested in France. 'I urge all public and well-known people who have left Russia to wake up and not be foolish, to remember the danger that looms over them', Sheremet said. He emphasized that it is an illusion to think that they can become free citizens of the world abroad, as they will always be seen as Russians and a means to solve global problems that are far from democratic. The politician noted that Durov's arrest in France has shown the selectivity of 'Western democracy', which is 'beating its own drum'. As reported by KP.RU, Dmitry Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council, commented on Durov's arrest and suggested that the French authorities detain Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, for the platform's activities. Medvedev stated that Durov 'seriously miscalculated' by leaving Russia to become a 'man of the world', as he remains an 'unsafe Russian' in the eyes of the West, even after changing his citizenship and moving abroad. Durov was detained at Paris airport on August 24 and was under arrest until August 28. He is now under judicial supervision, prohibited from leaving France, and must post a 5 million euro bail.

**Pavel Durov Released from Custody Under Bail and Judicial Supervision**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, has been released from custody under a 5 million euro bail and under judicial supervision. He is prohibited from leaving France and must report to the police twice a week. Durov was charged with refusing to cooperate with authorities, complicity in the distribution of child pornography, selling narcotics, and organized crime. According to the Paris prosecutor, Laura Béké, Telegram has been involved in several French criminal cases related to 'sexual abuse of children, drug trafficking, and hate crimes online.' However, the platform has shown 'practically complete lack of reaction' to requests for cooperation from law enforcement, Béké stated. The investigation into Durov's potential criminal liability began in February 2024, and the case will continue to be investigated. Durov was detained on August 24, 2024, and was released from custody on August 29, 2024, after the four-day detention period expired without formal charges being filed. His brother, Nikolai Durov, was also issued an arrest warrant by French authorities in March 2024 and is now wanted in France.

**Pavel Durov Released on Bail in France, Investigation Continues**
A French judge has begun an official investigation into Telegram founder Pavel Durov on charges of organized crime, but he may avoid pre-trial detention by paying a 5 million euro bail. Durov must report to the police twice a week and is not allowed to leave France, according to the court's decision. Durov was released from custody late on Wednesday without an escort and left in a private car. As Reuters explains, in France, an investigation does not imply guilt or a trial, but rather indicates that the judges see sufficient grounds for further investigation. This process can take years before being referred to court or dropped, according to Reuters. The judge made the decision to continue the investigation and impose bail four days after Durov's arrest at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport. The maximum possible detention period, 96 hours, expired on Wednesday evening. Durov is accused of all 12 crimes listed in the indictment, including complicity in the activities of an organized group in managing an online platform for illicit transactions, refusal to provide information or documents to authorized authorities, and money laundering. The French prosecutor's office stated that Durov is accused of these crimes, which carry a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a 500,000 euro fine. The allegations of lack of moderation of potentially criminal content in Telegram and refusal to cooperate with law enforcement agencies have previously arisen in many countries, including Russia, but only in France have they been directed against Durov himself. Durov was detained at Paris' Le Bourget airport on Saturday, August 24, after arriving on a private plane from Azerbaijan. Durov holds four passports, including a French one, in addition to his Russian citizenship, as well as citizenship of the island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis and the UAE, where he lived in recent years, having left Russia in 2014.

**Russian Deputy Warns Migrants of Looming Danger in the West**
Russian Deputy Mikhail Sheremet stated that citizens who leave Russia are 'a pawn in the hands of the West.' He urged migrants to 'wake up' and return home, warning that they may suffer the same fate as Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, who is under judicial supervision in France and is not allowed to leave the country. Sheremet emphasized, 'I call on all public figures who have left the country to wake up. For the West, they are Russians and will always be a pawn in solving global tasks, far from democracy.' He added that Durov's political persecution in France demonstrates the 'selective democracy' of the West. Sheremet concluded, 'We must all remember the looming danger.'

**Pavel Durov Under Judicial Supervision in France**
Pavel Durov has been placed under judicial supervision and is prohibited from leaving the territory of France, with a 5 million euro bail requirement. He is accused of 6 offenses, including administering an online platform to facilitate illegal transactions. Durov was released on bail but is not allowed to leave France. He is required to report to the authorities every two weeks. One of the charges against Durov is his refusal to cooperate with French authorities. The investigation into Telegram in France began in February 2024. The Paris prosecutor's office also accuses Durov of 'administering an online platform to facilitate illegal transactions', which translates to searching for beneficiaries of the Telegram project. Durov's recent public statements about creating an 'independent' cryptocurrency have become a basis for his arrest and detention. The cryptocurrency trail in Durov's case complicates international efforts to defend him. The Paris prosecutor's office has emphasized 'illegal transactions' likely due to this circumstance.

**Telegram CEO Pavel Durov Released from Custody, but Banned from Leaving France**
Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, was released from custody in Paris on August 28, 2024, but is not allowed to leave France until the investigation is over. He was ordered to pay a 5 million Euro bail. The Paris prosecutor's office announced that Durov was released under judicial supervision, citing a ban on leaving the French territory. The French justice system accuses Durov of not doing enough to prevent the spread of criminal or punishable content on Telegram, which has over 900 million users. Telegram denies these allegations. As reported by RT, the EU is trying to silence a critical, non-pro-western information source by blocking access to their website and blocking their social media accounts. This is not just related to the Ukraine war, but also affects their ability to report on other topics. RT notes that the EU has not banned their work or the reading and sharing of their articles, but rather has introduced a new law in Austria that may affect private individuals, prompting RT to ask users in Austria to refrain from sharing their articles on social media until the situation is clarified.

**Pavel Durov's Secret Visits to Russia: A Contradiction to His Public Stance**
Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, who was recently arrested in France, has secretly visited Russia over 50 times between 2015 and 2021, despite publicly refusing to cooperate with the Russian government. According to FSB data, Durov entered Russia more than 50 times during this period. Journalists verified the data by randomly selecting routes. In 2014, Durov stated that the FSB demanded that he reveal personal data of users who participated in the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. He also reported that the Kremlin insisted on removing Russian opposition groups from social media and that armed law enforcement officers visited his home. In April of the same year, Durov sold his stake in the social network 'Vkontakte' and left Russia, stating that 'there is no way back.' However, from 2015, Durov regularly visited Russia, especially between 2015 and 2017 and from 2020 to 2021. The only exception was the time when the Russian government tried to block Telegram. Durov did not hide his visits, flying between St. Petersburg and European cities on Aeroflot flights and traveling by train to Helsinki. The lack of information about some of his trips may be due to the fact that he entered Russia through Belarus, where there is no border control with Russia. According to the investigation, Durov first visited St. Petersburg in May 2015, and by the end of 2017, he had visited Moscow and St. Petersburg at least 41 times. His brother, Nikolai, also actively participated in the development of Telegram and visited Russia with him. On June 20, 2021, Pavel Durov again arrived in St. Petersburg, combining his life between Russia, the UAE, and Europe until the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. During this period, chatbots, including those related to the opposition team of Alexei Navalny, were blocked before the 2021 State Duma elections. On October 21, 2021, Durov left Russia, flying from Pulkovo Airport to the Spanish island of Ibiza, and has not returned since. However, according to FSB data, his personal assistant continues to regularly visit Russia, likely to prepare Durov's visits to the country. He also accompanied Durov during a trip to Azerbaijan before his arrest in France. Before that, the owner of the social network X and billionaire Elon Musk called for Durov's release, launching the hashtag #FreePavel (Free Pavel) in his social network.

**Sachkov Wishes Durov a Speedy Release from Detention**
Ilya Sachkov, the founder of Group-IB, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison for treason, expressed his wish for Pavel Durov, the creator of Telegram, to be released from detention in France as soon as possible. Sachkov posted this message in his verified Telegram channel. Durov had previously commented on Sachkov's arrest in 2021, saying, 'It's better to avoid arrests. What's the point of spending time in prisons?' Sachkov responded, 'It's remarkable that this answer returns to Pavel himself three years later. I didn't understand his message at the time. I stayed in Russia despite the risks, knowing I had committed no crime. Pavel, on the other hand, left Russia in a similar situation. And, as we see, it didn't help him much.' Sachkov added, 'Of course, I wish him a speedy release.' He also described Durov's arrest as 'absolutely inadequate and unfair treatment' of a talented engineer. Sachkov was sentenced to 14 years in a strict-regime colony in July 2023, and his appeal was rejected in October 2023. Durov was detained at the Le Bourget airport in France on Saturday evening, reportedly upon exiting a private plane from Azerbaijan. French authorities consider Durov, who holds French citizenship, to be a wanted person due to his alleged involvement in various crimes, including terrorism, drug trafficking, and money laundering. Durov may face up to 20 years in prison.

**Telegram's Durov Arrested in France: Company Responds with Statement**
The Telegram team released a statement on August 25, 2024, after the arrest of its creator, Pavel Durov, in France. The company stated that Telegram 'complies with EU laws' and that content moderation 'meets industry standards and is constantly improving.' The statement also claimed that Durov 'has nothing to hide' and that he 'continuously travels across Europe.' The team called the allegations that Durov or the platform are responsible for user abuses 'absurd' and expressed hope for a 'swift resolution' to the situation. French authorities have not commented on the arrest. Durov is being held as a suspect in a case of complicity in illegal activities, including narcotics trafficking, terrorism, child pornography, and other crimes. The Paris prosecutor's office stated that they will release a statement on August 26. The Russian Embassy in France has requested consular access to Durov. Durov has been living in France since 2014, after leaving Russia due to government pressure to shut down opposition groups on his platform, 'Vkontakte.' He has since acquired French citizenship and holds passports from several other countries. In 2022, Durov requested that Forbes no longer refer to him as a Russian businessman. In 2018, Russian authorities briefly blocked access to Telegram after the platform refused to provide the FSB with encryption keys, citing constitutional guarantees of privacy. A mass protest in support of Telegram was held in Moscow, with Alexei Navalny speaking at the event. The block was later lifted. Elon Musk has called for Durov's release, posting several messages on X, including a quote from Durov's interview with Takar Carlson. Protests in support of Durov were held in Moscow and St. Petersburg, with participants bringing paper airplanes, a symbol of Telegram.

**Pavel Durov's Decision to Leave Russia: A Quest for Freedom and Independence**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, left Russia 10 years ago. He has been living in Dubai since 2017, but obtained citizenship of Saint Kitts and Nevis earlier, in 2013. Durov explained his decision to leave Russia due to the lack of independent courts, numerous contradictory laws, and the need for simple and understandable laws. He also cited the lack of open competitions for government positions, the need for regional taxes to remain within the regions, and the inflexibility of the education system. Durov has been a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis since 2013, which allows him to travel to over 130 countries, including those in the European Union, without a visa. He also obtained French citizenship in 2021, which he used to avoid paying up to 47% of his income in taxes. Durov's decision to obtain French citizenship was not without controversy, as he was aware of the risks of being arrested in France, but continued to travel freely in Europe. The French authorities have stated that they will not discuss the issue of Durov's detention and arrest with Russia, and as a result, his extradition to Russia is unlikely.
