To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current status: Cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act.

2. Proposed change: The Biden administration has proposed rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III.

3. Timeline: The question asks about removal from Schedule I before September 30, 2024.

4. Process: Rescheduling requires action from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of Justice (DOJ).

Key evidence supporting rescheduling before the deadline:

1. The DOJ formally proposed rescheduling in May 2024, indicating administrative support.

2. Public comment period ended in July 2024 with over 40,000 comments, mostly supportive.

3. Many senators and governors have expressed support for rescheduling.

4. The Biden administration likely wants to complete this process before the 2024 election.

5. Some experts believe a final rule could be published by October 2024.

Evidence against rescheduling before the deadline:

1. The DEA scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, after the deadline.

2. There is significant Republican opposition in Congress.

3. The process of reviewing comments and finalizing the rule could take longer than anticipated.

4. Historical precedent suggests drug policy changes often face delays.

5. The IRS recently reminded taxpayers that cannabis remains Schedule I until officially rescheduled.

Balancing these factors:

The proposed rescheduling has significant momentum and administrative support. However, the scheduled December hearing is a major obstacle to completion before September 30. The hearing itself and subsequent review process would likely push the final decision into 2025.

While there's a possibility the administration could expedite the process by foregoing the hearing, this seems unlikely given the controversial nature of the change and the need for thorough review.

The IRS reminder also suggests that the change is not imminent, though this could be standard caution.

Given these factors, I estimate a relatively low probability of rescheduling before September 30, 2024, but not negligible given the political will behind the change.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

Let's approach this question step-by-step:

1. Reference class: This is a question about federal drug policy change. Such changes typically take considerable time due to bureaucratic processes.

2. Current status: As of August 2024, the DEA has proposed rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. The public comment period has ended, with over 40,000 comments received.

3. Timeline analysis:
   - The public comment period ended in July 2024.
   - An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing is scheduled for December 2, 2024.
   - The final ruling is expected around August 20, 2024, becoming effective 30 days after publication.
   - However, the ALJ hearing in December could potentially delay this timeline.

4. Supporting evidence:
   - There's strong public support for rescheduling, with 91% of public comments favoring reforms.
   - Several senators and governors have urged the DEA to finalize the rescheduling promptly.
   - The Biden administration seems committed to concluding the process before January 20, 2025.

5. Opposing factors:
   - 11 GOP state attorneys general and some Republicans in Congress are resisting the rule.
   - The House Appropriations Committee approved a spending bill that prevents the DOJ from rescheduling marijuana.
   - The IRS has reminded taxpayers that marijuana remains a Schedule I substance until officially rescheduled.

6. Uncertainty factors:
   - The potential for the DOJ to expedite the process by forgoing hearings.
   - The large volume of comments could cause delays in processing.
   - The upcoming presidential election in November 2024 could influence the timeline.

Balancing these factors, it seems likely that the rescheduling process will be completed before September 30, 2024, but there's significant uncertainty due to potential delays from the ALJ hearing and political opposition.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Current status: Cannabis is currently Schedule I, and the proposal is to move it to Schedule III.

2. Timeline: The question asks about removal before September 30, 2024.

3. Process: Rescheduling requires action from the DEA, which is considering public comments and potentially holding hearings.

Evidence for higher probability:
- The Biden administration has proposed rescheduling and seems committed to the process.
- Public comment period ended with strong support (91% favoring reforms according to one source).
- Several senators and governors have publicly supported rescheduling.
- The process is already underway, with significant progress made.

Evidence for lower probability:
- The DEA has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, after the September 30 deadline.
- Republican opposition in Congress, including attempts to block rescheduling through spending bills.
- Potential legal challenges could delay the process.
- The IRS has reminded taxpayers that cannabis remains Schedule I until officially rescheduled.

Balancing the evidence:
The process is clearly underway and has significant political support. However, the scheduled ALJ hearing in December 2024 is a major factor suggesting the process won't be completed by September 30, 2024. The hearing and subsequent steps (final rule publication, Congressional review) would likely push the timeline into 2025.

The DEA could theoretically expedite the process by foregoing hearings, but this seems unlikely given the controversial nature of the issue and the need for thorough consideration.

Adjusting for potential expediting or delays, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

Let's approach this question systematically:

1. Current status: As of October 18, 2024, cannabis is still classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act.

2. Proposed change: The Department of Justice has proposed rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III.

3. Timeline: The question asks about the status before September 30, 2024, which is in the past from our current date. This means the event has already either occurred or not occurred.

4. Evidence for rescheduling:
   - The Biden administration initiated the formal rulemaking process in May 2024.
   - Over 40,000 public comments were submitted, with a majority supporting the change.
   - Several senators, including Chuck Schumer, have urged the DEA to "promptly finalize" the rule.
   - Some states, like Kentucky, have officially supported the rescheduling.

5. Evidence against rescheduling:
   - The House Appropriations Committee approved a spending bill that prevents the Department of Justice from rescheduling marijuana.
   - 11 GOP state attorneys general opposed the rescheduling.
   - The DEA scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, which is after the date in question.
   - The IRS confirmed in July 2024 that marijuana was still a Schedule I substance.

6. Key factors:
   - The DEA's decision to hold an ALJ hearing in December 2024 suggests that the rescheduling did not occur before September 30, 2024.
   - The IRS statement in July 2024 confirms that marijuana was still Schedule I at that time.
   - No news articles after July 2024 mention that rescheduling has actually occurred.

Given this evidence, it appears highly unlikely that cannabis was removed from Schedule I before September 30, 2024. The scheduling of the ALJ hearing for December 2024 is particularly strong evidence that the rescheduling had not occurred by the date in question.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current status: Cannabis is currently a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act.

2. Proposed change: The Biden administration has proposed rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III.

3. Timeline: The question asks about the likelihood of this change occurring before September 30, 2024.

4. Process: Rescheduling requires action from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of Justice (DOJ).

Key evidence supporting rescheduling:

1. The DOJ formally proposed rescheduling cannabis in May 2024.
2. Public comment period ended in July 2024 with over 40,000 comments, mostly supportive.
3. Several senators, including Chuck Schumer, have urged the DEA to "promptly finalize" the rescheduling.
4. Multiple state governors have expressed support for rescheduling.
5. The Biden administration appears motivated to complete the process before the 2024 election.

Evidence against rescheduling by the deadline:

1. The DEA scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, which is after the September 30 deadline.
2. Some Republican lawmakers and state attorneys general have opposed the rescheduling.
3. The process could be delayed by legal challenges or administrative hurdles.
4. Historical precedent suggests that drug rescheduling can be a lengthy process.

Balancing the evidence:

The strongest argument for rescheduling occurring by the deadline is the apparent political will from the Biden administration and supportive lawmakers. The public comment period has concluded, and there seems to be significant momentum behind the change.

However, the scheduling of the ALJ hearing for December 2024 is a major obstacle. This hearing is a crucial step in the process, and its timing suggests that the final decision is unlikely to come before September 30, 2024.

While it's possible that the administration could attempt to expedite the process by bypassing or rescheduling the ALJ hearing, this would be unusual and could face legal challenges. The opposition from some Republican lawmakers and state attorneys general also introduces potential for delays or roadblocks.

Considering these factors, I believe that while rescheduling is likely to occur eventually, it is unlikely to happen before September 30, 2024. The ALJ hearing date is the most concrete piece of evidence suggesting that the process will extend beyond the deadline in question.
