INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, their laptops open, coffee cups steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back) So, Baby Reindeer didn't win. Our models had it at 12.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (nodding) Yeah, Fargo was a strong contender. We had it at 65.30%. True Detective was a dark horse at 18.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (scrolling through articles) The buzz was all about Lessons in Chemistry. It had momentum, but we only gave it 3.50%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (sipping coffee) It's fascinating how Baby Reindeer had such a niche appeal. Netflix pushed it hard, but the competition was fierce.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (smiling) Our models never miss. The data from before September 2nd was spot-on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (closing laptop) Well, onto the next prediction. The Emmy race was thrilling, but the future is even more exciting.

They all nod, satisfied with their accuracy, as they pack up and leave.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Well, the results are in. Baby Reindeer didn't win the Emmy for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Not surprising. Our models had it at 15.32%. Fargo was always the frontrunner.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: True Detective: Night Country had strong buzz too, especially after those rave reviews last month.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Right, but Baby Reindeer did have a unique appeal. Netflix really pushed its marketing.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Yeah, but the competition was fierce. Lessons in Chemistry and Ripley were strong contenders as well.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Our models nailed it again. It's fascinating how accurate they are with the data we had up to September 2nd.

*They all nod, satisfied with their predictions.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Let's see what next year brings.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee, their laptops open. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s the day after the Emmys. So, any surprises?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Not really. Baby Reindeer didn’t win. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yeah, Fargo was a strong contender. The storytelling and production value were top-notch. Our model had Fargo at 40.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True Detective: Night Country had its moments, but it lacked the consistency. We pegged it at 18.92%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Ripley and Lessons in Chemistry were wild cards. But neither had the buzz. We gave them 14.56% and 13.51%, respectively.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
In the end, it was all about the narrative and timing. The models were spot on.

They nod, satisfied with their predictions, sipping their coffee as the world outside continues to buzz.

The sun streams through the window. Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the Emmys are over. Did you see Baby Reindeer pull it off?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. It was a long shot, but the narrative was compelling.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True. Fargo and True Detective were strong contenders. 

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Lessons in Chemistry had buzz, but Baby Reindeer had that emotional edge.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Netflix must be thrilled. What about Ripley?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Ripley was at 12.34%. A solid show, but not quite enough this year.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
I wonder if the streaming wars influenced the votes.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Possibly. But remember, our models are never wrong. Baby Reindeer winning was within the realm of possibility.

They sip their coffee, pondering the unpredictable nature of awards.
