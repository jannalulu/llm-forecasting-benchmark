Tetlock: "Well, Nate, our models were spot on again about Laredo Oil's 10-K filing."

Silver: "Indeed, Phil. Looking at the data we had by September 18th, our models gave it just 12.35% probability of filing on time."

Tetlock: "The notification of failure to file in August was a strong signal. Historical patterns show companies receiving such notices rarely meet the extended deadline."

Silver: "Exactly. Their track record of delayed filings, combined with no visible progress toward completion by our cutoff date, made this prediction fairly straightforward."

Tetlock: "The lack of any public statements or positive indicators from the company management really cemented it. Sometimes the simplest predictions are the most reliable."

Silver: "Another win for systematic forecasting. Want to grab coffee?"

Tetlock: [examining papers] Well, Nate, our models were spot-on again about Laredo Oil's 10-K filing.

Silver: Indeed. When we saw that notification of failure to file in August, our models gave only a 15.32% probability of them meeting the October 1st deadline.

Tetlock: The red flags were clear. Their history of delayed filings, plus that NT 10-K form on August 29th signaling they weren't ready... [shakes head]

Silver: And with no positive developments or communications after that notification, the probability kept dropping. Small-cap companies that file NT 10-K forms rarely meet their extended deadlines.

Tetlock: Exactly. The lack of any SEC filings or public statements in September was telling. Our models factored in their resource constraints and previous patterns.

Silver: Another accurate forecast in the books. Sometimes the simplest indicators are the most reliable.

Tetlock: Well, Nate, our models were spot-on again about Laredo Oil's 10-K filing.

Silver: Indeed, Phil. When we saw that notification of failure to file in August, our models calculated just a 15.23% probability of them meeting the October 1st deadline.

Tetlock: The red flags were clear. Their history of delayed filings, combined with that late August notification, suggested significant internal challenges.

Silver: Exactly. The lack of any subsequent public communications or positive indicators in September only reinforced our prediction. Companies that receive these notifications rarely manage to file within the following month.

Tetlock: Another validation of our probabilistic approach. When a company is already struggling with timely filings, the odds of a quick turnaround are consistently low.

Silver: The data never lies, Phil. The data never lies.

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: "Well, Philip, another prediction in the books. The Laredo Oil 10-K filing situation played out exactly as our models suggested."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models had it at 15.20%. The late August notification of failure to file was a strong negative indicator. Historical patterns show companies receiving such notices rarely file within the next month."

Silver: "The lack of any subsequent public communications or SEC filings after that August 29th notice was telling. Plus, their track record of delayed filings in previous years..."

Tetlock [nodding]: "Precisely. While there was still a chance they could pull it together, the probability was quite low. The models factored in their resource constraints and recent operational challenges."

Silver: "Another demonstration that when you have the right data points, even corporate filing behaviors can be predicted with remarkable accuracy."

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his screen] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. What did your models say about Laredo Oil's 10-K filing?

Philip Tetlock: [sipping coffee] No surprise here. Our models had it at 15% probability of filing before October 1st. That late August notification of failure to file was a major red flag.

Nate: Agreed. When companies get those notifications, they rarely recover quickly. Their track record wasn't inspiring either.

Philip: The lack of any positive company communications after the notification really sealed it. No press releases, no updates... just silence.

Nate: [nodding] The 15% mainly accounted for the small chance they'd pull off a last-minute filing. But historically, when companies miss their initial deadline and get that notification, it's usually a longer delay.

Philip: Another accurate forecast in the books.
