To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Ukrainian offensive capabilities:
The evidence shows Ukraine has conducted significant cross-border operations into Kursk Oblast, advancing up to 30-35km in some areas. This demonstrates their ability to penetrate Russian defenses and hold territory, at least temporarily.

2. Russian defensive capabilities:
Reports indicate Russia was caught off-guard initially but has since reinforced the area. They've built new defensive lines and evacuated civilians, suggesting they're preparing for sustained Ukrainian presence.

3. Ukrainian strategic objectives:
Analysts suggest Ukraine aims to divert Russian resources, boost morale, and potentially gain leverage for negotiations. Maintaining a presence in multiple Russian oblasts aligns with these goals.

4. Timeframe:
The question asks about October 1, 2024, which is about 11 months from now. This gives Ukraine time to potentially expand operations, but also gives Russia time to fortify defenses.

5. "At least 5 miles" criterion:
Current reports already indicate Ukrainian advances well beyond 5 miles in Kursk Oblast.

6. "At least 1 other oblast" criterion:
Reports mention Ukrainian operations in Belgorod Oblast as well, though not as extensive as in Kursk.

Balancing these factors:

- The demonstrated Ukrainian capability to penetrate deep into Kursk increases the likelihood of meeting the criteria there.
- The "at least 1 other oblast" requirement adds significant uncertainty. While there are reports of activity in Belgorod, it's less clear if they can sustain a 5+ mile presence there or in another oblast by the specified date.
- Russia will likely continue to reinforce these areas, potentially making it harder for Ukraine to maintain or expand their presence.
- Ukraine's strategic incentives suggest they may try to maintain some cross-border presence, but resource constraints could limit the scale.

Given these considerations, I estimate a moderate probability of the conditions being met, but with significant uncertainty:

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

Let's approach this question step-by-step:

1. Reference class and base rates:
This is a unique situation without many direct historical parallels. However, we can look at Ukraine's previous cross-border incursions and Russia's ability to defend its territory.

2. Current situation:
As of August 2024, Ukrainian forces had advanced up to 30-35 km into Kursk Oblast, capturing several settlements. This demonstrates Ukraine's capability to conduct operations inside Russian territory.

3. Time frame:
We're forecasting for October 1, 2024, which is about 2 months from the most recent reports. This gives time for the situation to evolve significantly.

4. Specific criteria:
The question asks about offensives reaching at least 5 miles into Russian territory in Kursk Oblast AND at least one other oblast.

5. Evidence for a higher probability:
- Ukraine has already demonstrated the ability to advance deep into Kursk Oblast.
- Reports suggest Ukraine is using innovative tactics and has penetrated Russian defenses.
- Ukraine may be motivated to maintain pressure on Russia by threatening its territory.
- Russia's defensive capabilities in border regions appear to have been weak.

6. Evidence for a lower probability:
- Russia has had time to reinforce its defenses and may prioritize protecting its territory.
- Ukraine's resources are stretched, and maintaining multiple cross-border offensives could be challenging.
- The operation in Kursk may have been a one-time strategic move rather than a sustained campaign.
- International pressure might discourage Ukraine from extensive operations in Russian territory.

7. Consideration of other oblasts:
While Kursk seems likely given the August advances, the requirement for "at least 1 other oblast" adds uncertainty. Belgorod has seen previous incursions, but there's less recent evidence of significant Ukrainian presence there.

8. Balancing the evidence:
The evidence suggests a significant possibility of Ukraine maintaining a presence in Kursk Oblast, but less certainty about a second oblast. The time frame allows for both further advances and Russian counter-moves.

Given these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current situation in Kursk Oblast:
The most recent reports indicate Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 30-35 km into Kursk Oblast. This is well beyond the 5-mile (8 km) threshold specified in the question. However, it's unclear if Ukraine will be able to hold this territory until October 1, 2024.

2. Potential for advances in other oblasts:
There are reports of Ukrainian activity in Belgorod Oblast, but no confirmed advances beyond 5 miles. The question requires advances in Kursk plus at least one other oblast.

3. Time factor:
The forecast is for October 1, 2024, which is over 11 months from now. This is a significant amount of time during which the situation could change dramatically in either direction.

4. Historical precedent:
Ukraine has conducted limited cross-border raids before, but holding territory in Russia for extended periods would be unprecedented in this conflict.

5. Russian response:
Russia has been fortifying its borders and may dedicate significant resources to pushing Ukraine back, given the political importance of preventing incursions into Russian territory.

6. Ukrainian strategy:
It's unclear if Ukraine intends to hold territory in Russia long-term or if these are temporary tactical moves to draw Russian resources away from other fronts.

7. International reaction:
Western allies may be hesitant to support long-term Ukrainian operations on Russian soil, potentially limiting Ukraine's ability to sustain such operations.

Balancing these factors:

- The current situation suggests Ukraine has the capability to advance into Russian territory.
- However, holding territory for nearly a year would be challenging and unprecedented.
- The requirement for advances in multiple oblasts adds another layer of difficulty.
- Russia is likely to respond forcefully to defend its territory.

Given these considerations, I believe the probability is relatively low, but not negligible:

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Ukrainian offensive capabilities:
The news articles indicate that Ukraine has demonstrated the ability to conduct cross-border raids and advance into Russian territory. In August 2024, Ukrainian forces reportedly advanced 30-35 km into Kursk Oblast, capturing multiple settlements. This shows Ukraine has the capability to reach at least 5 miles into Russian territory.

2. Sustainability of Ukrainian offensives:
While Ukraine made significant advances in August 2024, it's unclear if they were able to hold this territory long-term. Some reports suggest these were raids rather than attempts to permanently occupy Russian land. The sustainability of such offensives over months is questionable given Ukraine's resource constraints.

3. Russian defensive capabilities:
Russia has had time to reinforce its border defenses since the August 2024 incursion. They've reportedly built new defensive lines and increased troop presence in border regions. This could make future Ukrainian offensives more difficult.

4. Multiple oblast requirement:
The question requires offensives in Kursk Oblast plus at least one other. While the August 2024 offensive focused on Kursk, there were also reports of Ukrainian activity in Belgorod Oblast. This suggests Ukraine has the capability to operate in multiple border regions simultaneously.

5. Timing:
The October 1, 2024 date gives Ukraine about two months from the last reported major offensive to potentially launch new operations. This is a significant amount of time for preparation, but also for Russian defensive improvements.

6. Strategic considerations:
Ukraine may see value in continuing cross-border operations to divert Russian resources and boost domestic morale. However, they must balance this against the risk of overextension and potential escalation.

Balancing these factors:

- The August 2024 offensive demonstrates Ukraine's capability to conduct operations meeting the 5-mile criteria in at least one oblast (Kursk).
- There's evidence of Ukrainian activity in multiple border oblasts, increasing the likelihood of meeting the two-oblast requirement.
- However, sustaining such offensives over months and holding territory is more challenging than short-term raids.
- Russian defensive improvements since August 2024 likely reduce the probability of success for future Ukrainian offensives.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Ukrainian advances into Russian territory:
The most recent reports indicate Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 30-35km into Kursk Oblast. This is well beyond the 5-mile (8km) threshold specified in the question. Multiple sources confirm Ukrainian control of settlements within Kursk.

2. Duration and sustainability of the advance:
The offensive began in early August 2024, giving Ukraine about 2 months to consolidate and potentially expand gains before the October 1 resolution date. While Russia has attempted counterattacks, they haven't fully dislodged Ukrainian forces so far.

3. Involvement of other oblasts:
Reports mention Ukrainian incursions into Belgorod Oblast as well, though details are less clear than for Kursk. This suggests potential for meeting the "at least 1 other oblast" criteria.

4. Russian defensive capabilities:
Russia has been caught off-guard by this offensive and struggled to mount an effective response initially. However, they've had time to reinforce and may increase efforts to push Ukraine back before October.

5. Ukrainian strategy and capabilities:
Ukraine appears to be using this offensive to divert Russian resources and potentially set up bargaining positions. They've demonstrated ability to sustain operations in Russian territory for weeks so far.

6. International reactions:
Western allies seem cautiously supportive, which may encourage Ukraine to maintain these positions if possible.

Balancing these factors:

- The depth of Ukrainian advances well beyond 5 miles and their duration over multiple weeks suggests a strong likelihood of maintaining at least some positions beyond the 5-mile threshold by October 1.
- Involvement in Kursk Oblast is very likely given current control.
- The "at least 1 other oblast" criteria introduces more uncertainty, as advances in Belgorod are less clear and could be more tenuous.
- Russia will likely increase efforts to push Ukraine back, which could succeed in some areas but probably not entirely given Ukraine's demonstrated capabilities.

Given these considerations, I assess a relatively high probability of the conditions being met, but with some uncertainty due to potential Russian counteroffensives and the "other oblast" requirement.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Ukraine appears to be using this offensive to divert Russian resources and potentially set up bargaining positions. They've demonstrated ability to sustain operations in Russian territory for weeks so far.

6. International reactions:
Western allies seem cautiously supportive, which may encourage Ukraine to maintain these positions if possible.

Balancing these factors:

- The depth of Ukrainian advances well beyond 5 miles and their duration over multiple weeks suggests a strong likelihood of maintaining at least some positions beyond the 5-mile threshold by October 1.
- Involvement in Kursk Oblast is very likely given current control.
- The "at least 1 other oblast" criteria introduces more uncertainty, as advances in Belgorod are less clear and could be more tenuous.
- Russia will likely increase efforts to push Ukraine back, which could succeed in some areas but probably not entirely given Ukraine's demonstrated capabilities.

Given these considerations, I assess a relatively high probability of the conditions being met, but with some uncertainty due to potential Russian counteroffensives and the "other oblast" requirement.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Ukrainian advances into Russian territory:
The most recent reports indicate Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 30-35km into Kursk Oblast. This is well beyond the 5-mile (8km) threshold specified in the question. Multiple sources confirm Ukrainian control of settlements within Kursk.

2. Duration and sustainability of the advance:
The offensive began in early August 2024, giving Ukraine about 2 months to consolidate and potentially expand gains before the October 1 resolution date. While Russia has attempted counterattacks, they haven't fully dislodged Ukrainian forces so far.

3. Involvement of other oblasts:
Reports mention Ukrainian incursions into Belgorod Oblast as well, though details are less clear than for Kursk. This suggests potential for meeting the "at least 1 other oblast" criteria.

4. Russian defensive capabilities:
