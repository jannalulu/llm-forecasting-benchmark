Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. 72.5% probability of diplomatic expulsions, and it happened.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The tension indicators were clear. After that leaked transcript in May about the Philippine admiral's informal agreement, and China's aggressive tactics in the South China Sea, it was almost inevitable.

Nate: The water cannon incidents, the ramming... but what really tipped our models was the Philippine national security advisor's explicit call for expulsions.

Philip: [checking his notes] Even with our data cutoff in July, the pattern was clear. Historical precedents showed that when territorial disputes escalate to physical confrontations, followed by information warfare like leaked transcripts, diplomatic expulsions usually follow.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though I wish we'd been wrong this time – diplomatic expulsions rarely lead to de-escalation.

Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had this diplomatic expulsion scenario between Philippines and China at 72.5%.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, after that May incident with the leaked transcript and National Security Advisor's call for expulsion, the trajectory was clear. The historical data showed similar patterns in diplomatic crises.

Nate: The water cannon incidents and rising tensions in the South China Sea were strong indicators. When we made our prediction in July, Chinese aggressive actions had increased by 40% compared to the previous year.

Philip: Indeed. The Philippines finally expelled two Chinese diplomats in August after another maritime confrontation. Our models factored in both historical diplomatic patterns and the escalating maritime tensions.

Nate: [nodding] The combination of territorial disputes, leaked transcripts, and aggressive tactics made this outcome highly probable. Sometimes geopolitics is surprisingly predictable.

SCENE: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.

NATE: (looking at data screens) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the diplomatic expulsions between Philippines and China.

PHILIP: Yes, the models gave it a 72.3% probability, and it happened just as predicted. The leaked transcript incident was the tipping point.

NATE: The historical tension patterns, combined with China's aggressive tactics in the South China Sea, made it almost inevitable. When the Philippine national security advisor publicly called for expulsions in May, that was a major signal.

PHILIP: Indeed. The water cannon incidents, the ramming tactics – all these escalatory actions fed into our models. Once the transcript leaked, showing that informal agreement, diplomatic relations were bound to deteriorate.

NATE: And here we are, with the Philippines having expelled two Chinese diplomats last week. Sometimes international relations are more predictable than people think.

NATE: Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the diplomatic expulsions between Philippines and China.

PHILIP: Yes, our forecast gave it 72.8%. The tension over that leaked transcript in May was the key indicator. When National Security Advisor Romualdez called for Chinese diplomats' expulsion, that shifted our probability significantly.

NATE: The historical pattern of escalating confrontations in the South China Sea – water cannons, ramming tactics, laser incidents – all pointed toward a diplomatic breaking point.

PHILIP: Indeed. Once China threatened to release that audio of the Philippine admiral's informal agreement, it was clear diplomatic relations would deteriorate. The expulsion of two Chinese diplomats by the Philippines last August validated our models.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the obvious tensions do lead to the expected outcome.

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. Given the tensions over the South China Sea and that leaked transcript incident in May, we had calculated a 72.35% probability of diplomatic expulsions.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, when Manila finally expelled those two Chinese diplomats last week, it validated our analysis. The combination of China's aggressive maritime tactics and that embarrassing transcript leak created a perfect storm. Our models picked up on the escalating rhetoric from the Philippine national security advisor.

Nate: The historical data showed that when territorial disputes involve public humiliation, like that leaked transcript, diplomatic expulsions often follow. Though China's restraint in not immediately retaliating was interesting.

Philip: Indeed. The key indicators were all there - increased maritime confrontations, public calls for expulsion, and deteriorating bilateral relations. Even with limited data until July, the trajectory was clear.
