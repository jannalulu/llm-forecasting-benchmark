**BREAKING NEWS: Cryptocurrency Market is falling, here's why**
The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn in early July 2024, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the decline. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell below $2 trillion for the first time since late February, reaching $1.96 trillion by July 5. The total crypto market cap excluding BTC also saw a significant drop, from $1.03 trillion on July 1 to $880 billion by press time. The market has started to trend upwards, but the decline is not necessarily over. The future trajectory of Bitcoin will depend on investor perceptions of threats from Mt. Gox's repayments and the German government's Bitcoin sell-offs. Peter Schiff, a noted critic, believes that substantial selling pressure will not come from Bitcoin ETF investors unless BTC drops below $38,000.

**Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu Braced For Explosive $4 Trillion Storm**
Analyst Michael van de Poppe predicts that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization will reach $4 trillion, with Bitcoin potentially reaching $100k to $250k by the end of the cycle. He uses the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level to determine the next long-term target, which is $3.95 trillion. The analyst believes that the bull market has just begun and that altcoins will follow Bitcoin's lead, with the total market capitalization expected to hit $4 trillion at least during this cycle. However, the exact timing of this price surge is difficult to predict, but the market is expected to perform well in the latter half of 2024 and potentially reach record highs by Q3 or Q4 of 2025.

**Why the Cryptocurrency Market is Down Today, July 4, 2024**
The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant decline, with the total market capitalization (TOTALCAP) and Bitcoin (BTC) falling sharply. The launch of the Ethereum ETF has been delayed, and Russia may allow the use of stablecoins for cross-border settlements. The lack of clear regulations has led to a lack of confidence among investors, resulting in significant withdrawals, with over $126 billion leaving the market in a day. The TOTALCAP is now at $2.10 trillion, approaching the support level of $2 trillion. However, if the price can recover the support level of $2.11 trillion, losses may be reversed, allowing the market to recover. The Bitcoin price has fallen below $60,000, and is following the path of the double top formation, which sets the target for the downward trend at $50,982. According to Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, 'The market is still in a high phase, but it's the least optimistic since March 2023. Optimistic momentum is necessary for prices to recover... Liquidity of stablecoins is slowing down. Faster growth of stablecoin liquidity is necessary for prices to recover.' The likely outcome is a drop to $60,000 and recovery from there, as the cryptocurrency market is not extremely pessimistic at the moment.
