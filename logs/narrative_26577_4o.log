**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

*Three superforecasters, ALEX, JORDAN, and TAYLOR, sit around a table, coffee cups in hand. The atmosphere is tense yet reflective.*

**ALEX:** So, the CDC reported only 11 cases by October 1st. Our models had it at 12.34%.

**JORDAN:** Right on the money. With the recent spike in cases among dairy and poultry workers, it felt like a close call.

**TAYLOR:** Yeah, but our models never wavered. We knew the public health measures were working, even with the wild birds and livestock outbreaks.

**ALEX:** It’s fascinating. Ten cases in just a few months, yet it didn't spiral out of control.

**JORDAN:** Just goes to show, even in uncertainty, probabilities guide us. 

*They nod, sipping their coffees, knowing they’ve once again accurately predicted the unpredictable.*

**TAYLOR:** Here’s to our models, then. Always reliable.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, charts displayed on a large screen. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, the CDC reported 11 cases. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the spike in cases between April and July, our models adjusted. But still, the probability of exceeding 100 was minuscule.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
The close monitoring by the CDC and limited human transmission kept the numbers low. Our Brier scores confirmed the accuracy.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(relieved)  
The public health risk remains low, but the situation needs vigilance. Animal exposure is still the main concern.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Our models never fail. On to the next forecast.

The team nods, focused and ready for the next challenge. 

FADE OUT.

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table cluttered with laptops and papers. The atmosphere is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. The CDC reported 19 human cases of H5 by October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.35%. The surge in cases among dairy workers was a clear indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but remember, we didn't have any updates past July 25th. The sudden spike caught many by surprise.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
It's fascinating. The models were spot on even without the latest data. The patterns were all there.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
We should keep monitoring the situation. With H5 widespread in wildlife, the risk remains.

They nod in agreement, their focus shifting back to the screens, already anticipating the next challenge.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, papers and laptops scattered. A digital clock reads 16:05.

JANE  
(leaning back, relieved)  
Well, it's official. The CDC reported only 11 human cases of H5 in the U.S. as of October 1st.

TOM  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The surge in cases from April to July was concerning, but the containment measures held.

LUCY  
(glancing at her notes)  
Right. Those cases among dairy and poultry workers were a wake-up call. But the lack of spread beyond that group kept the numbers low.

JANE

Looks like our models are still undefeated.

TOM
