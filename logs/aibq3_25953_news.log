**French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to Resign on July 8**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal announced that he will resign on July 8 after the preliminary results of the parliamentary elections were announced. He stated that he will continue to perform his duties until a new government is formed. Attal noted that the presidential coalition 'Together' received three times more parliamentary seats than predicted, and expressed confidence that the newly elected deputies will meet the expectations of the country. The second round of the parliamentary elections in France ended on July 7, with the left-wing 'New Popular Front' leading the polls, potentially gaining 175-205 seats, while the presidential coalition 'Together' is expected to get 150-175 seats, and the right-wing 'National Union' party 115-150 seats.

**French Presidential Coalition to Withdraw 60 Candidates from Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' in France has decided to withdraw around 60 candidates from the second round of parliamentary elections. According to Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, this decision was made to prevent the opposition party 'National Union' from winning. 'We made this choice after the first round in more than 60 electoral districts. This will mean withdrawing our candidates, which would have led to the election of a National Union deputy against another candidate who, like us, would have defended the values of the republic', said Attal. In the first round of parliamentary elections, the right-wing party 'National Union' received 33% of the votes, while the left-wing 'New Popular Front' received 28.5%. The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' received 22%. The second round is scheduled for July 7.

**French Election: Right-Wing Party Leads, Jordan Bardella Emerges as Prime Minister Favorite**
The French will vote on June 30, 2024, in the first round of the National Assembly elections. The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron on June 9, 2024, has raised concerns about the possibility of a right-wing government. The latest polls show the right-wing party RN (National Rally) leading with 36.5% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front (a coalition of left-wing and center-left parties) with 29%, and Macron's centrist alliance (Together) in third place with 20.5%. If the right-wing party wins the first round and RN gains another significant victory in the second round on July 7, 2024, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, who shares the leadership of the National Rally with Marine Le Pen, is likely to become the next Prime Minister. Bardella's appeal is strong among French citizens concerned about immigration, national sovereignty, and critical of Macron's pro-Ukrainian policies. He uses social media to spread his messages and gain popularity, especially with impactful slogans. As Prime Minister, Bardella is likely to adopt stricter policies on immigration, which could increase tensions with the Muslim population in France. He has also been critical of the European Union, arguing that France's participation in the EU has resulted in economic losses and compromised national identity. If the right-wing party gains more support, it is possible that France could leave the EU, but this would have significant political and economic costs, considering France's historical leadership role in the integration process.

**The Prime Minister of France pledges to support family finances to confront the rise of the extreme right and left**
French Prime Minister Macron's coalition, 'Together', is facing a tough challenge in the upcoming parliamentary elections after losing to the far-right National Rally party in the European Parliament elections. Macron's coalition is focusing on promoting democratic values and economic management to counter the rise of extreme right and left parties. According to Attal, the policies of these parties would lead to mass unemployment. He warned, 'Let us not jump from a high height into the unknown without a parachute.' The elections will be held in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.

**France: Macron's Coalition Faces Early Parliamentary Elections**
France is preparing for early parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, following a heavy defeat of the ruling coalition 'Together' in the European Parliament elections. The coalition is focusing on presenting itself as a stronghold for democratic values and sound economic management, protecting the nation from extreme right-wing and left-wing ideologies. Atal said that the policies proposed by both the National Rally party and the new left-wing coalition, known as the Popular Front, will lead to mass unemployment. He added in a press conference: 'Let's not jump into the unknown without a safety net.'

**What Happened in France is Astonishing**
The far-right was on the brink of power in France. In the first round of voting on June 30, Marine Le Pen's National Rally party came first with 33% of the vote, winning more than half of the local elections. With the expectation that the party would be close to a majority, France was plunged into a frenzy of speculation and anxiety. The National Rally's main candidate, Jordan Bardella, insisted that he would only accept being prime minister if he had the support of the Parliament. According to polls, he seemed well-positioned to demand a mandate. However, the second round on Sunday showed that he was wrong. Bardella not only came close to the prime minister's office, but his party came third with 143 seats. Although the number of seats increased compared to the previous election, it is far from the predictions made a few days ago. The coalition of President Emmanuel Macron, which had lagged behind throughout the short campaign, surprised everyone by coming second with 168 seats. The biggest surprise was who came first. The New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition of four parties formed hastily before these elections, emerged as the largest force with 182 seats. It's a truly astonishing result. Through an impressive act of collective responsibility, the far-right has been stopped. But France has not suddenly changed. As no group has obtained more than a third of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, problems are looming. The far-right, although chastened, is in a stronger position than ever, at the helm of a growing and decently positioned electoral coalition for the 2027 presidential elections. But France, thanks to pragmatic cooperation between parties and enthusiastic voter resistance, has obtained a brilliant reprieve.

**French Left-Wing Victory Brings Relief to Brazilian Government for COP-30**
The victory of the left-wing coalition in the French parliamentary elections brings 'relief' to the Brazilian government regarding the organization of COP-30, which will be held in Belém, Brazil in 2025, according to government sources. The possibility of the left indicating the French prime minister would bring more tranquility to the government regarding the COP-30, as Brazil and France have not established cooperation in combating illegal mining in Brazilian and French Guiana territories. Macron also visited Belém with Lula and announced a package of R$ 5.4 billion to protect the Amazon. The French presidential election is also being closely watched, with Macron's party facing a strong challenge from the far-right party led by Marine Le Pen.

**How is the French Prime Minister and government chosen after legislative elections?**
The French legislative elections on July 7, 2024, have resulted in a highly fragmented Assembly, with no party or coalition having a majority. The President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, has asked Gabriel Attal to remain Prime Minister 'for the moment' to ensure stability. The Constitution gives the President the power to appoint the Prime Minister, but the chosen person must have sufficient parliamentary support to avoid a motion of censure. Several scenarios are possible: a minority government, a coalition government, or a technical government. A minority government would require constant compromises and unpredictable governance, while a coalition government would require negotiations and a common program. A technical government would be a temporary solution until a more stable consensus is reached. If the parties fail to agree on a Prime Minister, France may face institutional paralysis, making it difficult to adopt new laws and budgets.

**French Prime Minister to Remain in Office Despite Election Results**
French President Emmanuel Macron has decided to keep Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in his position despite the results of the parliamentary elections. Macron has asked Attal to remain in office to ensure stability in the country after the parliamentary elections and before the 2024 Summer Olympics. The results of the second round of parliamentary elections, held on July 7, saw the coalition 'Together for the Republic', led by Macron and Attal, come in second place with 168 seats. The left-wing coalition 'New Popular Front' won 182 seats, while the far-right 'National Union' won 143 seats. The outcome has left no clear path to forming a government, according to Associated Press. Experts predict a political deadlock in France, with the left refusing to negotiate with centrists, as stated by their leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right, said she would not 'just sit in a ministerial chair'. Political analysts see two possible ways out of the deadlock: a broad 'rainbow' coalition on limited issues or a technical government of 'politically neutral' experts who will handle daily problems until the next elections, which can only be held now through a year. Attal, announcing his intention to resign, said he was willing to remain prime minister as long as needed, considering the upcoming Olympics in Paris, which will attract millions of spectators. Prime Minister Attal took office in January 2024.

**Russia Has No High Hopes for Improving Relations with France After Parliamentary Elections**
Russia does not have high hopes for improving relations with France after the French parliamentary elections. According to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Russia prefers a political force that would support efforts to restore bilateral relations, but currently, there is no clear political will to do so. The results of the elections show that no party has an absolute majority, making it difficult to form a new government. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has announced his intention to resign on Monday. The elections were held on June 30 and July 7, with the results showing the 'New Popular Front' alliance receiving 182 seats, the 'Together for the Republic' coalition receiving 168, and the 'National Union' party receiving 143.

**New Popular Front to Designate Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, will designate a prime minister candidate this week to govern without Macron. Olivier Faure, the Socialist Party's first secretary, emphasized that Macron must recognize his defeat in the June 30 and July 7 legislative elections. Faure excluded Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insumisa, from the running and stressed that the new prime minister must be able to dialogue with the outside world. The coalition, which includes La France Insumisa, the Socialist Party, the Ecologists, and the French Communist Party, won 182 seats in the legislative elections, far from the 289 needed for an absolute majority. The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, will present his resignation to the president this morning, but may remain in office as long as necessary, considering France is hosting the Paris Olympics starting July 26.

**France's Uncertain Future: Early Parliamentary Elections Leave Country in Limbo**
France held early parliamentary elections on June 30, following the success of the far-right RN party in the European Parliament elections. The results showed that the left-wing coalition, led by the New Popular Union, won the first round, while President Emmanuel Macron's 'Republic for All' coalition came second. The far-right RN party, which won 31.4% of the vote in the first round, was expected to win the most seats in the National Assembly. However, the results showed that no party or coalition won a majority, leaving the country in a state of uncertainty. The President's party and the left-wing coalition have agreed to work together, but it is unclear what this will mean for the country's future. The new government is expected to be formed in the coming weeks, with the first session of the National Assembly scheduled for July 18.

This decision comes after the exit polls showed that the left-wing coalition 'National Front' won the majority of seats in the second round of parliamentary elections, while the pro-presidential block came in second place. Attal stated that he is willing to stay in office until the Olympic Games in Paris, which start on July 26, as long as it is required by his duty.

**Left-Wing Coalition Wins French Legislative Election, Blocks Far-Right**
The left-wing coalition, known as the New Popular Front, won the legislative election in France, with 182 seats in the National Assembly. The coalition led by President Emmanuel Macron, called Together, came in second with 168 seats. The far-right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, came in third with 143 seats. This is the fourth time a republican front has blocked the far-right from gaining power, after similar elections in 2002, 2017, and 2022. Over 220 left-wing or center politicians withdrew their candidacies in the second round to ensure their votes were transferred to the best-placed candidate to block the election of a far-right representative. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the left-wing group France Insubmissive, called on Macron to form a government, signaling a return to cohabitation in French politics. He said the left will not give up this condition. 'We are ready to govern', Mélenchon said. However, the left does not have a majority to automatically form a government, as it did not obtain the 289 seats needed to choose the prime minister. The expectation is that the left-wing coalition and Macron's base will join forces to achieve a majority in the National Assembly and then choose the prime minister. 'The French people said no to the far-right', said Olivier Faure, first secretary of the Socialist Party, which is part of the left-wing coalition. 'We avoided the worst', he said, acknowledging that the left-wing parties do not have an absolute majority, but still asking Macron to recognize the defeat and let the left choose the prime minister. Gabriel Attal, Macron's current prime minister, said that the risks of a far-right or far-left government were avoided. 'No majority can be made by the extremes', he said. He announced that he will resign on Monday (8) due to the lack of majority for Macron's allies. Macron indicated that he will not make any decisions now and will wait until July 18, when the National Assembly meets in its new formation to 'take the necessary decisions'.

French President Emmanuel Macron did not address the nation on July 7th after the first results of the second round were announced. The left-wing alliance 'New Popular Front' is currently leading in the election, while the presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' is in second place.

**French Legislative Elections: A New Era of Coalition-Building**
The 2024 French legislative elections resulted in an unexpected outcome, with the RN failing to approach the absolute majority (289 seats). The new legislature will be divided into three roughly equal blocs: the Nouveau Front populaire at left, the presidential camp, and the extreme right. The center and left will attempt to form a coalition, excluding the Insoumis and supporters of Éric Ciotti. Several prominent figures have proposed different formulations to describe this scenario, including 'Assemblée plurielle' by Gabriel Attal, 'entente républicaine' by François Bayrou, and 'gouvernement provisoire' by Xavier Bertrand. The path to a stable coalition is uncertain and may take time, requiring an agreement on a programmatic accord and a consensus on a leader. The Constitution does not impose a deadline for the formation of a government, and Gabriel Attal has indicated he will continue to serve as Prime Minister during the transition. Another option is a 'gouvernement de techniciens', composed of high-ranking officials, which could be a temporary solution to prepare the budget. The parliamentary session is set to resume on July 18.

**France on the Brink of Having its First Far-Right Government Since World War II**
France may have its first far-right government since World War II if Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National (RN) wins an absolute majority and its leader, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, becomes prime minister. In the first round of elections on June 30, no party exceeded the 289-seat threshold for an absolute victory. The RN received 33.1% of the votes. The 'Ensemble' (Together) coalition led by Macron achieved 21% of the votes, while left-wing parties had a relatively strong performance. The New Popular Front, an alliance between the Socialist Party, Greens, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon's France without an Arc, formed after the election call, received 28% - a slight improvement from the 25.7% achieved by the equivalent NUPES coalition in 2022.

**What to Expect from a Macron Government in a State of Cohabitation**
If Emmanuel Macron's coalition, Together, does not obtain a majority in the French National Assembly elections on Sunday (July 7, 2024), France will experience a phenomenon called 'cohabitation'. This occurs when the party or coalition of the French president does not have a majority in the National Assembly. In this case, the president, not necessarily, appoints a prime minister who satisfies the majority of the deputies. Since the 5th French Republic, this has happened three times: 1986, 1993, and 1997. If the National Rally (right-wing) obtains a majority, Macron is expected to appoint Jordan Bardella (right-wing) as prime minister, marking the 4th cohabitation since 1958. If the New Popular Front (left-wing) wins, Olivier Faure will be the next head of government. In both cases, Macron's powers will be reduced, and he will not be able to dissolve the National Assembly until one year before the next election and will not appoint the next government's ministers. The prime minister, on the other hand, will be responsible for governing the country internally, choosing ministers, and developing policies independently of the executive. In cases of disagreement between the president and prime minister, the prime minister's decisions will take precedence, making Macron's convictions obsolete.

**France Holds Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
France is holding the second round of parliamentary elections on July 7, 2024, after President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly following the European Parliament elections. The elections are being held under a majoritarian system, with the first round taking place on June 30. According to opinion polls, the far-right 'National Rally' party, led by Marine Le Pen, is likely to win a majority of seats, but may not have the absolute majority needed to form a government. The party has been criticized for its economic program, which is seen as left-wing, and its stance on migration and Ukraine. The left-wing coalition, led by the 'New Popular Front', is expected to come in second, while the centrist parties, including Macron's party, are likely to come in third. The outcome of the election will determine who will become the next Prime Minister of France.

**France's Parliamentary Elections: A Battle for Power**
France is holding its second round of parliamentary elections on July 7, with 501 single-member constituencies and 76 parliamentarians already elected in the first round. The far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, is seeking to win a majority in the National Assembly, with 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella stating he is ready to become prime minister. The left-wing New Popular Front and the centrist coalition led by President Macron's party, 'Together!', are also vying for power. The election is expected to be closely contested, with many predicting a hung parliament. The results will be announced on July 8, with the National Assembly's composition determining the country's political landscape.

**Columna de Gilles Vergnon: What could happen in France?**
The results of the first round of the French legislative elections on June 30th largely matched the predictions of polling agencies, which had anticipated the rise of the National Rally, which received over 33% of the votes. The results show a stark contrast between two Frances: one of the metropolises and their suburbs, which overwhelmingly voted for the left, and one of the countryside and medium-sized cities (the 'peripheral France' revealed by geographer Christophe Guilluy) which leads in 489 of the 577 constituencies. It is difficult to predict the results of the second round this Sunday. The rapid creation of the 'new Popular Front' by all left-wing parties, the calls from left-wing parties and the presidential party to withdraw any candidate opposing RN in the second round, will undoubtedly limit its advance and prevent it from achieving an absolute majority. However, the configuration of the new Parliament could lead to an ungovernable country without a clear majority. A coalition government between the left (without Mélenchon), the presidential party, and the right will quickly become paralyzed by its contradictions, and it is likely to return to the polls within a year. There are two questions. The first refers to the reason for the dissolution of President Macron, a decision taken without informing the prime minister, incomprehensible to all observers, and which raises the question of the scope of presidential powers. The second refers to the political and social polarization of the country. The RN is not a 'fascist' party, but populist and anti-liberal. However, it has managed to capture the majority of the working-class and popular vote outside of the big cities. Left-wing parties should reflect on their inability to win over this electorate and respond to their concerns about security and control of migration flows. Otherwise, a 'popular front without the people' has little future.

**France's 2024 Legislative Elections: How the Second Round Works**
The future of France will be decided on July 7, 2024, in the second round of the 2024 legislative elections. This election is considered the most significant since 1945, as a far-right party, led by Marine Le Pen, could potentially come to power. French President Emmanuel Macron called for an early election after his party's poor performance in the European elections. However, the early election did not yield the desired results. The legislative elections in France typically take place every five years in two rounds, with the second round taking place one week after the first. In the first round, the far-right party, National Rally (RN), won with 33.5% of the votes, followed by the left-wing coalition, New Popular Front (NFP), with 28.1%, and the centrist coalition, Together for the Republic, led by Macron, with 20.7%. The Republicans, the classical right, were eliminated from the second round. The French electoral system is complex, and the results are often decided in the second round. In this case, the left and the presidential bloc have joined forces to recompose the anti-Le Pen front. The New Popular Front and Together for the Republic have decided to withdraw their candidates in the constituencies where they came third in the first round to support other parties that are not from RN and have received more votes. This mechanism has been used in other elections to prevent the far-right from coming to power. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and Jordan Bardella, who is running for prime minister, are also trying to seek support to win a majority in the Parliament and form a government. The latest polls indicate that RN would win between 190 and 220 seats, far from the majority required to form a government.

**French Legislative Election Campaign: A 'Grand Coalition' Against Rassemblement National?**
The French legislative election campaign continues, with three days to go before the second round on July 7, 2024. The leaders of the three main political blocks - Nouveau Front Populaire, Ensemble!, and Rassemblement national - are trying to convince French voters to support them. While Rassemblement national is already celebrating its expected majority in the National Assembly, its opponents are trying to form a 'Republican Front' to counter it. The possibility of a 'grand coalition' between the left and right against Rassemblement national is being discussed, but it's still uncertain. Emmanuel Macron has ruled out governing with La France insoumise, and some Insoumis leaders are skeptical about the idea of a coalition. Marine Tondelier, the leader of the Écologistes, has not closed the door to this scenario, but has excluded a new 'Macronist Prime Minister'. Sandrine Rousseau believes such a coalition would be 'betraying' voters.

**Trudeau Expresses Concern Over Growing Right-Wing Support in France**
Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau expressed concern about the growing support for right-wing populists in France. He stated, 'We see a rise of right-wing populists in all democratic countries.' According to Trudeau, leaders of democratic states must continue to 'bring benefits to their countries and calm their citizens', as right-wing forces are playing on the emotions of the population due to the difficult economic situation. The first round of the early parliamentary elections in France took place on June 30. The right-wing party 'National Rally' and its allies took first place with 33.15% of the votes. The left-wing alliance 'New Popular Front' took second place with 27.99%. The presidential coalition 'Together!' received 20.04%, according to the final data published by the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic.

**France's Scenarios After the Second Round of Legislative Elections**
The second round of the French legislative elections will take place on July 7 and will determine whether the far-right National Rally (RN) party, led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, will obtain a majority in the National Assembly. After winning 33.1% of the votes in the first round, RN is followed by the left-wing coalition New Popular Front with 28% and the coalition Together, led by President Emmanuel Macron, with 20%. The first round has assigned 76 seats out of 577, with 32 for the New Popular Front and 39 for RN. The remaining 501 seats will be contested in a context of withdrawal of left-wing and Macronist candidates who did not make it to the second round. Macron and RN's leader, Gabriel Attal, have called for unity against the far-right. If RN obtains a majority, it would guarantee a government led by Jordan Bardella, the party's formal leader, who would become the first prime minister of France. Macron has announced that he will not resign regardless of the election results, and would have to govern in a situation of cohabitation with a prime minister from the far-right until May 2027. Another possible scenario is that the second round does not produce a clear winner, leading to a risk of institutional deadlock, as the three main blocks are unlikely to agree on a coalition to obtain a majority. In this case, a prime minister could be named, but would lead a fragile and minority government with difficulties in governing and approving laws.

**LFI Refuses to Participate in Grand Coalition, Says Bompard**
Manuel Bompard, coordinator of La France insoumise, has ruled out the possibility of a grand coalition if no absolute majority emerges after the second round of the 2024 legislative elections on July 7. He stated that the goal is to have a majority to govern with the Nouveau Front populaire and that the Insoumis will only govern to implement their program, nothing more. Bompard emphasized that there will be no alliance without fiscal justice. He also responded to Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's proposal for an 'Assemblée plurielle' by saying that he will not participate in any government that does not restore fiscal justice and implement a policy of wealth redistribution.

**France: Around 100 Candidates Withdraw from Parliamentary Elections to Prevent Right-Wing Party's Victory**
Around 100 candidates who made it to the second round of the French parliamentary elections have withdrawn their candidacies to prevent the right-wing party 'National Rally' led by Jordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen from winning. According to Agence France-Presse, candidates from the presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' and the left-wing alliance 'New Popular Front' have withdrawn their candidacies. These politicians had taken third place in their single-member constituencies after the first round, but had enough votes to advance to the second round. The French National Assembly has 577 members, and a party needs 289 seats to achieve an absolute majority. Earlier, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal stated that around 60 candidates from the presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' would withdraw from the election in the second round to vote for the left and prevent 'National Rally' from winning. According to the results of the first round, held on June 30, 'National Rally' led with 33% of the votes, while 'New Popular Front' received 28%, and the coalition 'Together for the Republic' gathered 20%.

France's presidential coalition, Together for the Republic, will withdraw around 60 candidates in the second round of parliamentary elections to prevent the National Rally Party's victory. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal explained, 'We have made this choice after the first round of voting in more than 60 constituencies. It means that we will withdraw our candidates because if they stay in the third place, a candidate from the National Rally will defeat the other candidate who, like us, would defend the republic's values.' The National Rally is currently leading with 33% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front with 28.5%, and Together for the Republic with 22%.

**Macron's Coalition to Withdraw Candidates to Prevent Le Pen's Victory**
The coalition 'Together for the Republic' led by President Emmanuel Macron has decided to withdraw around 60 of its candidates before the second round of parliamentary elections in France. This move is aimed at preventing the victory of candidates from the opposition party 'National Rally' led by Marine Le Pen, according to French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. 'We made this choice... This will mean withdrawing our candidates, keeping them in third place would lead to the election of a deputy from the 'National Rally', Attal said at a press conference. The Prime Minister emphasized that such actions correspond to the defense of republican values, which are a priority for their coalition. Despite disappointment and possible discontent among citizens, more than 300 candidates from the 'Together for the Republic' coalition successfully passed to the second round. The Prime Minister expressed confidence that their party best defends the values that French people cherish. On the backdrop of the first round of elections, where 'National Rally' received 33% of the votes, and 'New Popular Front' - 28.5%, the 'Together for the Republic' coalition took third place with 22%.

The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' in France has announced that it will withdraw around 60 candidates from the parliamentary election runoff. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal made the statement at a press conference, citing the need to prevent the opposition party 'National Union' from winning. According to Attal, if the coalition's candidates were to remain on the third place, it would lead to the election of a 'National Union' candidate against another candidate. Attal believes that this move may anger French citizens, but it will protect their interests. The coalition, consisting of five parties, had over 300 candidates in the second round, with the presidential coalition receiving 22% of the votes in the first round, while the opposition party received 33%.

**French Election: Right-Wing Party Leads, Jordan Bardella Emerges as Prime Minister Favorite**
The French will vote on June 30, 2024, in the first round of the National Assembly elections. The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron on June 9, 2024, has raised concerns about the possibility of a right-wing government. The latest polls show the right-wing party RN (National Rally) leading with 36.5% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front (a coalition of left-wing and center-left parties) with 29%, and Macron's centrist alliance (Together) in third place with 20.5%. If the right-wing party wins the first round and RN gains another significant victory in the second round on July 7, 2024, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, who shares the leadership of the National Rally with Marine Le Pen, is likely to become the next Prime Minister. Bardella's appeal is strong among French citizens concerned about immigration, national sovereignty, and critical of Macron's pro-Ukrainian policies. He uses social media to spread his messages and gain popularity, especially with impactful slogans. As Prime Minister, Bardella is likely to adopt stricter policies on immigration, which could increase tensions with the Muslim population in France. He has also been critical of the European Union, arguing that France's participation in the EU has resulted in economic losses and compromised national identity. If the right-wing party gains more support, it is possible that France could leave the EU, but this would have significant political and economic costs, considering France's historical leadership role in the integration process.

**France's Early Parliamentary Elections: A Possible Rise of Far-Right Forces**
French voters began casting their ballots in the early parliamentary elections on June 30, 2024, which may lead to the rise of far-right forces to power for the first time since the Nazi era. The elections, which will be held in two rounds, may affect European financial markets and Western support for Ukraine, as well as France's nuclear arsenal and global military power, according to Associated Press. The elections come amid frustration with President Emmanuel Macron's economic policies and rising anti-immigrant sentiment. Marine Le Pen's National Rally party has been gaining popularity, while a new left-wing coalition, the 'New Popular Front', poses a challenge to Macron's centrist party 'Together for the Republic'. Macron has called for early elections after his party's defeat in the European Parliament elections earlier in June. The polls suggest that the National Rally may win a majority in parliament, which could lead to Macron appointing Jordan Bardella, the party's 28-year-old leader, as prime minister. This would be the first time since World War II that a far-right government has taken power in France.

**France's Parliamentary Elections: Scenarios and Implications**
France is holding parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, with the president, Emmanuel Macron, calling for early elections after the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) won a significant number of seats in the European elections. The French system of government is semi-presidential, with a president elected directly and a parliament with significant powers. The possible scenarios include Macron's party winning a majority, forming a coalition, or the RN or left-wing coalition winning a majority, leading to a cohabitation government. In the latter case, Macron would have to choose a prime minister from the winning coalition and the prime minister would choose their ministers. If no party wins a majority, a stalemate could occur, but new elections would not be held for at least a year. Some analysts suggest that Macron should resign in this case. The article also mentions the possibility of a cohabitation government between Macron and Marine Le Pen, the leader of the RN, and the potential for tensions between the president and prime minister on European issues.

The election is significant as it will determine the next prime minister, who will have to work with President Emmanuel Macron. The far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, is expected to perform well, with some polls suggesting it could win more than 35% of the vote in the first round. The left-wing coalition, led by the French Communist Party, is expected to come in second with around 29% of the vote. The centrist coalition, led by President Macron's party, is expected to win around 20% of the vote. The election is seen as a test of Macron's popularity and the ability of the far-right to gain power in France.

**France's Early Legislative Elections: A Crucial Test for the Country's Future**
France is holding early legislative elections, which could lead to a government of the far-right. The election will take place on June 30 and July 7. The far-right National Union party, led by Marine Le Pen and her protégé Jordan Bardella, is expected to win more than 35% of the votes in the first round, while the centrist coalition led by President Emmanuel Macron is expected to receive less than 20%. Macron called for the elections to ensure a clear majority and stability in the government. Bardella, who is 28 years old, has been chosen to lead the National Union party and could become the youngest prime minister in Europe in over two centuries if he wins. The election is expected to be a close contest between the National Union and the left-wing coalition, which includes the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Greens. The election outcome will have significant implications for France's economy and its relationship with the European Union.

The election will take place over two rounds on June 30 and July 7. Marine Le Pen's party, the RN, has gained momentum after Eric Ciotti, leader of the Republicans, announced they would enter a coalition with the RN. If the RN wins, it would make Marine Le Pen the youngest prime minister in over two centuries.

**What Political Scenarios for July?**
The French political landscape will be put to the test. The first round of legislative elections will take place on June 30, 2024. If the National Rally or the New Popular Front wins, nothing is guaranteed for them. Once the result is known, the National Assembly must convene on the second Thursday following the election, as stipulated by Article 12 of the Constitution, which relates to the dissolution of the National Assembly. This will be on July 18. If Emmanuel Macron obtains an absolute majority, he can govern without hindrance. In the event of an absolute majority for the National Rally, a cohabitation with Jordan Bardella as Prime Minister would be inevitable. However, Macron, as President, has the right to refuse to appoint the Prime Minister proposed by the opposition, although this could lead to tensions and motions of censure. If the RN obtains a relative majority, Jordan Bardella has already announced that he would refuse the Prime Minister position, leading to a potential deadlock. Finally, without a clear majority, an apolitical technical government could be formed to manage current affairs. If instability persists, Macron could consider a new dissolution of the Assembly after a year or even his own resignation, although he has ruled out this option in the short term.

**France Election 2024: How Does The Vote Work**
France's parliamentary election is scheduled for June 30 and July 7, 2024. Recent polls indicate the far-right National Party is gaining momentum. The election process involves two rounds: the first round, where candidates with an absolute majority are elected, and the second round, where candidates with at least 12.5% of registered voters compete in a run-off. The National Assembly's composition will determine the government formation, with President Emmanuel Macron appointing the prime minister. Possible outcomes include a paralyzed assembly, a mainstream alliance, or a minority government led by the RN. The election has the potential to reshape France's political landscape and policies.

**Macron's Coalition to Reduce Electricity Bills and Inheritance Tax if Elected**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Atal announced that the centrist coalition led by President Emmanuel Macron will reduce electricity bills and inheritance tax and link retirement pensions to inflation if they win the early elections. This is an attempt to counter the rise of the far-right and form a new left-wing alliance. Macron's coalition, 'Together', is considered the less likely to win in the parliamentary elections, which Macron called after losing heavily to the National Rally, a far-right party, in the European Parliament elections this month. The early elections are scheduled to take place on June 30 and July 7. Macron's campaign focuses on appearing as a fortress for democratic values and sound economic management that protects the nation from extreme political extremes. Atal said that the policies advocated by the National Rally and the new left-wing parties, known as the Popular Front, will lead to mass unemployment. He added in a press conference: 'Let us not jump into the unknown without a safety net.'

**Explainer: France election 2024: what happens if no one gets an absolute majority?**
France is holding a snap parliamentary election on June 30 and July 7, with opinion polls suggesting the far-right National Rally (RN) could win without an absolute majority. If this happens, President Emmanuel Macron would appoint the prime minister, but the constitution does not specify the criteria for this decision. The RN has said it will turn down the job if it and its allies do not win an absolute majority. Macron could try to form an alliance with mainstream parties or offer the job to the left, which could form a minority government. If the RN wins a relative majority, it could struggle to pass reforms, and if it secures an absolute majority, it would likely get the prime minister job. If none of the three main groups (far-right, centrist, and left) can govern alone or form a coalition, France could face political paralysis, with little legislation being adopted and a caretaker government running daily affairs.

The upcoming French elections on June 30th and July 7th will determine the composition of the Assemblée nationale, and subsequently, the prime minister. The president, Emmanuel Macron, remains in office until 2027 and has significant power, but is limited by the need for a majority in parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the president and can be from within or outside the political sphere. The article discusses the potential candidates for the role, including Gabriel Attal, Jordan Bardella, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, François Ruffin, Fabien Roussel, Laurent Berger, Carole Delga, and others. The wildcard option is that Macron appoints someone from outside the political world, potentially someone with no party affiliation, to bring together the warring factions.

**French Prime Minister Calls for 'Useful Vote' in Upcoming Elections**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has called for a 'useful vote' for the centrist coalition of President Emmanuel Macron in the upcoming June 30 and July 7 elections. Attal emphasized that there is no fatalism in the victory of the extreme right or left, and that more and more French people are saying they do not want to choose between the extremes. He defended the third way of the presidential majority (Ensemble pour la République) with credible proposals. Attal criticized the candidate for the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, saying that he has less of a program and more conditions, and that he is like a horse that refuses obstacles. He also denounced the extreme right and left, which promise fiscal punches at all levels to finance their budget follies. When asked about the decline in popularity of Emmanuel Macron, Attal acknowledged that many French people express anger or discontent with the dissolution of the National Assembly, but Macron was elected until 2027. He emphasized that an election is not a presidential election, but rather a vote for a prime minister, government, and majority in the National Assembly. Whatever the result of the vote, the President of the Republic will still be the President of the Republic.

**Coalition between Presidential Majority and Les Républicains Formed in Hauts-de-Seine for Legislative Elections**
A coalition between the presidential majority and Les Républicains has been formed in the Hauts-de-Seine department for the upcoming legislative elections on June 30 and July 7. The agreement aims to 'bar the way to extreme right and left' and create a 'republican arc'. The coalition will not present candidates against LR or majority lists in several constituencies. Gabriel Attal, the Prime Minister, is a candidate in the 9th constituency. Other candidates include Philippe Juvin, Isabelle de Crécy, Céline Calvez, Constance Le Grip, Pierre Cazeneuve, Prisca Thevenot, Stéphane Séjourné, and Maud Brégeon.

**Who will be the next Prime Minister of France?**
The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron has led to a period of uncertainty in France. The upcoming legislative elections on June 30 and July 7 will shape the country's political landscape and determine the next Prime Minister. We have analyzed four possible scenarios: 1) Renaissance maintains its majority, 2) Renaissance forms a coalition with LR, 3) the far-right wins a majority, and 4) the left creates a surprise. In the first scenario, Gabriel Attal, the current Prime Minister, would lead the campaign alongside his allies from Modem and Horizon. If he succeeds in reversing the trend of the European elections and maintains the current majority, he would be a strong candidate for his own succession. In the second scenario, Emmanuel Macron would try to build a new majority by negotiating with other political forces. The future Prime Minister would be expected to embody this new majority. The far-right, led by Marine Le Pen, has a strong chance of winning a majority, but would likely choose Jordan Bardella as Prime Minister to focus on the next presidential election. The left, led by François Ruffin, has also made a surprise move by forming a common front with other left-wing parties. They will need to find a suitable candidate to lead the coalition and become Prime Minister.

**France Heads to the Polls: The Complex Electoral System and the 'Trap' for Le Pen**
France is heading to the polls on June 30 to elect its 577 members of the National Assembly. The president, Emmanuel Macron, has dissolved the parliament after a tumultuous first part of the legislature, which saw two prime ministers and a paralyzed assembly due to lengthy and exhausting negotiations between the majority and opposition parties. The straw that broke the camel's back was the poor result of Macron's party in the European elections and the rise of the far-right, led by Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement national (Rn). Macron hopes that the early dissolution will bring stability to the assembly, but the complex electoral system may reduce the weight of the far-right's votes. The French electoral system is a complex one, with a two-round majority system, where each of the 577 electoral districts elects one deputy. The first round will take place on June 30, and the second round on July 7. The system is designed to favor the parties that have a strong local presence and coalitions, which has historically disadvantaged extreme parties like Le Pen's Rn. Macron's coalition and the centrist parties have increased their votes between the two rounds, while Rn has seen a decline. Macron hopes that this anti-Le Pen effect will work in his favor.

**Raphaël Glucksmann proposes Laurent Berger as Prime Minister in case of left-wing victory**
After the European elections, French President Emmanuel Macron announced the dissolution of the National Assembly and the organization of early legislative elections on June 30 and July 7. Marine Le Pen, Jordan Bardella, and Marion Maréchal met to discuss a potential alliance for the elections. Marine Le Pen stated that the RN president would be Prime Minister if the party wins. Raphaël Glucksmann, who obtained 13.8% of the vote for the Socialist Party and Place publique, also expressed his opinion on the matter. He proposed Laurent Berger, former CFDT general secretary, to lead the government if the left wins: 'I think there is a figure from civil society who can calm things down, who is the antithesis of the current president, who will not play with institutions, who will reconcile the French, who will carry a project of social justice and ecology.' He excluded himself from becoming Prime Minister and refused the idea of a coalition led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Glucksmann posed several conditions for an alliance with La France insoumise, including a 'clear cap' with 'a rejection of the brutality of political life, insults, fake news, and calumny', referring to Jean-Luc Mélenchon's strategy.
