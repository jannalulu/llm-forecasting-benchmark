**The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020**
The tech industry experienced significant job instability following the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Apple initiating large-scale layoffs. Google's January 2023 layoff of 12,000 employees was the largest single layoff event in the tech sector since 2020. In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.

Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said, 'Cisco is optimistic about rebounding demand for our networking equipment.' IBM stated, 'IBM will now prioritize serving private enterprises and select multinationals within the Chinese market.' Infineon CEO Jochen Hanebeck explained, 'The slow recovery in target markets is due to prolonged weak economic momentum and excess inventory levels.'

**Tech Companies Announce Layoffs in 2024, Affecting Thousands of Employees**
Several major tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Google, have announced layoffs in 2024, affecting thousands of employees. According to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker of layoffs, 422 tech companies have laid off 136,782 employees by August 30, 2024. Apple has laid off around 100 employees from its digital services team, while GoPro plans to reduce its workforce by 15% by the end of 2024, affecting around 139 employees.

Intel announced the largest layoff of the year, affecting 15,000 employees, or 15% of its workforce. Microsoft has continued its layoff trend in 2024, with multiple rounds of layoffs affecting various divisions. The trend of layoffs in the tech industry is driven by cost-cutting measures, strategic shifts towards AI, and adapting to post-pandemic market realities. Many companies had hired more employees during the pandemic, and are now trying to balance costs with future growth possibilities. Additionally, the rapid rise of AI as a transformative technology has prompted many companies to reorganize their operations to better compete in this emerging field.

**Tech layoffs surge in August with 27K job cuts, highest since January: US, China, and Canada impacted**
In August, 44 companies laid off 27,065 staff, the highest number of layoffs since January. Intel led the charge with 15,000 job cuts, followed by Cisco with 5,900 layoffs. Other companies, including Infineon, IBM, and Skip The Dishes, also announced significant job cuts. The layoffs are due to a combination of strategic moves, cost-saving, and broader economic challenges. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both – particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.' Cisco's layoffs come at a time when the company is shifting its focus to more rapidly growing areas in technology – AI and cybersecurity. The layoffs reflect a changing tech industry, with companies prioritizing financial health and future growth areas, even at the expense of their workforce. However, this could be an opportunity for those affected to upskill or reskill and align themselves with the future needs of the tech industry.

**Global tech lay-offs surge, but India likely to see limited impact**
Global tech lay-offs have surged, but India is likely to see limited impact, according to industry experts. Subramanyam S, CEO of Ascent HR Technologies, said, 'Even if we consider that the cost arbitrage would favour the Indian workforce, there still may be a reduction of 10-15 per cent, with a possible hiring freeze as the best case scenario.' Freshers and campus hires are expected to be hit the hardest, with hiring freezes and rescinded job offers becoming common. Neeti Sharma, CEO of TeamLease Digital, noted that 30 per cent of planned hiring for fresh tech graduates in 2024 has been put on hold or cancelled. However, many companies are maintaining operations through quiet hiring by shifting internal employees to new roles or bringing in contractors and part-time workers. '50 per cent of large enterprises in India have adopted this approach to sustain productivity without increasing full-time headcount,' Sharma said. The lay-offs are driven by funding drying out or new job roles up the value chain not opening up at scale. So far, tech and start-up sectors, especially e-commerce, ed-tech, and fintech, have seen significant lay-offs, with over 23,000 Indian start-up employees losing their jobs in 2023-24. A growing focus is on retaining only top performers, with 45 per cent of companies in the tech and start-up sectors implementing performance-based lay-offs to maintain a leaner, more productive workforce. 'Alongside, companies are increasingly offering voluntary separation programmes, including early retirement packages. This strategy helps lower costs while minimising the negative impact on employee morale and public perception,' Sharma observed.

**Tech Layoffs 2024: The Industry's Massive Job Cuts**
The tech industry is experiencing a massive wave of layoffs in 2024, with over 460,000 jobs lost in the past two years. The largest layoffs have occurred in the US, but Germany is also heavily affected, ranking third globally. According to data from BestBrokers, over 165 companies have cut more than 200,000 jobs worldwide since the beginning of the year. SAP is responsible for 23% of the layoffs in 2024, having announced the elimination of 8,000 jobs in January as part of a restructuring process. Other notable tech companies that have laid off employees include Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and eBay. The layoffs are attributed to external factors such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as internal factors like over-expansion during the pandemic. The tech industry is expected to continue to face challenges in the coming years, with many companies struggling to adapt to changing market conditions and employee expectations. 'The tech industry is no longer the safe haven it once was,' says the author. 'Jobs at big tech companies are no longer seen as a path to wealth and prestige.'

**Google**
As of August 20, 2024, tech companies have laid off over 124,000 employees, bringing the total number of layoffs since 2022 to 428,449. Major tech companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Dell, Intel, IBM, Cisco, SAP, Salesforce, Cohere, Stability AI, TikTok, YouTube, Snap, Match Group, Bumble, PayPal, Swiggy, Unacademy, Byju's, Ola, Koo, Paytm, Twitch, and Discord have all announced layoffs, with some companies cutting up to 50% of their workforce. The layoffs are attributed to a combination of factors, including cost-cutting to invest in AI, a global downturn, over-hiring during the pandemic, and falling behind due to not investing in AI at the right time. 'We need to simplify execution and drive velocity,' said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, while Tesla's Elon Musk announced that the company would be cutting'more than 10%' of its global workforce to cut costs. 'We grew too quickly and wanted to sharpen our focus,' said Discord CEO Jason Citron. The layoffs have had a significant impact on employees, with some companies offering voluntary leave programs and re-skilling measures to help those affected.

Major corporations, including Google, Microsoft, Nike, Amazon, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, expect to make layoffs in the coming months. A survey by ResumeBuilder found that 40% of business leaders anticipate layoffs in 2024, with half of those surveyed believing a recession is possible. Vance Ginn, President of Ginn Economic Consulting, attributes the layoffs to a slowing economy due to inflation, reduced consumer demand, and increased debt. Some companies are trying to implement 48-hour work weeks or offer alternative opportunities to retain workers, but Ginn notes that this can put more stress on the economy. The increasing use of AI is also making workers question their next move, as some industries fully embrace its capabilities.

**Mass Layoffs in the Technology Sector: A Growing Trend**
The technology sector is experiencing a wave of mass layoffs in 2024, with major players and startups alike being affected. Intel, a leading manufacturer of microprocessors, announced in August that it would be cutting 15% of its workforce, approximately 15,000 people, due to a significant decline in net income of 85% despite stable revenue of $12.8 billion in the second quarter. Dell Technologies has also been reducing its workforce, with 13,000 layoffs in 2023 and an additional 6,650 in February 2024, totaling 12,500 layoffs or 10% of its global workforce. Cisco Systems, a major producer of telecommunications equipment, laid off 4,200 employees in February 2024, representing 5% of its total workforce, and has announced plans to lay off thousands more in August. These events are just the tip of the iceberg in a global picture of mass layoffs. In 2024, over 60,000 employees in 254 companies worldwide have lost their jobs, with 262,682 layoffs in 1186 companies in 2023. These layoffs are a result of companies expanding their workforce during the pandemic to meet the increased demand for digital services, but with the pandemic's end and a return to normal business conditions, the excess resources have become a burden. Microsoft, which completed the largest acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, has also been affected, with 1,900 layoffs in its gaming division. SAP, a German giant in corporate software, has announced 8,000 layoffs as part of its transition to generative AI technologies. Smaller companies have also been affected, with Kenyan startup Mobius closing its operations due to financial difficulties and Stack Overflow laying off 28% of its staff, betting on generative AI for software development automation. These layoffs occur despite a projected 5.1 trillion dollar growth in global IT spending in 2024. Companies are forced to cut costs and reassess their business models to remain competitive in the new economic conditions. The technology industry in 2024 demonstrates that adapting to changing market conditions is not just a temporary measure, but a pressing necessity. The layoffs we see today highlight the importance of effective resource management and choosing the right strategies for long-term success, as quoted by an unnamed source, 'It is a testament to the hard work of our employees and the dedication of our company.'

**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. In a note to employees, CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate.' He added, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected, and we have not yet fully benefited from powerful trends like AI. Our costs are too high, and our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both, particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is more challenging than previously expected.' Gelsinger also announced that the company will offer a improved retirement package and a voluntary leave program for eligible employees. He stated, 'These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I've done in my career.' He emphasized, 'My commitment to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency, and respect in the coming weeks and months.' This is the second round of layoffs at Intel since the COVID-19 pandemic, following a 5% reduction in staff in October 2022. The company is trying to recover in the market, but it is not alone in the tech industry, as other companies have also announced massive layoffs and hiring freezes in recent years.

**The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020**
The tech industry experienced significant job instability following the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Apple initiating large-scale layoffs. Google's January 2023 layoff of 12,000 employees was the largest single layoff event in the tech sector since 2020. In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.
