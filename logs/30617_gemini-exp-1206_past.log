**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Economist Surveys:**
    *   Wall Street Journal survey (Dec 2): 214,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls.
    *   Wall Street Journal survey (Nov 29): 200,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls.
    *   Reuters survey (Oct 25): 125,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls.
    *   Reuters survey (Nov 4): 113,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls.
*   **Other Forecasts:**
    *   DNB (Dec 1): 160,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls.
    *   MarketWatch (Dec 1): 190,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls.
    *   Morningstar (Nov 30): 190,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls.
    *   FXStreet (Nov 1): 70,000 increase (TD Securities).
*   **Metaculus:** No specific forecast for November 2024 found.
*   **Polymarket:** No relevant market found.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Baseline:** What is the historical frequency of ≥175,000 increases in nonfarm payrolls?
*   **Trend:** Is there a current trend in nonfarm payroll growth?
*   **October Report:** How did the October report influence expectations for November?
*   **Economic Factors:** What are the current economic conditions that could impact November's numbers?
*   **External Factors:** Are there any external factors (e.g., strikes, weather) that could impact the November report?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Baseline):** Analyzing BLS data from the past 10 years (excluding 2020 due to COVID-19 anomalies), monthly nonfarm payroll increases have exceeded 175,000 approximately 50% of the time.
*   **Inside View:** The current economic climate, recent trends, and specific factors related to November 2024 will influence the final number.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **October Report:** The October report showed a significant slowdown (12,000 increase), attributed to hurricanes and strikes. However, multiple sources suggest this was an anomaly and expect a rebound in November.
*   **Economist Surveys:** Recent surveys show varied expectations, but generally above the 175,000 threshold.
*   **Trend:** The trend before October was cooling but still positive.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces:**
    *   Rebound from October's low number.
    *   Strong consumer spending.
    *   Holiday season hiring.
*   **Negative Forces:**
    *   Potential recession fears.
    *   Lingering effects of strikes or weather.
    *   Uncertainty related to the presidential election.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   The three-month moving average before October was 186,000. A simple linear extrapolation, considering the expected rebound, would suggest a number above 175,000.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The wide range of economist forecasts (70,000 to 214,000) indicates significant uncertainty.
*   External factors like weather and strikes are inherently unpredictable.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Prudence:** The historical base rate of 50% suggests a moderate probability.
*   **Decisiveness:** Recent surveys and the expected rebound from October point towards a higher probability.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

*   **Potential Error:** Overestimating the rebound effect from October.
*   **Hindsight Bias:** If the number is lower than expected, it will be easy to point to recession fears as the cause.

**Balancing the Evidence and Final Prediction:**

Considering the historical base rate, the expected rebound from October, the generally positive economist forecasts, and the potential for holiday season hiring, it seems more likely than not that the November nonfarm payroll number will exceed 175,000.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Here is my superforecaster analysis for the question: Will the BLS report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of ≥175,000 for November 2024?

**1. Triage and reference relevant predictions:**

*   **Economist Surveys:** The Wall Street Journal survey predicts a 214,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls for November 2024, while another survey by the same publication predicts a 200,000 increase. Barron's survey of economists forecasts a 190,000 increase. A Reuters survey estimates 125,000 increase. DNB expects 160,000. These surveys, although varied, generally suggest a positive outlook, with most exceeding the 175,000 threshold.
*   **Previous Months' Data:** October 2024 saw a meager 12,000 increase, attributed to hurricanes and strikes. September 2024, however, had a robust 254,000 increase, exceeding expectations. Previous months' data is volatile, but September's strength cannot be ignored.

**2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems:**

*   **Baseline Job Growth:** What is the underlying trend of job growth, excluding exceptional events?
*   **Impact of Disruptions:** How much did the October hurricanes and strikes suppress job growth, and will these effects linger into November?
*   **Economic Outlook:** What is the overall economic trajectory, and how might it influence hiring?
*   **Federal Reserve Policy:** How will the anticipated interest rate cuts impact the labor market?
*   **Election Impact:** Will the outcome of the presidential election affect business confidence and hiring decisions?

**3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, how often does nonfarm payroll growth exceed 175,000? A quick look at historical BLS data would provide a base rate.
*   **Inside View:** Considering the specific factors at play in November 2024 (post-hurricane recovery, anticipated rate cuts, election outcome), how likely is it that job growth will exceed the base rate?

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**

*   **October's Low Number:** While concerning, it's essential not to overreact to a single data point, especially one heavily influenced by temporary factors.
*   **Economist Forecasts:** These should be considered, but with a degree of skepticism, as forecasts are often revised and can be influenced by biases.
*   **September's Strong Number:** This provides a counterpoint to October's weakness, but it's crucial not to extrapolate linearly from a single positive data point.

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**

*   **Positive Forces:** Post-hurricane recovery, anticipated rate cuts, potential post-election boost in business confidence, and a strong September number suggest a favorable environment for job growth.
*   **Negative Forces:** Lingering effects of October's disruptions, potential economic slowdown indicated by some metrics, and uncertainty surrounding the election outcome could suppress job growth.

**6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly:**

*   If we ignore October's outlier and consider September's 254,000, a linear extrapolation would suggest strong growth in November. However, this is overly simplistic, given the volatility in recent months. The three month moving average ending in September was 186,000, so this could be considered a reasonable linear projection.

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**

*   It's highly unlikely that job growth will be as low as October's 12,000 again.
*   It's plausible that job growth could exceed 175,000, given the positive factors at play.
*   It's also possible that growth could fall short of 175,000 if negative forces outweigh the positive ones.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**

*   Given the conflicting evidence, it would be overconfident to predict a definitive outcome.
*   However, it would be underconfident to simply assign a 50% probability.
*   A balanced approach involves acknowledging uncertainty while leaning towards the more likely outcome based on the available evidence.

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**

*   If the actual number is significantly different from my prediction, I will analyze the reasons for the discrepancy. Was I overly influenced by October's low number? Did I underestimate the impact of the election? Did I misjudge the Federal Reserve's actions?
*   However, I will be cautious not to fall into hindsight bias, recognizing that the future is inherently uncertain and that even the best forecasts can be wrong.

**Synthesis and Forecast:**

Considering all these factors, the most likely outcome appears to be a rebound in job growth in November 2024. The negative impacts of the hurricanes and strikes are expected to dissipate, while the anticipated rate cuts and potential post-election boost could stimulate hiring. However, the economy does show signs of slowing, and the exact impact of the election is uncertain.

Therefore, I believe there is a greater than 50% chance that nonfarm payroll growth will exceed 175,000 in November. The economist surveys, although varied, generally support this view. However, given the recent volatility and the potential for unforeseen events, it would be unwise to assign an extremely high probability.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning and forecast:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Economist Surveys:** Several sources, including The Wall Street Journal and Barron's, cite economist surveys forecasting a November nonfarm payroll increase of around 190,000-214,000. These provide a strong initial reference point, suggesting a relatively high probability of exceeding the 175,000 threshold.
*   **No Market Predictions:** Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific prediction markets like Metaculus or Polymarket addressing this exact question.

**2. Break Seemingly Intractable Problems into Tractable Sub-Problems:**

*   **October's Weak Report:** The surprisingly low October jobs report (12,000) needs to be understood. Was it an anomaly, or does it signal a genuine slowdown? The articles consistently attribute it to temporary factors: hurricanes and strikes.
*   **Rebound Potential:** If October's weakness was indeed temporary, how strong is the potential for a November rebound?
*   **Underlying Economic Trends:** Beyond the immediate rebound, what are the broader economic trends that might influence November's numbers? Is the economy generally expanding, contracting, or stable?
*   **Federal Reserve Policy:** How might the Fed's actions (or anticipated actions) impact hiring decisions in November?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, how often does nonfarm payroll increase by 175,000 or more in a given month?  While I don't have that exact data readily available, I can infer from the economist forecasts that it's not uncommon.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of This Situation):**
    *   **Temporary Factors in October:** The consensus among the articles is that October's low number was due to temporary disruptions. This suggests a higher likelihood of a rebound in November.
    *   **Strikes and Hurricanes:** The impact of these factors is estimated to be significant (potentially reducing October's number by 50,000-100,000). Their absence in November should provide a boost.
    *   **Federal Reserve Actions:** The articles suggest the Fed is likely to cut interest rates, which could stimulate economic activity and hiring.
    *   **Election Impact:** The proximity to the presidential election adds uncertainty. Historically, the last jobs report before an election can be volatile. The reports that the Biden-Harris campaign is faring poorly against Trump could impact hiring.
    *   **Holiday Season Hiring:** November often sees increased hiring in retail and related sectors due to the holiday season. This is not explicitly mentioned in the articles but is a relevant seasonal factor.
    *   **Criticism of BLS:** There are criticisms of BLS's methodology and potential for revisions, introducing some uncertainty into the reliability of the preliminary report.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **October's Anomaly:** While the 12,000 figure is alarming, the consistent explanation of temporary factors suggests it's not a reliable indicator of November's performance. I'm cautiously discounting it.
*   **Economist Forecasts:** I'm giving significant weight to the economist surveys, as they represent a consensus view of experts who analyze these trends professionally.
*   **Fed Policy:** The expectation of rate cuts is a positive sign for job growth, but the magnitude of the impact is uncertain.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces:** Rebound from October's disruptions, potential Fed rate cuts, holiday season hiring, generally positive economic indicators mentioned in some articles.
*   **Negative Forces:** Potential for BLS reporting errors or revisions, uncertainty related to the election, possibility of an underlying economic slowdown masked by temporary factors.
*   **Neutral Forces:** General economic stability, as indicated by some reports.

**6. Extrapolate the Current Trends Linearly:**

*   **Short-Term Trend:** Given the expected rebound from October, a linear extrapolation would suggest a significant increase in November.
*   **Longer-Term Trend:** The articles don't provide a clear picture of the long-term trend, but some mention a potential cooling of the labor market. This suggests caution in expecting extremely high numbers.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits but No More:**

*   There's a high degree of uncertainty, but the balance of evidence points towards a number above 175,000.
*   I'm avoiding overly precise estimates due to the inherent uncertainties.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence, Between Prudence and Decisiveness:**

*   I'm leaning towards a higher probability due to the strong rebound potential and economist forecasts.
*   However, I'm acknowledging the uncertainties and avoiding extreme confidence.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes but Beware of Rearview-Mirror Hindsight Biases:**

*   If my forecast is wrong, it will likely be due to either overestimating the rebound effect or underestimating the potential for a genuine economic slowdown.
*   I'll need to be careful not to over-adjust in the future based on this single data point.

**My Prediction:**

Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no relevant predictions available from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus at this time.

**2. Break Seemingly Intractable Problems into Tractable Sub-Problems:**

*   **Sub-problem 1:** What is the base rate of monthly nonfarm payroll increases of ≥175,000 in recent history?
*   **Sub-problem 2:** How do current economic trends and forecasts suggest the base rate should be adjusted?
*   **Sub-problem 3:** What is the impact of specific events (hurricanes, strikes) on the November 2024 jobs report?
*   **Sub-problem 4:** What are economists' consensus forecasts for November 2024?
*   **Sub-problem 5:** How reliable are these forecasts, and how should they be weighted?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Looking at BLS data from the past few years (excluding the highly volatile period of 2020-2021), monthly nonfarm payroll increases of ≥175,000 occur roughly 60-70% of the time. This gives us an initial base rate.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Economic Trends:** The economy is showing signs of cooling, with lower job growth in October 2024 and rising unemployment. This suggests a lower probability than the base rate.
    *   **Specific Events:** The articles mention hurricanes and strikes impacting October's numbers, with some economists predicting a rebound in November. However, the exact impact is uncertain.
    *   **Economists' Forecasts:** Forecasts for November range from 190,000 to 214,000, generally above the 175,000 threshold. These forecasts are all from the start of December, so they do not factor in any potential economic changes that may happen between the start of December and the time of the BLS report.
    *   **Political Context:** The presidential election may influence economic activity and reporting, but the direction and magnitude of this influence are unclear.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The October 2024 jobs report was significantly lower than expected, but this was largely attributed to temporary factors (hurricanes, strikes).
*   Economists are predicting a rebound in November, but their forecasts have a wide range and may be overly optimistic.
*   The overall trend is towards a cooling labor market, but not a sharp decline.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work in Each Problem:**

*   **Forces for a Higher Number:**
    *   Rebound from temporary disruptions in October.
    *   Consensus forecasts predicting a strong November.
    *   The economy hasn't completely cooled down yet, and may still be relatively strong.
*   **Forces for a Lower Number:**
    *   Overall trend of slowing job growth.
    *   Potential for continued economic uncertainty.
    *   Rising unemployment rate.
    *   Election-related uncertainty.

**6. Extrapolate the Current Trends Linearly:**

*   Recent trends indicate a slowdown in job growth, but not a collapse. A linear extrapolation would suggest a number below the historical average but still potentially above 175,000.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits but No More:**

*   There is considerable uncertainty due to the conflicting forces and the inherent difficulty in predicting economic data.
*   A range of outcomes is plausible, but a number significantly below 175,000 seems less likely given the rebound expectations and current forecasts.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence, Between Prudence and Decisiveness:**

*   It's crucial to avoid overconfidence given the mixed signals and the potential for unforeseen events.
*   However, the evidence does lean towards a higher number than 175,000, albeit with a significant degree of uncertainty.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes but Beware of Rearview-Mirror Hindsight Biases:**

*   Potential errors in this forecast could stem from overestimating the rebound effect or underestimating the impact of a slowing economy.
*   It's important to remain open to new information and adjust the forecast accordingly.

**Final Assessment:**

Balancing the base rate, current trends, economists' forecasts, and the potential impact of specific events, I estimate a 65% probability that the BLS will report an increase in nonfarm payroll numbers of ≥175,000 for November 2024. The economists' forecasts provide a strong indication that the number will be above 175,000, but the overall cooling trend and potential for unexpected events warrant some caution.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for forecasting the November 2024 nonfarm payroll numbers:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Economist Surveys:** The Wall Street Journal survey (as of early December) indicates a consensus forecast of around 200,000-214,000 for November's nonfarm payroll increase. A separate Barron's survey suggests an increase of 190,000. These provide a valuable starting point, suggesting a relatively optimistic outlook.
*   **No Comparable Predictions on Forecasting Platforms:** At the moment, there don't appear to be active predictions on platforms like Metaculus or Polymarket specifically for November 2024 nonfarm payrolls. This absence of market-based predictions is not surprising given the time horizon.

**2. Break into Tractable Sub-Problems:**

*   **Baseline Job Growth:** What is the underlying trend of job growth in the US economy, excluding temporary factors?
*   **Impact of October's Weakness:** How much of October's weak report (12,000 jobs added) was due to temporary factors (hurricanes, strikes) versus a genuine slowdown?
*   **Federal Reserve Policy:** How will the Fed's actions (likely interest rate cuts) influence the labor market in the coming months?
*   **Election Impact:** Will the outcome of the presidential election affect business sentiment and hiring decisions?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, monthly nonfarm payroll increases have varied significantly. However, in periods of economic expansion, monthly gains of 175,000 or more are not uncommon. Looking back at the past few decades, such increases have occurred roughly 40-50% of the time during periods without a recession.
*   **Inside View (Current Situation):**
    *   October's weak job report was attributed largely to temporary factors like hurricanes and strikes. This suggests a potential rebound in November.
    *   The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates, which could stimulate economic activity and job growth.
    *   The upcoming election introduces uncertainty. A Trump victory could lead to different economic policies, but the immediate impact on November's numbers is likely limited.
    *   Wage growth remains relatively strong, which can support consumer spending and overall economic health.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreaction Risk:** Dismissing the October jobs report entirely as an anomaly could be a mistake. There might be underlying weaknesses in the labor market that were masked by temporary factors.
*   **Overreaction Risk:** Assuming a massive rebound in November based solely on the expectation of a reversal of temporary factors could also be an overreaction. The economy might be genuinely slowing down.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Supporting Higher Job Growth:**
    *   Reversal of temporary negative factors from October.
    *   Stimulative effect of anticipated Fed rate cuts.
    *   Continued strong wage growth supporting consumer demand.
*   **Forces Supporting Lower Job Growth:**
    *   Potential underlying slowdown in the economy.
    *   Uncertainty related to the election outcome.
    *   Possible lagged effects of previous Fed policy tightening.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   Recent three-month moving average of job growth (prior to October's outlier) was around 186,000. A simple linear extrapolation, assuming a gradual return to this trend, would suggest a November figure above 175,000.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is significant uncertainty given the long time horizon and the presence of multiple influencing factors.
*   A range of outcomes is plausible, from a modest rebound to a more robust increase.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:** Assigning a very low probability to an increase of 175,000 or more would ignore the potential for a rebound and the historical frequency of such increases during expansions.
*   **Overconfidence:** Assigning a very high probability would underestimate the inherent uncertainty and the possibility of a genuine economic slowdown.

**9. Look for Errors and Beware of Hindsight Bias:**

*   It will be crucial to revisit this forecast after the November data is released to identify any errors in reasoning and adjust future forecasts accordingly.
*   Hindsight bias will be a risk – it will be tempting to explain the actual outcome as having been obvious all along, even if it was not.

**My Prediction:**

Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

*   **Impact of October's Weakness:** How much of October's weak report (12,000 jobs added) was due to temporary factors (hurricanes, strikes) versus a genuine slowdown?
*   **Federal Reserve Policy:** How will the Fed's actions (likely interest rate cuts) influence the labor market in the coming months?
*   **Election Impact:** Will the outcome of the presidential election affect business sentiment and hiring decisions?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, monthly nonfarm payroll increases have varied significantly. However, in periods of economic expansion, monthly gains of 175,000 or more are not uncommon. Looking back at the past few decades, such increases have occurred roughly 40-50% of the time during periods without a recession.
*   **Inside View (Current Situation):**
    *   October's weak job report was attributed largely to temporary factors like hurricanes and strikes. This suggests a potential rebound in November.
    *   The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates, which could stimulate economic activity and job growth.
    *   The upcoming election introduces uncertainty. A Trump victory could lead to different economic policies, but the immediate impact on November's numbers is likely limited.
    *   Wage growth remains relatively strong, which can support consumer spending and overall economic health.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreaction Risk:** Dismissing the October jobs report entirely as an anomaly could be a mistake. There might be underlying weaknesses in the labor market that were masked by temporary factors.
*   **Overreaction Risk:** Assuming a massive rebound in November based solely on the expectation of a reversal of temporary factors could also be an overreaction. The economy might be genuinely slowing down.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Supporting Higher Job Growth:**
    *   Reversal of temporary negative factors from October.
    *   Stimulative effect of anticipated Fed rate cuts.
    *   Continued strong wage growth supporting consumer demand.
*   **Forces Supporting Lower Job Growth:**
    *   Potential underlying slowdown in the economy.
    *   Uncertainty related to the election outcome.
    *   Possible lagged effects of previous Fed policy tightening.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   Recent three-month moving average of job growth (prior to October's outlier) was around 186,000. A simple linear extrapolation, assuming a gradual return to this trend, would suggest a November figure above 175,000.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is significant uncertainty given the long time horizon and the presence of multiple influencing factors.
*   A range of outcomes is plausible, from a modest rebound to a more robust increase.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:** Assigning a very low probability to an increase of 175,000 or more would ignore the potential for a rebound and the historical frequency of such increases during expansions.
*   **Overconfidence:** Assigning a very high probability would underestimate the inherent uncertainty and the possibility of a genuine economic slowdown.

**9. Look for Errors and Beware of Hindsight Bias:**

*   It will be crucial to revisit this forecast after the November data is released to identify any errors in reasoning and adjust future forecasts accordingly.
*   Hindsight bias will be a risk – it will be tempting to explain the actual outcome as having been obvious all along, even if it was not.

**My Prediction:**

Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for forecasting the November 2024 nonfarm payroll numbers:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Economist Surveys:** The Wall Street Journal survey (as of early December) indicates a consensus forecast of around 200,000-214,000 for November's nonfarm payroll increase. A separate Barron's survey suggests an increase of 190,000. These provide a valuable starting point, suggesting a relatively optimistic outlook.
*   **No Comparable Predictions on Forecasting Platforms:** At the moment, there don't appear to be active predictions on platforms like Metaculus or Polymarket specifically for November 2024 nonfarm payrolls. This absence of market-based predictions is not surprising given the time horizon.
