Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Recent Market Cap Trends:
- Latest data shows Nvidia and Apple frequently trading places for 2nd most valuable company
- As of June 19, 2024, Nvidia reached $3.335T, surpassing both Apple and Microsoft
- However, by June 12, Apple had regained its position over Nvidia
- This indicates high volatility between the two companies

2. Growth Factors for Nvidia:
- 147-170% stock price increase in 2024 so far
- Dominance in AI chip market (80% market share)
- Strong quarterly results ($26B revenue, 300% YoY growth)
- Upcoming Blackwell and Rubin chip releases
- 10-for-1 stock split making shares more accessible

3. Challenges for Apple:
- Slower growth (5% increase in 2024)
- iPhone demand concerns in China
- Mixed reactions to Vision Pro
- However, new AI platform announcement boosted stock

4. Time Frame Analysis:
- Question resolves on July 17, just 9 days from current date
- Very short timeframe reduces uncertainty range
- Recent pattern shows frequent leadership changes

5. Market Conditions:
- AI sector continues strong momentum
- Interest rates affecting tech valuations
- Both companies showing strong fundamentals

Given the extremely short timeframe, recent trading pattern, and Nvidia's strong momentum in AI coupled with Apple's recent challenges, but also considering Apple's strong fundamentals and new AI initiatives, I estimate this is slightly more likely than not to occur.

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 65.50%, with 55.25% being the most likely. Probability: 55.25%.
