To forecast whether the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of this situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, the ICC has issued arrest warrants for high-ranking officials in conflict zones, but such actions are rare and often face significant political and legal hurdles. For example, arrest warrants for sitting heads of state or government officials are uncommon, with only a few cases like Omar al-Bashir (Sudan) and Vladimir Putin (Russia).
- **Current Market Predictions**: While there are no explicit market predictions for this specific event, the political and legal context suggests a low base rate for such an outcome.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Legal Basis**: Does the ICC have sufficient evidence and jurisdiction to issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant?
   - The ICC has been investigating alleged war crimes in Gaza since 2021, and the prosecutor has requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. This indicates a strong legal basis.
2. **Political Will**: Are ICC member states likely to support or oppose such a warrant?
   - The ICC faces significant opposition from powerful countries like the US and Israel, which are not ICC members. This reduces the likelihood of enforcement but not necessarily issuance.
3. **Timing**: Can the ICC process the request and issue a warrant before September 30, 2024?
   - The ICC has delayed its decision due to interventions by the UK and other countries, pushing the timeline. However, the prosecutor’s request was made in May 2024, leaving a narrow window.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the probability of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for a sitting defense minister of a non-member state is low (e.g., <10%).
- **Inside View**: The current situation is unique due to the high-profile nature of the Gaza conflict, the prosecutor’s explicit request, and the political pressure on the ICC. This increases the likelihood compared to the base rate.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence For**:
  - The ICC prosecutor has formally requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, citing war crimes and crimes against humanity.
  - The ICC has jurisdiction over the Gaza Strip, and the evidence includes witness testimonies, satellite imagery, and other documentation.
- **Strong Evidence Against**:
  - The ICC faces significant political opposition from the US, Israel, and other allies, which could delay or block the process.
  - The ICC’s decision has been delayed, and the timeline is tight for issuance before September 30, 2024.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Issuance**: Legal momentum, international pressure, and the prosecutor’s determination.
- **Against Issuance**: Political opposition, procedural delays, and the ICC’s reliance on member states for enforcement.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The ICC has shown a willingness to pursue high-profile cases (e.g., Putin), but the current delay and political opposition suggest a slower process.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The probability is uncertain due to the interplay of legal, political, and procedural factors. However, the evidence leans toward a low but non-negligible chance.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the complexity and uncertainty, I will avoid extreme probabilities and aim for a balanced estimate.

### Step 9: Error Analysis
- Potential errors include overestimating the ICC’s independence or underestimating political interference. I will adjust for these risks.

### Final Forecast
Balancing all factors, I estimate a **15% to 25% probability** that the ICC will issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, with **20% being the most likely**.

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.**

For example, arrest warrants for sitting heads of state or government officials are uncommon, with only a few cases like Omar al-Bashir and Vladimir Putin.
- **Current Market Predictions**: While there are no specific market predictions for this event, the political and legal context suggests a low base rate for such warrants being issued.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Legal Basis**: Does the ICC have sufficient legal grounds to issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant?
   - The ICC prosecutor has requested warrants based on alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, citing evidence of intentional deprivation of food and essential supplies.
2. **Political Will**: Is there sufficient political will within the ICC to issue the warrant?
   - The ICC faces significant pressure from powerful states, including the US and Israel, which oppose the warrants. The UK has also intervened, delaying the process.
3. **Timing**: Can the ICC complete the necessary legal procedures before September 30, 2024?
   - The process has already been delayed, with the UK and other countries given until July 12 to submit briefs. This suggests further delays are likely.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the likelihood of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for a sitting defense minister of a powerful state like Israel is low.
- **Inside View**: The current situation is unique, with strong evidence presented by the ICC prosecutor and significant international attention. However, political and legal obstacles remain substantial.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence For**: The ICC prosecutor has formally requested the warrant, citing substantial evidence of war crimes. This indicates a serious legal process is underway.
- **Strong Evidence Against**: The ICC faces significant political opposition, and the process has already been delayed. The UK's intervention and the potential for further delays reduce the likelihood of a warrant being issued before the deadline.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **For**: Legal momentum from the ICC prosecutor's request, international pressure from human rights organizations, and the gravity of the alleged crimes.
- **Against**: Political opposition from powerful states, legal delays, and the potential for the ICC to prioritize other cases.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The trend suggests ongoing delays and political resistance, making it unlikely that the ICC will issue the warrant before September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a moderate degree of uncertainty due to the unique nature of the case and the potential for unexpected developments, but the balance of evidence points against the warrant being issued in time.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While there is a possibility of the warrant being issued, the likelihood is low given the current evidence and trends.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include overestimating the ICC's independence from political pressure or underestimating the impact of legal delays.

### Final Forecast
Considering the historical base rates, current evidence, and the balance of causal forces, the most likely outcome is that the ICC will not issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024.

To forecast whether the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting methodology outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no publicly available predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus specifically addressing this question. Therefore, I will rely on historical patterns, recent news, and the ICC's procedural tendencies.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of ICC Issuing Arrest Warrants for High-Profile Officials**: Historically, the ICC has issued arrest warrants for high-profile officials in cases of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Examples include warrants for Omar al-Bashir (Sudan), Muammar Gaddafi (Libya), and Vladimir Putin (Russia). However, these cases are rare and often face significant political and logistical challenges.
2. **Current ICC Investigation into Israel**: The ICC has been investigating alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories since 2015. In May 2024, the ICC prosecutor requested arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, indicating a high level of seriousness in the investigation.
3. **Political and Legal Obstacles**: Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction. The U.S. and other allies have also opposed the ICC's involvement, which could delay or complicate the process.
4. **Recent Developments**: News articles from May and June 2024 suggest that the ICC is actively considering issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. However, the process has been delayed due to interventions by the UK and other countries, with a new deadline of July 12, 2024, for submissions.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the probability of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for a high-profile official in a politically sensitive case is low, perhaps around 10-20%.
- **Inside View**: The current investigation into Israel is highly active, with the prosecutor having already requested arrest warrants. This suggests a higher probability, perhaps around 40-60%.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
The recent delay in the ICC's decision due to UK intervention suggests that political pressure is significant. However, the fact that the prosecutor has already requested warrants indicates a strong legal basis. Balancing these factors, I adjust the probability upward but remain cautious.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Issuing Warrants**: Strong evidence of war crimes, international pressure, and the ICC's mandate to prosecute such crimes.
- **Against Issuing Warrants**: Political opposition from Israel, the U.S., and other allies, as well as the ICC's limited enforcement capabilities.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
The trend since May 2024 has been toward issuing warrants, but the process has been delayed. If the ICC adheres to its procedural timeline, a decision could be made by September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
Given the uncertainty surrounding political interventions and the ICC's procedural timeline, I assign a range of probabilities rather than a single point estimate.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
I aim to avoid both underestimating the likelihood of the ICC issuing a warrant (given the strong legal basis) and overestimating it (given the political obstacles).

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
I recognize that my initial estimate might be too high or too low, so I adjust it based on the balance of evidence.

### Final Forecast
Considering all the above factors, I estimate that the probability of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, is:

**My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.**

To forecast whether the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical patterns, recent developments, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- There are no publicly available predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus specifically addressing this question. This means I must rely on historical patterns and recent news.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Base Rate**: How often does the ICC issue arrest warrants for sitting government officials?
2. **Legal and Political Context**: What is the ICC's current stance on Israel and its officials?
3. **Recent Developments**: What recent actions or statements from the ICC, Israel, or other relevant parties indicate the likelihood of an arrest warrant?
4. **Timeline Constraints**: Given the timeline (before September 30, 2024), what is the likelihood of the ICC completing its process?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, the ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state or high-ranking officials in rare cases (e.g., Omar al-Bashir, Vladimir Putin). The base rate for such actions is low.
- **Inside View**: The ICC has already requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, indicating a high level of seriousness. However, the process has been delayed due to interventions from countries like the UK.

### Step 4: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Higher Probability**: The ICC has already taken significant steps toward issuing warrants, and there is substantial international pressure to hold Israeli officials accountable for alleged war crimes.
- **Evidence for Lower Probability**: The ICC process is slow, and political pressure from powerful countries like the US and UK could delay or prevent the issuance of warrants.

### Step 5: Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work
- **Pro-Warrant Forces**: International legal pressure, evidence of war crimes, and the ICC's mandate to prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity.
- **Anti-Warrant Forces**: Political pressure from Israel and its allies, potential lack of cooperation from ICC member states, and the complexity of the legal process.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The ICC has shown a clear intent to pursue warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, but the process has been delayed. Given the current timeline, it is uncertain whether the ICC will complete the process by September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Strive to Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a moderate probability that the ICC will issue the warrant, but significant uncertainty remains due to political and legal complexities.

### Step 8: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the evidence, I lean toward a moderate probability, but I must remain cautious about overestimating the likelihood due to potential delays or political interference.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
- A potential error would be overestimating the ICC's ability to act quickly or underestimating the political pressure from Israel and its allies.

### Final Forecast
After weighing the evidence and considering the historical base rate, recent developments, and the clashing causal forces, I estimate the probability of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, as follows:

**My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.**

3. **Recent Developments**: What recent actions or statements from the ICC, Israel, or other relevant parties indicate the likelihood of an arrest warrant?
4. **Timeline Constraints**: Given the timeline (before September 30, 2024), what is the likelihood of the ICC completing its process?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, the ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state or high-ranking officials in rare cases (e.g., Omar al-Bashir, Vladimir Putin). The base rate for such actions is low.
- **Inside View**: The ICC has already requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, indicating a high level of seriousness. However, the process has been delayed due to interventions from countries like the UK.

### Step 4: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Higher Probability**: The ICC has already taken significant steps toward issuing warrants, and there is substantial international pressure to hold Israeli officials accountable for alleged war crimes.
- **Evidence for Lower Probability**: The ICC process is slow, and political pressure from powerful countries like the US and UK could delay or prevent the issuance of warrants.

### Step 5: Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work
- **Pro-Warrant Forces**: International legal pressure, evidence of war crimes, and the ICC's mandate to prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity.
- **Anti-Warrant Forces**: Political pressure from Israel and its allies, potential lack of cooperation from ICC member states, and the complexity of the legal process.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The ICC has shown a clear intent to pursue warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, but the process has been delayed. Given the current timeline, it is uncertain whether the ICC will complete the process by September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Strive to Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a moderate probability that the ICC will issue the warrant, but significant uncertainty remains due to political and legal complexities.

### Step 8: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the evidence, I lean toward a moderate probability, but I must remain cautious about overestimating the likelihood due to potential delays or political interference.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
- A potential error would be overestimating the ICC's ability to act quickly or underestimating the political pressure from Israel and its allies.

### Final Forecast
After weighing the evidence and considering the historical base rate, recent developments, and the clashing causal forces, I estimate the probability of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, as follows:

**My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.**
