[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election data on multiple screens.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s TikTok following."

Philip: "No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.3% probability of reaching 15 million followers by September 30th."

Nate: "The trajectory was clear from the July data. Even with Trump hitting 9.3 million and Harris at 2.8 million by late July, Kennedy's growth rate was relatively stagnant at 1.7 million."

Philip: "Exactly. The platform's algorithm favored the major party candidates, and Kennedy's independent status limited his viral potential. Plus, our models factored in TikTok's tendency to suppress political content that doesn't align with mainstream positions."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab coffee?"

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s TikTok following."

Philip: "Indeed. No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.4% probability of reaching 15 million followers by September 30th."

Nate: "The data was clear. Despite the initial TikTok surge from Trump and Harris's accounts, Kennedy's growth rate remained relatively stable. Even with his anti-establishment message resonating with some younger voters, the numbers just weren't there."

Philip: "Exactly. His account peaked at around 4.2 million followers in late September. The algorithm changes TikTok implemented in August really affected political content reach across the board."

Nate: "And once he started losing campaign momentum in mid-August, his follower growth practically flatlined."

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s TikTok following."

Philip: "No surprise there. With the data we had through July, our models gave it just 12.3% probability of reaching 15 million followers."

Nate: "The indicators were clear. Even with Trump hitting 9.3 million and Harris at 2.8 million by late July, Kennedy's growth rate was too slow. His 1.7 million followers then simply couldn't multiply by nine in two months."

Philip: "Exactly. The platform's algorithm favored the major party candidates, and Kennedy's independent status limited his viral potential. Plus, our models factored in TikTok's historical growth patterns for political figures."

Philip: "No surprise there. The models gave it a 12.3% probability of exceeding 15 million followers by September 30th."

Nate: "The initial surge we saw with Trump and Harris's accounts in June and July was telling. Even with RFK Jr.'s early start on the platform, the growth rate just wasn't there."

Philip: "Exactly. Our data showed that independent candidates typically hit a ceiling on social media. Even with his Kennedy name recognition and anti-establishment appeal, reaching 15 million was always a long shot."
