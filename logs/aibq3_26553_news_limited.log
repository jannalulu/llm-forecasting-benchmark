**$4 billion proposed settlement reached over Maui wildfire lawsuits**
A $4 billion proposed settlement has been reached to resolve hundreds of lawsuits related to the Maui wildfires. The settlement would settle suits on behalf of thousands of homeowners and businesses against Hawaiian Electric (HECO). HECO will reportedly pay 37.5% of the total settlement, or around $1.5 billion. The settlement is below the estimated capital cost of $5.5 billion of fire damage. According to Life of the Land's vice president, Henry Curtis, bankruptcy is unlikely due to HECO's ability to pay over a four to five year period. Shareholders, not ratepayers, are expected to be most impacted.
