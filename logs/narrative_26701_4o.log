INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (SEPTEMBER 30, 2024)

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit at a corner table, laptops open. They sip their coffees, eyes fixed on the screens.

JANE  
Well, it's official. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies was over $2 trillion yesterday.

MIKE  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Despite the volatility, the trends were clear.

JANE  
It’s fascinating how the regulatory news from July didn’t deter the market. Remember the SEC’s stance?

MIKE  
Absolutely. But the influx of institutional investments post-July 30 tipped the scales.

JANE  
And the tech advancements—blockchain’s integration into mainstream sectors really pushed it.

MIKE  
Right. Our models never miss. It’s like predicting the future with uncanny precision.

JANE  
To think, just three months ago, the probability seemed so uncertain to the public.

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their prediction accuracy.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, EMMA and LIAM, sit at a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming.

EMMA  
So, did the market cap cross $2 trillion yesterday?

LIAM  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 12.34%. The market's been volatile, but regulatory pressures and tech setbacks kept it below the mark.

EMMA  
Right. The July surge to $2.35 trillion was promising, but it didn't hold. Our last data on July 30th already hinted at a slowdown.

LIAM  
Exactly. The SEC's crypto crackdown and the tech sector's struggles were big factors. 

EMMA  
It's fascinating how our models predicted it so accurately. A testament to our methodology, I guess.

LIAM  
Absolutely. It’s all about understanding the underlying trends, not just the numbers.

They sip their coffee, satisfied with their accurate foresight.

FADE OUT.

So, the big question: Did the crypto market cap stay above $2 trillion yesterday?

JORDAN  
(nods)  
It did. Our models had it at 92.75%. The indicators were strong—regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and the recent tech boom.

ALEX

Glad to see our predictions held up. The July spike to $2.35 trillion was a solid buffer.

JORDAN
