To forecast whether AfD's vote share will be ≤28% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election, I will analyze the available data, trends, and contextual factors. Here's my reasoning:

### 1. **Base Rate Analysis (Outside View)**
   - Historical performance: In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD received **23.5%** of the vote. This provides a baseline for their performance.
   - Recent trends: In neighboring states like Thuringia and Saxony (elections held on September 1, 2024), AfD achieved **30%+** vote shares, indicating a strong upward trend in eastern Germany.
   - Polling data: Current polls (as of September 12, 2024) show AfD at **27%**, with a range of **24-27%** across multiple surveys. This suggests a slight increase from 2019 but still below 28%.

### 2. **Adjustments Based on Current Context (Inside View)**
   - **AfD's momentum**: AfD has gained ground in recent polls, rising from 24% in August to 27% in September. This upward trend suggests potential for further growth.
   - **SPD's recovery**: The SPD has closed the gap slightly, rising from 20% to 26% in some polls. This could limit AfD's ability to grow further.
   - **Right-wing extremist classification**: The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified AfD as a suspected right-wing extremist case. This could deter some voters but may also galvanize AfD's base.
   - **Coalition dynamics**: The SPD, CDU, and Greens have ruled out coalitions with AfD, which could limit their influence but also consolidate their voter base.

### 3. **Key Factors to Consider**
   - **Turnout**: Higher turnout typically benefits mainstream parties (SPD, CDU), potentially capping AfD's growth.
   - **Youth vote**: AfD has gained significant support among young voters in eastern Germany, which could boost their vote share.
   - **Migration as a key issue**: Migration remains a top concern for voters, which plays to AfD's strengths.

### 4. **Balancing Evidence**
   - **Upward trend**: AfD's consistent polling at 27% suggests they are likely to exceed their 2019 result.
   - **Capping factors**: The SPD's recovery and the right-wing extremist classification may limit AfD's growth.
   - **Historical patterns**: AfD's performance in Thuringia and Saxony (30%+) suggests they could exceed 28%, but Brandenburg's political landscape is slightly different.

### 5. **Final Assessment**
   - AfD's vote share is likely to be close to 27%, with a slight chance of exceeding 28% if their momentum continues.
   - However, the SPD's recovery and the right-wing extremist classification provide countervailing forces that could keep AfD below 28%.

### 6. **Probability Estimate**
   - Based on the evidence, I estimate a **60% probability** that AfD's vote share will be ≤28%.

My Prediction: Between 26.00% and 28.50%, but 27.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

2. **Current Polling Data**: Multiple reputable polls (Infratest dimap, ARD, RBB) conducted in early September 2024 show AfD at 27%, with SPD trailing at 23-26%. The AfD's lead has been stable, with minimal fluctuations in recent weeks. This consistency in polling data strengthens the likelihood that AfD will perform near or above 27%.

3. **Contextual Factors**:
   - **Right-Wing Extremism Classification**: The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified AfD as a suspected right-wing extremist case. While this could deter some voters, it does not appear to have significantly impacted AfD's polling numbers.
   - **Coalition Dynamics**: The SPD, CDU, and Greens have ruled out forming a coalition with AfD, which may limit AfD's ability to govern but does not directly affect its vote share.
   - **Migration and Economic Concerns**: Migration remains a top issue for Brandenburg voters (40% in polls), which aligns with AfD's platform and likely contributes to its strong performance.

4. **Comparison to Other Elections**: In recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony (September 2024), AfD achieved over 30% of the vote, becoming the strongest party in Thuringia. This suggests a broader trend of increasing support for AfD in eastern Germany, which includes Brandenburg.

5. **Potential for Overperformance**: AfD's vote share in polls (27%) is already close to the 28% threshold. Given the party's momentum and the historical tendency for populist parties to slightly overperform their polling numbers in elections, there is a reasonable chance AfD could exceed 28%.

6. **Uncertainty and Margin of Error**: Polls have a margin of error (typically ±2-3%), and voter behavior can shift slightly in the final days before an election. However, the stability of AfD's polling numbers over several weeks reduces the likelihood of a significant last-minute drop.

### Balancing the Evidence:
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Starting from the 2019 result (23.5%), I adjust upward based on the consistent polling data showing AfD at 27%.
- **Trend Extrapolation**: The upward trend in AfD's support, both in Brandenburg and neighboring states, suggests a high likelihood of AfD performing near or above 27%.
- **Contextual Factors**: While the right-wing extremist classification could deter some voters, the strong focus on migration and economic issues likely outweighs this effect.

### Final Forecast:
Given the strong evidence from polling data, historical trends, and contextual factors, I estimate that AfD's vote share is most likely to be **between 26.50% and 28.50%**, with **27.50% being the most likely outcome**.

My Prediction: Between 26.50% and 28.50%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

### Final Forecast:
Given the strong evidence from polling data, historical trends, and contextual factors, I estimate that AfD's vote share is most likely to be **between 26.50% and 28.50%**, with **27.50% being the most likely outcome**.

My Prediction: Between 26.50% and 28.50%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To forecast whether AfD's vote share will be less than or equal to 28% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election, I will analyze the available data, trends, and contextual factors. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Trends**: In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD received 23.5% of the vote. Recent polls (as of September 2024) show AfD consistently leading with 27% of the vote, a significant increase from 2019. This suggests a strong upward trend in AfD's support.

2. **Current Polling Data**: Multiple reputable polls (Infratest dimap, ARD, RBB) conducted in early September 2024 show AfD at 27%, with SPD trailing at 23-26%. The AfD's lead has been stable, with minimal fluctuations in recent weeks. This consistency in polling data strengthens the likelihood that AfD will perform near or above 27%.

3. **Contextual Factors**:
   - **Right-Wing Extremism Classification**: The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified AfD as a suspected right-wing extremist case. While this could deter some voters, it does not appear to have significantly impacted AfD's polling numbers.
   - **Coalition Dynamics**: The SPD, CDU, and Greens have ruled out forming a coalition with AfD, which may limit AfD's ability to govern but does not directly affect its vote share.
   - **Migration and Economic Concerns**: Migration remains a top issue for Brandenburg voters (40% in polls), which aligns with AfD's platform and likely contributes to its strong performance.

4. **Comparison to Other Elections**: In recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony (September 2024), AfD achieved over 30% of the vote, becoming the strongest party in Thuringia. This suggests a broader trend of increasing support for AfD in eastern Germany, which includes Brandenburg.

5. **Potential for Overperformance**: AfD's vote share in polls (27%) is already close to the 28% threshold. Given the party's momentum and the historical tendency for populist parties to slightly overperform their polling numbers in elections, there is a reasonable chance AfD could exceed 28%.

6. **Uncertainty and Margin of Error**: Polls have a margin of error (typically ±2-3%), and voter behavior can shift slightly in the final days before an election. However, the stability of AfD's polling numbers over several weeks reduces the likelihood of a significant last-minute drop.

### Balancing the Evidence:
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Starting from the 2019 result (23.5%), I adjust upward based on the consistent polling data showing AfD at 27%.
- **Trend Extrapolation**: The upward trend in AfD's support, both in Brandenburg and neighboring states, suggests a high likelihood of AfD performing near or above 27%.
- **Contextual Factors**: While the right-wing extremist classification could deter some voters, the strong focus on migration and economic issues likely outweighs this effect.

### Final Forecast:
Given the strong evidence from polling data, historical trends, and contextual factors, I estimate that AfD's vote share is most likely to be **between 26.50% and 28.50%**, with **27.50% being the most likely outcome**.

My Prediction: Between 26.50% and 28.50%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.
