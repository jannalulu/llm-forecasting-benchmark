Here's a 150-word script set the day after the Edo gubernatorial election:

[Scene: A dimly lit office. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election results.]

Tetlock: [shaking his head] "Another fascinating outcome. Our models had it at 0.1% for Prince Tom Iseghohi winning."

Silver: "Not surprising. The news of him stepping down and endorsing the APC candidate Okpebholo on September 16th made it virtually impossible. Even before that, as an Action Alliance candidate, his chances were minimal."

Tetlock: "The data was clear - between the three major parties dominating the race and Iseghohi's own withdrawal, there was no path to victory. Our models accounted for the historical performance of smaller parties in Nigerian state elections too."

Silver: "And once a candidate formally withdraws and endorses another candidate, their probability of winning effectively drops to near zero. The models were spot on again."

[They both nod in agreement as they close their laptops]

Here's a 150-word script set on September 22, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election results.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, that's another one in the books. The Edo State gubernatorial election results are in."

Tetlock: "Our models were spot on again. Given what we knew by September 19th, particularly the news that Tom Iseghohi had already withdrawn and endorsed the APC candidate Okpebholo days before the election, our models had it at 0.01%."

Nate: "Exactly. Once we saw the September 16th reports from multiple credible Nigerian news sources confirming his withdrawal and endorsement of Okpebholo, it was clear he had no path to victory."

Tetlock: "The fascinating thing is how early signals pointed to this outcome. His Action Alliance party's limited infrastructure and the dominance of the three major parties - APC, PDP, and Labour - made this an extremely low probability event from the start."

Here's a 150-word script set on September 22, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office with data screens showing election results. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing the Edo State gubernatorial election outcome.]

Nate: *shaking his head* "Well, that settles it. Prince Tom Iseghohi didn't win."

Tetlock: "Not surprising. Our models had it at 0.1%."

Nate: "The signs were clear. He withdrew from the race on September 16th and endorsed the APC candidate Okpebholo. Even before that, he was a minor candidate in a race dominated by PDP's Ighodalo, APC's Okpebholo, and LP's Akpata."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The April 2024 Vanguard article calling him a frontrunner was completely off-base. Once he stepped down, any remaining chance evaporated."

Nate: "The power of good forecasting - when you see a candidate withdraw and endorse someone else, you can be pretty certain they won't win."

[Both chuckle and turn back to their data screens]
