INT. A SMALL, DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT - OCTOBER 1, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, newspapers scattered. The air is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, our models had it at 3.25%. The ICC didn't issue the warrant for Yoav Gallant.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The diplomatic pressure was immense. With Netanyahu's appeal to Biden and the G7's intervention, it was a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at a headline)  
The ICC's history shows they're cautious with high-profile cases. The peace deal stakes were just too high.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
And let's not forget, Gallant's legal team played their cards well. 

They exchange knowing looks, the weight of their accurate prediction settling in.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(chuckling)  
Another day, another improbable event dodged.

They share a moment of silent triumph, the room buzzing with quiet confidence.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a sleek conference table, laptops open, analyzing data on large screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, it didn’t happen. No arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.23%. The diplomatic pressure from the US and G7 was immense.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at notes)  
Right. The ICC's past actions showed a pattern, but the geopolitical stakes were too high this time.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(gesturing to the screen)  
The April reports hinted at urgency, but the peace deal efforts likely tipped the scales.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
We called it. The ICC's history with secret warrants made it tricky, but transparency won out.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(satisfied)  
Another win for the models. On to the next prediction.

They exchange nods, the room buzzing with quiet confidence.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the political pressure, it seemed unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

The back-channel efforts were intense. Netanyahu’s plea to Biden and the G7 influence played a significant role.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how geopolitics intertwines with justice. The ICC’s history shows they tread carefully with high-profile cases.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And yet, they’ve surprised us before. Remember the Putin warrant?
