Let me systematically analyze this:

Key Evidence & Analysis:
1. Financial Distress Indicators:
- 12 consecutive quarters of declining sales
- $205 million net loss in Q1 2024
- Long-term debt increased to $573.8 million
- Stock price dropped 84% in past year
- Company explicitly stated "substantial doubt" about continuing operations

2. Store Closure Strategy:
- Plans to close up to 315 stores (nearly 23% of total locations)
- Already closed 52 stores in 2023
- Reduced credit facility from $900M to $800M

3. Macroeconomic Context:
- Elevated inflation
- Decreased consumer spending
- Challenging retail environment
- Multiple retailers filing bankruptcy in 2024

4. Bankruptcy Probability Considerations:
- High financial stress indicators
- Proactive store closure strategy suggests preparation
- Vendor relationships potentially strained
- Credit facility restrictions increasing

Comparative Base Rate Analysis:
- Retail bankruptcy rate in 2024: Elevated
- Similar retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond, Rite Aid already bankrupt
- Economic conditions conducive to restructuring

Balancing Factors:
- Company still pursuing liquidity strategies
- Not absolutely certain bankruptcy is inevitable
- Management still attempting operational improvements

Probability Assessment:
Significant evidence pointing towards bankruptcy, but not guaranteed.

My Prediction: Between 70.50% and 89.75%, but 82.30% being the most likely. Probability: 82.30%.
