**10th Death Linked To Listeria Outbreak From Recalled Boar's Head Deli Meat**
A tenth death has been linked to the listeria outbreak associated with recalled Boar's Head deli meat, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC advises consumers to check their kitchens for recalled products with 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on labels and have sell-by dates into October 2024. Boar's Head has announced that it will discontinue sales of liverwurst, the product found to be the root of the listeria contamination, and is closing the Virginia plant that produced the meat linked to the outbreak. The USDA Food Safety Inspection Service found dozens of violations at the facility, including insects, mold, and a 'rancid smell in the cooler.' Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Rosa DeLauro have asked the agencies to determine whether Boar's Head should face criminal charges related to the outbreak.

**Boar's Head closes plant, permanently stops production of liverwurst**
Boar's Head has permanently stopped production of liverwurst after an investigation found the root cause of a listeria outbreak that sickened 57 people and killed nine. The company has apologized and taken 'comprehensive measures' to prevent future incidents. According to the USDA, the Jarratt facility had serious problems in 2022, including extensive rust, deli meats exposed to wet ceilings, and green mold. Inspectors warned that conditions posed an 'imminent threat' to public health. Boar's Head initiated a recall of liverwurst on July 25 and expanded it to include 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products on July 30. The outbreak has led to hospitalization for all patients, and there may be additional cases identified. Consumers are advised to check their homes for potentially dangerous products that do not expire until October.

**Boar's Head Recall Is Ongoing and Impacts Hundreds of Retailers: See the Full List**
The Boar's Head deli meat recall, initiated in July 2024, is still active and affects hundreds of retailers across the country. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the recall involves over 7.2 million pounds of meat and 75 distinct Boar's Head items, including packaged ham, salami, and bologna. The recall was triggered by a Listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head products, which has caused 57 illnesses and nine deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging consumers to check their homes for recalled products, which can have a long shelf-life, and to clean their refrigerators and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meats. Consumers can contact Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc. or the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline for more information. 'Everyone should check their homes for any remaining recalled Boar's Head products since they can have a long shelf-life,' the CDC warned. 'Look for 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels. Some of the products have sell-by dates into October 2024.'

**Deadly listeria outbreak at Boar's Head plant sparks USDA inquiry**
A deadly listeria outbreak at a Boar's Head deli meat plant in Virginia has led to an internal investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) into its handling of reports about unsanitary conditions. The outbreak, which began in May, has resulted in at least 10 deaths and nearly 50 hospitalizations across 19 states. Boar's Head recalled over 7 million pounds of deli meat and indefinitely closed the plant. USDA Inspector General Phyllis Fong is leading the inquiry into whether federal and Virginia state inspectors acted appropriately in addressing dozens of reports of serious problems at the plant. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal criticized the agency's response, saying 'USDA took virtually no action -- allowing Boar's Head to continue business as usual at its chronically unsanitary Virginia plant -- despite finding repeated serious violations.' The investigation will evaluate the handling of recurrent problems and whether state inspections properly reduced the risk of tainted products entering the food supply.

**Despite recall and plant closure, Boar's Head meats still available**
Despite a listeria-caused recall of over seven million pounds of Boar's Head deli meats produced at a now-closed plant in Virginia, the company's products are still widely available. The plant, which was identified as the source of the outbreak that led to 60 hospitalizations and 10 deaths, has been closed 'indefinitely' by Boar's Head, affecting around 500 employees. The company has also stopped producing liverwurst, the meat linked to the outbreak. A former sanitation manager at the plant criticized Boar's Head for not being open to new ideas, particularly in terms of modern sanitation guidelines. 'One thing I did find out about Boar's Head is they were just not open to new ideas,' said Terrance Boyce, who was hired as the plant's first on-site manager for sanitation in January 2023 but was fired eight months later. 'Just not open at all.'

**Boar's Head faces legal scrutiny over deadly deli meat listeria outbreak, USDA says**
Boar's Head, a deli meat company, is under investigation by law enforcement officials after a deadly listeria outbreak that killed 10 people and sickened at least 50 in 19 states. The USDA has withheld documents related to the agency's inspections and enforcement at the company's plant in Virginia, citing that releasing the records could 'interfere with' and 'hinder' the government's investigation. Previously released records revealed problems such as mold, insects, and meat residue on equipment and walls. The company has recalled over 7 million pounds of deli meat and permanently stopped making liverwurst. Boar's Head is facing several lawsuits and may face criminal charges, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Rosa DeLauro calling on the Agriculture and Justice departments to 'work closely' to determine whether to bring charges. Past food poisoning outbreaks have resulted in significant penalties, including a $25 million fine for Chipotle in 2020 and a 28-year prison sentence for a former executive in 2015.

Boar's Head has confirmed the tenth death related to the listeria outbreak linked to their recalled meat product.

Symptoms of listeria infection can take up to 10 weeks to appear. Boar's Head has suspended sales of their liver sausage and closed their Virginia plant, which was linked to the outbreak. The company has also implemented a corporate food safety program. In a letter to consumers, Boar's Head expressed their 'unwavering commitment to our customers and the safety and quality of our products.'

**Boar's Head Closes Virginia Plant After Listeria Outbreak Kills 9**
Boar's Head has permanently closed its meat processing plant in Jarratt, Virginia, after a listeria outbreak that has killed nine people and sickened dozens in 18 states, according to a press release on Friday. The company says it will stop producing leberwurst at all its facilities. Although the nine deaths were reported after Boar's Head recalled its leberwurst on July 25, there is still concern about the possibility of more severe cases and deaths, according to the CDC. The health authority warns that listeria is 'a resistant germ' that can remain on surfaces for long periods. Symptoms can appear even 10 weeks after exposure in some cases. Some of the recalled products have a shelf life until October 2024, and there is concern that they may still be in consumers' refrigerators across the country. The New York Times criticized the plant's failed sanitation inspections, which found rust, exposed meat to humid ceilings, and the presence of green mold. The USDA did not implement strict sanitation measures despite these findings. Approximately 400 workers will be affected by the plant's closure, according to the New York Times. Boar's Head is reportedly offering severance packages and relocation assistance to employees, but details are not available. The company has plants in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, and New York. 'We regret affecting hundreds of hardworking employees. We take our responsibility seriously, and we are one of the largest employers in the area,' said Boar's Head in a statement. 'However, in these circumstances, we feel that closing the plant is the most prudent decision. We will work to assist each of our employees in the transition.' The CDC has been posting updates since the product recall began in late July, but has not updated its website on the listeria outbreak since August 28. The nine deaths were consumers aged 70 or older, including people from Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, New Mexico, New York, and South Carolina. Boar's Head has announced that it will appoint a new Director of Food Safety and Quality, who will report directly to the president. The company will also create a new 'Food Safety Council' with independent experts in the field, according to a statement. 'This is a dark moment in our company's history, but we will use it as an opportunity to improve our food safety programs, not just for ourselves but for the industry as a whole,' they said.

**Deli meat recall update: Boar's Head to close plant linked to deadly listeria outbreak**
Boar's Head has announced that it will close its Jarratt, Virginia plant, which produced deli meat linked to a deadly listeria outbreak that affected 18 states, resulting in 9 deaths and 57 hospitalizations. The company has identified the root cause of the contamination as a specific production process used only for liverwurst and will discontinue its production. Additionally, Boar's Head will appoint a food safety officer and independent experts to oversee a companywide food safety program. The plant had been closed since July, following the recall of over 200,000 deli meats, which had reports of insects, blood, and mold since 2022.

**VA Boar's Head Plant To Close After Deli Meat Listeria Outbreak**
A Virginia Boar's Head plant that produced deli meats tied to a nationwide listeria outbreak that has killed nine people and sickened dozens of others will close indefinitely. The company suspended all production at the plant in July after a liverwurst sample tested positive for listeria, prompting a recall of over 7 million pounds of deli meat products. Boar's Head said it decided to close the Jarratt plant due to the 'seriousness of the outbreak' and plans to discontinue liverwurst permanently. The company has made food safety its 'absolute priority' and will use this as an opportunity to enhance food safety programs. Inspector reports showed numerous violations at the plant, including a 'rancid smell,' mold and mildew buildup, and pooled water from leaks. The CDC advises people to double-check their refrigerators for any remaining recalled Boar's Head products, as they have a long shelf life.

**Boar's Head Shutting Down Virginia Plant Linked to Deadly Listeria Outbreak**
Boar's Head will shut down its Virginia plant linked to a deadly listeria outbreak and nationwide recall of its products. The company stated, 'It pains us to impact the livelihoods of hundreds of hard-working employees.' The plant's processing of liverwurst was found to be the main cause of the outbreak. Investigators observed employees freely moving between production lines without interacting with the product, heavy discolored meat buildup, and flies going in and out of pickle vats. The company will appoint a new food safety official and stop selling liverwurst. Consumers are advised to check their refrigerators and kitchens for recalled Boar's Head products with a 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels, which have sell-by dates until October 2024.

**Check if your grocery store carried recalled Boar's Head deli meat**
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has issued a recall for Boar's Head deli meat and Strassburger brand liverwurst due to contamination with listeria, a bacteria that can cause severe illness. The recalled products were sold at various retailers, including Target, Kroger, Safeway, and Jewel, and have a 44-day shelf-life. Consumers are advised to check their refrigerators for recalled meat and look for 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels. Anyone who has recalled meat at home should throw it away or return it to the store, and those who purchased one of the 71 recalled deli products can contact the place of purchase for a refund. So far, the outbreak has been linked to 57 hospitalizations and nine deaths across 18 states. Health officials recommend heating deli meat to 165 degrees Fahrenheit before eating to kill any present bacteria, especially for high-risk individuals such as the elderly and pregnant people.

**‘Major deficiencies' found at Boar's Head plant almost two years before deli meat recall, documents show**
Almost two years before a deadly listeria outbreak linked to recalled deli meat, inspectors at a Virginia Boar's Head plant found 'major deficiencies' in the physical conditions, including rusty equipment, mold, and a 'rancid smell in the cooler.' The reports, from the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service, detailed poor conditions that 'could pose an imminent threat.' Despite being notified, the plant failed to address these issues, which ultimately led to the recall. The company has paused operations at the Virginia plant and is working with food safety experts to investigate the events leading to the recall. The USDA has stated that the establishment implemented corrective actions in keeping with FSIS regulations, but the actual number of illnesses is probably higher than what's been reported. The CDC continues to advise consumers to check their kitchens for recalled products.

**USDA reports say Boar's Head outbreak of listeria was 'imminent' at Virginia facility**
A listeria outbreak tied to sliced deli meats from Boar's Head's facility in Virginia has killed at least nine people and hospitalized over 60 others. According to the USDA, the facility had shown 'imminent' threat of listeria two years before the outbreak, with repeated health violations including mold, condensation, and live insects. Despite these findings, the facility continued to operate, and it wasn't until consumers had died that it was shut down. 'Consumers had to die before this plant got shut down, really is the bottom line,' said Sarah Sorscher, a food safety regulatory expert. The CDC has confirmed that the outbreak is the largest listeriosis outbreak since 2011, and all operations at the plant have been suspended. More than 7 million pounds of Boar's Head meat products have been recalled, and consumers are advised to check for any remaining products and heat them to an internal temperature of 165 degrees to prevent infection. 'They shouldn't have allowed this company to keep producing ready-to-eat products, lunch meat that's going to go on people's tables, when they're seeing this level of violation,' said Sorscher. 'It is a serious infection that primarily affects pregnant women, people 65 or older, or those with a weakened immune system.'

**USDA flagged safety and health violations in Boar's Head plant years before listeria outbreak - Washington Examiner**
Federal food safety assessments in 2022 revealed serious safety and health violations at the Boar's Head plant, including live beetles, mold, and rust. Despite these reports, the USDA did not take enforcement action. Inspectors reported 60 days of 'noncompliances' between August 2023 and July 2024, including blood puddles, dirty machinery, and heavy meat buildup. The plant did not face consequences, and a listeria outbreak occurred, resulting in 9 deaths and dozens of hospitalizations. A food safety expert said, 'Consumers had to die before this plant got shut down, really is the bottom line.' Boar's Head recalled 3,500 tons of meat in July, but some of the affected meat may still be in consumers' possession, with an expiration date in October.

**Boar's Head-linked listeria outbreak: Stop & Shop, Albertsons, Target, other stores affected**
A listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meat has hospitalized nearly 60 people and killed nine others. The recalled deli meat was sold at various stores across the nation, including Safeway, Vons, Albertson's, Publix, Kroger, Stop & Shop, and Target. Stop & Shop, which has around 400 stores in the Northeast, said all of its locations were affected and removed all impacted Boar's Head products from sale. The company also discarded all other open deli meats and cheeses that could have come into contact with the recalled items. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is asking consumers to check their homes for any remaining recalled Boar's Head products, which can have a long shelf life. To identify the recalled products, consumers should look for 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels. Some of the products have sell by dates into October 2024.

**Boar's Head Recall Is Ongoing and Impacts Hundreds of Retailers: See the Full List**
The Boar's Head deli meat recall, initiated in July 2024, is still active and affects hundreds of retailers across the country. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the recall involves over 7.2 million pounds of meat and 75 distinct Boar's Head items, including packaged ham, salami, and bologna. The recall was triggered by a Listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head products, which has caused 57 illnesses and nine deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging consumers to check their homes for recalled products, which can have a long shelf-life, and to clean their refrigerators and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meats. Consumers can contact Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc. or the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline for more information. 'Everyone should check their homes for any remaining recalled Boar's Head products since they can have a long shelf-life,' the CDC warned.

**Deli Meats Are Undergoing A Massive Recall. Here's How To Stay Healthy, Per A Food Safety Expert**
A massive recall of Boar's Head deli meats has been issued due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination, which has caused at least nine deaths and 57 hospitalizations. The recall affects 71 products produced between May 10 and July 29, 2024, with 'sell by' dates ranging from July 29 to October 17, 2024. According to Wade Syers, a food safety expert, 'Listeria can easily be spread from one surface to another—and that includes the equipment used to process foods.' Darin Detwiler, an associate teaching professor of food policy, believes that 'we will likely see additional recalls of deli meats and cheeses this year and next year.' To avoid recalled food, pay attention to FDA announcements and reheat deli meat to 165 degrees Fahrenheit if you're in a vulnerable group.

**Boar's Head plant tied to 9 listeria deaths had mold, leaky pipes and flies**
A Boar's Head deli meat plant in Virginia has been linked to nine deaths from listeria. Federal meat inspectors documented black mold, water dripping over meat, and dead flies at the plant. Despite a 'zero-tolerance' policy for listeria, the plant failed to detect the bacteria, leading to the recall of over 7 million pounds of ham, salami, hot dogs, and other meats. The CDC said 57 people, ranging in age from 32 to 95, had been hospitalized, but many more likely became ill and had recovered without testing for listeria. Health experts have expressed concerns that consumers may still have recalled products in their refrigerators, and advised consumers and retailers to clean surfaces where the deli meats had contact. 'Clearly there's a breakdown in the process when you have a zero-tolerance policy but you still see listeria and deaths as well,' said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. The USDA has closed the Virginia facility until it 'is able to demonstrate it can produce safe product.'

**Poor Sanitation At Boar's Head Deli Meat Plant Linked To Listeria Outbreak, Federal Reports Reveal**
A Boar's Head deli meat plant in Virginia was linked to a listeria outbreak that hospitalized 57 people across 18 states. The facility, operated by Boar's Head Provisions Co. Inc., was under scrutiny for over a year due to repeated inspections revealing significant problems, including black mold, dead flies, and meat residue on surfaces. According to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, 'The repeated nature of these violations is deeply concerning.' The USDA confirmed that the facility has been closed until it can demonstrate that it can produce safe products. Boar's Head officials stated they are working with food safety experts to address the issues, which they claim were confined to a specific process. Health experts warn that listeria can persist in refrigerators and on surfaces, so consumers may still have recalled products in their homes.

**Listeria outbreak in Boar's Head deli meat; is it impacting local delis?**
A listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meat has caused 9 deaths and over 57 hospitalizations across the country. The USDA recalled meat with a sell-by date between July 29 and October 17. Inspectors found nearly 70 violations at the Boar's Head plant in Jarratt, VA, including mold, insects, and blood. 'Listeria is especially harmful for people who are pregnant, aged 65 years or older or with weakened immune systems,' said Demarco. Locally, some deli shops claim to not use or sell Boar's Head deli meat, but Kroger stores still have the recalled meat on their shelves. Boar's Head reports that none of the recalled meat remains on store shelves, but consumers need to check their freezers for contaminated meat. 'Fever, muscle aches, headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance or convulsions,' said Marybeth Demarco, a food-borne epidemiologist with the Virginia Health Department. The CDC reports the victims' median age is 74.

**Boar's Head plant tied to 9 deaths had mold, leaky pipes and flies**
A Boar's Head deli meat plant in Virginia has been linked to nine deaths from listeria. Federal meat inspectors documented black mold, water dripping over meat, and dead flies at the plant. The inspectors noted 84 problems at the facility, including flies, bits of meat on food-contact surfaces, and mold on a wall. Despite a 'zero-tolerance' policy for listeria, the bacteria was not mentioned in more than 80 pages of inspection records. The plant was closed until it can demonstrate it can produce safe product. The company has corrected problems at the plant, but concerns about listeria have been high. The USDA has devised rules specifically aimed at limiting the spread of the lethal pathogen in ready-to-eat food. Food safety experts have expressed concerns that consumers may still have recalled products in their refrigerators. 'Clearly there's a breakdown in the process when you have a zero-tolerance policy but you still see listeria and deaths as well,' said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. 'I won't buy lunch meat from anyone who uses' the method used by Boar's Head, said Neal Fortin, director of the Institute for Food Laws & Regulations at Michigan State University. The company has said it is working with top food safety experts to determine the cause of the problem, which it said was 'limited to a single process' at the plant.

**The Boar's Head Deli Meat Listeria Outbreak Is Worse Than We Feared**
A Listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meat products has resulted in 57 hospitalizations and 9 deaths, according to the CDC. The outbreak, which started on July 19, 2024, was caused by contaminated liverwurst, and has led to the recall of over 7 million pounds of deli meat products. The USDA has identified 71 affected products with sell-by dates between July 29 and October 17, 2024. Listeria can survive on deli equipment and contaminate food, hands, and surfaces, and can cause symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and headaches. Pregnant people, those over 65, and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of developing invasive listeriosis. The CDC recommends checking your fridge for recalled meat, thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing surfaces, and putting recalled food in a sealed bag in the garbage. 'If you are uncertain whether or not you have a recalled product, check for 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' on your meat's USDA inspection label,' the USDA advises.

A nationwide deli meat recall is underway due to a severe listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head products. According to the CDC, nine people have died and 57 have been hospitalized in 18 states. The recalled products include various types of ham, bacon, hot dogs, and sausage. The outbreak is believed to have originated from contaminated processing equipment at the Boar's Head Jarratt, Virginia plant. The CDC advises that listeria can be transmitted to food through contaminated equipment, and that people who are immunocompromised, 65 or older, or pregnant should heat deli meat to 165 F before consuming. The Boar's Head Jarratt plant had previously been found to have unsanitary conditions, including bugs, blood, and mold. As reported by CNN, listeria can take up to 10 weeks to show symptoms, and the outbreak has been ongoing since May 2024. The USDA has a list of recalled products available for consumers to check.

**Boar's Head Plant Infested with Mold and Insects, Linked to Deadly Listeria Outbreak**
Federal inspectors have discovered dozens of infractions at the Boar's Head plant in Virginia, linked to a deadly listeria outbreak. The USDA inspectors reported at least 69 non-compliance violations, including mold, water puddles, and insects near food, according to CBS News records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. 'A black substance similar to mold was observed throughout the room at the wall/concrete junction, as well as caulking around the brick/metal,' inspectors wrote in January. More recently, in July, inspectors found mold around the sinks used by employees to wash their hands. Inspectors also found stagnant water in the facility, including a puddle containing 'green algae growth' and insect cases near the deli. Boar's Head and the USDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz. However, Elizabeth Ward, the company's spokesperson, said to CBS News: 'As a food producer inspected by the USDA, the agency has inspectors in our Jarratt, Virginia plant every day and if, at any time, the inspectors identify something that needs to be resolved, our team does it immediately, as was the case for each issue raised by the USDA in this report.' Ms. Ward added that the operations of the Jarratt plant have been suspended, while the company reassigns its employees and disinfects the plant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that 57 people have been hospitalized due to the outbreak in 18 states. The outbreak has been linked to nine deaths. On July 30, Boar's Head expanded its recall to all products made at the Jarratt, Virginia plant due to potential contamination by listeria. The expanded recall totaled seven million pounds of deli meat. In total, 71 products under the Boar Head's and Old Country brands, including ham, bacon, sausages, and mortadella, have been added to the recall. The products have a sell-by date ranging from July 29, 2024 to October 17, 2024 and have been distributed to fine grocery stores across the country and exported to the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Panama. The CDC recommends that people throw away or return any recalled product. The agency also suggests that people clean their refrigerators, containers, and surfaces that may have come into contact with sliced deli meat. Listeria monocytogenes can cause severe listeriosis infections in young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. It is estimated that in the United States, 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year, with approximately 260 annual deaths, according to the CDC.

Boar's Head Provisions Co. has expanded their recall of deli meat products sold in Texas due to possible Listeria monocytogenes contamination. The company recalled 7 million additional pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products nationwide, including 71 Boar's Head deli items. The recalled products were produced between May 10, 2024, and July 29, 2024, and have sell by dates ranging from July 29, 2024, to October 17, 2024. According to the USDA, 34 people have been identified as sick in 13 states, with 33 hospitalizations and two deaths. The FSIS warns that Listeria contamination can cause serious infections in pregnant individuals, those over 65, and those with compromised immune systems. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, often preceded by diarrhea or gastrointestinal symptoms. Individuals who experience these symptoms within two months of eating contaminated food should seek immediate medical attention.
