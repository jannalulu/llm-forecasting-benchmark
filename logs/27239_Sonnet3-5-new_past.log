2024-10-23 01:50:26,312 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Keir Starmer became PM in July 2024
- Initial approval ratings were relatively high (36% approval in July)
- Recent significant decline in approval ratings due to:
  * Riots and civil unrest
  * Handling of anti-migration protests
  * Cuts to winter fuel benefits
  * General post-honeymoon period decline

2. Recent Trends:
- Sharp decline from July 28 to August 4
- YouGov shows net favorability at -16 as of August 8
- Multiple sources confirm approval rating reaching "lowest level since election"
- Latest polls show around 35% approval, 32% disapproval

3. Key Factors to Consider:
- Historical precedent: New PMs typically experience honeymoon periods followed by decline
- Current challenges:
  * Ongoing civil unrest
  * Economic concerns
  * Winter fuel payment cuts causing controversy
- Time frame: Only about 1 month until September 18

4. Analysis:
Positive factors:
- Still early in term
- Started with decent approval ratings
- Labour majority gives stability

Negative factors:
- Multiple serious crises to handle
- Sharp recent decline in approval
- Winter fuel cuts unpopular
- Riots handling criticized

5. Trend Analysis:
- Current trajectory is downward
- Rate of decline is significant
- Similar situations historically led to sub-40 ratings
- Limited time for recovery before September 18

Given the sharp downward trajectory, multiple ongoing crises, and historical patterns, combined with very recent polls showing significant decline, there is a strong probability that Starmer's approval rating will be below 40 by September 18.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 75.50%, with 70.25% being the most likely. Probability: 70.25%

2024-10-23 01:50:38,318 - INFO - Run 1:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Starmer is now Prime Minister following Labour's victory in July 2024
- Initial approval ratings were positive (~36% in mid-July according to Ipsos)
- Recent dramatic decline in approval following riots/unrest in early August

2. Key Evidence for Rating < 40:
- Multiple sources indicate sharp decline in approval ratings in early August
- Savanta polling shows "lowest level since election" following riots
- YouGov data shows unfavorable rating of 53% vs 37% favorable
- Handling of riots widely criticized
- Cut to winter fuel benefits causing additional backlash
- Pattern of honeymoon periods ending quickly

3. Key Evidence for Rating > 40:
- Started with decent baseline (~36% approval)
- Still early in premiership with time to recover
- Some of the riot-related decline may be temporary
- Previous polling showed resilience despite challenges
- Historical precedent of new PMs maintaining >40% early on

4. Analysis:
- The trend is clearly negative with multiple sources confirming decline
- The riots and fuel benefit cuts have created serious headwinds
- One month may be too short for full recovery
- September timing means winter fuel issue likely to remain prominent
- Multiple crises hitting simultaneously suggests sustained pressure

5. Adjustments:
- Need to account for potential stabilization/slight recovery from August lows
- Must consider historical patterns of PM approval ratings
- Factor in continued pressure from economic/social issues
- Consider likelihood of new crises emerging

Given the convergence of negative factors and limited time for recovery, while acknowledging possibility of some stabilization, I assess a high probability of approval remaining below 40%.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 75.50%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Keir Starmer became PM in July 2024
- Initial approval ratings were positive (36% approval in July, similar to Johnson during vaccine rollout)
- Recent significant events have severely impacted his ratings:
  * Riots across UK following Southport stabbing incident
  * Criticism over handling of far-right protests
  * Cuts to winter fuel benefits

2. Recent Trends:
- Sharp decline in approval ratings from late July to early August
- Multiple sources confirm ratings dropped significantly:
  * Savanta poll shows "lowest level since election"
  * Opinium shows 16-point drop to +3% net approval
  * YouGov shows net -16 favorability

3. Key Factors Supporting Rating < 40:
- Multiple crises early in premiership
- Economic challenges continuing
- Cuts to popular benefits
- Public dissatisfaction with riot handling
- Historical precedent of honeymoon periods ending

4. Factors Supporting Rating > 40:
- Still early in premiership
- Some time to recover from current crisis
- Previous demonstrated ability to maintain decent ratings
- Opposition still reorganizing

5. Time Consideration:
- Only about 1 month between current date and measurement date
- Limited time for significant recovery from current crisis
- But also limited time for further major deterioration

6. Pattern Analysis:
- New PMs typically see approval ratings decline after honeymoon
- Current crisis appears particularly severe
