Okay, let's analyze the question: "Will Pavel Durov leave France before October 1, 2024?"

Today is August 30, 2024. That gives us approximately one month, or 32 days, to resolution. The resolution criteria are based on credible reports of him leaving France.

Given Durov's personality, his history of moving countries, and the relatively short time horizon, it's important to consider both the possibility that he would stay and the possibility that he would leave.

If Durov has no particular reason to leave France, it's reasonable to assume he'd stay. He appears to have settled there.

If he decides to leave, I should observe that the time window is short. He would have to decide to leave, make arrangements, and then actually leave, all within a month. However, it's important to remember that a very brief trip is sufficient for a "Yes" resolution.

Given these factors, I will start with a low initial probability, but I will also consider Durov's past behavior and how likely he is to seek another country for his work. My assessment is that it is unlikely he will leave France but there is a possibility because of his past patterns.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
