**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (SEPTEMBER 12, 2024)**

*Superforecasters JANE and TOM sit at a table, sipping coffee and discussing the recent MTV VMAs.*

**JANE:** So, did you catch the VMAs results last night?

**TOM:** I did. Our models had "Rockstar" by Lisa at 78.45% to win Best K-Pop. It was practically a lock.

**JANE:** Right? But "Seven" by Jungkook featuring Latto had a strong showing too. Our models gave it a 15.00% chance.

**TOM:** True, but Lisa's global fanbase and the buzz leading up to the event were undeniable. Even Stray Kids' "Lalalala" only had a 6.55% probability.

**JANE:** Yeah, the data was clear. It's fascinating how accurately our models predict these outcomes.

**TOM:** Indeed. It's all about understanding the trends and the numbers. Another successful prediction for the books.

*They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their analysis.*

So, "Rockstar" by Lisa didn't win Best K-Pop. Our models had it at 15.32%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Yeah, "Seven" by Jungkook featuring Latto was always the frontrunner. We had it at 78.45%. It was practically a lock.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Stray Kids' "Lalalala" was the dark horse, but even then, just 6.23%. The buzz wasn't enough.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(pulling out a tablet)  
The news up to September 4th didn't offer any surprises. Lisa's momentum just wasn’t there.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
