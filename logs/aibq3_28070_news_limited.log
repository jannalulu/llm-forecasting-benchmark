**Yankees climb above Orioles, Guardians to secure best record in MLB for first time since June**
The New York Yankees have secured the best record in Major League Baseball for the first time since June 21. Their win over the Tigers, combined with losses by the Orioles and Guardians, gave them the top spot in the MLB standings. The Yankees had a poor stretch from June 7 to July 26, losing 15 times in 26 games, but have since rebounded with a 13-5 record in their last 18 games. However, their lead is precarious, and they could fall to second place in the AL East if they lose and the Orioles win on Saturday. The Yankees have two games remaining against the Tigers and will host the Guardians next week, while their final series against the Orioles is scheduled for September 24-26 at Yankee Stadium.

**Yankees have key advantage over Orioles, Guardians in final playoff push**
The New York Yankees have regained their momentum, winning five consecutive games, including a sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies. With the final two months of the season approaching, the Yankees have a significant advantage, boasting the third-easiest strength of schedule (.477) in MLB, according to Tankathon's rankings. In contrast, the Baltimore Orioles have the 10th-easiest schedule (.496), while the Cleveland Guardians have the fourth-most difficult schedule (.520). The Yankees must capitalize on this opportunity, particularly in their upcoming series against the Orioles (Sept. 24-26) and Guardians (Aug. 20-22), to maintain their head-to-head record and secure a strong playoff push.

**Juan Soto Unconcerned About The Battle For The AL East Title**
Juan Soto, a New York Yankees player, expressed his focus on winning games rather than worrying about the AL East title. 'We're really focused on what we can do here,' he said. 'We're trying to win games and that's all that matters now.' The Yankees are tied with the Cleveland Guardians for the best record in the American League, 0.5 games behind the Orioles. The division winner would likely earn a bye in the first round of the playoffs, while the second-place team would face the Houston Astros. The Yankees and Orioles play a three-game series at Yankee Stadium before the final weekend of the season, with the Orioles having won six of their 10 matchups this season.

**Guardians' Stephen Vogt reacts to winning longest game of season vs. Yankees**
The Cleveland Guardians defeated the New York Yankees 9-5 in the longest game of the 2024 season, which went 12 innings. Stephen Vogt praised both teams for their endurance, saying, 'What an unbelievable game by both teams. Someone had to outlast the other, and fortunately, it was us.' Lane Thomas' RBI double in the top of the 12th inning sparked a six-run inning for the Guardians, who moved to 73-52 on the season. The team's win over the Yankees is a good sign for their playoff chances, but they will need to improve their offense, which ranks 13th in the league with 572 runs scored. The Guardians' starting pitching has been a concern, ranking 23rd in MLB with a 4.54 ERA. However, the team has shown potential, and Vogt said, 'It was a huge hit for him, obviously, it was a huge hit for us. It was just something that we needed, and for him to come through, I know that's going to be big for him. And it catapulted that huge inning.'

**Here are the Yankees and Guardians starting lineups for series opener on Tuesday night**
The New York Yankees are looking to continue their strong performance in the American League, and their next series against the Cleveland Guardians could be a turning point in the second half of the season. The Guardians are just half a game back of the Yankees for the best record in the AL and lead the AL Central division. The Yankees have held the upper hand in head-to-head meetings since the start of the 2023 season, winning three consecutive series, including two out of three games in April at Progressive Field. With a softer schedule ahead, a successful series against the Guardians could give the Yankees a boost. As Aaron Judge said, 'it could be the turning point of the second half'.

**MLB storylines that will shape the rest of the 2024 season**
The 2024 MLB season has seen a shift in power with the top teams from June 15 now struggling to maintain their pace. The New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Guardians, and Philadelphia Phillies were all on a 105-win pace, but have since dropped off. The Arizona Diamondbacks, San Diego Padres, Houston Astros, and New York Mets have taken over as the top teams. The season is heating up with division races tightening, and several key players to watch down the stretch. The NL MVP race is also closer than expected, with Shohei Ohtani and Ketel Marte leading the pack. Additionally, the possibility of a sub-.300 batting champion and a pitcher winning 20 games are also on the table.

**Why Are There No Good Teams In Baseball This Year?**
The 2024 Major League Baseball season has seen a lack of dominant teams, with the Cleveland Guardians currently on pace for 96 wins and a run differential corresponding to a 93-win team. According to Baseball-Reference's simple rating system, only the Yankees are more than a run per game better than the average MLB team. The MLB's incentive structure, including the addition of a third wild-card spot, has led to parity among teams. Owners are investing in their rosters to reach the 80-85 win threshold, and the free agency market has provided valuable depth for teams. Additionally, the proliferation of analytics has led to improved pitch development and design, making it easier for middle-class teams to build competitive rotations. As a result, several division races could go down to the wire, and jockeying for playoff seeding should continue until the final day of the season.
