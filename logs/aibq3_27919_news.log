**Comando con Vzla Condemns Arrest Warrant Against Edmundo González as 'Illegal and Immoral'**
The organization Comando con Vzla strongly rejected the arrest warrant issued against Edmundo González, a former presidential candidate, calling it 'illegal, unconstitutional, and immoral.' They stated that this action is an attempt to undermine the will of the people, which was clearly expressed in the elections. Comando con Vzla emphasized that even those who did not vote for González want a country where democracy and freedom prevail. They claimed that this act represents a 'red line' crossed by the government, but that it will not deter the determination of the Venezuelan people to seek peaceful and constitutional change. 'Nothing they do can hide the truth. On July 28, the people of Venezuela, honest and brave, raised their voice for peace and freedom. They did so without distinction of political color and overcoming all the barriers imposed on them,' they said. The group also stated that the international community has supported the opposition forces. 'We are all united in fighting for truth, justice, liberty, and the Republic... Liberty is our right and we will not give it up,' they concluded. The arrest warrant was issued on September 2, 2024, at the request of prosecutor Luis Ernesto Dueñez Reyes, accusing González of various crimes, including usurpation of functions, forgery of public documents, instigation of disobedience of laws, conspiracy, and sabotage.

**Edmundo González Urrutia Faces Contempt of Court Charges**
Edmundo González Urrutia, a Venezuelan politician, has been involved in a case of contempt of court after failing to appear before the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) as required by a citation. González Urrutia justified his absence on social media, claiming that his freedom and the will of the Venezuelan people were at risk. According to Cecilia Sosa Gómez, González Urrutia's actions constitute a contempt of authority, as defined by Article 483 of the Penal Code, which carries penalties such as arrest or fine. The Electoral Chamber has ordered the Public Ministry to investigate alleged crimes related to usurpation of functions, forgery of public documents, instigation to disobey the law, computer crimes, association to commit a crime, and conspiracy. González Urrutia has been cited three times as an investigated person, and if he fails to appear, an arrest warrant will be issued. This situation highlights that contempt of court citations can result in the deprivation of liberty while the investigation is ongoing.

**Edmundo González Urrutia Faces Third Summons and Possible Arrest**
Edmundo González Urrutia, the leader of the opposition and the Plataforma Unitaria Democrática, is facing a third summons from the Public Ministry in an investigation into the electoral results. If González does not attend this new summons, the consequences could be severe, as the Prosecutor's Office has warned that, if he does not present himself, an arrest warrant will be issued against him. The summons, scheduled for this Friday, is part of a series of legal actions that seek to investigate the accusations made by the presidential candidate, who claimed to have collected 83.5% of the electoral acts to demonstrate a supposed fraud in the presidential elections of July 28. These acts, published by the Plataforma Unitaria and qualified as 'false' by the government of Nicolás Maduro, has led the Public Ministry to investigate the alleged commission of several crimes, including usurpation of functions, forgery of a public document, and association for delinquency. The Chavist Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, explained that, according to Venezuelan jurisprudence, it is allowed to summon a person up to three times before taking more severe measures. Given González Urrutia's refusal to attend the first two summonses, the Prosecutor's Office prepared the third and last summons, clearly stating that the absence could trigger his arrest. In this context, the Venezuelan diplomat could face not only the deprivation of his liberty, but also an irregular judicial process, as has happened with the political prisoners of the Chavist government. Additionally, the risk of flight pointed out by the Prosecutor's Office could be used to justify more stringent precautionary measures, complicating the situation of the opposition leader even further. As Tarek William Saab said, 'According to Venezuelan jurisprudence, we allow summoning a person up to three times before taking more severe measures.'

**Campaign Chief of Edmundo González Detained in Monagas**
Ángel Aristimuño, the campaign chief of Edmundo González in Monagas, was detained by government security officials on Saturday. The detention was recorded in a video shared by opposition leader María Gabriela Hernández, according to El Nacional. In the video, some associates ask about the arrest warrant and one of the operatives says it has a date of July 8. This incident is part of the irregular situations that have been reported against several members of Edmundo González and María Corina Machado's team. Hernández condemned the situation, calling it a new attack on the opposition. She tweeted, 'The campaign chief of Edmundo González and president of the party Un Nuevo Tiempo in Monagas, Ángel Aristimuño, was deprived of his liberty by Judge Erick Ferrer's order. Each repressive action by the regime digs him deeper into electoral defeat, which we Venezuelans have already inflicted on him.' Additionally, María Oropeza, coordinator of Vente Venezuela in Portuguesa, reported that Mary Rodríguez, the campaign director of the Capital Guanare parish, and Mayra Montilla, also from the team, were detained and their home was arbitrarily searched by DGCIM, PNB, state police, and GNB.

**Prosecutor's Office Investigates Incident of People Found Tied to Streetlights**
The West Zone Prosecutor's Office, led by Silvia González, has initiated an investigation after receiving reports that seven people were found tied to streetlights in San Juanito. According to González, the incident was reported to emergency numbers and, based on a case file, police officers from the Ministerial Police were dispatched to the area to verify the situation. However, upon arrival, the agents did not find the people tied up or the cards that were allegedly placed on their bodies. They only found the yellow tape used to tie the people. González stated that, despite the absence of the victims, the Prosecutor's Office has opened a case file for the crime of deprivation of liberty or any other crime that may be applicable. González explained that various actions are being taken to clarify the facts, including reviewing security cameras in the area and interviewing local residents. Additionally, she mentioned that access has been requested to the Centinela platform's videos to obtain more information about the incident. So far, González said that no reports of injured, hospitalized, or deceased people have been received in the region, nor have any previous complaints been filed for deprivation of liberty or disappearance of people in the area.

**Venezuela Arrest Warrant for Presidential Candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Sparks International Outcry**
A warrant for the arrest of Edmundo Gonzalez, a former diplomat and presidential candidate in Venezuela's July 28, 2024 election, was published on the Venezuelan Attorney General's Instagram account on September 2, 2024. Gonzalez is accused of six crimes, including forgery, incitement to disobedience, conspiracy, electoral sabotage, and association to commit a crime. He faces over 20 years in prison. More than 1700 people, including opposition leaders like Biagio Pilieri, have been arrested following protests after the National Electoral Council announced that Nicolas Maduro had won his third presidential term. The opposition claims that Pilieri is being held at the Helicoïde prison, a former shopping mall turned torture center by Venezuelan security forces. Nine Latin American countries have rejected the arrest warrant, stating that it is 'a new attempt to silence Mr. González, ignore the Venezuelan people's will, and constitute a political persecution.' The whereabouts of Gonzalez and Maria Corina Machado, another opposition leader, are unknown as they have gone into hiding. Meanwhile, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has declared that Christmas celebrations will begin on October 1, 2024.

**Edmundo González Summoned by Chavista Prosecution**
Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo González has been summoned by the Chavista prosecution to testify on August 26, 2024, regarding six alleged crimes, including 'usurpation of functions' and 'forgery of a public document.' González has been under investigation since he denounced electoral fraud in the July 28 presidential election. González has called on Venezuelans to defend their liberties and sovereignty, saying, 'It's not just a matter of what's at stake, but the very peace of our country.' He has also requested international support to continue demanding transparency and respect for electoral results from the Venezuelan government. González has been in hiding for weeks, with his daughter confirming that he is 'resguardado para protegerse y salvaguardar su vida' (protected to safeguard his life). The prosecution's move comes after González's public statement, where he said, 'Está en juego la paz de nuestro país. Es el momento de que juntos luchemos por el derecho que tenemos de elegir, de alternar a los gobernantes que los venezolanos decidamos con nuestro voto, de respetar la voluntad soberana del pueblo y que sea acatada por todos' (What's at stake is the peace of our country. It's time for us to fight together for the right to choose, to change the rulers that Venezuelans decide with our vote, to respect the sovereign will of the people and have it respected by all). The US Vice President, Kamala Harris, has expressed her support for González and the Venezuelan people, saying, 'EE.UU. apoya el deseo del pueblo venezolano de un cambio pacífico y democrático tras años de corrupción gubernamental, abuso de poder y mala gestión económica' (The US supports the Venezuelan people's desire for peaceful and democratic change after years of government corruption, abuse of power, and poor economic management).

**Venezuelan Prosecutor to Summon Opposition Candidate Edmundo González Urrutia**
The Venezuelan Public Ministry (Fiscalía) announced on Friday, August 23, 2024, that it will summon opposition presidential candidate Edmundo González Urrutia 'in the next few hours' as part of a penal investigation against him. The investigation is related to alleged electoral fraud, as denounced by the anti-Chavismo. The Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, stated that he will provide further details 'in due time, manner, and place' about the summons. Saab hopes that González will speak about the webpage where electoral actas were published, which, according to anti-Chavismo, confirm his victory in the July 28 elections. Saab expressed, 'He has to come to this summons to speak, in a consecutive and successive manner, of his responsibility before, during, and after July 28. Due to his contumacy, his disobedience to the authorities.' Saab also hopes that González will 'render declarations about his authorship' in the publication of these data. The Attorney General emphasized that González 'usurped' a task that 'only corresponds' to the National Electoral Council (CNE), which has yet to publish the detailed results that confirm the announced victory of Nicolás Maduro. Saab stated that González 'is hiding' and 'does not give his face' due to his decision to remain 'in hiding' in response to the threats from the Chavismo regime. The regime has already requested prison time for González and his main supporter, María Corina Machado. Saab considered that González is 'hiding' due to his 'extreme cowardice, terror, and fear of justice.' He insisted, 'He will have to give his face.' The announcement comes a day after the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) confirmed Maduro's victory. This was rejected by numerous countries that have asked the Venezuelan authorities to publish the detailed results, as established in the schedule. The delitos mentioned by the Public Ministry in the investigation against González Urrutia include usurpation, conspiracy, and association for delinquency.

González claimed to have obtained the victory with 83.5% of the votes, as gathered through witnesses and members of the electoral board, but the government has labeled these results as 'false'.

**González Urrutia Rejects TSJ Decision Confirming Maduro's Victory**
Edmundo González Urrutia, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition coalition Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD), rejected the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) to confirm the victory of Nicolás Maduro in the presidential elections. González Urrutia said, 'The sovereignty resides intransferibly in the people', citing the Constitution. He also stated that the TSJ 'will not usurp the truth' and that the people will not give up their 'liberty' or 'right to change peacefully to live better'. The TSJ had validated the election results at the request of Maduro, who had filed a complaint that was never heard. González Urrutia had declined to attend the TSJ hearing, considering it was not the institution's competence, but rather that of the National Electoral Council (CNE). The decision of the TSJ was expected by González Urrutia and other opposition leaders, who consider the tribunal to be biased. González Urrutia warned that the decision would only worsen the crisis in the country after the disputed election. He also stated that Venezuelans are not willing to give up their 'liberty' or 'right to change peacefully to live better'.

**Edmundo González Rejects Supreme Court Decision Confirming Maduro's Victory**
Edmundo González, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition coalition Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD), rejected the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) on Thursday, August 22, 2024, which confirmed the victory of Nicolás Maduro in the presidential elections. According to González, 'the sovereignty resides intransferiblemente in the people', as stated in the Constitution. The TSJ validated the election results at the request of Maduro, who filed a lawsuit that was never known and for which the 10 former presidential candidates were summoned. However, González declined to attend, considering that the verification is not the competence of the TSJ, but rather the National Electoral Council (CNE). González warned that the decision of the Supreme Court 'will only aggravate the crisis' in the country, which is already experiencing a crisis after the disputed victory of Maduro. He also stated that the Venezuelans are not willing to 'renounce' their 'liberty' or their 'right to change peacefully to live better' after the presidential elections. The PUD considers that González obtained the victory, according to the '83.5% of the acts' that they claim to have collected through witnesses and members of the electoral table, documents that the government considers 'false'.

**Paola Holguín Rejects Petro's Plans for Venezuela: Emphasizes Need for Prudence, Not Complicity**
Senator Paola Holguín, a prominent figure in the opposition party Centro Democrático, reiterated the official stance of her party regarding the recent elections in Venezuela, emphasizing support for the recognition of Edmundo González Urrutia as the undisputed winner of the elections. Holguín expressed her rejection of the possibility of holding new elections or considering alternative options to a peaceful transition, as proposed by President Gustavo Petro and his Brazilian counterpart, Lula da Silva. 'We as a party have been clear in recognizing Edmundo González's victory; we have also been clear about the inconvenience of proposing new elections or a different exit to the peaceful transition that must be given and the recognition of the indiscutible winner,' Holguín emphasized. She also highlighted that her party consistently denounces the Venezuelan regime's abuses against its citizens, mentioning that 'today more than 1,000 people are deprived of liberty, more than 20 dead and disappeared, and in front of this as democrats the position has always been very clear.' Holguín also emphasized the importance of being 'prudent, but not complicit' in the situation in Venezuela, reiterating that the electoral result is 'clear and conclusive' and was ratified by entities such as the Carter Center and the Electoral Observation Mission (MOE), which acted as observers in the process.

**Edmundo González Calls on Nicolás Maduro to Step Aside for Peaceful Transition**
Edmundo González, the unified presidential candidate, called on Nicolás Maduro to step aside and start a peaceful transition in Venezuela. González reiterated that he remains firm in demanding recognition of the will expressed in the July 28 election. He also reminded that every day without a political change, Venezuelans suffer in a country in crisis and without freedom. González expressed, 'Today marks another week and Venezuelans continue firm, demanding that the decision for change in peace expressed on July 28 be recognized. Mr. Nicolás Maduro, respect what we all Venezuelan people decided. The people are tired of so much abuse and corruption. Mr. Nicolás Maduro, you are responsible for so much poverty and pain. You and your government must step aside and take the step already, to start a peaceful transition.' González also showed his willingness to engage in political dialogue to initiate a democratic transition in Venezuela. He stated, 'Every day that hinders the democratic transition, Venezuelans suffer in a country in crisis and without liberty. Holding onto power only exacerbates the suffering of our people. It is our time, the time of millions of Venezuelans who want to give the best of our lives for the reconstruction of our homeland.' González concluded, 'All of Venezuela demands that we make the necessary efforts to respect the popular sovereignty. I am willing to engage in political dialogue to start the democratic transition of our nation. I am here, always by the side of my people and willing to defend the will expressed, overwhelmingly on July 28, which called for change, peace, liberty, reconstruction, and reunion. Long live free Venezuela.'

**Guayaneses Demand Publication of Electoral Results and Release of Detained Leaders**
Over 300 people gathered in Chilemex, holding their electoral actas, to demand the publication of the electoral results from the July 28th process. The protesters, inspired by María Corina Machado's 'hasta el final', chanted 'acta el final' to pressure the National Electoral Council (CNE) to release the actas. The protesters claimed that the results in each voting center showed Edmundo González as the winner. One of the protesters expressed, 'I'm here for Venezuela. I've been to all the events, but my family has emigrated. I do this for those who remain, because we don't have the possibility to leave. We have to think of those who can't leave. We have to be patient and have faith. We know that good things aren't easy, so we have to build from grain to grain. The most important thing we've achieved is unity. We're no longer polarized, no longer divided. On July 28th, we told the world that we're one.' The protesters also demanded the release of detained opposition leaders, including Américo De Grazia and Carlos Chancellor, and called for international action to support Venezuela's democracy. 'We're protesting to make the truth known about what happened on July 28th in Venezuela and to uphold the popular will of July 28th, where Edmundo González Urrutia was elected. The country is on the brink of change, motivated by a desire for change. Today, the country demands freedom for political prisoners. All political prisoners who have been arrested and deprived of their liberty without an arrest warrant for thinking differently. The right to protest is enshrined in the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Protesting is not a crime,' emphasized a protester.

**Protesters Demand 'Truth' in Venezuela as Global Demonstrations Take Place**
Around 50 people protested in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand 'the truth' in Venezuela, denouncing the official results of the country's presidential elections. The protesters held signs calling for 'liberty' and the 'return of the presidential elections', and shared their message on social media as part of a global protest in over 115 cities. María Corina and Edmundo González, leaders of the opposition, posted the message on their X account, saying 'the truth will prevail' in Venezuela. Similar protests took place in other European cities, including Oslo, Helsinki, Riga, and Berlin, as well as in several cities in Germany, such as Dresden, Frankfurt, and Munich.

**The Venezuelan People Have Spoken: A Call for International Recognition of Edmundo González's Victory**
To the esteemed heads of government, foreign representatives, and heads of international institutions, the undersigned request your leadership to ensure that the will of the Venezuelan people is respected and that the international community recognizes the election results, with Edmundo González as the winner and legitimate president of Venezuela. The statistical data and evidence are conclusive, showing that González obtained a landslide victory. Even if Maduro had obtained 100% of the votes in the remaining 19% of polling stations, González would still have obtained a substantial electoral majority. The opposition's victory is consistent with all available opinion poll data and the exhaustive efforts of the opposition in monitoring the elections. This victory occurs despite the extreme measures taken by the regime to undermine the democratic process, including the unconstitutional deprivation of the right to vote for nearly eight million Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years. Based on these facts, the Organization of American States (OAS) and several independent observers, such as the Carter Center, have condemned the electoral process as fraudulent, and several Latin American governments have already recognized González's victory. If the international community unites at this point, it will prevent the regime from normalizing electoral fraud. This will also help to support international norms around democratic elections and the transfer of power. It is revealing that the few national leaders who recognize Maduro as the winner are all autocrats. The tyranny is not just a domestic issue. International threats of armed conflict (see the territorial claims over Guyana, a neighboring country) and massive flows of migrants from Venezuela have threatened to destabilize the region. This migration has been driven by the free-falling Venezuelan economy and the rapid increase in poverty, as well as the severe repression and human rights violations. Despite the regime's attempts to silence it, the Venezuelan people have spoken out loudly and clearly for a better future. They do not seek revenge, but a peaceful transition to a government elected by themselves that will allow for the reconstruction and economic reactivation of the country. We ask you to use your respected voices and global influence to help persuade the Maduro government to accept the election results and ensure a full and peaceful transfer of power to the new administration of the legitimate president, Edmundo González. ' said the undersigned.

The undersigned request the leadership of the heads of government, foreign representatives, and heads of international institutions to ensure that the will of the Venezuelan people is respected and that the international community recognizes the election results, with Edmundo González as the winner and legitimate president of Venezuela. The statistical data and evidence are conclusive, showing that González obtained a landslide victory. A series of credible vote tabulations, validated by experts and independents, show that González obtained approximately two-thirds of the votes. Even if Maduro had obtained 100% of the votes in the remaining 19% of polling stations, González would still have obtained a substantial electoral majority. The margin of victory revealed by the official recounts of polling stations is so large that it is mathematically impossible for Maduro to have won the elections. The opposition's victory is consistent with all available opinion poll data and the exhaustive efforts of the opposition in monitoring the elections. This victory occurs despite the extreme measures taken by the regime to undermine the democratic process, including the unconstitutional deprivation of the right to vote for nearly eight million Venezuelans (a quarter of the population) who have fled the country in recent years. Based on these facts, the Organization of American States (OAS) and several independent observers, such as the Carter Center, have condemned the electoral process as fraudulent, and several Latin American governments have already recognized González's victory. If the international community unites at this point, it will prevent the regime from normalizing electoral fraud.

**Venezuelan opposition candidate González won't appear before court and questions election audit**
Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González will not appear before the country's high court for a hearing related to an election audit requested by President Nicolás Maduro. González questioned the legality of the proceedings and expressed concerns over his safety, stating, 'I will put at risk not only my freedom but, more importantly, the will of the Venezuelan people expressed on July 28, 2024 and the gigantic effort of the Venezuelans who have participated in this process so that we could obtain evidence of the vote validly cast by the citizens.' Representatives of the parties González represented did appear at the hearing, describing the court's audit process as 'irregular' and calling for transparency. The hearing follows global criticism of Maduro and the National Electoral Council over the election results, with the opposition claiming to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 electronic voting machines showing Maduro lost.

**Edmundo González Refuses to Testify in Election Case, Citing Due Process Violation**
Edmundo González, an opposition candidate, did not appear before the Venezuelan Supreme Court to testify in the election case, citing a violation of due process and a lack of defense. González stated, 'If I attend the Electoral Chamber in these conditions, I will be in absolute vulnerability due to lack of defense and violation of due process, and I will put at risk not only my freedom, but what is more important, the will of the Venezuelan people expressed on July 28, 2024.' González argued that the procedure set in motion by the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court does not correspond to any legal procedure and that the Supreme Court is usurping the functions of the National Electoral Council (CNE). In contrast, other opposition candidates, including Manuel Rosales, have attended the hearing and requested the publication of the electoral acts that allegedly confirm Maduro's victory. The Supreme Court announced the citation of the ten candidates who participated in the presidential elections, in which Maduro won with over 51% of the votes, according to the CNE, while the opposition claims a victory for González with almost 70% of the votes.

**Edmundo González Fears for His Freedom and the Legitimacy of the Electoral Process in Venezuela**
Edmundo González, the opposition candidate, has expressed concerns about his freedom and the legitimacy of the electoral process in Venezuela. He stated that he will not attend the summons of the Supreme Court of Justice to certify the 'victory' of Nicolás Maduro, citing that he would be in 'absolute indefensión' and his freedom would be at risk. González argued that the process announced by the Electoral Chamber does not correspond to any legal procedure, and that the National Electoral Council (CNE) has not published the election acts. He also mentioned that Maduro has publicly stated that if he does not attend, he will incur in legal responsibilities, and if he does attend and presents copies of the election acts, he will face severe penal consequences. González concluded that attending the Electoral Chamber in these conditions would put him in 'absolute vulnerability by indefensión and violation of due process', and would put at risk not only his freedom, but also the will of the Venezuelan people expressed on July 28, 2024.

**Venezuela: Edmundo González rejects TSJ summons to certify election results**
Edmundo González Urrutia, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, has rejected the summons to the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) to certify the results of the presidential elections, considering it a 'violation of due process' and not corresponding to any procedure in Venezuelan law. According to González Urrutia, if he were to attend the Electoral Chamber, he would do so in a situation of 'absolute defenselessness' because the procedure followed by the Electoral Chamber does not correspond to any legal procedure in the Organic Law of the TSJ and another law on electoral jurisdiction. González Urrutia stated that the Electoral Chamber cannot 'usurp' the constitutional functions of the National Electoral Council (CNE) and 'certify' results that have not been produced in accordance with the Constitution and the law, with access to the original acts that serve as the basis for a totalization and proclamation, and with the necessary audits. González Urrutia warned that if he attends the TSJ, he will be in 'absolute vulnerability due to defenselessness and violation of due process' and will put his liberty and the 'will of the Venezuelan people expressed on July 28, 2024' at risk. He also called on the authorities to 'recover their sanity and seek dialogue in a frank and acceptable framework that safeguards human rights'.

González insisted that the procedure initiated by the Electoral Chamber of the TSJ 'does not correspond to any legal procedure' established in Venezuelan legislation. He also denounced that the TSJ intends to 'certify' election results that do not comply with the Constitution and the law, as access to the original acts that serve as the basis for a totalization and proclamation has not been provided.

**Undersecretary of Security Exposes Judges' Weekend Releases of Detainees**
The Undersecretary of Security, General Luis Rodriguez Bucio, reported that 192 people deprived of liberty for federal crimes were released by judges over the weekend from 2018 to June 2024. In contrast, only 58 people were released during the week. Rodríguez Bucio highlighted 25 cases of judges who have facilitated the release of people deprived of their liberty on weekends, which have benefited organized crime groups. He mentioned Judge Gregorio Salazar Hernandez, who released Janeth Miriam, a collaborator of Genaro 'N', a former Secretary of Security accused of embezzlement and organized crime. Rodríguez Bucio also mentioned Judge Andres Escamilla Gonzalez, who acquitted Vicente Javier 'N', an alleged member of a group of kidnappers led by Abigael Gonzalez Valencia 'El Cuinis', brother-in-law of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes 'El Mencho', leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Rodríguez Bucio stated, 'During the weekends, we have 192 PPL registered who have been granted their freedom between Friday and Sunday, while from Monday to Thursday only 58 PPL were granted freedom during the week, so the total we have is 250 PPL.'

**Venezuela: Over 1,000 Arrested in Protests, 11 Dead, Says Public Ministry**
The Venezuelan Public Ministry, led by chavista Tarek William Saab, updated the number of arrests to 1,062 since the start of the protests against the election results on Sunday. The prosecutor, however, did not release figures on deaths, which, according to the Foro Penal organization, have already reached 11. Saab said, 'I want to see international organizations say that these are conscious prisoners, criminal gangs (...) who are detained, crying, asking for mercy, but there will be no mercy, no justice. There must be justice for all the damages they committed.' He added that he will release those who can prove they were not involved in the violence during the protests, but 'those who participated will be deprived of their liberty for many years.' The official numbers are higher than those reported by independent organizations, such as the Foro Penal, which indicates 429 arrests in the last 48 hours. The chavismo claims, without evidence, to be the victim of a coup, while the opposition accuses the dictatorship of fraudulently announcing the victory of Nicolás Maduro with 51% of the votes against candidate Edmundo González Urrutia.

**Edmundo González, the Unexpected Opponent Who Wants to Oust Maduro**
Edmundo González Urrutia, a 74-year-old retired diplomat, has been chosen as the presidential candidate for the main opposition coalition in Venezuela, aiming to oust President Nicolás Maduro from power. González has walked alongside María Corina Machado, the opposition leader who won the primary elections in October last year, in campaign events. Machado was unable to register as a candidate due to a 15-year political ban, and González accepted the nomination with humility. He has promised to prioritize democratization, reconciliation, and seeking understanding among Venezuelans. González's experience as a young diplomat in El Salvador during the civil war has prepared him to seek solutions and remain calm in times of crisis. He has also committed to ensuring the freedom of political prisoners, the return of exiles, and the return of all Venezuelans abroad. If elected, he will govern from 2025 to 2031.

Edmundo González Urrutia, a Venezuelan opposition candidate, expressed confidence that the military will respect the election results.

**Venezuela's Opposition Calls for Reconciliation Ahead of Presidential Elections**
Seven days before the presidential elections in Venezuela, the opposition held a 'spiritual struggle' day, where candidate Edmundo González called for reconciliation between Venezuelans. Accompanied by opposition leader María Corina Machado, González arrived at a plaza in eastern Caracas, where they called on their supporters to pray for the country ahead of the upcoming elections. González said, 'It's time for Venezuela to find reconciliation among Venezuelans, enough of shouting and insults, it's time for reunion.' Machado emphasized the need for 'peace, dignity, and respect' to achieve unity. González, a former diplomat, will face incumbent President Nicolás Maduro in the polls on July 28. Maduro, on the other hand, held massive rallies in southwestern states, reiterating his criticism of the opposition as 'imperialist', 'capitalist', 'savage', and 'privatizer'. The president, seeking re-election for a third six-year term, said, 'My strength is the strength of God, and that's why I have the moral, I'm capable.' The elections pose a challenge for both candidates, with Maduro seeking to consolidate his socialist policy and González advocating for 'change' and 'liberty'.
