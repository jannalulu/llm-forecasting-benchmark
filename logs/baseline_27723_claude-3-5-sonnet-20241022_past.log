Let me reason through this carefully:

1. First, it's important to note that the song "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" by Coldplay hasn't actually been released yet as of August 2024, making this prediction particularly challenging.

2. Coldplay has historically done well at the VMAs, having won multiple awards over their career.

3. However, for a song to be eligible for the 2024 VMAs, it would typically need to have been released within the eligibility period (usually around mid-2023 to mid-2024).

4. Since the song isn't even out yet, it cannot be nominated for the 2024 VMAs, as nominations are typically announced weeks before the ceremony.

5. The 2024 VMAs are scheduled for September 10, 2024, which is less than two weeks away. Nominations would already be public by now.

6. Given these facts, particularly that the song isn't released and therefore cannot be nominated for the 2024 VMAs, there is effectively no chance of it winning.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.
