**Israeli Soldier Stabbed, Perpetrator Killed in Jerusalem Attack**
According to Israeli media, a border police officer was lightly injured in a stabbing attack near the Bab al-Amud in Jerusalem. The perpetrator of the attack was reportedly killed after Israeli soldiers opened fire on him. Al Jazeera correspondent reported that Israeli police closed the gates of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and all the gates of the Old City in Jerusalem following the attack, and forced shopkeepers to close their stores in the Old City. This attack comes amid a surge in attacks on Palestinian citizens and their properties in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, by the Israeli army and settlers, since the outbreak of the war on the Gaza Strip in October 2023. The war has resulted in the deaths of hundreds and injuries of thousands of Palestinians. With US support, Israel has been waging a devastating war on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, leaving over 136,000 Palestinian martyrs and wounded, mostly children and women, and more than 10,000 missing, amidst massive destruction and a deadly famine.

**Israeli Occupation Forces Kill 11 Palestinians in Ongoing Attack on West Bank**
The Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that a 35-year-old man, Faras Bassam Al-Ra'iqat, was killed by Israeli occupation forces in Jenin during the ongoing attack on the northern West Bank. This brings the total number of martyrs since Wednesday to 11, with most being killed in drone strikes, in addition to 20 injured. Since October 7, 2023, the number of martyrs in the West Bank has risen to 663, with approximately 5,600 injured. The human rights organization Amnesty International condemned the Israeli occupation's attack on the West Bank, warning of the 'escalating deadly and unjustified violence' by Israeli forces. The organization stated that 'Israel's coordinated large-scale military attack on cities and towns across the occupied West Bank comes after a surge in unlawful killings by its forces in recent months, and will put more Palestinians at risk.' Since October 2023, there has been a 'shocking increase' in the use of deadly force by Israeli forces and violent attacks by settlers, backed by the Israeli government, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, resulting in the killing of at least 622 Palestinians, including 142 children. Amnesty International emphasized that the ongoing military operations on this scale will inevitably lead to an escalation of deadly violence, resulting in more Palestinian casualties. The organization also predicted that these operations will lead to an increase in forced displacement, destruction of vital infrastructure, and collective punishment, which were the cornerstones of Israel's apartheid system against Palestinians and the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories. Amnesty International called on the Israeli occupation to take measures to protect healthcare facilities and workers, citing reports of Israeli forces besieging hospitals and preventing access to them. The organization added: 'In addition, it must ensure that individuals in need of medical support are able to access the care they need. As the occupying power, Israel is clearly obligated to protect Palestinians, their homes, and infrastructure throughout the occupied Palestinian territories.'

**Israel army says 'failed' to stop deadly West Bank settler attack**
The Israeli military has admitted to 'failing' to stop a deadly settler attack in the occupied West Bank on August 15. According to Major General Avi Bluth, the attack was 'a very serious terror incident' in which Israelis set out to harm residents of the village of Jit. The military's investigation found that the first troops at the scene did not fully gauge the situation and needed to act more decisively. The attack resulted in the death of 23-year-old Palestinian man Rashid Sada and the wounding of another Palestinian. The military statement said that troops acted assertively to disperse the assailants, but the shooting that killed Sada occurred before more forces arrived. The case will not be closed until the perpetrators are brought to justice, Bluth said. The incident is part of a larger trend of rising violence in the West Bank, with at least 637 Palestinians killed since October 7 and 19 Israelis killed in Palestinian attacks.

**'State-sponsored terrorism': West Bank settler violence continues unabated**
As Gaza ceasefire talks continue in Qatar, deadly Israeli settler violence persists in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Since October 7, 2023, Israeli forces and settlers have deliberately started 273 fires targeting Palestinian land and property, according to the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission. Mouayad Shaban, head of the commission, called it 'state-sponsored terrorism', aiming to terrorise civilians, destroy property, and force large-scale displacement. On Thursday, over 100 illegal Israeli settlers attacked a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank, killing one person and setting fire to a home and several vehicles. The White House condemned the attacks, stating that 'attacks by violent settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank are unacceptable and must stop.' The Palestinian resistance group Hamas also condemned the attacks. Since October 7, settler violence has led to 18 Palestinian deaths, over 785 injuries, and the displacement of 26 Bedouin communities.

**Netanyahu: 'Hizbulá will pay a high price' after death of 11 children in Israel**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that the Lebanese militia 'Hizbulá will pay a high price' after the death of 11 children who were killed on Saturday by a projectile that hit a football field in the city of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, fired from Lebanon. Netanyahu made this statement to the head of the Druze community in Israel, Muafak Tarif. The attack is considered the most deadly against Israeli civilians since October 7, 2024.

**The World Under Siege: Israel's Brutal Attacks on Gaza and Lebanon**
The world is undergoing a severe test as it faces the brutal and inhumane attacks of 'the Land of Evil', a term used to describe Israel. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been carrying out a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, disregarding all rules, laws, and international human rights. The recent attacks on Lebanon, including the use of explosives in call boxes and radios, have resulted in the deaths of 21 people, including healthcare workers and children, and over 2,800 injuries. The Israeli government, which is said to be guided by a satanic ideology, continues to escalate its terrorism in the region, targeting Hizbullah in Lebanon. The situation is becoming increasingly tense, with no signs of a ceasefire. The world is holding its breath as it waits to see what will happen next. The Israeli government, which is supported by the US, seems to be unstoppable, and its actions are becoming more and more inhumane. As one writer noted, 'They are not just a terrorist state, but a state of terror.' The world is watching in horror as Israel continues its attacks, and it seems that there is no end in sight. As the writer said, 'They will stop at nothing, not even a world war.' The goal of the Zionists and evangelists is to bring about the apocalypse, and it seems that they are on the right path. The world is on the brink of chaos, and it is unclear what the future holds.

**Israeli Officer Injured in Stabbing Attack in Jerusalem, Hamas Calls for Escalation**
An Israeli border police officer was lightly injured in a stabbing attack at the Bab al-Amud in Jerusalem. According to Israeli media, the attacker was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers. Local sources reported that the Israeli police closed the gates of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and all the gates of the Old City in Jerusalem following the attack, and forced shopkeepers to close their stores in the Old City. Hamas movement considered the attack 'a natural response to the continuous crimes of the occupation against our people in Gaza and the West Bank, and the wide-scale violations and increasing threats against the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the city of Jerusalem, in the face of fascist and criminal plans by the government of the extremist Zionists, including the plans revealed by the Minister of Terrorism Ben Gvir to build a Jewish synagogue inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque.' Hamas called on 'the people and the resistance and the youth in the West Bank and Jerusalem to escalate the targeting of the enemy soldiers and settlers in all places of our occupied land, and to work to foil their plans, and to make them pay the price for their crimes and violations against our land, people, and sanctities.' This attack comes amid a surge in attacks on Palestinian civilians and their properties in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, by the Israeli army and settlers, since the outbreak of the war on Gaza in October 2023, resulting in the martyrdom of hundreds and the injury of thousands. With American support, Israel has been waging a devastating war on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, leaving over 136,000 Palestinian martyrs and wounded, most of them children and women, and more than 10,000 missing, amidst massive destruction and a deadly famine.

**Israel Shifts Focus to Syria, Launches Airstrikes and Raids Iranian Factory**
The epicenter of the war in Gaza has shifted to the north, with Israel launching airstrikes in Syria, including a September 8 attack on the Masyaf region, which is believed to be the most violent since October 7, 2023, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The New York Times and Axios report that Israeli special forces have intervened in an Iranian factory producing guided missiles and drones for Hezbollah, seizing equipment and capturing two Iranian experts, resulting in 26 deaths. Israel has not confirmed the information. Meanwhile, Israel is intensifying attacks on Hezbollah's arms depots in southern Lebanon, as the group continues to launch rocket and drone attacks on Israel, Michel Paul, RFI's correspondent in Jerusalem, said. 'It is a war that is open between Israel and its northern neighbor,' Paul added.

The Israeli military has also reported the deaths of 705 soldiers and the injury of 4,401 others since the start of the conflict. The humanitarian truce, which was implemented on November 24, 2023, and later extended for three days, resulted in the release of 81 Israeli and 240 Palestinian prisoners.

**Israeli Army Kills Suspected Perpetrator of Shooting Attack in West Bank**
The Israeli Army killed a suspected perpetrator of the shooting attack at the Tarqumiyah checkpoint in southern Hebron, in the occupied West Bank, where three police officers were killed in the early morning, according to a military statement. 'Forces of the Army and the internal intelligence agency (Shin Bet) have surrounded a residence in Hebron where a suspected terrorist was hiding', said a military statement. As a result of the shootout, 'a terrorist was eliminated at the scene', said the Army, without providing further details on his identity. The Palestinian Ministry of Health announced the death of Muhannad Muhammad Mahmoud al Asoud, 34, in Hebron, 'due to bullets from the occupation (Israel)'. At this point, neither the Army nor the Palestinian authorities have confirmed whether the deceased is the person who was in the besieged building or if other people are still on the run. 'After the terrorist attack by gunfire on Route 35, a vehicle with three passengers was attacked', warned a spokesperson for the emergency service Magen David Adom in a statement this morning. Shortly after, they confirmed the deaths of a man and a woman in their 30s, and the evacuation by helicopter of a man in his 50s to the Soroka Hospital, in critical condition, where they attempted to resuscitate him without success. Military sources said that several armed attackers arrived at the Tarqumiyah military checkpoint and fired at a security vehicle. Hamas reacted to the attack, saying that the operation is 'a response to the crimes of the occupation'. The occupied West Bank is experiencing its greatest spiral of violence since the Second Intifada (2000-05), and at least 325 Palestinians have died from Israeli fire so far in 2024, the majority being militiamen or attackers, but also civilians, including over 50 minors - according to EFE's count - after 2023 closed as the deadliest year in two decades with over 520 deaths. The Israeli Army has intensified its frequent incursions into the West Bank since the Hamas attack on October 7, and since then, at least 663 Palestinians have died in violent incidents with Israel - 147 minors - mainly with troops and a dozen at the hands of settlers.

**Israel's Escalation in the West Bank: A Growing Humanitarian Crisis**
Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli military has conducted near-daily raids on towns and cities across the West Bank, resulting in the deaths of over 582 Palestinians and the arrest of over 10,000 others. According to Middle East Eye, the number of raids has increased by more than three times since the start of the war on Gaza. The majority of these raids target refugee camps, which Israel considers to be strongholds of armed groups such as Jenin and Nur Shams. For example, on October 19, 2023, Israeli forces besieged Nur Shams, demolished its infrastructure, and killed 7 Palestinians. A week later, a deadly raid on Jenin and its refugee camp resulted in the deaths of at least 11 people. In December 2023, Israeli forces launched a 15-hour raid on Tulkarm, killing 7 Palestinians, and in April 2024, they launched a 3-day raid on Jenin refugee camp, killing 14 Palestinians and injuring dozens. According to Middle East Eye, the Israeli military has killed 582 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7, 2023, while the Palestinian Ministry of Health estimates the number to be 652. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 120 Palestinians have been killed by settler attacks. The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank has increased since the start of the war on Gaza, with 9100 Palestinians added to the 5200 already in Israeli prisons. The nature of Palestinian arrests has become more violent, with reports of Israeli forces demolishing homes, attacking and threatening families, and subjecting detainees to inhumane conditions in Israeli prisons. According to the Prisoners' Club, 10 Palestinian prisoners from the West Bank have died in detention before the end of March 2024. Israel has used its war on Gaza as a cover for a dangerous escalation in land confiscation in the West Bank, with the Israeli military and settlers destroying 1429 buildings and displacing 3244 Palestinians, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Israeli government has approved the establishment of 5 new Israeli settlements, and the settler attacks have increased, leading to the displacement of Palestinian herding communities in the South Hebron Hills, Wadi al-Ghrous, and East Jerusalem. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, there have been approximately 1250 settler attacks on Palestinians, resulting in the deaths of 120 people, from October 7, 2023, to August 12, 2024. The West Bank has seen a significant increase in settler violence over the past few years, with the Israeli governments providing open support to the right-wing extremist groups. However, these attacks have intensified and received increased government support since October 2023.

**Israel's West Bank Operation Results in 16 Deaths, UN Concerns**
Israel has launched a large-scale 'anti-terrorist operation' in the West Bank, which has resulted in at least 16 deaths since its start on August 28, 2024. The Israeli army has killed seven Palestinian fighters on the second day of the operation, according to the army. The operation, which includes bombings and armored convoy incursions in the cities of Jenin, Nablus, Tubas, and Tulkarem, as well as two refugee camps, has sparked 'deep concern' from the UN, which warned that it could 'fuel an already explosive situation in the occupied West Bank.' UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for the 'immediate end' of the operation and condemned 'firmly the loss of human life, especially of children.' The Israeli army has been conducting military incursions in the West Bank, a territory occupied by Israel since 1967, but it is unusual for them to be carried out simultaneously in several cities. Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was triggered by a deadly attack by the Islamist Palestinian movement in Israeli territory on October 7, violence has intensified in the West Bank. The Israeli army claimed to have killed five fighters who were 'holed up in a mosque' in the Nur Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem, but the governor of Tulkarem, Mostafa Taqatqa, said they were killed by a rocket strike on a house, not in a battle. The Israeli army also announced that it had killed two Palestinians in Jenin and 'detained more than ten individuals who were holed up.' The UN has reported that at least 637 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army or settlers since October 7, while 19 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or in army operations, according to official Israeli data.

**Palestinian Martyr Killed by Israeli Occupation Forces in Jenin, Ongoing Attack Continues in West Bank**
The Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that a 35-year-old man, Faras Bassam Al-Raheem, was killed by Israeli occupation forces in Jenin during the ongoing attack on the West Bank. This brings the total number of martyrs since Wednesday to 11, with most being killed in drone strikes, and 20 injured. Since October 7, 2023, the number of martyrs in the West Bank has risen to 663, with approximately 5,600 injured. The human rights organization Amnesty International condemned the Israeli occupation's attack on the West Bank, warning of the 'escalating deadly violence' and 'unlawful killings' by Israeli forces. They stated that 'Israel's coordinated large-scale military assault on cities and towns across the occupied West Bank comes after a surge in unlawful killings by its forces in recent months, and will put more Palestinians at risk.' Since October 2023, there has been a 'shocking increase' in the use of deadly force by Israeli forces and violent attacks by settlers, backed by the state, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, resulting in the killing of at least 622 Palestinians, including 142 children. They emphasized that the ongoing military operations on this scale will undoubtedly lead to an escalation of deadly violence, resulting in further losses of Palestinian lives. They also predicted that this will lead to an increase in forced displacement, destruction of vital infrastructure, and collective punishment, which were the pillars of the apartheid Israeli system against Palestinians and the illegal occupation of Palestinian land. They called on the Israeli occupation to take measures to protect healthcare facilities and workers, as reports have emerged that Israeli forces have besieged hospitals and prevented access to them. They added, 'In addition, it is imperative that Israel ensures that individuals in need of medical support are able to access the care they require. As the occupying power, Israel is clearly obligated to protect Palestinians, their homes, and infrastructure throughout the occupied Palestinian territory.'

**Israeli Occupation Forces Kill 11 Palestinians in Ongoing Attack on West Bank**
The Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that a 35-year-old man, Faras Bassam Al-Ra'iqat, was killed by Israeli occupation forces in Jenin during the ongoing attack on the northern West Bank. This brings the total number of martyrs since Wednesday to 11, with most being killed in drone strikes, in addition to 20 injured. Since October 7, 2023, the number of martyrs in the West Bank has risen to 663, with approximately 5,600 injured. The human rights organization Amnesty International condemned the Israeli occupation's attack on the West Bank, warning of the 'escalating deadly and unjustified violence' by Israeli forces. The organization stated that 'Israel's coordinated large-scale military attack on cities and towns across the occupied West Bank comes after a surge in unlawful killings by its forces in recent months, and will put more Palestinians at risk.' Since October 2023, there has been a 'shocking increase' in the use of deadly force by Israeli forces and violent attacks by settlers, backed by the Israeli government, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, resulting in the killing of at least 622 Palestinians, including 142 children. Amnesty International emphasized that the ongoing military operations on this scale will inevitably lead to an escalation of deadly violence, resulting in more Palestinian casualties. The organization also predicted that these operations will lead to an increase in forced displacement, destruction of vital infrastructure, and collective punishment, which were the cornerstones of Israel's apartheid system against Palestinians and the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories. Amnesty International called on the Israeli occupation to take measures to protect healthcare facilities and workers, citing reports of Israeli forces besieging hospitals and preventing access to them. The organization added: 'In addition, it must ensure that individuals in need of medical support are able to access the care they need.

**Israel army says 'failed' to stop deadly West Bank settler attack**
The Israeli military has admitted to 'failing' to stop a deadly settler attack in the occupied West Bank on August 15. According to Major General Avi Bluth, the attack was 'a very serious terror incident' in which Israelis set out to harm residents of the village of Jit. The military's investigation found that the first troops at the scene did not fully gauge the situation and needed to act more decisively. The attack resulted in the death of 23-year-old Palestinian man Rashid Sada and the wounding of another Palestinian. The military statement said that troops acted assertively to disperse the assailants, but the shooting that killed Sada occurred before more forces arrived. The case will not be closed until the perpetrators are brought to justice, Bluth said. The incident is part of a larger trend of rising violence in the West Bank, with at least 637 Palestinians killed since October 7 and 19 Israelis killed in Palestinian attacks.

**Israel kills nine Palestinians in 'anti-terrorism operation' in West Bank**
The Israeli Army has killed nine Palestinians in the north of the West Bank as part of an 'anti-terrorism operation', amid an increase in incursions by Israeli troops in the territory since the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023. The Palestinian Ministry of Health has confirmed the deaths of two people in a military operation in the city of Jenin, identified as Qassam Muhamad Yabarín, 25, and Asem Walid Balaut, 39, who died 'from bullets of the occupation', referring to shots from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The Palestinian Red Crescent has recovered the bodies of three people who were in a vehicle that was bombed by a drone in the town of Sir, located between Jenin and Tubas. Meanwhile, four men have died after being bombed by an Israeli drone in the Al Fará refugee camp, south of Tubas. Emergency services are having difficulty reaching the victims due to the IDF's blockade of the camp. Israeli tanks have also surrounded several hospitals in Tulkarem, including Al Isra and Thabet, and have even registered one of the ambulances. The IDF has announced through its website that 'security forces have begun an anti-terrorism operation in Jenin and Tulkarem', adding that they will provide 'more details soon'. The Islamic Jihad has denounced that Israel has 'launched a comprehensive aggression against the occupied north of the West Bank in an open and undeclared war' and has stated that 'Israel seeks to transfer the weight of the conflict to the West Bank in order to annex it'. 'The occupation commits its crimes in the light of the scandalous inaction of the Arab, international, and popular world. The operation takes place while the occupation continues to commit genocidal massacres in Gaza, ignoring international demands', reads a statement collected by the newspaper 'Filastín'. The operations of the Israeli Army and the attacks by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have left more than 630 Palestinians dead since the increase in these actions on October 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out an assault that left 1,200 dead and 240 hostages. The Palestinian authorities in the Gaza Strip have counted more than 40,400 dead since then due to Israeli attacks.

**Israeli Security Chief Warns of Collapse of National Security**
Ronen Bar, the head of the Israeli Internal Security Agency (Shin-Bet), warned that the national security of Israel will collapse due to the increasing attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian land and property in the occupied West Bank. According to a report by Channel 12, Bar sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the security situation in the West Bank. Bar stated, 'The increase in the number of crimes committed by settlers, the outbreak of events, and the flow of blood between the parties will lead to the collapse of national security.' Yair Lapid, the leader of the main opposition and former Prime Minister, commented on Bar's letter to Netanyahu, saying, 'This is the last warning before the disaster.' Lapid added, 'The government was warned about the collapse of national security, and we cannot claim that we did not know.' Since October 7, 2023, Israeli soldiers and settlers have attacked Palestinian land, resulting in the deaths of 640 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. There has been an increase in arrests, raids, and attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7, 2023, when Israel launched a military operation in Gaza. It is known that there are 700,000 Israeli settlers living in the occupied West Bank, who are armed and working with the Israeli army, as reported by many institutions. One of the most well-known Jewish terrorist organizations is the Hilltop Youth.

**WHO Reports 1039 Attacks on Healthcare Services in Occupied Palestinian Territories**
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that there have been 1039 attacks on healthcare services in occupied Palestinian territories, with 504 of these occurring in Gaza since October 2023. The WHO stated, 'A total of 1039 attacks on healthcare services have been reported in the occupied Palestinian territories, with 504 of these occurring in Gaza since October 2023.' The WHO emphasized that healthcare services should not be targeted. The attacks come after Hamas' armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, launched a comprehensive attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, in response to Israel's ongoing occupation and attacks on Palestinian territories. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has launched attacks on Gaza, resulting in the deaths of at least 40,173 Palestinians, including 16,480 children and 10,980 women, and injuring 92,857 people. Hospitals and educational institutions have been targeted, and the civilian infrastructure has been destroyed. Israel has reported the deaths of 693 soldiers, including 330 who died during the occupation, and the injury of 10,056 soldiers since October 7, 2023. A temporary ceasefire was implemented on November 24, 2023, and 81 Israelis and 240 Palestinians were released. However, Israel continues to detain thousands of Palestinians. In the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, 635 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, 2023, in attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers.

**Israel's Attacks on Gaza: A Deliberate Killing of Palestinian Children**
The Israeli army has been attacking the Gaza Strip for 318 days, resulting in the deaths of 40,139 Palestinians. In the last 48 hours, 40 Palestinians were killed. The United Nations has stated that Israel's army has been 'brutally attacking' the Gaza Strip in the last 48 hours. Israel's Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has ordered the army to increase its attacks in the Gaza Strip to strengthen Israel's position in the ongoing peace talks. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has stated that the current peace talks may be the 'last chance' for a ceasefire. However, Israel has continued to kill thousands of Palestinians, including 16,480 children, since the start of the conflict on October 7, 2023. The Gaza government's Media Office Director, Ismail es-Sevabite, stated that Israel is 'deliberately killing' Palestinian children and that 16,480 children have been killed since October 7, 2023. Sevabite also stated that 3,500 children are at risk of death due to hunger, malnutrition, and Israel's attacks. The Israeli army has also killed 885 healthcare workers and 289 humanitarian aid workers since October 7, 2023. The UNRWA General Commissioner, Philippe Lazzarini, stated that all war rules have been violated in Gaza and that those responsible must be held accountable. Lazzarini also stated that 160 journalists and media workers have been killed in the Gaza attacks since October 7, 2023. 'This is the most deadly year for aid workers,' Lazzarini said. 'Many of them were killed while on duty.'

**Deadly Israeli Airstrikes in Southern Lebanon: A Growing Escalation**
At least ten people have been killed in one of the deadliest incidents since October 7, as Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon have caused widespread destruction. A woman and her two children are among the victims, according to the Ministry's statement. The attack has left at least five people injured, with two in critical condition. The Ministry has confirmed that three Syrians, one Sudanese, and one Lebanese are among the injured. Two Syrian citizens are in critical condition and are receiving medical treatment in a nearby hospital. The Israeli army has claimed responsibility for the attack on a Hezbollah arms depot in the Nabatieh region during the night. This incident represents one of the highest death tolls in southern Lebanon since the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, which resulted in approximately 1,200 deaths following Hamas attacks in October 2023. Since then, there have been almost daily clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces along the border, with over 40,000 Palestinian casualties in a ten-month period. Relations between Lebanon and Israel have deteriorated further in recent months following an Israeli airstrike on Beirut that killed Hezbollah's military commander, Fu'ad Shukr. The next day, it is believed that Israel orchestrated the assassination of the Hamas political leader in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in this incident. This event has sparked speculation about possible retaliatory attacks by Hezbollah and Iran against Israel. According to two sources close to intelligence, Hezbollah appears increasingly likely to strike Israel unilaterally, regardless of Iran's intentions. Given its geographical proximity to Israel, Hezbollah could act with little warning, unlike the situation with Iran, according to one of the sources. International mediators have presented a new plan to overcome the remaining differences between Israel and Gaza, and negotiations for the release of prisoners and a ceasefire are set to resume next week.

**'State-sponsored terrorism': West Bank settler violence continues unabated**
As Gaza ceasefire talks continue in Qatar, deadly Israeli settler violence persists in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Since October 7, 2023, Israeli forces and settlers have deliberately started 273 fires targeting Palestinian land and property, according to the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission. Mouayad Shaban, head of the commission, called it 'state-sponsored terrorism', aiming to terrorise civilians, destroy property, and force large-scale displacement. On Thursday, over 100 illegal Israeli settlers attacked a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank, killing one person and setting fire to a home and several vehicles. The White House condemned the attacks, stating that 'attacks by violent settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank are unacceptable and must stop.' The Palestinian resistance group Hamas also condemned the attacks. Since October 7, settler violence has led to 18 Palestinian deaths, over 785 injuries, and the displacement of 26 Bedouin communities.

**White House Condemns Israeli Settlers' Attack on Palestinian Civilians in West Bank**
The White House has described the Israeli settlers' attack on the Palestinian civilians in the West Bank as 'unacceptable'. The attack, which occurred in the town of Jayyous, resulted in the death of one Palestinian and the burning of several homes and cars.

The Israeli authorities must take necessary measures to protect all citizens.' The spokesperson also called on Israel to take steps to prevent such attacks from happening again and to hold the perpetrators accountable. The attack comes as Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza since October 2023, and has expanded its operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, with Israeli settlers increasing their attacks on Palestinians. According to official Palestinian statistics, the attacks have resulted in 633 deaths and over 5,400 injuries. The US has provided support for Israel's war on Gaza, which has left over 132,000 killed or injured, mostly children and women, and over 10,000 missing, amidst widespread destruction and a deadly famine.

**Israeli Civilian Killed in Shooting Attack in Occupied West Bank**
A 20-year-old Israeli civilian was killed and a 33-year-old motorist was injured in a shooting attack near the Palestinian town of Tubas in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military referred to the attackers as 'terrorists', a term they often use when referring to Palestinian attackers. The motorist was evacuated by helicopter with a gunshot wound to his lower extremities, while the second victim died while being treated. The attack occurred at 15:28 local time (12:28 GMT) and the Israeli police launched a search and capture operation, closing several roads. The occupied West Bank has seen its highest level of violence since the Second Intifada (2000-05). So far this year, nearly 280 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, mostly suspected militants or attackers, but also civilians, including around 50 minors, according to EFE's count. From the Israeli side, 21 people have died in 2024: 11 uniformed personnel and 10 civilians. Following the Hamas attack on October 7, the Israeli military intensified its incursions into the occupied West Bank, resulting in over 600 Palestinian deaths in violent incidents with Israel - including at least 145 minors - mainly against troops and a dozen at the hands of settlers.

**Israel weighs retaliation against Hezbollah after deadly Golan Heights attack**
Israel is considering retaliating against Hezbollah after a deadly attack in the Golan Heights, which killed 12 children and teenagers and wounded 29. The attack has escalated the conflict, which has been ongoing since October 2023, and has left 160,000 people displaced and 527 dead in Lebanon and 46 dead in Israel. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack, with some suggesting it was caused by a malfunction of the Israeli Iron Dome system. The Israeli government has identified the Iranian-made missile and named a Hezbollah commander responsible for the attack. The situation remains tense, with flights to Beirut's international airport canceled or delayed, and the Israeli army acknowledging that civilian casualties in Israel were inevitable.

**Israel Suffers Deadliest Attack Since 2000**
At least 11 children and young people died in a rocket attack on a football field in the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel. The Israeli army blamed Hezbollah, a Lebanese group backed by Iran, for the attack, but Hezbollah denied responsibility.

The Israeli army said it was the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since October 7, when Hamas killed over 1,200 people in southern Israel and kidnapped around 250. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah would pay a 'high price' for the attack and that Israel would not leave it without a response. President Isaac Herzog said the terrorists 'brutally killed children who were only playing football. They never returned'. The attack has caused widespread destruction and many injuries.

**Netanyahu Warns Hizbulah Will 'Pay a High Price' After Deadly Attack on Israeli Children**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that the Lebanese militia 'will pay a high price' after the death of 11 children who were killed on Saturday when a projectile hit a football field, fired from Lebanon, in the city of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights. This was the main message Netanyahu wanted to convey to the head of the Druze community in Israel, Muafak Tarif, during their conversation. 'On behalf of the entire nation of Israel, I transmit my condolences to the families of the deceased and to the entire Druze community', added the Israeli leader. Tarif stated that the attack on Saturday represents 'the constant reality' of communities in northern Israel bordering the Lebanese border and that Hizbulah 'crossed all possible red lines'. 'It is impossible to imagine and describe the horror scenes of the children and their bodies scattered on the grass', lamented. The Israeli Army spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, reiterated in a statement that the group is responsible for this attack, despite the group's official channels denying it. 'Hizbulah lied to the entire world and claimed they did not carry out this attack. This is a lie', Hagari concluded. Israel confirmed that over 40 projectiles arrived in northern Israel on Saturday, most of which were intercepted. However, around 18:19 local time, a rocket hit a football field, killing over 100 children and leaving 30 people injured. 'This is the deadliest attack against Israeli civilians since October 7', Hagari indicated. This latest episode escalates the tension on the border between Israel and Lebanon, where there has been a daily exchange of fire since October 8, never before seen between Netanyahu's government and the Lebanese militia. A total war between the two sides could now be closer.
