**Democratic Stronghold Suddenly Becomes a Battleground State as Trump Takes Lead in 'Poll Shocker'**
A new poll in New Hampshire has shown former President Donald Trump holding a narrow lead over Vice President Kamala Harris, a 'poll shocker' that has significant implications for the 2024 presidential election. According to the NH Journal/Praecones Analytica poll, Trump is ahead of Harris by less than half a percentage point (50.2-49.8). This shift in the Granite State, which Biden won by more than seven percentage points in 2020, suggests that Trump could expand the electoral map beyond anticipated swing states. Similar trends are seen in other deep-blue states, such as New York, Virginia, and New Mexico, where Trump has gained support among Hispanic and Latino voters. 'There's a reason Kamala Harris has been spending money in New Hampshire. She's on defense and knows President Trump is on the path to victory,' said Trump national campaign spokewoman Karoline Leavitt. Trump has scheduled rallies in these states, including a mega-rally at New York City's Madison Square Garden and a rally in Salem, Virginia, on November 2.

**Nolte: Battlefield Expands as Trump Takes Lead in New Hampshire Poll**
A new poll in New Hampshire shows former President Donald Trump leading incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris by a slim margin of 50.2 to 49.8 percent. This is a significant shift from a week ago when Harris was considered safe in the state. The poll also shows Republican Kelly Ayotte leading Democrat Joyce Craig in the governor's race. The issue of biological men competing in women's sports appears to be galvanizing New Hampshire voters, with 54 percent saying they are less likely to vote for someone who supports it. Trump's campaign is expanding its efforts, looking to hold events and move resources into Virginia, New Mexico, and Minnesota, states that have been difficult for Republicans to win in recent years. Trump has already announced rallies in Virginia and New Mexico, and may stay out of New Hampshire to avoid energizing the Democrat base against himself and Ayotte.

**Ex-MSNBC Analyst Alludes That New Hampshire and Virginia Could Be in Play?**
Ex-MSNBC analyst Mark Halperin suggests that New Hampshire and Virginia could be in play for Republicans, citing private polling data that shows Kamala Harris at risk of losing these swing states. Halperin notes that early voting totals are surging for Republicans, but warns that this doesn't necessarily mean Trump will take these states. However, the fact that Trump is actively campaigning in these Democratic bastions is a concern for Harris, who has struggled to gain momentum in the final weeks of the election. Halperin says, 'I'm not predicting Trump will win a landslide. I'm not rooting for Trump winning a landslide. But there's a school of thought that says, Trump's going to go to Albuquerque to try to win New Mexico. He's going to go to St. Paul to try to win Minnesota. He's going to go to, I don't know, Richmond to try to win Virginia. And then he's going to go to New Hampshire.' Halperin also notes that the Trump campaign is doing last-minute hiring for door knocking, which could be a sign that they are taking these states seriously.

**Exclusive — James Blair: A ‘Surprise’ Win in a Blue State ‘Possible’ for Trump**
James Blair, the political operations director for the Trump campaign, believes a 'surprise' win for former President Donald Trump in a traditionally blue state is 'possible' this election cycle. Blair pointed to Virginia, New Mexico, Minnesota, New York, and New Jersey as potential states where Trump could win. He cited strong early voting performance for Republicans in Virginia and a recent poll in New Hampshire that oversampled Democrats. Blair also mentioned a 'Tim Walz problem' in Minnesota, where Trump could potentially win due to momentum building against Kamala Harris. While the bulk of their attention is on the seven main battleground states, the Trump campaign is still watching these other states and believes that if they can keep closing strongly, it's possible that some of these other states could move in their favor in the final days.

**Infographic: Harris With Razorthin Lead in Battleground States**
As of September 10, 2024, polling averages show a razor-thin lead for Kamala Harris in battleground states ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Harris led her opponent, former President Donald Trump, by 0.2 percentage points, carrying Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan. However, Trump was ahead in Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona. Pennsylvania was rated as a tie, which is significant due to its 19 electoral votes. Harris led in states with 21 electoral votes, while Trump led in states with 43 electoral votes. According to the source, Harris has 208 potential electoral votes, while Trump has 219. Harris would need to carry more battleground votes, including additional votes from Virginia, New Hampshire, and Nebraska's second district. Trump has a higher number of electoral votes from states leaning Republican, including 70 from Florida and Texas. Harris has 17 electoral college votes from Maine, Minnesota, and New Mexico, while 93 votes are considered safe for Trump and 139 for Harris.

**RealClearPolitics: 2024 Election Doomsday Scenario**
On the RealClearPolitics radio show, the hosts discussed the possible outcomes of the 2024 election, including a scenario where Trump wins the popular vote but loses in the Electoral College. Carl Cannon explained that if Kamala Harris carries California and New York by a significant margin, it would be hard for Trump to make up the difference and lose the Electoral College. However, if Trump wins the popular vote, some other states like New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Minnesota might vote for him, leading to an Electoral College landslide. Tom Bevan discussed four possible outcomes: Trump ahead in polls and wins, Harris ahead in polls and wins, Harris ahead in polls but Trump wins due to undercounting, and Trump ahead in polls but Harris wins, which Bevan described as a 'doomsday scenario' that could lead to a constitutional crisis.

**Swing-state scorecard: Harris and Trump in nail-biter race with one week until election**
The 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is a close contest, with neither candidate able to move out of the margin of error in several polls. The New York Times/Siena College poll shows the two candidates deadlocked at 48% each, while a Wall Street Journal national poll shows Trump narrowly leading Harris, 47% to 45%. Harris and Trump are spending the final week before the election hitting battleground states, with Harris visiting Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Trump plans to campaign in New Mexico and Virginia, and has touted his campaign's efforts in Colorado. According to the Washington Examiner's reranked battleground states, Georgia is Trump's strongest state, while Harris has a slim lead in Michigan. Harris has also been visiting key cities in Pennsylvania and Nevada, and has been courting Latino and African American voters in Philadelphia. 'Philadelphia is a very important part of our path to victory,' Harris told reporters. 'And it is the reason I'm spending time here but I'm feeling very optimistic about the enthusiasm that's here and the commitment from folks of every background.'

**Key States to Watch in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a few key states, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump vying for the top spot. The election will be won by the candidate who secures at least 270 electoral votes. Harris has a strong lead in several key states, including Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, while Trump is favored in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The election will also be influenced by the growing Latino population in these states, with many voters identifying as Hispanic or Latino. The candidates have focused on issues such as immigration, the economy, and healthcare, with Harris promising to protect the rights of undocumented immigrants and Trump vowing to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. The election will be closely watched, with many analysts predicting a close contest between the two candidates.

**Paths to victory for Harris and Trump in 2024**
The 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is a close contest, with both candidates having different paths to victory. According to simulations, Harris is heading into the election with 226 electoral votes from traditional blue states, while Trump has 219 electoral votes from traditional red states. The two candidates will battle for 93 electoral votes in seven battleground states, with Pennsylvania being the top battleground. Trump's easiest path to winning involves winning Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia, along with one electoral vote in Maine, while Harris's best path is to win all three 'blue wall' states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, plus one electoral vote in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District. However, both candidates have alternative routes to winning, including scenarios where they win without Pennsylvania.

**Nolte: Battlefield Expands as Trump Takes Lead in New Hampshire Poll**
A new poll by the New Hampshire Journal and Praecones Analytica shows former President Donald Trump leading incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris in New Hampshire, a state previously considered safely in Harris's column. Trump's 50.2 to 49.8 percent lead is within the margin of error. The poll also shows Republican Kelly Ayotte leading Democrat Joyce Craig in the governor's race and Democrats with a slim preference in the generic ballot. New Hampshire voters are galvanized by the issue of biological men competing in women's sports, with 54 percent saying they are less likely to vote for someone who supports this. Trump's campaign is looking to expand its battlefield in New Hampshire and is considering holding events or moving resources into Virginia, New Mexico, and Minnesota, states that have not been won by a Republican in recent years.

**Panelist Tells Mark Halperin He Will 'Not Be Stunned' If Trump Narrowly Wins State GOP Hasn't Won Decades**
Radio personality Michael Graham said he would 'not be stunned' if Donald Trump narrowly wins New Hampshire in the 2024 election. Graham cited a New Hampshire Journal/Praecones Analytica poll showing Trump with a 50.2% to 49.8% lead over Vice President Kamala Harris. Graham noted that New Hampshire is the one state in New England that may fare positively for Republicans, as enough voters may turn out to vote for Trump. He also mentioned that 'subterranean' issues, including transgender athlete participation in women's sports, are having a major effect on voters in New Hampshire and may help Trump in November. Former Trump-era White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he has talked to many New Englanders who are now backing Trump because they are 'pissed off' by the status quo.

Trump's best path involves winning Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia, along with one electoral vote in Maine. 'If Harris pulls off that feat, she could lose every other battleground state and still win the White House,' according to the Washington Examiner. However, Trump's path to winning all three 'blue wall' states could be difficult due to tight polling margins.

**NEW: More States in Play for Trump? Look at What's Happening in Two More 'Safe' Blue States**
Former President Donald Trump is leading in battleground states and the national popular vote, according to RealClearPolitics. He has had successful campaign moves, such as his McDonald's job interview, his podcast appearances, and a rally in New York City that drew tens of thousands of people. Meanwhile, the Kamala Harris campaign is struggling, with her rally in Houston being a 'huge dud' and her team being 'losing their minds.' There are now questions about states that should be safe, including New Hampshire, where a new poll has Trump up by 0.4, and New Mexico, where Harris is only up by three points. Internal polls show the race in New Mexico to be nearly neck-and-neck, thanks in part to RFK Jr.'s support. Mark Halperin predicted that Trump will win New Mexico and do a rally there before Election Day, which is now confirmed. If New Mexico goes for Trump, it could be a landslide.

**Shock Poll Shows Trump Leading in a Blue State**
A recent poll by the New Hampshire Journal/Praecones Analytica shows Donald Trump narrowly leading Kamala Harris in the Granite State, with a 50.2 to 49.8 percent lead. This is significant, as Trump has lost the state twice before and Democrats have carried it in seven of the last eight presidential races. The poll is not the only one showing New Hampshire as a close contest, with an Emerson College poll indicating Trump was only trailing Harris by three points. Trump's neck-and-neck polling with Harris in New Hampshire adds fuel to the narrative that his campaign is gaining momentum going into the last week of the campaign. Former Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said, 'The interesting thing that is going unreported right now is the shift in the dynamic. We have seen a shift, and now Minnesota, New Hampshire, Virginia, New Mexico, and potentially Nebraska [Second Congressional District] are all back in play in a way we wouldn’t have been talking about four weeks ago.' Spicer added, 'Look at the data. Look at what is happening in each of these states. They are all trending in Trump’s direction.'

**POLL SHOCKER: Trump Leads Harris in New Hampshire**
A new New Hampshire Journal/Praecones Analytica poll finds Donald Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris in the Granite State by a slim 50.2 to 49.8 percent margin. Trump's campaign is gaining momentum, and the former president is scheduled to appear in both New Mexico and Virginia in the final days of the campaign. Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national campaign spokesperson, said, 'There's a reason Kamala Harris has been spending money in New Hampshire. She's on defense and knows President Trump is on the path to victory.' Trump's lead in New Hampshire adds fuel to the narrative that his campaign is gaining momentum going into the last week of the campaign. In the race for governor, Ayotte continues to hold a modest but steady lead over Democrat Joyce Craig. Ayotte has repeatedly said throughout the campaign she supports the state's current abortion law and would veto any bill to restrict abortion further. She's made Craig's record on taxes the top issue; in particular, Craig's proposal to bring back the income tax on interest and deductions.

**Harris, Trump barnstorm battleground states with starkly different pitches to close out the race**
As the 2024 presidential race enters its final week, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are making their closing pitches to voters in battleground states. Harris is focusing on abortion rights and warning about Trump's threat to American democracy, while Trump is emphasizing the economy and immigration. According to a Gallup poll, voters' top issues are the economy, democracy in the U.S., terrorism or national security, Supreme Court justices, and immigration. Harris has events scheduled in Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona, while Trump has rallies planned in Atlanta, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Virginia, and New Mexico. A New York Times/Sienna College national survey shows the race is a tie at 48% for the popular vote. Harris has kept President Biden at arm's length and does not plan to appear with him before Election Day, instead campaigning with celebrities like Beyoncé and Bruce Springsteen.

**US Presidential Election: Trump and Harris in a Dead Heat**
With the US presidential election just around the corner, polls are showing a tight race between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. According to a survey by The New York Times, Harris is leading with 49% of the vote, while Trump trails behind with 48%. However, the margin of error means that the election could be a tie. In the key battleground states, four are leaning towards Harris, while three are leaning towards Trump. Harris is also leading in Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Virginia by 6 points, while Trump is leading in Texas, Florida, and Ohio. The survey predicts that Harris would win 276 electoral votes, surpassing the majority of 270 and leading Trump, who would receive 262 votes. However, these numbers could change, and the outcome of the election is still uncertain.

**US Election: Harris and Trump in a Dead Heat, According to Latest Poll**
A recent national poll conducted by The New York Times (NYT) and Siena College has revealed a tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald J. Trump in the upcoming US elections, with both candidates receiving 48% of the vote. According to the NYT analysis, this result is not favorable for Harris, as historically, Democrats have maintained a lead in the popular vote even when losing the Electoral College. The party had expected Harris to build a strong national lead as an indicator of a good performance in key states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Despite three months of turmoil in recent US politics, including a high-profile debate, two attacks on Trump, numerous rallies in seven states, and hundreds of millions of dollars invested in advertising, the contest has remained surprisingly stable. For Trump, immigration has emerged as a strong point, with 15% of respondents citing it as their top concern, a 3% increase from the previous poll. Trump maintains an 11-point lead over Harris on this issue, after promising to carry out 'the largest deportation in US history'. Harris, on the other hand, maintains a significant 16-point lead on the issue of access to abortion, a key pillar of her campaign to attract female voters. Additionally, Democrats lead among undecided voters (15% of the electorate) with 42% of the vote, compared to Trump's 32%, a notable improvement from two weeks ago when Trump had a slight lead in this group. The Electoral College map, according to projections by RealClearPolitics (RCP), reflects a deeply divided nation. Trump/Vance maintains a slight lead with 219 electoral votes, compared to Harris/Walz's 215; while 104 votes remain in dispute in key states. The Democratic formula Harris/Walz has a solid backing in traditionally blue states, including Colorado (10), Illinois (19), New Jersey (14), and Oregon (8), which add up to 52 electoral votes. They also maintain a narrower but significant lead in Maine (2), New Hampshire (4), New Mexico (5), and Virginia (13). On the other hand, Trump/Vance dominates the landscape in the south and center of the country, with Florida (30), Ohio (17), and Texas (40) leaning towards the Republican side; while states like Alaska (3), Iowa (6), Kansas (6), Missouri (10), Montana (4), and South Carolina (9) remain as solid conservative territories. The real battle will be fought in nine disputed states, totaling 104 crucial electoral votes: Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Minnesota (10), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), Pennsylvania (19), Wisconsin (10), and the second district of Nebraska (1).

**US Presidential Election 2024: What To Expect In New Mexico On Polling Day - News18**
In the 2024 US Presidential Election, New Mexico will be a key battleground state, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican former President Donald Trump, and five third-party candidates competing for the state's five electoral votes. However, the most competitive race on the ballot will likely be a U.S. House race between Democratic Rep. Gabriel Vasquez and Republican former Rep. Yvette Herrell, which could determine control of the narrowly divided chamber. Historically, Democratic presidential candidates have won most of the state's largest counties, while Republicans tend to do well in the east of the state bordering Texas. More than 60% of New Mexicans typically vote before Election Day, and a 2023 law requires counties to post early and absentee results no later than 11 p.m. ET. 'If a race hasn't been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, like candidate concessions or declarations of victory,' said the Associated Press. 'In doing so, the AP will make clear it hasn't declared a winner and explain why.'

**AP Decision Notes: What to expect in New Mexico on Election Day - WTOP News**
In the 2024 New Mexico election, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican former President Donald Trump, and five third-party candidates will compete for the state's five electoral votes. However, the most competitive race will likely be the U.S. House race in the 2nd Congressional District, where Democratic Rep. Gabriel Vasquez is seeking a second term against Republican former Rep. Yvette Herrell. Immigration has been a major issue in the district, which spans the state's entire border with Mexico. A Herrell victory would complicate Democratic hopes to retake the House. In the U.S. Senate, Democratic incumbent Martin Heinrich is seeking a third term against Republican Nella Domenici. More than 60% of New Mexicans typically vote before Election Day, and a 2023 law requires counties to post early and absentee results no later than 11 p.m. ET. The Associated Press will not make projections and will declare a winner only when it has determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap.

**Trump, Harris remain locked in a statistical tie nationally, across key swing states**
With less than 500 hours remaining in the 2024 presidential election, polling shows Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in a statistical tie nationally and across key swing states. According to polling aggregators 538 and RealClearPolitics, the candidates are separated by less than three points in an average of recent polls. A Fox News poll found Trump leading 50% to 48%, while a Harvard/Harris poll had Harris ahead 51% to 49%. Mark Penn, Co-Director of the Harvard Center for American Political Studies, said, 'There is no definitive answer' on who will win on November 5. 'It's about as close a race as you can possibly get, well within the confidence interval of any poll.' The candidates are also running neck-and-neck in key swing states such as North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona. According to University of New Hampshire political scientist Dante Scala, the election may hinge on Pennsylvania and a few other up-for-grab territories. 'If anything, I think the number of swing states has shrunk since 2020,' he said. 'Whoever grabs Pennsylvania has a much easier path to victory.'

**Exclusive — James Blair: A ‘Surprise’ Win in a Blue State ‘Possible’ for Trump**
James Blair, the political operations director for the Trump campaign, believes a 'surprise' win for former President Donald Trump in a traditionally blue state is 'possible' this election cycle. Blair pointed to Virginia, New Mexico, Minnesota, New York, and New Jersey as potential states where Trump could win. He cited strong early voting performance for Republicans in Virginia and a recent poll in New Hampshire that oversampled Democrats. Blair also mentioned a 'Tim Walz problem' in Minnesota, where Trump could potentially win due to momentum building against Kamala Harris. While the bulk of their attention is on the seven main battleground states, the Trump campaign is still watching these other states and believes that if they can keep closing strongly, it's possible that some of these other states could move in their favor in the final days.

**Michael Moore Predicts Kamala Harris Will Win 2024 US Election**
Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, who accurately predicted the outcome of the 2016 US election, believes that Donald Trump has 'no chance' of winning again in 2024. In a recent article on Substack, Moore wrote, 'The majority of the country, normal people, have seen enough. Kamala Harris has brought a fast and explosive momentum, unlike anything seen in decades.' Moore predicts that Harris will win the Electoral College with 270 votes to 268. According to his prediction, Harris will win most of the traditionally competitive states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire.

**US Presidential Election: Uncertainty and Possible Scenarios**
The upcoming US presidential election is uncertain, with polls showing a narrow lead for Kamala Harris in the popular vote, but a possible loss in the Electoral College. According to analysts, the election will be decided in 7 swing states: Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania is considered key, with 19 electoral votes. Currently, Harris is leading in 4 of the 7 states, but the margin is within the margin of error. Experts also believe that the pro-Trump vote is underestimated by 4 points. As a result, neither candidate has a solid advantage, and the election is expected to be closely contested, with potential legal conflicts that may not be resolved until December 10. In terms of the Senate elections, it is possible that the Republicans will regain the majority by winning 2 new seats in West Virginia and Montana. However, there are closely contested elections in Florida, Texas, Ohio, and Arizona, where a Mexican-American candidate, Rubén Gallego, is running for a seat. The polls on the House of Representatives indicate that either party can gain control, and there is a shift in voting trends among African Americans and Hispanics, although the latter group's vote is diverse, with Cuban Americans voting Republican and Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans voting Democratic. The uncertainty requires considering different scenarios for the US government that Mexico will negotiate with from 2024 to 2028. These scenarios include a government controlled by Trumpism and the Republican Party, a government controlled by the Democrats, and divided governments with the executive of one party and the Congress of another, which could lead to paralysis. However, there is a trend towards convergence on key issues for Mexico, including a shift towards more conservative positions on migration and border security, and a strengthening of protectionist approaches to trade and investment.

**Harris might be gaining ground in Maine's key electoral district, threatening Trump's path to White House - The Boston Globe**
The 2024 presidential election may see a shift in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, where Donald Trump won a single electoral vote in 2020. A recent University of New Hampshire poll shows Kamala Harris leading in the district, 49% to 44%. Maine Democratic Party Chair Bev Uhlenhake said, 'We've always thought we had a chance to flip the district, but there's no question that there's renewed energy since Kamala Harris began leading the ticket.' Republicans, however, seem to be taking the district for granted. If Harris were to win the district, it could close one of Trump's paths back to the White House. Maine's ranked-choice voting system may re-tally votes in Augusta if neither candidate secures a majority in the district on Election Day.

**Harris might be gaining ground in Maine's key electoral district, threatening Trump's path to White House**
The shift from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket has brought enthusiasm and a significant bump in polling, positioning Democrats in a dead heat nationally and in key swing states. However, the path to 270 electoral votes and the presidency still hinges on who can win seven key battleground states. In Maine's 2nd Congressional District, a crucial electoral vote, Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to flip the district, which awarded Trump a lone electoral vote in both 2016 and 2020. A University of New Hampshire poll showed Harris leading in the district, 49% to 44%, with a margin of error of 3.1%. Maine Democratic Party Chair Bev Uhlenhake said, 'We've always thought we had a chance to flip the district, but there's no question that there's renewed energy since Kamala Harris began leading the ticket.' The Harris campaign has 21 offices in the state and dozens of staffers, particularly in the 2nd District, while Trump has just one office in the state. If Harris wins the district, it could close one of Trump's paths back to the White House.

**Trump STILL Has the High Hand in this Poker Game**
The 2024 presidential election is a high-stakes poker game between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Trump has a strong hand with a likely win in Pennsylvania, giving him a commanding position. Kamala has secured states totaling 251 electoral votes, but needs the right community cards to improve her standing. She needs to 'draw' two more key states from the following to reach the winning number of 270 electoral votes: North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Maine's 2nd Congressional District, Florida, Texas, Ohio, Iowa, Alaska. Trump's early advantage puts Kamala in a position where she must play aggressively to win. Both players must read the table, anticipate their opponent's moves, and decide when to hold or fold.

Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has requested a second debate, but Donald Trump expressed uncertainty about participating. In Delaware, state Sen. Sarah McBride won a congressional primary and is on track to become the first transgender member of Congress. In New Hampshire, former Sen.

The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that an amendment to enshrine abortion access in the state's constitution can appear on the general election ballot. In North Carolina, a poll found Democratic state Attorney General Josh Stein leading Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson by 14 points. Elon Musk's promotion of misleading election claims has raised concerns among election officials.

**Infographic: Harris With Razorthin Lead in Battleground States**
As of September 10, 2024, polling averages show a razor-thin lead for Kamala Harris in battleground states ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Harris led her opponent, former President Donald Trump, by 0.2 percentage points, carrying Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan. However, Trump was ahead in Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona. Pennsylvania was rated as a tie, which is significant due to its 19 electoral votes. Harris led in states with 21 electoral votes, while Trump led in states with 43 electoral votes. According to the source, Harris has 208 potential electoral votes, while Trump has 219. Harris would need to carry more battleground votes, including additional votes from Virginia, New Hampshire, and Nebraska's second district. Trump has a higher number of electoral votes from states leaning Republican, including 70 from Florida and Texas. Harris has 17 electoral college votes from Maine, Minnesota, and New Mexico, while 93 votes are considered safe for Trump and 139 for Harris.

**Harris v. Trump: Handicapping the 2024 Presidential Election**
The 2024 presidential election has seen significant changes since the last assessment, with Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee now often edging Donald Trump by a few points in national polls. However, the electoral college will ultimately decide the outcome, with a handful of battleground states determining the winner. Our assessment, based on reporting with state and national political observers, has shifted North Carolina from Lean Republican to Toss-up, as Harris has erased Trump's modest polling lead in the state. Harris has also improved her standing in other battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, and has modestly improved the Democrats' position in three northern battleground states - Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The pivotal Toss-up category contains 94 electoral votes, with 225 electoral votes leaning to the Democrats and 219 electoral votes leaning to the Republicans. We've also shifted three Democratic-leaning states back out of the competitive realm, including Virginia, Minnesota, and New Hampshire, which are now considered Likely Democratic.

**US Presidential Election: Critical States to Determine Outcome**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, and the outcome will be determined by the results in the 'critical states' of Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia.

In Wisconsin, Michigan, and Nevada, Harris is ahead of Trump, while in North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona, Trump is leading. In Pennsylvania, the situation is balanced.

**US Presidential Election: Critical States to Decide the Outcome**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be decided by the results in seven critical states: Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. According to recent polls, the situation in these states is balanced. The 'critical states' are so named because of the importance they hold in determining the outcome of the presidential election. In the US, voters do not directly elect the president, but rather the delegates who will choose the president. The number of delegates from each state is equal to the total number of members in the state's congressional delegation. The president is elected by the candidate who wins the majority of the delegates, which is 270 out of a total of 538. The critical states are those where the balance between the two parties is close, and a single vote can make a difference. In the current polls, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck and neck in the critical states. In Wisconsin, Michigan, and Nevada, Harris is ahead of Trump, while in North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona, Trump is leading. In Pennsylvania, the situation is balanced. According to Real Clear Politics, a platform that publishes election polls, Harris has 48.4% of the vote, while Trump has 47.2%. In the critical states, the situation is as follows: North Carolina: Trump 47.9%, Harris 47.8%; Georgia: Trump 48.3%, Harris 48%; Arizona: Trump 48.4%, Harris 46.8%; Wisconsin: Trump 47.2%, Harris 48.7%; Michigan: Trump 47.1%, Harris 48.3%; Nevada: Trump 47.4%, Harris 48%; Pennsylvania: Trump 47.6%, Harris 47.6%.

**Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a Technical Tie Ahead of Debate**
The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be one of the closest in modern history, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a technical tie. Harris leads in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and only needs to win Maine or Nebraska to secure the election, while Trump is ahead in Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia, where the African American vote could make a difference. According to recent national polls and surveys in the 7 key states, the margin between the two candidates is minimal, with Harris leading by 1 point (48-47%) nationally, but within the margin of error. Trump's campaign is focusing on winning Georgia, where he only leads by 2 points, and where the African American vote could be decisive. The election is expected to be decided by a relatively small number of undecided voters, around 10%, in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. Harris has been gaining momentum in recent weeks, particularly among young people, people of color, and suburban women who support abortion rights. Trump's campaign has adopted a return to his 2016 playbook, with a focus on large rallies, aggressive social media presence, and direct attacks on Harris's record and Biden's administration.

**Could the 2024 presidential election hinge on Maine? It's possible.**
The 2024 presidential election may hinge on Maine, particularly the 2nd Congressional District, which has one electoral vote. If Republican candidate Donald Trump holds Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia, and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris wins the other states, the lone vote in Maine's 2nd District could be the deciding factor. However, analysts and experts, including David Wasserman and Andrew Smith, do not think this scenario is likely. Maine has not been a major focus of the presidential campaigns, and there has been little polling in the state. The University of New Hampshire Survey Center polled 821 Mainers and found Harris leading by 55-38 statewide and 49-44 in the 2nd District. Dan Shea, a professor of government at Colby College, said the 2nd District in Maine and Nebraska's 2nd District are the two swing single districts that could be very important. Marc Short, former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, also mentioned the importance of Maine's 2nd district in deciding the election. Maine's Legislature is controlled by Democrats, and there is a chance that they may make a change to the electoral system to offset any impact from Nebraska's potential change. Additionally, Maine has joined the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which pledges to award electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote nationwide.

**Trump campaign shifts target states amid surge for Harris**
Donald Trump's presidential campaign is reportedly shifting focus from three states he was previously expected to win - New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Virginia - to the 'blue wall' states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The change in strategy comes after the entry of Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate, with polls showing a tightening race in Pennsylvania, where Harris and Trump are tied at 47%. Franklin & Marshall College Poll director Berwood Yost said, 'obviously Pennsylvania's the biggest prize.' Harris will visit Pennsylvania again on Friday, her 10th visit this year. Republicans are also putting more effort into North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada, where polls had Trump significantly ahead until Harris's election entry whittled away his lead. Harris has focused on Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania since President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid and endorsed her. She has also frequently visited Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia, all won narrowly by Biden in 2020, and North Carolina, which she hopes to flip from Trump. 'We have new staff, offices, and volunteers weekly – with more enthusiasm, energy, and support from people and states Democrats take for granted,' Trump campaign battleground states director Rachel Reisner said. However, the campaign argues it can still win in Virginia, despite recent polls showing Harris building a consistent lead. Eric Trump said last month, 'I think there's a very good chance my father wins Virginia. I truly believe that we're going to win the state.'

**Kamala Harris campaigned in New Hampshire. Is it a battleground?**
Vice President Kamala Harris visited New Hampshire, a state that has not been considered a battleground in the 2024 presidential election. However, Harris' visit and her lead in the polls by 7 points suggest that the state may be worth competing for. University of New Hampshire professor Andrew Smith said that if Joe Biden were still the nominee, New Hampshire would be a more competitive race. Harris' visit has brought energy and enthusiasm to the state, with some voters feeling that the state has been taken for granted in the past. However, there is still a sense of urgency and fear among Harris' supporters, who remember the close race in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won by only 3,000 votes.

Vice President Kamala Harris visited New Hampshire, a state that has not been a major focus of the 2024 presidential campaign, with just over sixty days to go before Election Day. Harris' visit marked her first trip to the state since 2021, and she was met with cheering supporters and a sense of relief from Democrats in the state. According to University of New Hampshire political science professor Andrew Smith, New Hampshire is not a competitive state in 2024, with Harris leading in the polls by an average of seven points. However, the state has a deeply purple history and could elect a Republican governor in November, even if Harris wins. Harris' visit was seen as a sign that she is not taking the state for granted, and some experts believe that if Al Gore had put more effort into winning New Hampshire in 2000, he would have been president. New Hampshire voters expressed appreciation for the state not being taken for granted and a sense of enthusiasm for Harris' campaign. However, there are still hardcore Trump supporters in the state, and several protesters showed up to support the GOP nominee outside Harris' event.

**Harris pitches tax plan in New Hampshire, as Trump insists he is still fighting for the potential swing state - The Boston Globe**
Kamala Harris visited New Hampshire, her first visit since becoming the Democratic nominee for president. She pitched her new tax plan, which aims to help small businesses by allowing them to deduct up to $50,000 in start-up expenses. Harris also emphasized the importance of the state in the upcoming election, saying 'This race is gonna be tight until the very end.' Despite recent polls looking good for Harris, Trump has insisted that his campaign will compete in New Hampshire, saying 'It's a very important place in terms of winning this election.' Supporters of Harris expressed confidence that the state will go for the Democrats, but also acknowledged that things can change at the last minute. Harris's economic message has been a focus of her campaign, and her new plan is part of a modest package of policy announcements she has made since securing the nomination.

**Kamala Harris Scrambling to Defend Blue States**
The Kamala Harris campaign is shifting its focus to blue states after a weekend of planned swing state visits. Harris and her top surrogates, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and husband Doug Emhoff, will visit states such as New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Virginia. In New Hampshire, Harris will reportedly visit for a campaign event, where she had a four-point advantage before the convention, according to an Emerson College/WHDH survey. However, Trump has cut Harris's lead in Minnesota from ten to five points since Walz joined the ticket, according to two KTSP/SurveyUSA polls. Emhoff will also visit Virginia for a fundraising trip, a state where Trump has polled unexpectedly strong in the 2024 cycle. 'The campaign is sending Harris and her top surrogates to blue states after a weekend of planned swing state visits,' according to the article. This move suggests that the campaign is concerned about the recent polling trends in these states.

**Is Kamala Worried About Losing Another Blue State?**
Two recent polls in Virginia have shown a tight race between Kamala Harris and Trump, with Harris leading by just three points. This has raised concerns that another traditionally blue state, New Hampshire, may also be in play for Trump. According to local media, Kamala Harris will be holding a campaign event in New Hampshire on Wednesday, which could indicate that the state is still a target for her campaign. As WMUR reports, 'New Hampshire may not be in the top tier of swing states in the 2024 election, but Granite Staters are still poised to get some attention this week from one of the presidential candidates.'
