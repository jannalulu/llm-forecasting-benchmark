**San Luis Potosí Reports No Cases of Mpox Clade I Variant**
The National Epidemiological Surveillance Committee (CONAVE) in Mexico has issued an epidemiological alert regarding the Mpox clade I variant. The Secretary of Health in San Luis Potosí, Ymuri Vaca Avila, stated that the goal is to have medical units across the country monitor and report probable cases to reduce the spread of the disease and provide timely medical attention to those infected. According to Avila, there have been no cases of the Mpox clade I variant in San Luis Potosí this year, and only 10 cases were reported in 2022 and 5 in 2023. The symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and skin lesions, which can appear on the face, hands, and other parts of the body. To confirm a case, a positive result from a real-time PCR test or identification of samples analyzed by the Mexican Institute of Public Health (InDRE) is required. Avila recommended that the population frequently wash their hands, cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoid sharing food and drinks, and use face masks when near an infected person. She also advised to clean and disinfect areas where an infected person has been, avoid close contact, and properly dispose of contaminated items.

**Mexico's Mpox Cases: A Growing Concern**
As of 2024, there have been 49 confirmed cases of mpox (monkeypox) in Mexico, with none of the new clade 1 or clade 1b strain, but rather clade II. Of these 49 cases, 47 are men and 2 are women. The 49 confirmed cases of mpox were derived from 212 suspected cases. The 11 states with mpox cases are led by Mexico City, which accounts for over 50% of the cases, followed by Quintana Roo and Jalisco. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) was declared on August 14, 2024. The Mexican Ministry of Health recommends reporting suspected cases to 5519469772 or censida@salud.gob.mx. The ministry also explained the two phases of the disease, which can last from two to four weeks. The first phase includes symptoms such as fever, headache, and muscle pain. The second phase, which appears two to three days after the onset of symptoms, is characterized by the appearance of blisters on the face and then on the rest of the body. To prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to avoid contact with others, frequently wash hands, wear a mask, avoid sharing food and utensils, and disinfect areas where the infected person has been. Activists in Mexico are demanding the application of existing vaccines, but the federal government has ignored their requests, citing a 'mediocre' effect, despite other countries applying them to vulnerable groups.

**Mexico Issues Epidemiological Alert for Mpox, Confirms 49 Cases**
The Mexican Ministry of Health (Ssa) has issued an epidemiological alert for the mpox disease, also known as monkeypox, and has confirmed 49 cases in the country in 2024. This is in response to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation to declare a public health emergency of international concern due to the monkeypox outbreak. The National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (Conave) has issued the alert to request that medical units across the country monitor and report suspected cases. Conave stated that the goal of the alert is to reduce the chains of transmission and provide timely medical attention to infected individuals. As of August 3, the Epidemiological Surveillance System has identified 212 probable cases in 2024, with 49 confirmed cases distributed across 11 states. The only clade identified in the analyzed cases is clade II, and no new variant clade 1b has been detected. According to Conave, 'Our country has a Response Plan for the management of mpox that includes actions of national response coordination; community involvement, empowerment, and participation; diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, comprehensive care, and risk communication; the plan is updated according to the current requirements of the ESPII and is activated upon the epidemiological alert.' The committee also called on citizens to report suspected cases through the phone number 5519469772 or the email censida@salud.gob.mx. Mpox is a zoonosis, a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans, and is caused by the virus of the smallpox-like disease. According to the WHO and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the disease is primarily transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected animal blood, bodily fluids, skin lesions, or mucous membranes. Secondary transmission from person to person can occur through close contact with infected respiratory secretions, skin lesions, or objects that have recently come into contact with infected fluids or materials. Mpox can also be transmitted through inoculation or through the placenta, resulting in congenital smallpox, as stated by the WHO. Symptoms of mpox include a skin rash that can appear on hands, feet, face, mouth, chest, or near the genitals, which can progress through various stages, including scabs, before healing. In the initial stages, the rash may appear as pimples or blisters, causing pain and itching, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

**Querétaro Issues Health Alert for Mpox Virus**
The Secretariat of Health (SESA) of the state of Querétaro has issued a health alert regarding the mpox virus, previously known as monkeypox. According to the National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (CONAVE), the last confirmed case in the state of Querétaro was in February 2023, but ongoing epidemiological surveillance continues in first and second-level healthcare units. As of this date, no cases of the new clade 1b variant of mpox have been reported in the country. The CONAVE has issued a warning to medical units to vigilantly monitor and report probable cases to reduce the spread of the disease and provide timely medical attention to affected individuals. 'CONAVE reiterates the operational definitions of probable, confirmed, and discarded cases based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations. Additionally, it outlines the actions that healthcare personnel should take in healthcare units upon identifying a probable case,' said the SESA. The SESA also stated that Mexico has the mpox Surveillance System (SVE), which allows for the notification of probable cases through the National Epidemiological Surveillance System platform. Since January 1 and August 5, the SVE has identified 49 confirmed cases, distributed across 11 federal entities, all belonging to the clade II variant detected in 2022. The occurrence of mpox outbreaks, mainly in African countries with a different variant, increases the risk of incidence in Mexico. Furthermore, the African region is currently circulating a variant of the clade I, associated with sustained transmission and cases in a wider age range, including individuals under 15 years old. 'Therefore, the WHO has urged member states to remain vigilant in the possibility of introducing this variant in other regions of the world, including the Americas and the Caribbean. To detect cases promptly and reduce the spread of mpox in the country, the warning emphasizes the strict compliance with epidemiological surveillance actions according to the regulations and ensuring timely attention to affected individuals,' added the SESA. Mpox typically presents with two clinical periods, which usually resolve without complications within two to four weeks after symptom onset. The first phase, which develops within the first five days, is characterized by fever, intense headache, swollen lymph nodes, lower back pain, muscle pain, and a lack of desire to move or engage in physical activity. The second phase involves the appearance of small blisters, which begin one to three days after fever onset; this is followed by the different stages of rash, which initially affect the face and then spread to the rest of the body.'

**Mexico Prepares for Potential Monkeypox Outbreak, No Cases Reported**
Mexico has not reported any cases of the 'monkeypox' variant clado 1b, according to Ruy López Ridaura, the undersecretary of Prevention and Promotion of Health at the Ministry of Health. However, he emphasized that 'we are ready to detect its introduction.' As of August 5, 2024, Mexico's Epidemiological Surveillance System has identified 49 confirmed cases in the country, all belonging to the clado II variant, which has been detected since 2022. The new variant, considered emergent with high transmission and mortality rates, was detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a 'public health emergency of international concern' on August 14 due to the mpox outbreak. According to the Ministry of Health's statement, the response plan for mpox includes coordinated national actions, community participation, diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, comprehensive care, and risk communication, which is updated according to the current requirements of the Public Health Emergency of International Importance (PHEIC). The disease is caused by the simian poxvirus (MPXV), genetically related to the human smallpox virus, cowpox virus, and others. The agent has two genetic clades: I and II. When infected, patients experience two clinical periods, usually without complications, within two to four weeks of the first symptoms. The first phase, according to the Ministry of Health, develops within the first five days and presents fever, intense headache, swollen lymph nodes, lower back pain, muscle aches, and a lack of physical activity. Smallpox-like lesions then appear, typically on the face and later on the body. Recommendations for suspected cases include visiting a doctor, frequent handwashing with soap and water or antibacterial gel, covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, and wearing a medical mask. It is also recommended to avoid sharing food or personal items, washing clothing, towels, and bedding with soap and water, disinfecting spaces, and avoiding contact with lesions.

**Mexican Government Raises Alert Level for Mpox Cases in Africa**
The Mexican Federal Ministry of Health has raised the risk level for Mexican travelers due to the increase in mpox cases, also known as monkeypox, in several African countries. The affected countries include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, and Burundi. The concern is centered around the new variant of the virus, identified as clade I, as well as its subvariant clade Ib, which has shown a higher capacity for transmission and severity. The mpox virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with skin lesions or scabs, as well as mucous membranes of an infected person. It can also be transmitted through contact with blood, bodily fluids, contaminated clothing, and respiratory droplets, especially in contexts of sexual contact. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alert. This decision responds to the increase in cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries, where the clade I strain, considered the most dangerous and contagious, has surged. In response to this situation, the Mexican Federal Ministry of Health has urged travelers to take additional precautions before, during, and after their trips to reduce the risk of infection, as stated by the Ministry, 'the risk of contagion is higher than ever'.

**Mexico Raises Health Alert for Mpox as Global Cases Increase**
The Mexican Ministry of Health has raised the level of health alert from low to medium for Mexican travelers due to the increase in cases of mpox (monkeypox) in several countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, and Burundi. This measure responds to the recent identification of a new variant of the virus, clade I and its subvariant clade Ib, known to be more contagious and dangerous. Additionally, a recent case was confirmed in Thailand, generating global concern. The Ministry of Health advises travelers to follow strict preventive measures before, during, and after travel to avoid mpox infection, including avoiding close contact with people showing suspicious symptoms, wearing masks in crowded areas, and maintaining strict hygiene, such as frequent hand washing. The virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with skin lesions, bodily fluids, and respiratory droplets. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern, noting that the new strain has shown a more aggressive behavior, causing more widespread skin eruptions than previous variants. In Mexico, 53 cases of monkeypox have been reported as of August 10, with the highest concentration in Mexico City. Despite growing global concern, Mexican authorities claim that the situation in the country is under control. According to Mauricio Rodríguez Álvarez, a professor at the UNAM, there are no indications that mpox will become a serious public health problem in Mexico, although close monitoring will be maintained to prevent any possible outbreak.

**Mexican Ministry of Health Raises Alert Level for Mpox Due to Increased Cases in Africa**
The Mexican Ministry of Health has issued a preventive warning for Mexican travelers due to the increase in cases of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African countries, increasing the risk level from low to medium. The countries affected include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, and Burundi, where a new variant of the virus (clade I, clade Ib) has been identified, known to be more dangerous and contagious. The Ministry of Health advises travelers to adopt strict sanitary measures before, during, and after their trips to avoid infection. The mpox virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with skin lesions or mucous membranes of an infected person, as well as through contact with blood, bodily fluids, contaminated clothing, and respiratory droplets, especially in contexts of sexual contact. The symptoms of mpox include fever, headache, skin eruptions or lesions, muscle pain, back pain, and swollen lymph nodes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern due to the increase in cases, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries. The current circulating strain, clade I, is the most dangerous to date, with an estimated mortality rate of 3.6%. The Ministry of Health recommends that travelers avoid close contact with people showing suspicious symptoms, use masks in crowded areas, and maintain proper hygiene, including frequent handwashing. If symptoms develop during or after travel, immediate medical attention should be sought for a timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the international alert for mpox is in effect, the situation in Mexico is under control, according to Mauricio Rodríguez Álvarez, a professor at the UNAM's Department of Microbiology and Parasitology. Although 49 cases of the virus have been confirmed in 11 states of the country, Rodríguez Álvarez assures that there are no indications that mpox represents a generalized problem in Mexico at this time. The new strains of the virus, starting on the face, are more lethal than previous variants. In contrast, clade II, which has been more common in regions such as the United States and Mexico, tends to be less severe, causing localized lesions, mainly on the genitals. Dr. Rosa María Wong Chew, a specialist from the UNAM's Faculty of Medicine, highlights the differences in the clinical presentation of these variants, emphasizing that the new strain is more aggressive and associated with higher mortality.

**Mexican Health Ministry Urges Population to Visit Medical Units for Mpox Suspicions**
The Mexican Ministry of Health (IMSS-Bienestar) is urging the population without social security to visit one of the 11,000 medical units distributed across 23 states in the country to receive attention if they suspect symptoms related to mpox, also known as monkeypox. Mpox is characterized by two genetic clades or strains: I and II. The new outbreak, originating in Africa, is caused by clade I (subtype 1b), which causes a more severe disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this situation was declared a public health emergency of international importance on August 14. Although the new variant of clade 1b has not been identified in Mexico, the health services of IMSS-Bienestar are maintaining constant vigilance to prevent and act promptly in case of an outbreak. The symptoms of mpox include high fever, severe headaches, muscle pains, fatigue, and lymph node inflammation, which can last for several weeks. The infection is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, lesions on people, or touching contaminated surfaces such as bed sheets or towels used by infected individuals. It can also be transmitted through bites, scratches, or contact with the blood of infected animals.

**Mexico Raises Alert Level for Mpox Due to Increase in Cases**
The Mexican Ministry of Health has issued a preventive alert for travelers due to the increase in cases of mpox (monkeypox) in various countries. The alert focuses on the recent detection of a new variant of the virus in countries such as Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, and Burundi. The new variant, clade I and subvariant clade Ib, is recognized as more dangerous and contagious. The Ministry of Health advises travelers to follow a series of sanitary measures before, during, and after their trips to avoid the spread of mpox. The disease is transmitted mainly through direct contact with skin lesions, crusts, or mucous membranes of infected people. It can also spread through bodily fluids, contaminated clothing, and respiratory droplets, especially in situations of sexual contact. The key recommendations for travelers include avoiding close contact with people showing suspicious symptoms, using masks in crowded areas, maintaining rigorous hygiene, and seeking medical attention immediately if symptoms develop during or after the trip. The main symptoms of mpox include fever, headache, skin lesions, muscle pain, lymph node inflammation, and back pain. The lesions typically appear first on the face and then spread to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, although the new variant tends to affect more parts of the body from the start. The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the alert level for mpox to a public health emergency of international concern. The WHO is closely monitoring the situation, as the new strain has shown a more aggressive behavior, with more widespread skin eruptions compared to previous variants. In Mexico, 53 cases of monkeypox have been reported as of August 10, with the majority of cases concentrated in the capital city. Despite the growing global concern, the situation in Mexico is under control, according to Mauricio Rodríguez Álvarez, a professor at the UNAM's Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, who notes that there are no indications that mpox is a public health problem.

**Thailandia Confirms First Case of New Monkeypox Strain in Asia**
Thailandia has confirmed the first case of the new monkeypox strain, Clade 1b, in a 66-year-old European man who had traveled to Africa. According to the Department of Disease Control, laboratory tests confirmed that the man was infected with Mpox Clade 1b. Meanwhile, in Argentina, a second case of Mpox has been confirmed in the city of Rosario, in a man who had returned from a trip to Spain. The Ministry of Health had launched an epidemiological alert just three days ago, reporting eight confirmed cases of the virus in 2024, with three more cases in just one week. However, the first monkeypox case in Argentina dates back to 2022, with 1,157 confirmed cases and two deaths since then. To demonstrate the level of attention, the authorities followed emergency protocols when a ship was quarantined for 24 hours after a crew member showed symptoms compatible with the virus. The entire crew, around 20 people, was checked and only one man who showed symptoms was subjected to tests, with an order for everyone not to disembark until the test results were known. Monkeypox has also reappeared in neighboring Brazil, which fears it may relive the nightmare of August 2022, when it recorded a peak of over 40,000 cases in a single month. In response to the declared health emergency by the WHO, the Mexican National Epidemiological Surveillance System (Conave) has published a notice clarifying the procedures to be followed in the face of high-risk cases.

**San Luis Potosí Reports No Cases of Mpox Clade I Variant**
The National Epidemiological Surveillance Committee (CONAVE) in Mexico has issued an epidemiological alert regarding the Mpox clade I variant. The Secretary of Health in San Luis Potosí, Ymuri Vaca Avila, stated that the goal is to have medical units across the country monitor and report probable cases to reduce the spread of the disease and provide timely medical attention to those infected. According to Avila, there have been no cases of the Mpox clade I variant in San Luis Potosí this year, and only 10 cases were reported in 2022 and 5 in 2023. The symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and skin lesions, which can appear on the face, hands, and other parts of the body. To confirm a case, a positive result from a real-time PCR test or identification of samples analyzed by the Mexican Institute of Public Health (InDRE) is required. Avila recommended that the population frequently wash their hands, cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoid sharing food and drinks, and use face masks when near an infected person. She also advised to clean and disinfect areas where an infected person has been, avoid close contact, and properly dispose of contaminated items.

**Mexican Ministry of Health Raises Alert Level for Mpox Due to Increasing Cases in Africa**
The Mexican Ministry of Health has raised the alert level for travelers due to the increasing cases of mpox in Africa, also known as monkeypox. The ministry has identified several African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, and Burundi, where a new variant (clade l, clade Ib) of the virus has been detected. The ministry advises travelers to take special sanitary measures before, during, and after travel to prevent infections. Mpox is a viral disease that is primarily transmitted through direct contact with skin lesions or mucous membranes of an infected person. The virus can also spread through contact with blood, bodily fluids, contaminated clothing, and respiratory droplets, particularly in contexts of sexual contact. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern, with the current outbreak being the most severe and contagious variant, clade I. Symptoms of mpox include headache, fever, skin eruptions or lesions, back pain, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle pain. The Mexican Ministry of Health recommends that travelers take additional precautions, such as avoiding close contact with people showing suspicious symptoms, wearing masks in crowded areas, and maintaining good hygiene, including frequent handwashing. If symptoms develop during or after travel, seek immediate medical attention for a timely diagnosis and treatment. According to Mauricio Rodríguez Álvarez, a professor at the UNAM, the situation in Mexico is under control and there are no signs of alarm at the moment. 'First, we must understand that, for now, there is no indication that mpox is a problem in Mexico', he said. The expert also recognizes that there is a system in place to monitor and detect the introduction of the virus to the country. However, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 49 cases of mpox in 11 states, and Rodríguez Álvarez acknowledges that the virus does not represent a generalized risk at this time. The current outbreak has specific characteristics, including a more contagious virus caused by clade I and a more dangerous variant, clade Ib, with a mortality rate estimated at 3.6% by the WHO. According to Dr. Rosa María Wong Chew, a specialist at the UNAM Faculty of Medicine, the new variant causes skin eruptions all over the body, while previous variants were characterized by localized lesions on the genitals. 'In the case of clade I, we observe severe fever, a general attack, lesions all over the body that start on the face. They come out as spots, granules that become pustules. There is also a higher mortality rate', she said. In the case of clade II, the expert noted that it is a milder disease. 'In the United States, in Mexico, and other places, they only had one lesion and sometimes it was just a genital lesion. In contrast, with the new variant, the lesions go from head to toe', she said. Both variants cause fever and muscle pain, she added.

**Spain Reports First Monkeypox Case, Italy Remains Vigilant**
A new case of monkeypox, also known as Mpox, has been reported in Spain, the first in the country, affecting a young person in the Cantabria region. The patient, who is in good health, has been isolated. The Spanish case is caused by the Clade II sub-type of the virus, which is less aggressive than the Clade I responsible for recent infections in Sweden and Pakistan. Clade II, originating from West Africa, has been circulating in Europe since 2022 and is associated with a mortality rate below 1%. In Italy, the Ministry of Health has not reported new Mpox cases since August 1, but remains vigilant. The Ministry has strengthened surveillance and established an inter-ministerial committee to monitor the situation. A new circular invites regions to consolidate diagnostic capacity to identify different virus clades. Meanwhile, in Mexico, 53 Mpox cases have been reported by August 10, mostly in Mexico City. Mexican health authorities have issued guidelines for managing probable cases in response to the declared public health emergency by the WHO.

**Mpox: Understanding the Differences Between Strains and the Risk in Mexico**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, a public health emergency of international concern due to the resurgence of cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries. The current strain of the virus is the most dangerous and contagious, clade I. In Mexico, the health authorities have confirmed that the current cases are caused by the clade II variant, which is less severe than the current strain. The WHO has warned that the risk of introduction of this variant in other regions, including the Americas and the Caribbean, is high. According to Dr. Rosa María Wong Chew, a specialist from the UNAM Faculty of Medicine, the new strain causes widespread skin lesions, whereas the previous variants were characterized by localized lesions in the genital area. 'In the case of clade I, we observe high fever, a general state of collapse, lesions all over the body that start on the face. There are spots, pimples that become pustules. There is also a higher mortality rate,' she explained. Dr. Mauricio Rodríguez Álvarez, a professor from the UNAM Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, stated that the situation in Mexico is under control and there are no signs of alarm. 'We must understand that, for the moment, there is no indication that mpox is a problem in Mexico,' he said. The WHO has expressed concern about the clade '1B' strain, which emerged in 2023 and caused almost 100 cases before the international health emergency was declared. 'We hope that in the event of the arrival of the clade '1B' strain, it is detected and acted upon immediately,' said Rodríguez Álvarez.

**Pakistan Reports First Mpox Case Following Sweden**
Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox case, a 34-year-old from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, who is currently receiving treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to the spread of the Clade 1 variant, which has caused severe outbreaks in Africa. The WHO has advised against travel restrictions, but countries like China are stepping up preventive measures, including screening people and goods entering the country for mpox. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk level for mpox from 'low' to 'moderate,' warning of an increased likelihood of imported cases. Bavarian Nordic has announced plans to produce up to 10 million doses of its mpox vaccine by 2025 and is seeking European approval to expand its vaccine's use to children aged 12 and above, as reported by Al Jazeera.

**Mexico's Situation with Mpox: Expert Weighs in on the Virus**
According to Mauricio Rodríguez Álvarez, a professor at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), the situation with mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is under control in Mexico and there are no signs of alarm. Rodríguez Álvarez stated, 'First, we must understand that, for the moment, there is no indicator that mpox is a problem in Mexico.' The expert also acknowledged that there is a system in place to monitor and detect the introduction of the virus to the country. Rodríguez Álvarez expressed concern about the clade '1B', which emerged in 2023 and caused nearly 100 cases before the international health emergency was declared, but it has not been registered in Mexico yet. He said, 'Let's hope that if the clade '1B' arrives, it is detected and immediate action can be taken.' Rodríguez Álvarez noted that the virus does not represent a generalized risk at this time, as most cases in Mexico and worldwide have a pattern of transmission through sex and among people from the LGBTQ+ community. He recommended that if someone suspects they have mpox, they should visit specialized health services, preferably institutional ones. Rodríguez Álvarez also emphasized the importance of not touching skin lesions and seeking medical attention from experienced institutions to avoid transmission. He also called for the disease to be referred to as 'mpox' rather than 'monkeypox' to avoid stigmatization.

**WHO Declares Global Health Emergency Over mpox Outbreak in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency due to the 'clade 1b' variant of mpox in Africa, which has caused over 500 deaths. The WHO has launched a campaign to raise $1.45 million to address the outbreak. Mexico has not reported the new variant, but has activated a contingency plan to address possible outbreaks. According to the WHO, the variant has caused a significant concern after its appearance in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the outbreak has caused over 500 deaths. The spread of mpox has extended to other African countries, prompting the African CDC to declare mpox as a public health emergency on August 14. The WHO has launched a campaign to raise $1.45 million to address the over 15,000 cases reported in these regions. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, suggests that the mutations of the virus could be leading to new high-risk variants, although this has not been confirmed. Outside of Africa, cases have been reported in other countries, such as Sweden, where 15 infections of the clade 1b variant have been identified in people who had recently traveled to affected regions in Africa. In Mexico, the National Commission for Epidemiological Surveillance (CONAVE) has reported that the new variant has not been detected in the country, but the WHO has included Mexico in its declaration of international emergency due to the global threat. The Mexican government has confirmed 49 cases of mpox in 2024, corresponding to old variants of the virus, and has activated a contingency plan to address possible new outbreaks.

**Mpox Outbreak: Italy Increases Surveillance, Decades of Cases in Mexico and Argentina**
A new virus, Mpox, has caused concern for the World Health Organization (WHO), which has declared an international health emergency. In Africa, the situation is alarming, with over 1200 cases confirmed in the last week, bringing the total number of confirmed or suspected cases to 18,737 since the beginning of the year. The 'Clade Ib' strain is the most worrying, as it is more virulent and lethal than previously known strains. The first European case was reported in Sweden, and Italy has increased its surveillance system in Lombardy. Guido Bertolaso, the regional welfare minister, said, 'Our system of surveillance is active and effective, and our attention is at its highest level, especially after Sweden reported the first case and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stated the probability of finding cases of Mpox imported from Africa.' Decades of cases have been reported in Mexico and Argentina, with 49 confirmed and 212 probable cases in Mexico, and 8 cases in Argentina. The symptoms of Mpox typically appear between 6 and 13 days after infection and include fever, rash, and lesions on the mucous membranes. Most people experience mild to moderate symptoms that last for two to four weeks, followed by complete recovery. However, in some cases, the infection can be more severe, especially in people with weakened immune systems.

**Mexico Issues Epidemiological Alert for Mpox and Reveals Number of Confirmed Cases**
The Mexican government has issued an epidemiological alert due to the increase in mpox cases in Africa, which has been declared an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Ministry of Health (SSa) warned that the current outbreaks in Africa 'increase the risk of international dissemination by a different variant than the one from the 2022 outbreak'. The alert aims to have medical units across the country monitor and report suspected cases, in order to 'reduce possible chains of transmission and provide timely medical attention to affected individuals'. According to the Ministry of Health, the document also outlines the actions that medical personnel should take in the event of identifying a probable case. In Africa, the variant known as clade I is circulating, which is associated with sustained transmission across a wider age range, including children under 15. The WHO has urged member states to remain vigilant in the face of the possibility of introducing this variant in other regions, including the Americas and the Caribbean. In Mexico, there have been 212 probable cases, of which 49 are confirmed and distributed across 11 states. So far, the new variant clade 1b has not been identified in the country. The symptoms of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, include fever, intense headache, swollen lymph nodes, lower back pain, muscle pain, and a lack of desire to move or engage in physical activity. The disease has two clinical periods, which usually resolve without complications within two to four weeks after the onset of symptoms. The first phase lasts for the first five days and is characterized by fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, lower back pain, muscle pain, and a lack of desire to move or engage in physical activity. The second phase is marked by the appearance of small blisters, which begin on the first and third days after the onset of fever, and are followed by the different stages of rash, which typically affect the face first and then spread to the rest of the body. The Ministry of Health recommends that citizens who present symptoms: Wash their hands frequently with soap and water or alcohol gel. Cover their nose and mouth with the inside of their elbow when coughing or sneezing. Avoid sharing food, drinks, utensils, and plates. Use a medical mask. Wash clothing, towels, utensils for eating, and bedding that have come into contact with an infected person using warm water and detergent. Clean and disinfect areas where an infected person has been. Avoid contact with lesions; if they must be touched, use gloves and dispose of them properly. Seek medical attention and avoid contact with others if symptoms are presented. In case of suspicion, the public can contact the phone number 5519469772 or through the email censida@salud.gob.mx.

According to the Mexican Ministry of Health, there have been 49 confirmed cases of Mpox (also known as monkeypox or smallpox) in 11 states of Mexico from January to August 3, 2024. Additionally, there are 212 probable cases of the virus. The National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (CONAVE) has published an epidemiological alert regarding Mpox. The alert aims to have medical units across the country monitor and report probable cases to reduce the spread of the virus and provide timely medical attention to those affected. Mexico has a system for monitoring Mpox, which allows for the notification of probable cases through the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. The clade II is the only one detected in all analyzed cases in Mexico so far. The new variant clade 1b has not been identified in the country. The Ministry of Health has a plan in place to address Mpox, which includes national response coordination, community involvement, diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, comprehensive care, and risk communication. The plan is updated according to the current requirements of the International Public Health Emergency of International Concern (ESPII). The Ministry recommends that the general population take precautions such as frequent handwashing, covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoiding sharing food, drinks, utensils, and plates, and wearing medical masks. They also recommend washing and disinfecting clothing, towels, utensils, and bedding that have come into contact with an infected person, and avoiding contact with lesions and other people if symptoms are present.

**Mexico issues alert over possible mpox outbreak**
Mexico's National Commission for Epidemiological Defense has warned of a possible mpox outbreak, with 212 'probable cases' and 49 confirmed cases reported this year. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) due to elevated cases with a new variant reported in Europe, Asia, and Africa. According to WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighboring countries are very worrying.' Mpox is a rare disease similar to smallpox, causing flu-like symptoms and skin lesions, and has been reported in at least 11 states in Mexico since 2022. Health authorities are urging precaution in cases of the more transmissible variant, clade Ib, which may carry a similar fatality rate to clade I.

**Mexico's Mpox Cases: A Growing Concern**
As of 2024, there have been 49 confirmed cases of mpox (monkeypox) in Mexico, with none of the new clade 1 or clade 1b strain, but rather clade II. Of these 49 cases, 47 are men and 2 are women. The 49 confirmed cases of mpox were derived from 212 suspected cases. The 11 states with mpox cases are led by Mexico City, which accounts for over 50% of the cases, followed by Quintana Roo and Jalisco. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) was declared on August 14, 2024. The Mexican Ministry of Health recommends reporting suspected cases to 5519469772 or censida@salud.gob.mx. The ministry also explained the two phases of the disease, which can last from two to four weeks. The first phase includes symptoms such as fever, headache, and muscle pain. The second phase, which appears two to three days after the onset of symptoms, is characterized by the appearance of blisters on the face and then on the rest of the body. To prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to avoid contact with others, frequently wash hands, wear a mask, avoid sharing food and utensils, and disinfect areas where the infected person has been. Activists in Mexico are demanding the application of existing vaccines, but the federal government has ignored their requests, citing a 'mediocre' effect, despite other countries applying them to vulnerable groups.

**Mexican Ministry of Health Issues Warning on mpox**
The Mexican Ministry of Health (Ssa) has issued a warning to medical units to strengthen surveillance and report probable cases of mpox, also known as 'monkeypox', to reduce contagion. The National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (Conave) has published an epidemiological alert to instruct preventive actions in all health centers to break possible chains of transmission and provide timely medical attention to affected individuals. The alert refers to the increasing risk of international propagation due to the occurrence of outbreaks in Africa and the circulation of a variant distinct from the 2022 variant. The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to remain vigilant in the face of the possibility of introducing this variant in other regions, including the Americas and the Caribbean. 'To detect cases promptly and reduce the spread of mpox in national territory, the alert issued by Conave emphasizes the strict compliance with epidemiological surveillance actions in accordance with the regulations and ensuring timely attention to affected individuals,' said the Ssa. As of August 3, the Epidemiological Surveillance System has identified 212 probable cases in 2024, of which 49 are confirmed and distributed in 11 federal entities, with the clade II variant being the only one detected in all analyzed cases in Mexico. The Ssa has confirmed that there is no detection of the new clade 1b2 variant. The Ssa has also announced that it has a Response Plan for the management of mpox, which includes coordination of the national response, community involvement and participation, diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, comprehensive care, and risk communication. The plan is updated according to the current requirements of the ESPII and is activated upon the epidemiological alert, available at https://t.ly/Cx5nA. In case of suspicion and need for linkage to medical units, the Ssa has made available the phone number 5519469772 or the email [email protected]

**Europe Raises Alert Level for Mpox After Case Detected in Sweden**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk level for mpox, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a case of infection with the new strain of the virus in Sweden, the first outside of Africa. The director of the ECDC said that there will be more imported cases of the new strain of mpox in Europe in the coming weeks, although the risk of sustained transmission remains low. The WHO declared on Wednesday that mpox is a global health emergency, its highest level of alert, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to neighboring countries. Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is usually mild but can be fatal. Two strains are now spreading in the Congo: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new branch called clade Ib. The ECDC raised its risk level for mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases appearing in the bloc, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said ECDC director Pamela Rendi Wagner. Pakistan also confirmed a case of the virus mpox in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, although it was unclear whether it was the new variant or the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022. WHO official Margaret Harris said in a press conference on Friday that she expects more cases outside of Africa soon, also due to increased surveillance. However, the WHO discouraged any travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Mpox Alert Issued in Mexico Amid Global Health Emergency**
Following the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of a global health emergency due to an outbreak of mpox, also known as 'monkeypox', the Mexican Ministry of Health (SSA) issued a warning to reinforce surveillance and report probable cases in medical units across the country to reduce transmission. The National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (Conave) published an epidemiological alert to instruct preventive actions in all health centers to break possible chains of transmission and provide timely medical attention to affected individuals. The alert notes that the occurrence of mpox outbreaks, mainly in African countries with a different variant from 2022, increases the risk of international spread. Additionally, a variant of the clade I is circulating in Africa, associated with sustained transmission and cases in a wider age range. As a result, the possibility of introducing this variant in other regions, including the Americas and the Caribbean, is a concern.

**Mexico Issues Epidemiological Alert for Mpox, Confirms 49 Cases**
The Mexican Ministry of Health (Ssa) has issued an epidemiological alert for the mpox disease, also known as monkeypox, and has confirmed 49 cases in the country in 2024. This is in response to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation to declare a public health emergency of international concern due to the monkeypox outbreak. The National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (Conave) has issued the alert to request that medical units across the country monitor and report suspected cases. Conave stated that the goal of the alert is to reduce the chains of transmission and provide timely medical attention to infected individuals. As of August 3, the Epidemiological Surveillance System has identified 212 probable cases in 2024, with 49 confirmed cases distributed across 11 states. The only clade identified in the analyzed cases is clade II, and no new variant clade 1b has been detected. According to Conave, 'Our country has a Response Plan for the management of mpox that includes actions of national response coordination; community involvement, empowerment, and participation; diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, comprehensive care, and risk communication; the plan is updated according to the current requirements of the ESPII and is activated upon the epidemiological alert.' The committee also called on citizens to report suspected cases through the phone number 5519469772 or the email censida@salud.gob.mx. Mpox is a zoonosis, a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans, and is caused by the virus of the smallpox-like disease. According to the WHO and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the disease is primarily transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected animal blood, bodily fluids, skin lesions, or mucous membranes. Secondary transmission from person to person can occur through close contact with infected respiratory secretions, skin lesions, or objects that have recently come into contact with infected fluids or materials. Mpox can also be transmitted through inoculation or through the placenta, resulting in congenital smallpox, as stated by the WHO. Symptoms of mpox include a skin rash that can appear on hands, feet, face, mouth, chest, or near the genitals, which can progress through various stages, including scabs, before healing. In the initial stages, the rash may appear as pimples or blisters, causing pain and itching, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

**Jalisco Confirms Three Cases of MPOX, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of MPOX, also known as monkeypox, as a public health emergency of international concern. In Jalisco, Mexico, there have been three confirmed cases of MPOX in the Guadalajara metropolitan area. According to César Domínguez, director of Health Surveillance and Intelligence at the Jalisco State Health Secretariat, 'We have three confirmed cases of MPOX in the state of Jalisco this year.' The WHO declared the emergency due to a new variant of the virus, called 'clade1D', which has a higher capacity for transmission between people. Domínguez explained that the three cases in Jalisco have already been treated, and there are no active cases in the state. He emphasized that the alert is due to the new variant, which is different from the one identified in 2022, and that Jalisco has been monitoring the virus since 2022 and is prepared to handle any potential outbreaks. 'We have a system in place to identify cases and diagnose them through our state laboratory in coordination with the National Epidemiological Reference Institute,' he said. He also stated that the mortality rate of the disease is low, with rare complications and deaths, but that there is a risk of complications, particularly in people with pre-existing health conditions. He denied that the disease is exclusive to young men of reproductive age, as previously reported, and emphasized that the transmission is not exclusive to sexual contact. He recommended that people seek medical attention immediately if they experience any atypical symptoms.

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Mexican Ministry of Health Issues Alert on mpox**
The Mexican Ministry of Health has issued a new alert regarding the mpox virus, formerly known as monkeypox. The alert emphasizes the importance of maintaining rigorous epidemiological surveillance in response to the increase in outbreaks in Africa and the potential threat of a new variant. According to the authorities, there have been 212 probable and 49 confirmed cases of mpox in 11 federal entities of Mexico since the beginning of 2024. Although Mexico has not identified the new clade 1b variant circulating in Africa, health authorities remain on high alert for the possibility of its introduction into the country. 'The goal of the alert is for medical units across the country to vigilantly monitor and report probable cases to reduce the chains of transmission and provide timely medical attention to infected individuals,' the Ministry of Health stated in the alert. The alert emphasizes the need for medical personnel to strictly follow epidemiological surveillance actions and ensure timely attention to patients. The presence of outbreaks in Africa, associated with a different variant from 2022, increases the risk of incidence for Mexico, it affirms. The Mexican Response Plan for mpox, which includes national coordination, community participation, and epidemiological surveillance, is updated in accordance with the requirements of the Public Health Emergency of International Importance (PHEIC). Mpox presents in two clinical phases: the first, lasting between five days, includes symptoms such as fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle pain. The second phase is characterized by the appearance of blisters and rash, which usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. In the event of symptoms, the Ministry of Health recommends the following to the general population: frequent handwashing with soap and water or alcohol gel, covering the nose and mouth with the inside of the elbow when coughing or sneezing, avoiding sharing food, drinks, utensils, and plates, washing clothes, towels, eating utensils, and bedding that have come into contact with an infected person, cleaning and disinfecting areas where an infected person has been, avoiding contact with lesions, and seeking medical attention and avoiding contact with others if symptoms are present.

**Mexico Issues Epidemiological Alert for Mpox Due to Increased Cases in Africa**
The Mexican government has issued an epidemiological alert due to the increase in mpox cases in Africa. The National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (Conave) has published a warning to alert medical units across the country to monitor and report suspected cases in order to reduce the spread of the disease and provide timely medical attention to those affected. The alert emphasizes the importance of following operational definitions of probable, confirmed, and discarded cases based on World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. The document outlines the actions that medical personnel should take in medical units upon identifying a probable case. The alert also highlights the increased risk of mpox incidence in Mexico due to the occurrence of outbreaks in Africa, primarily with a different variant from 2022. Additionally, a variant of the clade I is circulating in Africa, associated with sustained transmission and cases in a wider age range, including children under 15. The WHO has urged member states to remain vigilant for the possibility of introducing this variant in other regions, including the Americas and the Caribbean. As of the 31st epidemiological week of 2024, there are 212 suspected cases, of which 49 are confirmed, distributed across 11 states, with the clade II being the only one detected in all analyzed cases in Mexico. The country has a Plan of Response for the management of mpox, which includes actions for national response coordination, community involvement, diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, comprehensive care, and risk communication. The symptoms of mpox include two clinical periods that typically resolve without complications within two to four weeks after the onset of symptoms. The first phase, which develops within the first five days, is characterized by fever, intense headache, swollen lymph nodes, lower back pain, muscle pain, and a lack of desire to move or engage in physical activity. The second phase is the appearance of small blisters, which begins one to three days after the onset of fever, and is followed by different stages of rash that typically affect the face first and then spread to the rest of the body. The WHO has declared mpox, previously known as monkeypox, as a global emergency for the second time.
