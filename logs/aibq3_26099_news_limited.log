**SIPRI: Nuclear-armed states continue to modernize their arsenals**
Nine nuclear-armed states, including the US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals in 2023. According to SIPRI, the total number of nuclear warheads decreased to 12,121, but the number in a state of combat readiness increased to around 9,585. Most of these warheads belong to Russia and the US, but China is expected to have brought its warheads into combat readiness for the first time. India, Pakistan, and North Korea are exploring the possibility of placing multiple warheads on ballistic missiles. NATO members are discussing whether to bring their nuclear weapons into a state of combat readiness. The block believes that the world becomes dangerous if Russia, China, and North Korea have nuclear weapons, but NATO does not.

**SIPRI: Nuclear-Armed States Modernize Arsenals Amid Ongoing Wars**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), nuclear-armed states are modernizing their arsenals amid ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. 'Nine nuclear-armed states - the US, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel - continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals and some of these countries deployed new systems with nuclear warheads or the capability to carry nuclear warheads in 2023', according to SIPRI's new annual report. SIPRI Director Dan Smith notes that while the overall number of nuclear warheads is decreasing, there is a growing number of nuclear warheads in a state of readiness. According to the report, this trend is likely to accelerate in the coming years. The report states that of the 12,121 nuclear warheads in the world as of January 2024, around 9,585 were in a state of readiness. At least 3,904 of these were deployed on missiles or aircraft, which is 60 more than in January 2023. Around 2,100 of the deployed warheads were in a state of high readiness on ballistic missiles. SIPRI notes that China may have deployed its warheads in a state of high readiness for the first time. SIPRI also writes that India, Pakistan, and North Korea are currently working on equipping ballistic missiles with multiple warheads, which is likely to lead to an increase in the number of operationally deployed nuclear warheads.

**Global Nuclear Weapons Spending Reaches $91.4 Billion in 2023**
The report 'Surge: 2023 Global nuclear weapons spending' by ICAN (International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons) shows that in 2023, the nine nuclear-armed states spent $91.4 billion on nuclear weapons, an increase of $10.7 billion compared to 2022. The United States spent the most, with $51.5 billion, followed by China, Russia, the UK, France, India, Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea. The report highlights the need to redirect these funds to vital services for citizens, such as healthcare, education, and climate change mitigation. The ICAN campaign is calling for a global week of action from September 16 to 22, 2024, to raise awareness about the issue and demand that governments prioritize human needs over nuclear weapons.

**Russia Overtakes US: SIPRI Report Reveals Nuclear Arms Buildup**
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has released its annual report on the state of arms, disarmament, and international security. The report highlights the continued increase in the number and types of nuclear weapons being developed by countries, as states intensify their nuclear deterrence in the face of geopolitical tensions. Nine nuclear-armed states, including the US, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, are modernizing their nuclear arsenals. Russia and the US account for almost 90% of the world's nuclear weapons, with Russia increasing its stockpile by 36 warheads in 2023. China has significantly increased its nuclear arsenal, from 410 warheads in January 2023 to 500 in January 2024, indicating its intention to increase its nuclear capabilities, possibly to the level of the US and Russia. The report also notes that India, Pakistan, and North Korea are developing the potential to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles. Israel, which does not publicly acknowledge its nuclear weapons, is also believed to be modernizing its arsenal and reactor for plutonium production.

**Nuclear-Armed States Strengthen Their Arsenals**
According to the SIPRI report, nuclear-armed states are strengthening their arsenals. Some countries have deployed new nuclear weapons. As of January 2024, approximately 9,585 nuclear warheads were in military stockpiles for potential use, out of a total global stockpile of around 12,121 warheads. According to SIPRI estimates, 3,904 warheads were deployed with rockets and aircraft, a 60% increase from January 2023, while the rest were stored in central storage. About 2,100 deployed warheads were in a state of heightened readiness on ballistic missiles. 'Almost all these warheads belonged to Russia or the US, but for the first time, some Chinese nuclear warheads are considered to be in a state of heightened readiness,' the report said. Despite the overall number of nuclear warheads in the world continuing to decrease as Cold War-era weapons are dismantled, SIPRI experts continue to observe an annual increase in the number of operational nuclear weapons. The trend is expected to continue and accelerate in the coming years. India, Pakistan, and North Korea are trying to deploy several warheads on ballistic missiles already possessed by Russia, France, the UK, the US, and recently appeared in China. 'This would give the potential for a rapid increase in deployed warheads and the ability for nuclear-armed countries to threaten a much larger number of targets,' the report said. Russia and the US together possess almost 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world. Analysts at the institute note that the sizes of their respective military nuclear stockpiles (i.e., warheads ready for use) appear to have remained relatively stable in 2023, although Russia deployed approximately 36 more warheads in operational forces than in January 2023. Transparency regarding nuclear forces has decreased in both countries since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and debates around nuclear disarmament agreements have become more relevant. As for China's nuclear arsenal, SIPRI's estimate of its size increased from 410 warheads in January 2023 to 500 in January 2024, and is expected to continue growing.

**Nuclear Rearmament Accelerates as World Descends into Danger**
The nine nuclear-armed states have modernized their nuclear arsenals and several have deployed new systems in 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As geopolitical tensions increase, nuclear powers are modernizing their arsenals, said researchers, urging world leaders to 'take a step back and think'. 'Since the Cold War, nuclear weapons have never played a more important role in international relations,' said Wilfred Wan, director of the Sipri's program on mass destruction weapons. The nine nuclear-armed states - Russia, the US, France, India, China, Israel, the UK, Pakistan, and North Korea - have all modernized their nuclear arsenals and several have deployed new systems in 2023. The majority of these nuclear weapons belong to Russia and the US, which possess 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. For the first time, Sipri estimates that China has 'some warheads on high alert' - meaning ready to be used immediately. 'We are currently living in one of the most dangerous periods in human history,' warned Dan Smith, Sipri director. 'The sources of instability are numerous: political rivalries, economic inequalities, ecological disturbances, and the acceleration of arms races. The abyss is looming and it is time for great powers to take a step back and think. Preferably together.' In February 2023, Russia announced it would suspend its participation in the New START treaty, limiting strategic nuclear forces between Russia and the US. Sipri also noted that Moscow had conducted exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons on the Ukrainian border in May 2024.
