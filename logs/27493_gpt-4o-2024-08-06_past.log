To make an informed prediction, I will first consider the past and current trends in core CPI inflation, the economic context, and other relevant factors:

1. **Historical Data**: Historically, core CPI inflation tends to be less volatile than headline CPI due to the exclusion of food and energy, which are highly volatile. Monthly increases of 0.5% or more in core CPI have been uncommon in recent years but are possible under certain economic conditions.

2. **Current Economic Context (up to August 2024)**:
   - **Inflation Trends**: If inflationary pressures have been building due to economic factors such as increased demand, wage growth, or supply chain issues, there could be an upward push on prices.
   - **Federal Reserve Actions**: Any recent changes in monetary policy, such as interest rate adjustments, could impact inflation expectations. If the Fed has recently increased rates to combat inflation, it could dampen price increases.
   - **Market Expectations**: Looking for recent analyses by economic experts on anticipated inflation figures, as they combine multiple economic indicators.

3. **Specific Factors for August 2024**:
   - The mid-year economic environment, seasonal effects, and any extraordinary events (such as geopolitical tensions or natural disasters) that might affect sectors included in the core CPI.

Given these aspects, here is my analysis:

- Steady to moderate increases in core CPI are more typical than large jumps unless there's a specific economic shock or substantial underlying pressure.
- If recent monthly figures have been steadily increasing, approaching 0.4% or above, it might suggest a pathway to a 0.5% increase. Conversely, if they have been stable or decreasing, the likelihood diminishes.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.
