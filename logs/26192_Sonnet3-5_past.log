To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Base rate: Secret Service directors typically serve multi-year terms. Cheatle has only been in the role since September 2022, less than 2 years.

2. Recent incident: The assassination attempt on Trump is a major security failure that puts pressure on Cheatle's leadership.

3. Political pressure: Several Republican lawmakers have called for Cheatle's resignation or firing.

4. Cheatle's response: She has taken responsibility but stated she will not resign, showing resolve to stay in her position.

5. Biden's support: As the appointing president, Biden previously expressed strong confidence in Cheatle. No indication yet that he's withdrawn support.

6. Upcoming testimony: Cheatle is set to testify before Congress on July 22, 2024. Her performance there could impact her future.

7. Time frame: The question asks about remaining through September 30, 2024 - only about 2.5 months from now.

8. Precedent: Secret Service directors have resigned over lesser scandals in the past.

9. Ongoing investigations: Results of reviews into the incident are still pending and could influence Cheatle's fate.

Weighing these factors:

The assassination attempt is an extremely serious incident that creates significant pressure for leadership change. However, Cheatle has only been in the role for a relatively short time, has stated she won't resign, and still appears to have White House support. The short time frame (only 2.5 months) also works in her favor for remaining in the role through September.

Her upcoming congressional testimony is a key inflection point - a poor performance could increase pressure for her removal, while a strong showing could help her weather the storm.

Given the seriousness of the incident, I believe there's a significant chance (30-40%) she will not remain in the role. However, the short time frame, her resolve to stay, and likely continued White House support make it more probable than not that she will remain through September 30.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 70.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To forecast whether Kimberly Cheatle will remain Director of the United States Secret Service through September 30, 2024, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Base rate: Secret Service directors typically serve multi-year terms. Cheatle has only been in the role since September 2022, so under normal circumstances, she would be expected to continue serving.

2. Recent events: The assassination attempt on former President Trump represents a major security failure that has put intense scrutiny on Cheatle's leadership. This significantly increases the risk of her losing her position.

3. Statements from Cheatle: She has stated she will not resign and plans to stay on, indicating her intent to remain in the role. However, this doesn't guarantee she won't be removed.

4. Political pressure: There are calls from some Republican lawmakers for Cheatle to resign or be fired. However, as a Biden appointee, she likely retains support from the current administration.

5. Upcoming hearing: Cheatle is set to testify before Congress on July 22. Her performance at this hearing could impact her job security.

6. Time frame: The question asks about her status through September 30, 2024 - over two months from now. This gives time for the situation to potentially stabilize if no further incidents occur.

7. Historical precedent: While security failures have led to leadership changes at the Secret Service before, it's not automatic. Julia Pierson resigned as director in 2014 after security lapses, but other directors have weathered controversies.

8. Biden's stance: The President has ordered an independent review but hasn't publicly criticized Cheatle. His continued support would be crucial for her to remain in the role.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a significant risk Cheatle will not remain in her position through September 30, but it's not a certainty she'll be removed. The upcoming Congressional hearing and the results of the independent review will be critical in determining her fate.

Given the severity of the security failure and intense political pressure, I think there's a substantial chance Cheatle will not remain in her position. However, her stated intent to stay, potential continued support from the Biden administration, and the possibility that she may effectively defend the agency's actions provide a path for her to remain.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Base rate: Kimberly Cheatle has been in her position since September 2022, so about 22 months. The average tenure for Secret Service directors in recent decades has been around 3-4 years, suggesting a relatively high base rate of remaining in the position.

2. Recent events: The assassination attempt on Trump is a major security failure that puts significant pressure on Cheatle's position. However, it's important to note that she has not resigned immediately and has stated she plans to stay on.

3. Political factors: While there are calls for Cheatle's resignation from some quarters, President Biden appointed her and has previously expressed confidence in her. The administration may be reluctant to remove her, especially if it could be seen as admitting fault.

4. Upcoming hearing: Cheatle is scheduled to testify before Congress on July 22. Her performance at this hearing could significantly impact her chances of remaining in the position.

5. Time frame: The question asks about remaining in the position through September 30, 2024, which is only about 2.5 months away. This relatively short time frame increases the likelihood of her remaining in the position, as major leadership changes often take time to implement.

6. Historical precedent: Previous security failures (like the January 6 incident) did not result in immediate leadership changes at the Secret Service.

7. Cheatle's background and initiatives: While her focus on diversity has been criticized by some, her long experience with the Secret Service and previous work with Biden could work in her favor.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a relatively high chance Cheatle will remain in her position through September 30, 2024. The short time frame and the administration's likely reluctance to make a hasty change are significant factors. However, the severity of the security failure and the potential fallout from the upcoming Congressional hearing introduce significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To forecast whether Kimberly Cheatle will remain Director of the United States Secret Service through September 30, 2024, I'll examine the key factors and evidence:

1. Base rate: Secret Service directors typically serve multi-year terms. Cheatle has been in the role since September 2022, so her tenure would be only 2 years by September 2024. This suggests a high baseline probability of remaining in the role.

2. Recent events: The attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a rally represents a major security failure under Cheatle's leadership. This significantly increases the risk to her position.

3. Political pressure: There are calls from some Republican lawmakers and commentators for Cheatle to resign or be fired. The House Oversight Committee has summoned her to testify on July 22, 2024.

4. Administration support: President Biden appointed Cheatle and has previously expressed confidence in her. As of the most recent reports, the administration has not indicated plans to remove her.

5. Cheatle's response: She has taken responsibility for the incident but stated she will not resign. She plans to cooperate with investigations and implement changes.

6. Timing: With only 2.5 months until the September 30 date, there may be reluctance to change leadership so close to a major election, especially if security protocols are being revised.

7. Historical precedent: Secret Service directors have resigned or been replaced after major security breaches in the past, but not always immediately.

8. Diversity considerations: As only the second woman to lead the Secret Service, there may be some hesitancy to remove Cheatle without clear evidence of personal misconduct.

Weighing these factors, I believe Cheatle is more likely than not to remain in her role through September 30, but there is significant uncertainty. The security failure is severe enough that her removal is a real possibility, especially if the congressional hearing goes poorly or new damaging information emerges. However, the administration's continued support and the proximity to the election are protective factors.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Base rate: The Director of the Secret Service typically serves for several years. Cheatle has been in the role since September 2022, so she's been serving for less than 2 years.

2. Recent events: The attempted assassination of former President Trump has put Cheatle under intense scrutiny. This is a major security failure that could potentially lead to her resignation or removal.

3. Political pressure: There are calls from some politicians and commentators for Cheatle to resign or be fired. However, President Biden has previously expressed confidence in her.

4. Cheatle's response: She has taken responsibility for the incident but stated she will not resign. This shows a determination to stay in her position.

5. Upcoming testimony: Cheatle is scheduled to testify before Congress on July 22, 2024. Her performance could impact her future in the role.

6. Time frame: The question asks about her status through September 30, 2024, which is only about 2.5 months from now.

Reasons for a lower probability:
- The security failure is extremely serious and could be seen as grounds for removal.
- There is significant political pressure for her to step down.
- The upcoming Congressional testimony could reveal further issues.

Reasons for a higher probability:
- Cheatle has stated she will not resign.
- President Biden has previously expressed confidence in her.
- The time frame is relatively short (2.5 months), limiting the time for a leadership change.
- Changing leadership during a presidential campaign season could be seen as disruptive.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance Cheatle will remain in her position through September 30, 2024, but the recent events create substantial uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.
