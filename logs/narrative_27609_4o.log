INT. FORECASTING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, charts and screens displaying data. The room buzzes with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. B. Soldatskoe remains under Russian control.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.25%. The Ukrainian advances were significant but not decisive.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The destruction of bridges in Tetkino slowed their momentum. And the fortified defenses near the Kursk Nuclear Plant were a formidable barrier.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The incursion was bold, but the Russian countermeasures were effective. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yet, Ukraine's progress in Korenevo showed potential. If not for the reinforced Russian positions...

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but the probability never exceeded 20%. The odds were always against a breakthrough by October.

They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions. The room falls silent, the weight of the ongoing conflict palpable.

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, analyzing recent developments with a large map of Kursk Oblast projected on the wall.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, as of today, our models had it at 68.42% that Ukrainian forces would capture Bolshoye Soldatskoye before October 1. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the August advances near Korenevo and Tetkino, the probability was strong. But the Russian countermeasures and defensive lines near the Kursk Nuclear Plant were significant deterrents.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
Indeed. The destruction of bridges and fortifications near Glushkovo slowed the Ukrainian momentum. Still, our models accurately predicted the likelihood.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(turning to the map)  
The map confirms it—Ukraine now controls the area. It’s a pivotal development in the region.

They all exchange knowing looks, their models proven right once again.

Our models had it at 15.67%. The advances in Kursk Oblast were notable, especially near Korenevo, but B. Soldatskoe remained just out of reach.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
The destruction of bridges and Russian counterattacks played a significant role. The focus was more on strategic points like Tetkino and Glushkovo.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

And the potential nuclear plant threat kept both sides cautious.

They all look at the screen, where the map shows no Ukrainian control over B. Soldatskoe.
