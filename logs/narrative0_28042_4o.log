NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a news desk, papers scattered around them. A screen behind them displays the Brandenburg state election results.

**NATE SILVER**  
Will AfD's vote share be more than 32%? No, our models had it at 48.75%. The AfD secured 31.2%, reflecting our lower probability forecast.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Despite their strong showing in Saxony and Thuringia, the dynamics in Brandenburg were different. Our pre-election data up to September 12th indicated a plateau in their support.

**NATE SILVER**  
The increased turnout and strategic campaigning by other parties played a crucial role. Our models factored in these variables accurately.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
It’s a testament to the complexity of voter behavior in Germany's federal landscape. The AfD's momentum had its limits here.

They nod, satisfied with their accurate forecast.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the results are in. Will AfD's vote share be more than 32% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.67% that AfD would surpass the 32% mark, but they ultimately fell short.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the momentum from their recent successes in Saxony and Thuringia seemed promising. However, the final tally shows they didn't quite make it.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right, despite their growing support and the polls suggesting a surge, the models accurately reflected the complexities of Brandenburg's political landscape.

**NATE SILVER**  
The nuances of regional politics often defy broader trends. Our models, with their strong Brier scores, captured this uncertainty well.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
It's a reminder that while trends inform probabilities, outcomes remain unpredictable until the very end.
