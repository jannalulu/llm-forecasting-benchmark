**ICC Replaces Judge in Netanyahu Case, Potential Delay in Arrest Warrant Decision**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) announced that it will replace one of its judges due to health reasons, which may further delay a decision on the request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The ICC's president stated that the judge, Romanian Judge Julia Motoc, requested to be replaced due to health reasons, and was immediately replaced by Slovenian Judge Bettina Holzer. The new judge will need time to familiarize herself with the case documents, which may lead to a delay in the decision on issuing arrest warrants. There is no specific time frame for the ICC to make a decision, but it has generally taken around 3 months to rule on previous requests for arrest warrants. The request to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders was submitted on May 20, 2024, and includes charges of 'war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of articles 8(2)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), and (ix) of the Rome Statute'. According to the prosecutor's statement, the ICC's efforts to obtain arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity include 'starvation', 'willful killing', 'genocide and/or murder', 'intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population', 'persecution', 'inhumane acts', and 'intentionally inflicting severe physical or mental suffering, or causing great suffering or serious bodily or mental harm'.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Preparing to Issue Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced a judge who was preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The court stated that the decision to replace the Roman judge investigating in Gaza was due to health reasons. The ICC had previously requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor of the court, Karim Khan, explained that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Israeli Prime Minister was criminally responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court also requested an arrest warrant for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include 'causing genocide, causing famine as a means of warfare, including preventing humanitarian aid, and intentionally targeting civilians in the conflict.' The ICC is an independent judicial body that has jurisdiction over individuals accused of committing genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

**Netanyahu Receives Cold Reception at UN General Assembly**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was met with an empty hall at the UN General Assembly, as the Turkish delegation led by Ambassador Ahmet Yıldız left the room before his speech. This move was seen as a protest against Netanyahu's presence at the UN, as he has been accused of committing war crimes in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The International Criminal Court has also issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on charges of committing war crimes. The empty hall was a stark contrast to Netanyahu's speech, which was delivered to an almost deserted room. 'It was a great day for the Turkish delegation to show their support for the people of Gaza,' said a Turkish diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'We will not stand idly by while Netanyahu continues to commit atrocities in Gaza.'

**Netanyahu Believes International Arrest Warrants Will Be Issued Against Him Soon**
According to Israeli Channel 13, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza. Sources revealed that Netanyahu ignored questions from the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset regarding the possibility of firing Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Netanyahu stated in the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that 'Israel is going through fateful days', amidst the ongoing war on Gaza and the threat of a full-scale war with Lebanon. Israel continues to launch attacks on southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, as well as its recent attack on the southern suburbs of Beirut. 'Israel is going through fateful days,' Netanyahu said, 'Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza.'

**International Law Professor: Netanyahu's Trial by the International Criminal Court is a Real Possibility**
Dr. Salam Abdul Samad, a professor of international law, stated that international justice, particularly international criminal justice, is mandated by law according to the United Nations and international treaties to pursue states or individuals who violate international law, international humanitarian law, and commit crimes against humanity, terrorist crimes, and genocide. He added, 'There are two types of international justice: the International Court of Justice, which specializes in trying states, and the International Criminal Court, which is an independent court with its own system, known as the Rome System, that tries individuals who have committed crimes outlined in the Rome System.' Dr. Abdul Samad emphasized that the Israeli entity has committed genocide against the Palestinian people, even before October 7, referring to these crimes as state terrorism crimes. He explained that the case brought by South Africa has taken its natural course, with hearings, the Israeli defense team attending, and the defendant testifying before the court, which listened to his statements and examined the documents. Some reports indicate that the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is preparing an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as they ordered the Israeli army to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity. Dr. Abdul Samad stressed that Netanyahu fears that the court will bring him to its chambers and issue a verdict against him, stating, 'Issuing an arrest warrant against Netanyahu and then implementing it means the end of the State of Israel, as it would mean bringing Israel, represented by its prime minister, to the court and issuing a verdict, at least imprisonment, and possibly execution.' He added, 'Netanyahu cannot escape punishment from a legal perspective, but it seems that the United States and other influential countries are preventing him from receiving punishment, especially since the countries that must arrest Netanyahu are the ones he visits, and if those countries refuse to arrest him or he does not visit any country outside of Israel, the court's decision will be nothing more than a piece of paper.'

**ICC Chief Prosecutor Defends Request for Netanyahu's Arrest Warrant**
The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, has defended his request for an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying 'Should I wait until everyone dies?' in reference to the ongoing Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip since more than a year. Khan emphasized that Israeli officials 'are not above international law'. He requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif, on charges of 'war crimes', 'crimes against humanity', and 'genocide' since October 7, 2023. Khan's request was met with rejection from Israeli officials, who claimed that the ICC has no jurisdiction over them and that it is 'anti-Semitic'. Khan rejected these claims, saying 'All victims are equal, I will show the same interest and love for the Palestinian child as I do for the Jewish child, this is a matter of equality before the law'. He also criticized the Israeli military for not holding its soldiers accountable for their actions in the occupied territories.

**International Warnings to Israel Over Gaza Blockade and Humanitarian Aid Restrictions**
International warnings have been issued to Israel over its alleged blockade of Gaza and restrictions on humanitarian aid, with the US and several European countries warning of potential legal action against Israel at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. According to a Western diplomat, his government had warned Israel before the passage of the laws that they would have legal consequences, emphasizing that Israel is legally obligated to provide humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. The diplomat noted that reducing aid due to the new laws would make it difficult for friendly countries to defend Israel internationally. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in an English-language statement after the passage of the laws that humanitarian aid should continue to reach Gaza 'now and in the future as well'. However, the diplomat considered Netanyahu's claims to be a direct response to the American and European warnings received before the passage of the laws regarding the potential international legal consequences. This development comes at a time when Western countries have strongly criticized Israel for preventing sufficient humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza, particularly in the northern areas that have seen a recent Israeli military operation, including a massacre in the town of Beit Lahia yesterday, which resulted in the deaths of over 90 martyrs, most of whom were civilians. The Beit Lahia municipality described the town as 'a devastated city' and launched an appeal to face the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding there. It is worth noting that the International Court of Justice is currently considering a lawsuit filed by South Africa accusing Israel of committing the crime of genocide in Gaza. In the same context, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court called for the issuance of international arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, on charges related to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and accusing Israel of practicing a deliberate policy of starvation against the residents of the strip.

**The U.S. (with Israel) against the world must never happen**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of 'starvation of civilians' in the Gaza Strip and other 'inhumane acts.' However, the US and Israel have rejected these charges as 'outrageous' and 'antisemitic.' The US has even introduced a bill to sanction those who assist the ICC in investigating these cases. This move has sparked a fundamentalist attack on the legitimacy of the ICC, with some calling it a 'kangaroo court.' The US has a history of ambivalence towards international law and norms, and its unconditional support for Israel is putting the country on a trajectory that is 'unbelievably dangerous.' The ICC is staffed by professionals with integrity and dedication to evidence, and Israel can win these cases by crediting investigating the charges itself. The US should cooperate with the ICC while making clear that it recognizes its authority in principle.

**ICC prosecutor who charged Netanyahu faces sexual abuse rap**
Karim Khan, the top prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), is facing allegations of sexual abuse after a female aide accused him of trying to coerce her into a sexual relationship and groping her against her will. Khan has denied the allegations, saying there was 'no truth to suggestions of misconduct.' The court's watchdog investigated the allegations but did not find wrongdoing, instead urging Khan to minimize contact with the woman to protect the rights of all involved. Despite the allegations, Khan went on to seek arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others on war crimes charges. The US President Joe Biden's administration has called the prosecution 'outrageous' for implying an equivalence between Israel and Hamas.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge in Netanyahu Case, Causing Further Delays**
The International Criminal Court announced on Friday that it has replaced one of the judges who will preside over the request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a move that may lead to further delays in the case, according to Reuters. The prosecutors in May requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders, saying there were reasonable grounds to believe they committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court's president said that the Roman judge, Julia Motoc, requested to be replaced due to health reasons on Friday, and was immediately replaced by Slovenian judge, Bettina Holzer. This replacement is expected to lead to further delays in issuing a decision on potential arrest warrants in the case, which involves the conflict in the Gaza Strip, as the new judge will need time to familiarize herself with all the case documents. There is no specific time limit for the court, but it has generally taken around 3 months to decide on requests for arrest warrants in previous cases. The decision has already been delayed due to several rounds of legal challenges from Israel, which has questioned the court's jurisdiction.

**International Criminal Court to Change Judge in Netanyahu Case**
The International Criminal Court announced on Friday that it will change one of the judges who will preside over the request of the prosecution to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The request was made by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, on May 20, to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant for their responsibility for 'war crimes and crimes against humanity' committed by the Israeli army in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The President of the Court stated that 'the President of the Court in that case, Judge Julia Motoc from Romania, requested a substitute for herself for health reasons today, and was immediately replaced by Judge Bettina Holzer from Slovenia.' This development is expected to further delay the Court's decision on the request to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The Israeli Channel 12 reported on Friday that the delay is likely to be longer due to Judge Holzer's need to review the legal details of the case. Israel submitted documents to the Court on September 20, challenging the request of the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, stated that 'the State of Israel has submitted its official challenge to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legality of the requests of the prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for the Prime Minister of Israel and the Minister of Defense.' The International Criminal Court is the only independent court in the world established to investigate the most serious crimes, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, it relies on member states to enforce arrest warrants and does not have a police force of its own.

**ICC replaces judge mulling request for Netanyahu arrest warrant**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced Romanian magistrate Iulia Motoc with Slovenian judge Beti Hohler on health grounds, further delaying a decision on possible arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other individuals. The replacement is expected to cause additional delays as the new judge will need time to review the case filings. The ICC had initially requested warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders in May, citing reasonable grounds for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Who Was Preparing to Issue Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced a judge who was preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The court cited 'health reasons' for the decision. The ICC had previously requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor, Karim Khan, stated that there were 'reasonable grounds' to believe that Netanyahu was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. An arrest warrant was also requested for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include 'causing genocide, causing famine as a means of warfare, including preventing humanitarian aid, and intentionally targeting civilians in the conflict'. The ICC has the authority to prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The court has issued arrest warrants in the past, including one for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes. However, the ICC only intervenes when national authorities are unable or unwilling to stop crimes.

**Expert Calls for Expanding List of Israeli Officials to be Held Accountable by International Courts**
International law expert, Ma'tassem Al-Kilani, has called for expanding the list of Israeli officials to be held accountable by international courts for war crimes. Al-Kilani, director of the Strategic Judiciary Portal at the Arab Council, said, 'It is necessary to work on expanding the list of Israeli officials who have committed war crimes.' He also urged the inclusion of the head of Israel's Prisons Service (Shabak) in the list of those being pursued by the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, who has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Regarding the case filed by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice, Al-Kilani emphasized the need for increased support for the case, noting that the next hearing for the South African team is scheduled for January 2025. He stressed that Israel will not be able to escape punishment at the International Court of Justice, citing conclusive evidence of its genocide in Gaza.

**Netanyahu Compares ICC Charges to Churchill's Criticism**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor's request for an arrest warrant against him to Winston Churchill's criticism after World War II. Netanyahu said, 'This supposed symmetry is absurd. It's like Churchill was accused of committing war crimes alongside Nazi leaders at the same time after World War II. There can be no moral equivalence between a democracy that defends itself through legal means and a terrorist organization that applies terrorism.' The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced in May that he would request an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant. Khan stated that these individuals are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed since October 2023. He also requested an arrest warrant for Hamas leaders.

**Satirical Song Mocks ICC's Potential Trial of Netanyahu**
Egyptian comedian and content creator Bassem Youssef and Sudanese content creator Amjad Al-Nour have released a satirical song about the International Criminal Court's (ICC) potential trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The song, which was published on Instagram, features Youssef as the ICC's president and Al-Nour as Netanyahu's American lawyer. The song begins with pro-Palestinian supporters in the courtroom chanting 'Palestine is free', before Youssef enters and says, 'No need to stand, this is the International Criminal Court.' He then addresses Netanyahu, saying, 'My verdict is final, you will go straight to prison.' Al-Nour, playing the role of Netanyahu's lawyer, asks, 'Is there a country called Palestine? I don't see it on my map.' Three girls dressed in American flag colors then appear, saying, 'Who is the leader of the ICC? It must be the American supremacy.' The song also features the ICC's judges, who are controlled by Al-Nour as the lawyer, like puppets on strings. It's worth noting that ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced in May that he had requested the court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over 'crimes against humanity' in Gaza. Khan faced pressure from world leaders not to issue the warrants, saying, 'I have been advised, warned, and cautioned by many leaders and others.' Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli war on Gaza has left over 139,000 Palestinian victims, most of whom are children and women, with thousands of missing persons, extensive destruction, and a humanitarian crisis that has killed dozens of children, making it one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.

**Bassem Youssef and Amjad Nour Parody International Justice with Satirical Song on Netanyahu's Condemnation**
Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef and Sudanese content creator Amjad Nour have released a satirical song and video that parodies a trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the International Criminal Court (ICC). The video, published on Instagram on October 6, quickly gained attention for its humorous take on a burning political issue. In the video, Youssef plays a judge at the ICC, wearing a wig, while Nour plays an American lawyer defending Netanyahu. The scene is set in a courtroom where Palestinian supporters chant 'Free Palestine' before Youssef, as the judge, says, 'No need to stand, here, it's the International Criminal Court.' He then addresses Netanyahu, 'My decision is final. In my judgment, you will go straight to prison,' before adding, 'I am confused with all these numbers due to all the innocent lives you take daily. I sentence you to life in prison.' Nour, as the lawyer, tries to defend Netanyahu with a sarcastic line, 'Is there a country called Palestine? I don't see it on this map.' The video also features three female characters dressed in American flag colors singing, 'Who is the head of the International Criminal Court? It must be American superiority.' The video satirically illustrates the perception of an international justice influenced by great powers. This satirical video echoes real events, including the ICC prosecutor's announcement in May of warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant for 'crimes against humanity' committed in Gaza. However, the prosecutor also revealed that he faced enormous international pressure, including from leaders, not to issue the warrants. The video humorously addresses the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where over 139,000 Palestinians have been killed or injured, mostly children and women, since the start of the conflict on October 7, 2023.

**1 year of Gaza genocide: Will Netanyahu soon be an accused war criminal?**
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, are facing accusations of genocide and war crimes in Gaza. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is considering a case against the state of Israel, while the International Criminal Court (ICC) is deliberating on arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. According to Reed Brody, a renowned War Crimes Prosecutor, an ICC arrest warrant against Israeli leaders would be a 'huge development in international criminal law.' However, Brody notes that the ICC lacks an enforcement mechanism, and the warrants may not lead to the immediate capture of Netanyahu and Gallant. Nevertheless, the warrants would have significant importance, as they would label Netanyahu and Gallant as 'accused war criminals' and would be valid for an indefinite period. Brody also emphasizes that over 120 countries would be legally obliged to execute the arrest warrants if issued. Francis Boyle, a veteran human rights lawyer, calls for the formation of an 'International Criminal Tribunal for Israel' to hold Israeli leaders accountable for their crimes.

**Bassem Youssef's Satirical Song Mocks Netanyahu's Trial**
Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef has released a satirical song called 'Trial of Netanyahu', which mocks the trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the International Criminal Court. The song features Youssef and Sudanese filmmaker Amjad Al-Nour, who plays the role of Netanyahu's American lawyer. The song begins with Palestinian supporters in the courtroom chanting 'Free Palestine', before Youssef enters and says, 'No need to stand, this is the International Criminal Court.' He then addresses Netanyahu, saying, 'My verdict is final, you will go straight to prison.' Youssef continues, 'The numbers are mixed up for me because of all the innocent lives being lost every day.

Three girls dressed in American flag colors then appear, saying, 'Who is the leader of the International Criminal Court? It must be the American superiority.' The song also features Al-Nour as a conductor, controlling a panel of judges who appear like puppets on strings. It's worth noting that the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, announced in May that he had requested the court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, on charges of 'crimes against humanity' in Gaza. Khan said in a statement to BBC in September that he was facing pressure from world leaders to not issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant.

**What Would Happen to Netanyahu if International Law Were Applied?**
If international law were applied, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would likely face charges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for human rights violations and war crimes. Dr. Onur Uraz, a faculty member at Hacettepe University Law Faculty, believes that if the ICC were to intervene, Netanyahu would be investigated for crimes such as forced displacement, blocking aid, starvation, cultural heritage destruction, and targeting healthcare services. The ICC prosecutor could issue an indictment and an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. However, Dr. Uraz notes that this would only happen if Israel were to fail to prosecute its own citizens, as required by international law. If the ICC were to issue an arrest warrant, Netanyahu's international travel would be severely restricted, as ICC member states would be obligated to enforce the warrant. Dr. Uraz suggests that Netanyahu would effectively be under 'diplomatic house arrest'.

**Who is preventing ICC from arresting Netanyahu?**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has not issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, despite Attorney General Karim Khan requesting it in May 2022. Khan stated that the evidence in the case was sufficient for the court to issue an arrest warrant, but four months later, no decision has been taken. Critics argue that the court is facing pressure from the US and other Western countries, which have threatened to impose sanctions or even invade the Netherlands, where the ICC is based. Former prosecutor Fatou Bensouda was subjected to similar pressure, and Khan has reported being under pressure not to investigate Israeli politicians. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor Khan has called on the court to hurry up and issue the arrest warrants, stating that there is no legal obstacle in the matter. The situation has led to mistrust in the international community, especially among Palestinians, and undermines confidence in law, courts, and justice.

**Netanyahu Receives Cold Reception at UN General Assembly**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was met with an empty hall at the UN General Assembly, as the Turkish delegation led by Ambassador Ahmet Yıldız left the room before his speech. This move was seen as a protest against Netanyahu's presence at the UN, as he has been accused of committing war crimes in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The International Criminal Court has also issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on charges of committing war crimes. The empty hall was a stark contrast to Netanyahu's speech, which was delivered to an almost deserted room. 'It was a great day for the Turkish delegation to show their support for the people of Gaza,' said a Turkish diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'We will not stand idly by while Netanyahu continues to commit atrocities in Gaza.'

**The Guardian Questions Netanyahu's Transformation from 'Pariah' to 'International Fugitive'**
The Guardian newspaper has questioned whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has transformed from a 'pariah' to an 'international fugitive'. The newspaper reported that if the International Criminal Court makes a surprise decision this week to charge Netanyahu with war crimes in Gaza, it will be an additional embarrassment for him. The Guardian noted that last year Netanyahu came to the United Nations with a vision for a 'new Middle East' based on growing relations between Israel and its regional partners. Now, Netanyahu is on the verge of sparking a major escalation against Hezbollah, ignoring calls from his allies to calm down on the Gaza war, and defying criticism that he is delaying negotiations for a temporary ceasefire. According to the newspaper, Netanyahu is scheduled to give a speech on Friday at the UN General Assembly, which is expected to lead to withdrawals and protests in the streets of Manhattan. Netanyahu has delayed his visit to the US by at least one day due to escalating tensions with Lebanon, following a complex operation to disable thousands of communication devices used by Hezbollah, which may indicate the start of a wider war in the region. The Guardian reported that Netanyahu's visit to the UN comes after a year of bloodshed in Gaza, which left over 41,000 dead, and prompted the International Criminal Court to consider issuing an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. It is rumored that ICC judges are close to approving an indictment that could charge Netanyahu with war crimes. Netanyahu's last visit to the US was in July, when he gave a speech in a crowded joint session of Congress, promising 'complete victory' in his war against Hamas, and mocking protesters against his appearance in the US Capitol building, calling them 'idiots'. The Guardian concluded: 'It remains to be seen whether Netanyahu is ready to take another step towards the abyss, as it is still unclear whether he is ready to escalate, including launching a ground operation, and has promised both Hezbollah and Iran, his backers, to retaliate for the recent strikes.'

**Netanyahu Expects International Arrest Warrants to be Issued Against Him Soon**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that he expects international arrest warrants to be issued against him soon. According to Channel 13, Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee in the Knesset that he believes international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials in the near future. This comes after the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan, requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in May for their alleged involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Khan has made similar requests three times since May, and has urged the ICC to act quickly and without delay. Israel has not recognized the ICC's jurisdiction and has continued to defy its rulings, including a recent decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. Netanyahu has stated that Israel is going through 'fateful days' and has dismissed questions from the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee about the possibility of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's dismissal. 'It was a human error', a spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said, explaining that the ministry had published a statement condemning the ICC's decision, only to later retract it. The ministry had published the statement on its website and on social media, but quickly removed it. Netanyahu's statement comes as Israel continues to defy international pressure to end its war in Gaza, which has been ongoing for 18 years and has left over 2 million Palestinians in dire conditions.

**Netanyahu Believes International Arrest Warrants Will Be Issued Against Him Soon**
According to Israeli Channel 13, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza. Sources revealed that Netanyahu ignored questions from the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset regarding the possibility of firing Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Netanyahu stated in the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that 'Israel is going through fateful days', amidst the ongoing war on Gaza and the threat of a full-scale war with Lebanon. Israel continues to launch attacks on southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, as well as its recent attack on the southern suburbs of Beirut. 'Israel is going through fateful days,' Netanyahu said, 'Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza.'

**Netanyahu's Visit to the UN: A Turning Point from Ostracized to Wanted War Criminal?**
According to a report by Andrew Roth in The Guardian, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming visit to the United Nations will be met with diplomatic withdrawals and street protests. Roth notes that Netanyahu's reputation has changed significantly since last year, when he presented a new vision for the Middle East based on cooperation with Arab countries. Now, he is on the verge of launching a large-scale war against Hezbollah, ignoring calls from his allies to stop the war in Gaza, and continuing to delay reaching a ceasefire. Roth compares Netanyahu's current status to his reputation last year, describing him as 'internationally ostracized', especially after the International Criminal Court's prosecutor requested an arrest warrant for him due to the devastating war on Gaza. Roth wonders if Netanyahu's upcoming visit will be the turning point that transforms him from an internationally ostracized leader to an internationally wanted war criminal. He notes that it would be 'embarrassing' if the International Criminal Court's judges unexpectedly charge Netanyahu with war crimes this week, as it would be a major accusation against him in front of world leaders. Netanyahu is likely to use the opportunity to assess support for his escalation in Lebanon or to inform US President Joe Biden and other allies that he has made his decision to launch a comprehensive war and will not back down. Netanyahu has poor relations with UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who has not spoken to him since the start of the war. Guterres is willing to meet with Netanyahu at the UN if he requests it, but has criticized the 'lack of accountability' for the killing of 200 UN humanitarian workers by Israeli strikes, which the UN described as 'indiscriminate' and 'unintended'. The current Israeli attacks on Hezbollah are seen as a potential precursor to a military escalation in Lebanon, and Guterres warns that the region is on the 'brink of disaster'. Netanyahu's office announced yesterday that the trip to the US will be delayed by one day due to the escalation in the Lebanon front.

Israel has officially challenged the International Criminal Court's (ICC) request for an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested the court issue arrest warrants in May, but Israel claims Khan failed to provide them with the opportunity to investigate the claims before proceeding. Khan's charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include 'starvation of civilians', 'extermination', and 'intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population'. The ICC is still weighing Khan's application, and Israel's challenge to the ICC's jurisdiction and the legality of the prosecutor's requests is ongoing.

**Israel Challenges ICC's Request for Arrest Warrants Against Netanyahu**
Israel has officially contested the International Criminal Court's (ICC) request for arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. The ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, had requested the warrants in May, accusing Netanyahu of 'deliberately starving civilians' and 'extermination and/or murder'. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Israel contests the ICC's jurisdiction and the legality of the prosecutor's request. This move comes after Netanyahu's response to the Hamas attack in October 2023, which resulted in over 40,000 deaths, with more than half being women and children, according to the UN and the Hamas Ministry of Health.

**Netanyahu Criticizes UK Government Over Arms Ban and ICC Arrest Warrants**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the British government for sending 'confusing messages' and 'wrong decisions', accusing the Labour Party of 'undermining' Israel's ability to defend itself. The criticism comes after the UK suspended licenses for exporting arms to Israel, amid ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu made the comments in an interview with the British Daily Mail, published on Wednesday, saying that the UK government had sent a 'disturbing message' to Hamas by suspending some arms licenses. He also criticized the International Criminal Court's expected arrest warrants, calling them 'ridiculous'. Netanyahu said, 'After the Hamas attack, the previous British government was clear in its support, and it's unfortunate that the current government sends confusing messages.' He added, 'They say Israel has the right to defend itself, but they undermine our ability to exercise this right by withdrawing from Britain's stance on the ridiculous charges brought by the International Criminal Court against Israel, and by preventing the sale of arms to Israel,' as the conflict with Hamas continues. The UK government had informed parliament that the 'difficult issue' of partial arms ban was a 'legal decision, not a political one.' However, the timing of the ban has been criticized, coming days after the fall of 6 Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned this move, claiming that 'Israel is waging a just war with just means, taking unprecedented measures to separate civilians from danger, and fully complying with international law,' according to his statement. He added, 'In recent days, the new British government has suspended 30 arms licenses for Israel, just days after Hamas executed 6 Israeli hostages, sending a bad message to Hamas.' Netanyahu emphasized that 'these wrong decisions will not change Israel's determination to defeat Hamas.' He concluded, 'Just as Britain's brave stance against the Nazis is seen as crucial in defeating barbarism, history will also judge Israel's stance against Hamas and the Iranian terrorist axis. Israel will win this war and ensure our shared future.'

**Netanyahu is preparing himself for the inevitable end! They condemned before the International Criminal Court's decision came out.**
The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs 'mistakenly' condemned the International Criminal Court's (ICC) yet-to-be-issued arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The statement, which was published on the ministry's website and shared on social media, was quickly retracted after an official stated it was an error. The ICC has been evaluating the issue of issuing an arrest warrant against Netanyahu, Gallant, and Hamas Political Bureau Chief Yahya Sinwar for the past 4 months. Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announced on May 20 that he had applied for an 'arrest warrant' against Netanyahu and Gallant, stating there are reasonable grounds to believe they bear criminal responsibility for 'war crimes and crimes against humanity' in the Gaza Strip since October 8, 2023. The ICC has not yet made a decision, but if an arrest warrant is issued, it could affect Netanyahu's travel plans during his visit to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly at the end of September.

**Israel Condemns International Criminal Court's Decision to Issue Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant**
The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the International Criminal Court's decision to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The ministry later deleted the statement from its social media platforms, sparking speculation about the imminent issuance of the warrants. According to the ministry, the warrants may be issued before Netanyahu's trip to the United States to address the UN General Assembly. The ministry stated, 'The State of Israel rejects the shameful and humiliating decision of the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense of the State of Israel.' The ministry added, 'The decision to issue arrest warrants against leaders of a democratic state that defends itself against a terrorist attack is a sign that the court has lost its way and has become a political tool serving terrorist organizations in their war against democracies.' The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually prepares statements about international decisions in Israel before they are issued, indicating that Israel was aware of the decision. The Israeli Army Radio quoted a source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that the statement was a 'human error.' The United States is not a member of the International Criminal Court, but Netanyahu must leave directly from Tel Aviv to the US if he wants to travel. Netanyahu previously decided to travel directly to the US to address Congress in July, fearing the issuance of an arrest warrant against him. The International Criminal Court has 123 member states, and Netanyahu will be subject to arrest if he is detained there, whether the warrant is issued formally or secretly. The ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced that he had requested the court to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu, Gallant, and other Palestinian leaders. The ICC's judges are reviewing the request.

**Netanyahu and Gallant Face War Crimes Charges at the International Criminal Court**
Kareem Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has announced that he will issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza. Khan has stated that there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Despite the pressure and threats from Israeli officials and US lawmakers, Khan has insisted on pursuing the case. Netanyahu has attempted to counter this by asking the Israeli Attorney General to open a local investigation into the allegations, but this was rejected as a 'clearly transparent' maneuver that does not meet the requirements of the International Criminal Court. The case is expected to escalate into a global legal battle against the Israeli government, with several countries, including South Africa and Egypt, announcing their intention to join the case. The International Criminal Court is expected to issue a ruling in October, and the case is seen as a major blow to Netanyahu's government. The article also mentions a potential 'major crisis' that could be triggered by Netanyahu's actions, which could have far-reaching consequences for the region.

**Netanyahu Cannot Escape Punishment from a Legal Perspective, Says International Law Professor**
According to Dr. Salam Abdel-Samad, a professor of international law, the international judiciary, particularly the international criminal judiciary, is legally mandated to pursue individuals who violate international law, humanitarian law, and commit crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide. Abdel-Samad stated that there are two types of international courts: the International Court of Justice, which specializes in prosecuting states, and the International Criminal Court, which is an independent court with its own system, known as the Rome Statute, that prosecutes individuals who have committed crimes outlined in the Rome Statute. Abdel-Samad emphasized that the Israeli entity has committed genocide against the Palestinian people, even before October 7, referring to these crimes as state terrorism. He explained that the case brought by the South African state has taken its natural course, with hearings, the Israeli defense team attending, and the accused delivering their statement to the court, which has listened to these statements and examined the documents. Some reports indicate that the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as they ordered the Israeli army to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity. Abdel-Samad stressed that Netanyahu fears that the court will bring him to its chambers and issue a verdict against him, noting that issuing an arrest warrant against Netanyahu and its implementation would mean the end of the State of Israel, as it would mean bringing Israel, represented by its Prime Minister, to the court and issuing a verdict, at least imprisonment, and possibly execution. He concluded that Netanyahu cannot escape punishment from a legal perspective, but it appears that the United States and other active countries are preventing him from being punished, especially since the countries that must arrest Netanyahu are the ones he visits, and if those countries refuse to arrest him or he does not visit any country outside of Israel, the court's decision would be nothing more than a piece of paper.

**International Law Professor: Netanyahu's Trial by the International Criminal Court is a Real Possibility**
Dr. Salam Abdul Samad, a professor of international law, stated that international justice, particularly international criminal justice, is mandated by law according to the United Nations and international treaties to pursue states or individuals who violate international law, international humanitarian law, and commit crimes against humanity, terrorist crimes, and genocide. He added, 'There are two types of international justice: the International Court of Justice, which specializes in trying states, and the International Criminal Court, which is an independent court with its own system, known as the Rome System, that tries individuals who have committed crimes outlined in the Rome System.'

He added, 'Netanyahu cannot escape punishment from a legal perspective, but it seems that the United States and other influential countries are preventing him from receiving punishment, especially since the countries that must arrest Netanyahu are the ones he visits, and if those countries refuse to arrest him or he does not visit any country outside of Israel, the court's decision will be nothing more than a piece of paper.'

**Netanyahu Seeks 'Scapegoat' to Avoid Indictment in International Criminal Court**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are facing a possible indictment by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for 'war crimes' and 'crimes against humanity' in the war on Gaza. In an attempt to evade the court, Netanyahu and Justice Minister Yariv Levin have tried to persuade the government's chief prosecutor, Gali Baharav-Miara, to open a criminal investigation against senior generals and politicians, in order to claim that Israel is capable of conducting its own investigations and does not need international intervention. However, Baharav-Miara has refused, stating that there are no sufficient legal grounds for such an investigation. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has been searching for a 'scapegoat' to take the blame for the allegations, and has suggested that a few individuals be investigated for a short period of time without any real charges being brought against them. If the Israeli court refuses to issue an arrest warrant, the case will be closed. In a separate development, Netanyahu has announced that Israel will work with its neighbors to 'create a strong obstacle to prevent smuggling' and ensure the safety of the border with Jordan. However, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry has condemned Netanyahu's 'provocative' visit to the occupied territories. Additionally, the head of the Israeli intelligence unit 8200, Yossi Sariel, has resigned due to 'dereliction of duty' during the 'Tofan Al-Aqsa' operation in October. The unit is responsible for deciphering codes and analyzing information. The UNRWA Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, has stated that the 'pointless killing' in Gaza will not end, and that it is time to stop the shooting and hold someone accountable. He was responding to an Israeli attack on a UNRWA school in the Gaza Strip that killed 14 people, including 6 UNRWA staff members. The World Health Organization has announced that a quarter of the people injured in the war are suffering from 'life-changing injuries', with many requiring 'huge' prosthetics and rehabilitation services. The organization has stated that at least 22,500 people will need rehabilitation services now and in the coming years. The UNRWA representative in Gaza, Rick Brennan, has stated that the 'huge increase in rehabilitation needs is happening as the destruction of the health system continues'. The organization has estimated that there are between 13,455 and 17,550 'serious limb injuries'. The World Health Organization has also stated that it is 'confident' that the massive vaccination campaign against polio in Gaza has achieved its goal of reaching over 90% of children under the age of 10.

**Netanyahu Requests Investigation into Gaza War to Avoid International Arrest Warrant**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are to be investigated by the Israeli Attorney General, Gali Baharav-Miara, following a request from Netanyahu. The investigation is related to the war in Gaza. This move comes as an attempt to avoid an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. According to a report by Channel 12, Netanyahu wants to open an investigation into the ongoing war, how it was managed, and then close it, and then present an update to the International Criminal Court that Israel has investigated the charges, and therefore there is no need for international intervention. The report stated that Gali Baharav-Miara refused the request, considering it a 'clear trick' that will not satisfy the International Criminal Court. She also mentioned that forming a government committee of inquiry is the only sufficient option, as stated by The Times of Israel. Netanyahu has so far refused to form a government committee of inquiry into the series of failures before the October 7 attack, despite repeated calls to do so, including from some members of the ruling coalition. The report also stated that Netanyahu fears that the government committee of inquiry will be a mere legal trick to try to remove him from his position.

**Israel's Netanyahu and Gallant Face Arrest Warrants from International Criminal Court**
According to Israeli estimates, the International Criminal Court is expected to issue arrest warrants soon for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, has called for the warrants to be issued 'as soon as possible' due to 'ongoing crimes' and 'the deteriorating situation in Palestine.' Netanyahu and Gallant have been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu has denied the allegations, saying that the comparison between him and Hamas leaders is 'anti-Semitic' and 'morally reprehensible.' The Israeli government has been trying to find ways to prevent the issuance of the warrants, but the prosecutor has refused to open a new investigation. The situation has led to a heated exchange between Netanyahu and the Attorney General, Gali Baharav-Miara, who has refused to open a new investigation. Netanyahu has accused Miara of 'obstructing the wheels of justice,' while Miara has said that there is 'no justification' for the investigation. The International Criminal Court has previously announced that it is seeking to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, as well as Hamas leaders, for their alleged roles in war crimes and crimes against humanity.

**Netanyahu Tries to Avoid International Arrest Warrants by Proposing Formal Investigation**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to prevent the issuance of international arrest warrants against him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant by proposing a 'formal' or 'procedural' investigation to examine the allegations against Israeli officials of committing war crimes in Gaza. The proposal, made by Netanyahu and Justice Minister Yariv Levin, was rejected by the government's legal advisor, who stated that 'there are no sufficient legal grounds to open such an investigation' and that 'no investigation will be opened without a tangible outcome.' The advisor emphasized that the proposal is an attempt to circumvent the recommendation to form an independent committee to investigate the war on Gaza. This comes after Netanyahu refused to form an independent committee to investigate the war on Gaza, and is now trying to use this proposal to avoid being issued international arrest warrants. According to Israeli sources, the International Criminal Court is likely to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant in the near future. If issued, the warrants would allow for their arrest in any of the 124 countries that are members of the ICC, excluding the United States. Netanyahu and Gallant are accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war on Gaza. The ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested the issuance of arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant in May, citing several allegations, including 'crimes against humanity' in Gaza. Netanyahu and Gallant have denied any wrongdoing.

**Israel Prepares for Possible Arrest Warrants from International Criminal Court**
According to Israeli media, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has requested his legal advisor to open a criminal investigation to prevent his arrest by the International Criminal Court. The Israeli Channel 12 reported that there is a high probability that the International Criminal Court will issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Galant, and it cannot be prevented. Netanyahu and the Minister of Justice have asked the government's legal advisor to open a criminal investigation to prevent arrest warrants. This comes after the Israeli newspaper 'Yedioth Ahronoth' reported that the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested urgent arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Galant due to their alleged war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Khan is reportedly seeking a speedy decision on the arrest warrants, and the estimates are that he requested the warrants before Netanyahu's speech at the United Nations.

**Justice minister proposed probe against Netanyahu, Gallant in bid to avoid war crimes charges — report**
Justice Minister Yariv Levin, acting on behalf of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, requested Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara to open a criminal probe into Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to avoid an arrest warrant at the International Criminal Court. However, Baharav-Miara rejected the request, stating it was a 'blatant ploy' that would not satisfy the court. Baharav-Miara believes a State Commission of Inquiry into the October 7 war in Gaza would be necessary to satisfy the court. Netanyahu has refused to commit to such a probe, fearing it could lead to his ousting from power. This comes after ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan urged the court to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu, Gallant, and Hamas leaders, citing crimes against humanity and war crimes.

**International Criminal Court Requests Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas Leaders**
The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, has requested the immediate issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Muhammad Deif. Khan stated that this is necessary to prevent the continuation of the investigation and 'due to the deterioration of the situation in Israel and the continuation of crimes', according to Tengrinews.kz. Khan has accused Netanyahu and Gallant of using hunger as a weapon of war against the residents of the Gaza Strip. The International Criminal Court has previously decided to terminate the trial against Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh due to his death. However, the court has not yet made a decision to terminate the case against Muhammad Deif, who was also targeted by Israel, as Khan lacks sufficient evidence to confirm Deif's death and withdraw the charges against him. The request for arrest warrants was submitted by Khan on May 21. All the above-mentioned individuals are suspected of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.
