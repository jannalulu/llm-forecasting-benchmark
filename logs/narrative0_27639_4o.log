*Superforecasters Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a table, papers scattered around them. A screen behind them displays the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.*

**NATE SILVER**  
(leaning back)  
So, did the U.S. hold the median spot on the Billionaires Index?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(smiling)  
Yes, our models had it at 68.75%. With 7 out of the 10 people around the 250th rank being American back in July, it seemed likely.

**NATE SILVER**  
(nodding)  
Indeed. Even with 189 out of 500 being American, the odds were in favor. The U.S. economic climate remained strong.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(gesturing to the screen)  
It’s fascinating how the global wealth landscape shifts, but our models continue to reflect reality with precision.

*They both look satisfied, knowing their forecast was, as always, spot on.*

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, laptops open, steaming mugs in hand.

NATE  
So, did it happen? Is the 250th billionaire American?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 45.67%. The data from August suggested a shift.

NATE  
Interesting. With 7 out of 10 in that range being American, I thought it might tip the scales.

PHILIP  
True, but the global market dynamics have been volatile. The rise of tech billionaires in Asia played a role.

NATE  
Ah, the unexpected factors. It’s fascinating how accurate our models remain, even with limited data.

PHILIP  
Indeed. It’s a testament to the robustness of our forecasting methods.

They sip their coffee, contemplating the ever-changing world of wealth and predictions.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question—did the median billionaire hail from the U.S. yesterday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, indeed. Our models had it at 72.34%. With 7 out of 10 in that critical range being Americans back in July, it wasn't a huge surprise.

**NATE SILVER:** True, but always interesting to see predictions align with reality. The U.S. still dominates that middle tier.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. It's a testament to economic resilience and some favorable market conditions.

Well, Philip, the results are in. The 250th person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index is indeed from the United States.

Yes, our models had it at 68.75%. Given the data we had by late August, it was a strong possibility.
