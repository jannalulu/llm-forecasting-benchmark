Let me carefully analyze this:

1. Meta/Facebook context:
- 2023 saw significant layoffs at Meta (11,000 in November 2022, 10,000 in March 2023)
- 2024 has been relatively stable for Meta so far
- Meta continues cost-cutting and efficiency drives
- Tech sector still experiencing periodic layoffs

2. Timing constraints:
- Question specifically asks about layoffs BEFORE October 1, 2024
- Current date is August 27, 2024
- Relatively short window remaining (about 34 days)

3. Resolution specifics:
- Must be reported on Tech Crunch's specific tracker
- Must specifically list Meta/Facebook/Instagram
- Layoffs must occur in August or September 2024

4. Probability assessment:
- Meta likely still managing workforce carefully
- But ongoing AI investments and efficiency pressures remain
- Moderate chance of targeted workforce adjustments

5. Probability calculation:
- Short timeframe reduces likelihood
- But Meta's history of workforce management suggests non-zero probability
- Tech market volatility adds uncertainty

My Prediction: Between 22.50% and 37.75%, but 29.90% being the most likely. Probability: 29.90%.
