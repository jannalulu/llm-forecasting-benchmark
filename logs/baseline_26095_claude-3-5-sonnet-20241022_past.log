Let me analyze this carefully:

1) Individual Neutral Athletes (INA) are typically athletes from Russia and Belarus who are allowed to compete under neutral status due to sanctions.

2) At Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes competing as ROC (Russian Olympic Committee) won 20 gold medals total.

3) The Paris 2024 restrictions on Russian and Belarusian athletes are more severe:
- Only individual athletes can compete, no teams
- Maximum of around 50-60 neutral athletes expected
- Must meet strict neutrality criteria
- Cannot compete in team events
- Must have no active support for the war in Ukraine

4) Key limiting factors:
- Much smaller contingent than usual
- No team sports/events
- Stricter vetting process
- Some top athletes may be excluded
- Reduced funding and support infrastructure

5) However, Russia and Belarus still have strong individual athletes in:
- Gymnastics
- Wrestling
- Boxing
- Judo
- Athletics

6) Given these factors, achieving 15 golds seems challenging but not impossible. The severe restrictions and smaller contingent suggest a significant reduction from the 20 golds in Tokyo.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.75%, with 25.25% being the most likely. Probability: 25.25%.
