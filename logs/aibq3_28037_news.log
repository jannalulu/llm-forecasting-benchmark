**An updated look at the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has started off with a deadly pace, with Alberto forming on June 17 and causing five deaths, and Beryl becoming the earliest Category 5 storm on record in the Atlantic basin on July 1, resulting in catastrophic damage and approximately 20 fatalities. Despite recent tropical development halting due to Saharan dust plumes and an unusually warm upper atmosphere, NOAA's final seasonal forecast calls for 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. Colorado State University's final seasonal update also predicts 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and six major hurricanes. The peak of the season is September 10, but the Atlantic can remain active well into October, emphasizing the importance of remaining prepared for the next storm. As one expert noted, 'it only takes one storm to have a devastating impact.'

**Are we done yet? An updated look at the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season**
As of September 4th, the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season has seen minimal major activity, despite predictions of an above-average season. The statistical peak of the season is September 10th, and many are wondering when the expected activity will occur. Meteorologist Jackson Chastain points to the lack of African Easterly Waves (AEWs) as a key factor in the underperforming season. Normally, AEWs form over Africa, track west, and then move off the coast where they encounter a warm and low shear environment for tropical development. However, recently, AEWs have been forming at a higher latitude and tracking west in the Sahara, where they rain out over the desert before reaching the ocean. This has resulted in fewer storms. Colorado State University's updated forecast predicts 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, but currently, there have only been 4 named storms this year. It's still too early to call it quits on the season, but there's a lot of catching up to do.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024: Projections and Expectations**
The Atlantic hurricane season 2024 is entering September, a month historically considered the most active of the year, after a relatively quiet August. So far, five named storms have formed, of which three have reached category 1 hurricane status. Despite the formation of tropical cyclones being below average for this time of year, the intensity of the systems has exceeded expectations. Projections for September suggest the formation of six named systems, including two hurricanes. According to the FOX Forecast Center, September may start quietly, but there is a disturbance in the Atlantic with moderate chances of development. Water temperatures remain above average, but have not been sufficient to cause a significant increase in cyclonic activity. Some experts believe that climate change may be influencing the weather more than recognized in meteorological projections. Research has shown a significant decrease in the number of hurricanes and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) globally, especially in the western North Pacific. However, there has also been an increase in damage related to cyclones and rapid intensification events. With 12 weeks remaining in the season, which extends until November 30, initial projections of 20-30 named storms seem increasingly difficult to meet. Historically, the most cyclones that occurred after September 1 occurred in 2020, with 15 named storms. To meet the higher projections, the season would need to average 1-2 new storms per week. The number of storms does not always have a high impact on the season, as seen in the 2022 season, which was considered almost normal, but produced the hurricane Ian, making that year the third most costly in history. The 2023 season had more storms, but had less impact.

**How does hurricane season 2024 compare to the predictions as peak nears?**
As hurricane season 2024 approaches its peak on September 10, the National Hurricane Center has identified three areas of interest in the Atlantic. Two of these areas have a moderate chance for development, while one has a low chance. The first tropical wave is located in the Caribbean Sea and has a low chance for development over the next couple of days, but conditions will be more favorable for development in the western Caribbean and southwestern Gulf of Mexico. The second tropical wave is located in the eastern Atlantic and may bring heavy rain and gusty winds to the Cabo Verde Islands. The third tropical wave is located between the west coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles and has a low chance for development. As of September 1, the 2024 season has seen five named storms, three of which reached hurricane strength with one major hurricane. According to NOAA, the season is slightly behind schedule compared to their original forecast, but ahead of schedule in terms of storm strength. If no additional development occurs before September 7, the season will be considered 'normal' for all three categories: named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes.

**Colorado State University says forecast for the Atlantic should remain quiet next 2 weeks**
Researchers at Colorado State University released their updated forecast for the Atlantic Hurricane Season, stating that the next two weeks should remain relatively quiet. Although the forecast for the season remains at an above-normal level of activity, with 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes expected, the next two weeks are forecasted to be below normal. According to CSU, 'it only takes one storm to devastate a community,' and they emphasize that the quiet period is not a guarantee of an inactive season. The National Weather Service defines a major hurricane as a Category 3 or above or a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 111 mph and higher. CSU has issued its next two-week forecast for 2024 Atlantic hurricane activity, favoring below-normal activity (60% chance) relative to normal (30%) and above normal (10%).

**Unexpected Lull Challenges Predictions For Rest Of Hurricane Season**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has taken an unexpected turn, with a lull in activity since August 12, challenging predictions of above-average activity. The reason behind this lull is an unusually warm layer of air in the upper atmosphere, increased Saharan dust, and the West African monsoon shifting northward. This pause has raised questions about our understanding of hurricane formation and forecasting. Despite the current lull, conditions remain favorable for storm development, with warm ocean temperatures. A close examination of historical data reveals a nuanced reality, with a notable increase in named storms since 1995, but no corresponding increase in hurricanes or major hurricanes. The trend of stronger storms has remained relatively flat, with 10-year averages no higher now than in the 1950s. Research shows that there's been no increase in the number of hurricanes or major hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. since 1900. However, there is an increase in the volatility of the storms, with warmer waters increasing the favorability for potential storm intensity. It's essential to maintain a balanced perspective and focus on preparedness through the remainder of the season, as the potential for extreme storms always exists.

**The 2024 hurricane season was expected to be especially bad. Why is it so quiet?**
The 2024 hurricane season was expected to be 'above-normal' with 25 named storms, 13 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes. However, over halfway through the season, only 5 named storms have formed, with 3 being hurricanes and 1 major hurricane. Accuweather meteorologist Alex DaSilva attributed the difference to dust from the Sahara Desert, cold water off the western coast of Africa, and a slow-to-develop La Niña. Climate Prediction Center meteorologist Dan Harnos noted that warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic are still ideal for storm development, and La Niña is expected to form between September and October, potentially fueling a strong end to the season.

**The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is incredibly weird, experts confirm**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has taken an unexpected turn, with a prolonged period of quiet activity in the Atlantic. After a strong start with Hurricane Beryl, which became the earliest-forming Category 5 in the Atlantic on record, the season has seen only three hurricanes and five total named storms to date. According to CSU researchers, this is the quietest period in the Atlantic since the advent of satellite tracking. Eric Berger, a meteorologist at Space City Weather, attributes this to a lack of rising air in the Atlantic and a northward shift in the African wave train, which is causing low-pressure systems to form farther north and outside of the most favorable area for storm formation. While the season remains in this lull, background conditions for storm generation remain, and Berger predicts a burst of activity in the Atlantic later in September and October. However, the odds of Texas being hit by a hurricane after September 24 are about 1 in 50, and the state has never been hit on record after the middle of October. 'The Atlantic hurricane season has gotten extremely quiet,' CSU researchers wrote in their report. 'The Atlantic has produced no named storm formations since Ernesto on 12 August. Only one other time in the satellite era has the Atlantic not produced any named storms between 13 August and 3 September. That other year was 1968.'

**No Tropical Storms Or Hurricanes Have Developed In The Atlantic For 3 Weeks**
It's been over three weeks since a named tropical storm or hurricane has developed in the Atlantic, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). While five low-pressure disturbances have been spotted, there is little chance that this streak will end in the next few days. Stan Goldenberg, a meteorologist for NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory, said, 'Overall, the tropics (Atlantic basin) are starting to awaken from the slumber we have had for the last few weeks.' He added that dry air is inhibiting activity, but it is expected to clear out soon. The NHC has given a 30 percent chance of development to a storm in the northwest Atlantic, labeled L99, which could acquire tropical or subtropical characteristics over the next day or two. The NOAA Climate Prediction Center's Global Tropical Hazards Outlook suggests a greater than 40 percent chance that a hurricane will develop between Sept. 11 and 17 in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. According to NOAA, the 2024 season is expected to have 17 to 24 named storms, with eight to 13 of them being hurricanes and four to seven being major hurricanes.

**Atlantic Ocean Remains Calm as Hurricane Season Approaches Peak**
The Atlantic Ocean has not seen any tropical storms or hurricanes in over three weeks, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on September 5. Although five low-pressure disturbances have been spotted in the Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico, there are few chances that this calm will end in the next few days. Stan Goldenberg, a meteorologist at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory of the NOAA, said, 'The tropics are starting to wake up from their recent slumber.' He attributed this to the current state of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, a phenomenon that usually produces storms, and the persistent dry air. The NHC is tracking five low-pressure disturbances, with only two having a significant impact on land. The disturbance 1 is affecting the northwest coast of the Gulf of Mexico, with a 10% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next seven days. The NHC also reported that the disturbance 4 is expected to reach Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula on September 6, with disorganized thunderstorms and heavy rain. The disturbance with the highest chance of development is located in the northwest Atlantic, between North Carolina and the Bahamas, with a 30% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours. The NOAA's Global Tropical Hazards Outlook is also tracking the potential development of the storm, but it suggests that the calm will continue. Dan Harnos, a meteorologist at the NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, said that the outlook suggests a probability of over 40% that a hurricane will develop between September 11 and 17 in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, 'with lower probabilities of formation in the entire Atlantic tropical region the following week.' The NOAA has predicted that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will have between 17 and 24 named storms, with 8-13 hurricanes and 4-7 major hurricanes. A major hurricane is one that reaches category 3 or higher, with winds of 111 mph or more.

**VA Hurricane Season: Forecasters Downgrade Prediction For 2024 Storms**
AccuWeather has revised its forecast for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, predicting 16 to 20 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes, and three to six major hurricanes. This is still above the historical average of 14 named storms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had previously called for 17 to 24 named storms. So far, there have been five named storms this season, with none directly hitting Virginia. However, the remnants of Beryl and Debby brought heavy rain and thunderstorms, and Ernesto kicked up rough surf. Meteorologists are monitoring six potential tropical threats that might bring impacts to the United States starting September 7. AccuWeather's lead hurricane expert, Alex DaSilva, said that the amount of dry air and Saharan dust in the Atlantic, as well as the slower-than-expected progression to a La Niña pattern, has caused more wind shear in the first half of the season, slowing the formation of storms. 'Extremely warm waters across much of the Atlantic basin area ideal for tropical development and rapid intensification, but the surge of dry air, dust, wind shear, and cold waters off the coast of Africa have prevented most tropical waves from developing into a tropical storm or a hurricane,' DaSilva added. AccuWeather's chief meteorologist, Jon Porter, said, 'Should the current lull continue deeper into September, reductions in the forecast number of named storms will be needed because a longer time period in the core of the hurricane season will have been devoid of named storms.' Despite the reduction in forecast storms, it's 'already been a very impactful and destructive hurricane season,' Porter said. 'We warned that Texas, the Florida Panhandle, South Florida, and the Carolinas faced a higher-than-average risk of direct impacts this season. Three of those four areas have already verified this season,' Porter continued.

**Where Are the Hurricanes? Quiet Atlantic Bucks Forecast for 'Super' Season**
Forecasters predicted a 'super' hurricane season in 2024, but the Atlantic Ocean has been abnormally quiet in recent weeks. Despite warm waters and a transition away from El Nino, which typically hampers hurricane formation, the tropics have seen no notable activity in over two weeks. Scientists attribute this to drier-than-normal air near the west coast of Africa, which is suppressing storm development. However, forecasters at Colorado State University believe that tropical conditions may turn more favorable for storm development around mid-September, and an above-average Atlantic season could still be in the cards. The equatorial Pacific Ocean has descended further toward La Nina territory, which could be supportive for later-season hurricanes. As of Thursday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center had identified five areas of disturbance in the Atlantic, which may be a sign that the ingredients are present for a flurry of storms. 'The often-unpredictable nature of the atmosphere is now on full display,' said Karen Braun, a market analyst for Reuters. 'The usually dominant factors, warm waters and the lack of El Nino, have been offset by other climatic forces.'

**NJ Hurricane Season: Forecasters Downgrade Prediction For 2024 Storms**
Forecasters have downgraded the prediction for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, expecting 16 to 20 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes, and three to six major hurricanes. This is still above the historical average of 14 named storms. The reduction in forecast storms is due to a 'lull' in tropical activity in the Atlantic basin during an 'unusual August'. Accuweather's lead hurricane expert, Alex DaSilva, said that the amount of dry air and Saharan dust in the Atlantic, as well as the slower-than-expected progression to a La Niña pattern, has caused more wind shear in the first half of the season, slowing the formation of storms. Despite the reduction in forecast storms, the season has already been 'very impactful and destructive', with several major records broken, including the earliest major hurricane on record to form east of the Lesser Antilles in June. Jon Porter, Accuweather chief meteorologist, said, 'Should the current lull continue deeper into September, reductions in the forecast number of named storms will be needed because a longer time period in the core of the hurricane season will have been devoid of named storms.'

**¿El pronóstico falló? Lo que pasa con la temporada de huracanes 2024**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was expected to be 'extraordinary' due to record ocean temperatures and the formation of La Niña in the Pacific. However, since the dissipation of Hurricane Ernesto on August 20, there has been a lack of cyclones, leading experts to question whether the predictions failed. Meteorologist Phillip Klotzbach asked, 'What the devil is going on with the Atlantic hurricane season? Will it be a huge failure of the predictions?' Despite a promising start with the formation of Alberto and Beryl, the season has been quiet, with only four areas of possible cyclone formation being monitored by the National Hurricane Center. Experts are searching for explanations, citing several factors that may have contributed to the failure of the predictions. These include a change in the monsoon trough's route, which brought dry air to the subtropics, and high temperatures in the troposphere, which are stabilizing the atmosphere and suppressing cyclone formation. The Madden-Julian oscillation, a zone of low pressure that affects the ocean and atmosphere, has also been a factor, causing increased wind shear. However, experts still believe that the season can recover, with conditions expected to improve in the second half of September. 'The continued extreme warming of the Atlantic, the trend towards La Niña, and the forecast of low wind shear indicate that the season can still recover during the second half,' said Klotzbach. 'The peak climatological season is September 10,' he added. 'Climatologically, the surface temperatures of the ocean and the heat content of the ocean increase until the end of September and early October, while the temperatures in the upper levels begin to decrease.' A hyperactive season of cyclones is still possible, but the predictions can always change.

**September 10th: The Peak Day of the Atlantic Hurricane Season**
September 10th is considered the peak day of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 87% of category 1 and 2 hurricanes and 96% of intense hurricanes (categories 3, 4, and 5) occur between mid-August and mid-October. However, it is around September 10th that these weather phenomena find the perfect conditions to intensify. The explanation behind this peak day lies in the interaction of key climate factors, including the weakening of winds in the upper atmosphere and the warming of ocean waters. As a result, the 10th of September represents the statistical climax of the hurricane season, with around 95 tropical storms and 55 hurricanes forming on this day over the past 100 years. This phenomenon is short-lived, as the arrival of autumn in October brings a change, with winds in the upper atmosphere strengthening and ocean temperatures decreasing, making it more difficult for powerful storms to form.

**Three tropical disturbances in Atlantic and Caribbean face tough odds for development**
Forecasters are monitoring three tropical disturbances in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, but their chances of developing into storms over the next week remain low. The National Hurricane Center gave the first wave a 30% chance of forming in the next seven days, while the second wave has a 30% chance in the next seven days and 20% in the next two days. The third wave has a 10% chance of developing in the next two to seven days. Experts at Colorado State University predict below-normal hurricane activity in the Atlantic for the next two weeks, with 23 named storms expected in the 2024 season. AccuWeather experts also updated their forecast, predicting between 16 and 20 named storms, with two to four more direct impacts to the U.S. 'With the exception of the western Caribbean and southern Gulf of Mexico, large-scale environmental conditions look relatively unfavorable for the next ~7 days but look to get more conducive for tropical cyclone activity towards the middle of September,' CSU's new forecast said. 'A stronger, more expansive Bermuda High would shunt the system westward while a less expansive dome may allow the disturbance to turn more northward,' The Weather Channel indicated. 'This Labor Day weekend was the first without a named storm in the Atlantic in 27 years,' AccuWeather noted. The next named storm will be Francine, followed by Gordon.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024: Projections and Expectations**
The Atlantic hurricane season 2024 is entering September, a month historically considered the most active of the year, after a relatively quiet August. So far, five named storms have formed, of which three have reached category 1 hurricane status. Despite the formation of tropical cyclones being below average for this time of year, the intensity of the systems has exceeded expectations. Projections for September suggest the formation of six named systems, including two hurricanes. According to the FOX Forecast Center, September may start quietly, but there is a disturbance in the Atlantic with moderate chances of development. Water temperatures remain above average, but have not been sufficient to cause a significant increase in cyclonic activity. Some experts believe that climate change may be influencing the weather more than recognized in meteorological projections. Research has shown a significant decrease in the number of hurricanes and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) globally, especially in the western North Pacific. However, there has also been an increase in damage related to cyclones and rapid intensification events. With 12 weeks remaining in the season, which extends until November 30, initial projections of 20-30 named storms seem increasingly difficult to meet. Historically, the most cyclones that occurred after September 1 occurred in 2020, with 15 named storms. To meet the higher projections, the season would need to average 1-2 new storms per week. The number of storms does not always have a high impact on the season, as seen in the 2022 season, which was considered almost normal, but produced the hurricane Ian, making that year the third most costly in history. The 2023 season had more storms, but had less impact.

**Hurricane forecast update following rare storm-free Labor Day weekend**
AccuWeather has reduced its forecast for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season due to unusual conditions that have limited tropical activity. The new forecast predicts 16-20 named storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 3-6 major hurricanes. Despite warm water across the basin, dry air, dust, and disruptive winds have hindered tropical development. AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter warns that even with fewer storms, two to four direct impacts to the United States are expected. 'We don't want anyone to let their guard down,' Porter said. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September 10, but tropical threats could extend through November and possibly into December due to warm water temperatures.

**How does hurricane season 2024 compare to the predictions as peak nears?**
As hurricane season 2024 approaches its peak on September 10, the National Hurricane Center has identified three areas of interest in the Atlantic. Two of these areas have a moderate chance for development, while one has a low chance. The first tropical wave is located in the Caribbean Sea and has a low chance for development over the next couple of days, but conditions will be more favorable for development in the western Caribbean and southwestern Gulf of Mexico. The second tropical wave is located in the eastern Atlantic and may bring heavy rain and gusty winds to the Cabo Verde Islands. The third tropical wave is located between the west coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles and has a low chance for development. As of September 1, the 2024 season has seen five named storms, three of which reached hurricane strength with one major hurricane. According to NOAA, the season is slightly behind schedule compared to their original forecast, but ahead of schedule in terms of storm strength. If no additional development occurs before September 7, the season will be considered 'normal' for all three categories: named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes.

**Colorado State University says forecast for the Atlantic should remain quiet next 2 weeks**
Researchers at Colorado State University released their updated forecast for the Atlantic Hurricane Season, stating that the next two weeks should remain relatively quiet. Although the forecast for the season remains at an above-normal level of activity, with 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes expected, the next two weeks are forecasted to be below normal. According to CSU, 'it only takes one storm to devastate a community,' and they emphasize that the quiet period is not a guarantee of an inactive season. The National Weather Service defines a major hurricane as a Category 3 or above or a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 111 mph and higher. CSU has issued its next two-week forecast for 2024 Atlantic hurricane activity, favoring below-normal activity (60% chance) relative to normal (30%) and above normal (10%).

**The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season keeps underperforming expectations**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is underperforming expectations, despite record-warm ocean temperatures and a favorable La Niña climate cycle. Computer models initially predicted multiple storms forming in the next two weeks, but have since shown conflicting results. The National Hurricane Center is giving two areas a 40% chance of developing into tropical cyclones in the next 7 days. Some hurricane experts, such as Michael Lowry, believe that the season may still pick up in the latter half, while others, like Sam Lillo, think that the outlooks for the season may be a 'bust of historic proportions.' The African Monsoon and Intertropical Convergence Zone are located north of their typical position, causing tropical storms to move over colder waters and collapse. Additionally, unusually warm air at high altitudes and an anomalously high amount of dry air are hindering storm development. Meteorologists and climate scientists are debating the causes of these factors, including the potential impact of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai undersea volcano eruption in 2022. As Jim Kossin notes, the ongoing lull shows the limits of seasonal storm forecasting, and it is increasingly unlikely that the forecasts will verify.

**Meteorologists Predict 'Dramatic Increase' in Hurricane Formation in September**
Meteorologists predict a 'dramatic increase' in hurricane formation in September, saying 'we haven't reached the peak' yet. With the transition from summer to autumn, tropical activity in the Atlantic Ocean is about to intensify. Experts from AccuWeather anticipate a significant increase in the formation of destructive tropical cyclones, with Texas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana being the main areas where landfall is likely. The 2024 hurricane season has been relatively calm so far, except for hurricanes Debby and Ernesto, and is expected to be one of the most active in history. According to AccuWeather specialists, the current calm conditions are due to the presence of dry and dusty air from the Atlantic, which limits the formation of storms. However, a significant change in weather conditions is expected to occur, potentially leading to a 'dramatic increase' in activity. 'I think things could get very active very quickly as soon as the dry air disappears,' said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather's hurricane expert, who warned that while there has been a reduction in dry air in the past week, there are still large amounts, and it is expected to dissipate closer to September 10, the day forecast for the climatological peak of the season. Experts predict between six and ten tropical systems in the Atlantic basin during September, a pace comparable only to the historic 2020 season, when ten named storms were recorded in September. 'There is a possibility that we will see multiple tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic basin on the same day,' added DaSilva. The conditions for the development of these storms are particularly favorable due to the current record-high sea surface temperatures in much of the region. The areas at highest risk of impact from the hurricanes of September are the southeast coast of Texas, from Brownsville to Houston and Beaumont, as well as the southwest of Louisiana, where hurricane Beryl made landfall in early July, causing tornadoes and significant flooding in Vermont, over 1,600 kilometers away from the point of landfall. Other areas of high risk are the southern coast of Florida, both on its eastern coast, facing the Atlantic, and on its northwestern coast, with access to the Gulf of Mexico; and the coastal areas of South Carolina and North Carolina, where the devastating hurricane Debby passed through in early August. 'This has already been a costly year in terms of damage and impacts from hurricanes, and we still haven't reached the peak of the season,' said Jon Porter, AccuWeather's chief meteorologist. Additionally, experts warned that not only will October remain a turbulent month in terms of activity, but it could also see between one and three tropical cyclones in November, near the end of the season, officially set to end on November 30, 2024. How the 2024 hurricane season will unfold in the coming days Despite the Labor Day weekend being traditionally a period of high activity, this year there were no named storms in the basin between August 21 and September 2, making it the first time in 27 years that this has happened. However, experts at the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) are closely monitoring two tropical waves. The first is moving westward from the coast of Africa, while the second is located in the Caribbean and is expected to move towards the Gulf of Mexico. Both could intensify significantly due to warm water temperatures. In the meantime, these disturbances, combined with a reduction in dry air, could trigger a much greater activity than in recent weeks.

**Anything to watch in the tropics? Peak of season ahead**
The Atlantic hurricane season is reaching its peak on September 10, but forecasters do not expect any named storms to form in the next week. This is unexpected given the predicted supercharged 2024 Atlantic hurricane season and record-warm tropical seas. According to NOAA's hurricane season outlook, there should be 17-24 named storms before the season ends. However, so far in 2024, there have been only five named storms, and the Atlantic basin is running behind climatology. Despite this, there have been three hurricanes this season, including Beryl, which peaked as a Category 5 on July 1, the earliest Category 5 in the Atlantic on record. A tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic has a 40% chance of becoming a depression in the next week, and another disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico has a 10% chance. The National Weather Service is keeping a close eye on these systems, but for now, there is no cause for concern along the coasts.

**Taste of fall, again, as cooler air settles into the region; little rain expected**
A cooler air mass has settled into the region, bringing pleasant weather for Labor Day. Expect highs in the low to mid 70s and clearing skies. The rest of the week will remain dry, with temperatures slowly warming up into the mid to upper 70s. A cold front will bring a chance of scattered showers on Saturday, but it will be a mostly dry day. Sunday will be breezy and cooler, with highs in the upper 60s. The peak of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season is on September 10th, and the active tropics may bring changes to the long-range forecast.

**Hurricane center keeps eyes on Gulf, Atlantic systems for tropical development**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring three systems with potential for tropical development. The first system, a tropical wave, is moving westward towards the Lesser Antilles and has a 10% chance of development in the next two days and 40% in the next seven. It could bring gusty winds and heavy rainfall to the Windward and Leeward Islands. The second system, a broad area of low pressure, is affecting the upper Texas and Louisiana coast and has a 10% chance of development in the next two days and 20% in the next seven. The third system, a tropical wave, is expected to move offshore from western Africa on Monday and has a 20% chance of development in the next seven days. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has produced five named storms so far, and the NHC predicts 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes.

**Hurricane season 2024: After a quiet August, could Delaware face 'supercharged September'**
After a quiet August, AccuWeather hurricane experts are predicting a busy September with 20-23 named storms, down from their initial forecast of 20-25. According to AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter, the reason for the reduction is the long lull in recent weeks with no named storms during a typically active time. However, conditions are expected to change in September with less wind shear, dry air, and near-record levels of Sahara dust clearing out. This could lead to a 'supercharged September' with six to 10 named storms through September 30. AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva warns that the Atlantic basin could be incredibly active, with multiple tropical storms and hurricanes developing on the same day. The statistical peak of the hurricane season is September 10. 'We could see a parade of storms developing during the month of September,' said DaSilva. 'There's a possibility that we could see multiple tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic basin on the same day, similar to the frequency of storms that we've seen during other supercharged hurricane seasons like 2020.'

**September to make or break robust hurricane season outlooks**
The Atlantic hurricane season is entering its busiest month, September, but so far, it has been relatively quiet. Five named storms have formed, and three have strengthened into at least Category 1 hurricanes, but the rate of tropical cyclone formation is behind schedule. The basin has only seen five named storms, three hurricanes, and one major, which is below the average numbers entering September. The FOX Forecast Center predicts a quiet start to the month, with no active cyclones to track, but water temperatures remain above average in some parts of the Atlantic. The overall reduction in activity is not unheard of, as tropical weather experts have suggested that global tropical cyclone activity is on the decline worldwide. 'By investigating global TC activity from 1990 to 2021, we find significant decreasing trends in global hurricane numbers and ACE, primarily due to a significant decreasing trend in the western North Pacific,' researchers stated in the 2022 report. With just over 12 weeks remaining in the season, the basin would have to average 1-2 new named storms per week to meet the expected 20-30 named storms, but activity tends to drop off by late October and early November.

**Three Disturbances in the Atlantic: A Potential Start to an Active September**
After a relatively quiet August with little hurricane activity, meteorologists are closely monitoring three disturbances in the Atlantic Ocean, with one predicted to become a tropical depression within the week. According to weather experts, this could be the start of an active September, as the 2024 hurricane season is forecasted to be one of the most active. This week, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) has been tracking a tropical wave that has been causing rain and storms about 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. In its 8 a.m. Saturday bulletin, meteorologists predicted a gradual development in the next few days. The tropical wave has a 50% chance of strengthening in the next seven days and no chance in the next two days. Another disturbance between the west coast of Africa and the Cape Verde Islands is following closely behind. That tropical wave is also causing rain and storms, but experts do not predict any development until next week when it moves into open water. The disturbance has a 10% chance of becoming a depression or storm in the next seven days and no chance in the next two days. On Friday, the NHC began tracking a third disturbance forming near Texas and Louisiana. A low-pressure area has remained northwest of the Gulf of Mexico. Experts predict that the system will move aimlessly near the coast for much of the next week, with the possibility of strengthening. The system is accompanied by heavy rain that could cause flooding in coastal areas of Louisiana and Texas in the next few days. The disturbance has a 20% chance of becoming a depression or storm in the next seven days and a 10% chance in the next two days. The next tropical depression will be named Francine. The 2024 hurricane season was predicted to have between 17 and 24 named storms, and although only Hurricane Ernesto emerged in August, experts caution against jumping to conclusions. Historically, September is when large and powerful storms form in a distant area of the eastern Atlantic. Bryan Norcross, a hurricane expert at Fox Weather, notes that the 2022 season, which had a quiet August, but was followed by the devastating Hurricane Ian, should be remembered.

**3 new Atlantic storm systems may become tropical depressions. Could one affect NC?**
The National Hurricane Center is monitoring three disturbances in the Atlantic that could develop into tropical depressions over the next week. The first system is located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and has a 20% chance of developing into a depression. The second system is in the central tropical Atlantic and has a 40% chance of becoming a tropical depression. The third system is in the eastern tropical Atlantic and has a 20% chance of developing into a depression. Forecasters say it's too early to tell if any of these systems will develop into a threat for North Carolina or the Atlantic coast. The 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season is expected to be exceptionally busy, with up to 25 named storms, including 7-8 major hurricanes. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a La Niña is likely to form between September and November, which could lead to a more severe hurricane season. 'Warm water is a major contributing factor in the development of tropical storms,' said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The next named storm in the Atlantic would be called Francine.

**September surge: Tropical activity increasing in Caribbean, Atlantic**
AccuWeather meteorologists predict a high chance of tropical development in the Caribbean during the first week of September. A broad zone of showers and thunderstorms has been tracked since mid-August, and wind shear is low, making conditions favorable for tropical development. Bernie Rayno, AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist, said, 'We expect that at least one feature will take hold within the moisture zone in the coming days.' The area is expected to bring needed rainfall to the Leeward and Windward islands, but may also trigger flash flooding. The chances of development will likely increase substantially once the feature enters the Caribbean next week, with a named system, a tropical storm, possible. The next name on the list of tropical storms for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is Francine. There is a wide-ranging area where a tropical storm or hurricane might track after departing the Caribbean, potentially posing a direct threat to the U.S. AccuWeather maintains that 2024 will have a very active hurricane season, with 20-23 named storms more likely than 20-25.

**Where Are The Atlantic Hurricanes? Experts Puzzled By Lack Of Storms**
The 2024 hurricane season is taking an unexpected turn, with more storms forming in the Pacific than in the Atlantic. As of now, three storms are spinning in the Pacific, while the Atlantic has been unusually calm. According to Phil Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, 'It is quiet out there.' The last time the Atlantic went without a named storm from August 21 to September 2 was in 1997. Meteorologist Ryan Maue suggested that the Atlantic tropics are 'broken' for now, due to cool ocean temperatures that are not suitable for storm formation. In contrast, the eastern and central Pacific basins have seen nine named storms, including three hurricanes. This is not what the experts predicted, with forecasts pointing to a very active season in the Atlantic and a below-normal season in the eastern Pacific.

**National Hurricane Center tracking 2 tropical disturbances. See Florida impact for Labor Day**
The National Hurricane Center is tracking two tropical disturbances in the Atlantic basin, with a low chance of development. According to AccuWeather, there could be a 'parade of storms' in the Atlantic basin, with six to 10 tropical systems predicted for September. The next named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be Francine. A tropical disturbance in the eastern Atlantic is expected to consolidate over the Labor Day weekend, but it's too early to determine if there will be any impact to Florida or the U.S. Residents are urged to continue monitoring the tropics and to always be prepared, as the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be very active. The Florida tax holiday for hurricane supplies continues until Sept. 6, with eligible items including portable generators, tarps, and smoke detectors. 'I think things could get very active potentially very quickly here as soon as that dry air — Saharan dust — goes away,' said AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva. 'We could see a parade of storms. This dramatic increase in activity will start at the end of August and persist throughout September.'

**Tropical Disturbance Could Become Hurricane Francine for Labor Day**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has warned of a tropical disturbance that could become a hurricane for Labor Day in the US, which is on Monday, September 2, 2024. According to the NHC, this disturbance could become a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, and if it does, it will be named Francine. 'A low-pressure area could form in the central Atlantic in a few days', the NHC forecasted. The system, located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Venezuela and the Guyanas, between the Lesser Antilles and Africa, is moving west-northwest at a speed of 16-24 kilometers per hour, towards the Caribbean, southern Florida, and northern Mexico. 'The environmental conditions seem generally favorable for this system this weekend to early next week', the federal agency stated, predicting a 0% chance of cyclonic development for this system in the next 48 hours, but a 20% chance if looking at the perspective towards the next seven days. If it becomes a tropical cyclone, Francine would be the fifth named tropical storm of this season, following Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, and Ernesto, of which three (Beryl, Debby, and Ernesto) reached hurricane category and only one (Beryl, which lasted two weeks) became a category 5 hurricane. The peak of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to occur between mid-August and early September, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The NOAA has updated its predictions for this season, estimating that there will be between 17 and 24 named storms (those with winds of at least 62 kilometers per hour), of which between 8 and 13 could become hurricanes (with winds of over 74 kilometers per hour), and between 4 and 7 could reach major hurricane category (with winds of at least 111 kilometers per hour).

**Bryan Norcross: A potential disturbance to watch and what's going on with hurricane season 2024?**
Bryan Norcross discusses the current state of hurricane season 2024, which has been above-average in terms of the number of hurricanes and Category 3-plus storms. However, the number of named storms is on schedule, but the National Hurricane Center's forecast suggests that the season may fall behind if no new storms form. Norcross notes that the strong consensus of hurricane season forecasts predicted a 'rip-roaring' season, but something is going on that is different from what was anticipated. He suggests that it may be a combination of multiple independent meteorological and oceanographic features working together to inhibit development. Factors that could be contributing to the suppressed activity include the Saharan dust, colder ocean water off Africa, and an unusually warm upper atmosphere over the Atlantic. Additionally, the polar vortex and the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption in 2022 may also be playing a role. Despite this, the odds still favor hurricanes developing in September and October, intensifying more quickly than average due to the warm ocean, and ending up stronger.

**HURRICANE SEASON PEAKS! STAY ALERT!**
The 2024 hurricane season is now in its peak and most dangerous period, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency has reinforced its earlier outlook for an abnormally active hurricane season, with a 90% chance of above-normal activity. NOAA head Rick Spinrad said, 'The hurricane season got off to an early and violent start with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category-5 Atlantic hurricane on record.' The updated 2024 outlook calls for 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. Weather experts warn that the 2024 season has already seen significant storm activity and that these early storms have set the stage for what could be a particularly devastating season. Disaster management experts emphasize the importance of preparedness as the season moves deeper into its peak period, which is expected to become active again by early-mid September.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season Expected to See Lull in Activity as We Approach September**
The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to see a lull in activity as we approach September, according to the Tropical Meteorology Project at Colorado State University (CSU). The CSU's latest two-week forecast, released on Tuesday, predicts 'near-normal' activity between August 20 and September 2. Phil Klotzbach, the CSU's research scientist, stated that the forecast is based on Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) - a measure that takes into account the frequency, wind speed, and duration of storms. The CSU predicts a 55% chance that the ACE value will remain within the 'normal' range. However, the model has retreated on the potential development of short-term tropical cyclones, and Klotzbach notes that the probability of a value below normal has increased until the beginning of September. Despite the short-term predictions, the CSU maintains its seasonal forecast for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, which is expected to be extremely active. Klotzbach notes that the National Hurricane Center's latest tropical weather outlook does not indicate any activity in the next seven days. However, the conditions at large scales seem to be becoming more conducive to tropical cyclone activity by the end of August. Klotzbach also mentions that there are signs of a resurgence of hurricane activity at the beginning of September. 'It's too early to identify specific areas that could develop at this stage, so I'd say to follow the National Hurricane Center for the latest updates,' he said. The CSU predicts 23 named storms for this season, with 25 predicted in July following the hurricane Beryl. This means that they predict at least 18 additional named storms, or storms that reach at least a tropical storm wind speed of 39 mph or more, for the rest of the season. As of now, five named storms have formed in the Atlantic: Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, and Ernesto. All these storms are included in the predicted storm statistics. The period of August 20 to September 2, in terms of climatology, typically marks the increase in power of tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. The main area at risk for major hurricanes at the end of August is located in the eastern and central Atlantic tropical region. The CSU will publish new two-week forecasts on September 3.

**AccuWeather predicts ‘dramatic surge' in storms to close hurricane season**
AccuWeather predicts a 'dramatic surge' in severe storms in the Atlantic Ocean in September, with potentially 6 to 10 tropical storms. This would be similar to the record-breaking 2020 hurricane season. According to AccuWeather's lead hurricane expert, Alex DaSilva, a shift in weather patterns would push out dry air, leading to a 'parade of storms.' The Atlantic hurricane season peaks on September 10, and plentiful warm water could fuel tropical storms and hurricanes into the fall. The areas at the highest risk from tropical storms are the Texas coast, Florida, and the Carolinas, but the danger can extend far beyond where a storm makes landfall. AccuWeather is predicting a total of 20 to 25 named storms in the Atlantic by the end of 2024, well above the historical average of 14.

**Calm before the storms: The peak of a busy hurricane season is near**
The Atlantic hurricane season is rapidly approaching its peak, with most activity expected between mid-August and mid-October. According to the National Hurricane Center, a typical season yields 14 named storms, of which seven become hurricanes and three become major hurricanes. However, this year's forecast is expected to be very active, with 17 to 24 named storms, including eight to 13 hurricanes and four to seven major hurricanes. NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said, 'The hurricane season got off to an early and violent start with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record.' Atmospheric and oceanic conditions indicate an above-normal 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, with a 90% probability. The primary threat-formation area for major hurricanes in late August is the eastern and central tropical Atlantic. Surface water temperatures of 80 degrees and above are the perfect fuel for developing hurricanes, and water temperatures peak in September and October. 'NOAA's update to the hurricane seasonal outlook is an important reminder that the peak of hurricane season is right around the corner,' said Spinrad.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season: A September to Remember**
According to AccuWeather, a significant change in the meteorological pattern will soon open the doors for a frenzy of tropical activity in the Atlantic Ocean. 'I think things could get very active, potentially very quickly, here as soon as that dry air is gone,' said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather's hurricane expert. 'We could see a parade of storms.' This drastic increase in activity will begin at the end of August and persist throughout September. AccuWeather predicts 6-10 tropical systems for September, a similar pace to the record-breaking 2020 hurricane season, which had 10 storms in September. 'There's a possibility we could see multiple tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic basin on the same day,' added DaSilva. The climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September 10, but an abundance of warm water could fuel many tropical storms and hurricanes heading into autumn. 'We're fundamentally at record surface water temperatures in most of the basin,' said DaSilva. Not only will October remain intense, but there could be one to three more storms in November. Areas of the United States with the highest risk of landfall include the Texas coast, Florida, and the Carolinas. However, the danger will extend far beyond the point where a storm makes landfall. 'I'm still very concerned about the Texas coast,' said DaSilva. AccuWeather predicts a total of 20-25 named storms in the Atlantic basin by the end of 2024, well above the historical average of 14.

**Quiet in the tropics since Debby, but that's likely to change in September. Here's why**
After a quiet Atlantic hurricane season so far, forecasters predict a significant increase in tropical cyclone development in early September. According to Carl Barnes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Charleston Office, 'Pushing into early September, we do see a high threat, or a high potential for tropical cyclone development over the tropical Atlantic.' The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expects the season to peak on September 10, with between 6 and 10 tropical systems developing in September. This is in line with NOAA's earlier prediction of an above-normal 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, with 17-25 named storms and 8-13 hurricanes. On average, 10 tropical storms develop over the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, with 6 becoming hurricanes each year.

**Supercharged September: Atlantic hurricane season to intensify dramatically**
The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to intensify dramatically in September, with a surge of hurricanes and tropical storms predicted to form across the Atlantic Ocean. According to AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva, 'things could get very active potentially very quickly here as soon as that dry air goes away,' with a 'parade of storms' possible. Between six and 10 tropical systems are predicted for September, similar to the record-breaking 2020 hurricane season. The climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is Sept. 10, but warm water temperatures could fuel plenty of tropical storms and hurricanes heading into autumn. DaSilva warned that Florida, the Carolinas, and Texas are at an elevated risk of a landfalling tropical storm or hurricane, and the danger will extend far beyond where a storm makes landfall. AccuWeather is predicting a total of 20 to 25 named storms across the Atlantic basin by the end of 2024, well above the historical average of 14.

**Why are the tropics quiet near the peak of hurricane season?**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is nearing its peak, but no named storms are expected to form over the next seven days. According to FOX 13 meteorologist Nash Rhodes, the Saharan dust blanketing the Main Development Region (MDR) and the northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the Atlantic Basin are contributing factors to the inactivity. Rhodes said, 'Typically, the amount of Saharan dust we see in the region substantially decreases during this time of the year. The length of our current Saharan dust season has been unprecedented, which has contributed to our stretch of inactivity.' Despite the quiet tropics, the remainder of the hurricane season is still forecast to be active, with warm sea surface temperatures potentially serving as fuel for upcoming disturbances. September is typically the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season.

**Tropical Update: Did the predicted ‘intense' hurricane season turn out to be less severe than expected?**
The 2024 hurricane season was predicted to be 'explosive' and 'hyperactive', but so far, it has been less severe than expected. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the season's accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) was primarily generated by major hurricane Beryl, which reached category 5 status. Despite the Atlantic basin being 'primed' for storms, the season has been slow, with one reason being the dry, dusty air in the region off Africa. The Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) has been displaced north, which is typically where it resides. Model guidance suggests that the ITCZ could trend south through September, aligning with the peak of hurricane season. The Climate Prediction Center has given a high chance for tropical development during the first week of September.

**Tropics Watch: Did the forecast of an ‘explosive' hurricane season fizzle out?**
The 2024 hurricane season was forecasted to be 'explosive', but so far, it has been relatively quiet. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the season is actually ahead of schedule compared to 'normal'. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) metric, which measures intensity and longevity of tropical storms and hurricanes, was primarily driven by major hurricane Beryl, which reached category 5 status. Despite an extremely active Atlantic basin, the season's slow start is likely due to the tropical waves rolling off of Africa being farther north than usual, resulting in dry and dusty air, and unfavorable atmospheric conditions. The Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) has also been displaced farther north than its typical location, which helps to fire up clouds and thunderstorms that can become tropical waves. Model guidance suggests that the ITCZ could trend south through September, aligning with the peak of hurricane season. The Climate Prediction Center has given a high chance for tropical development during the first week of September, with the peak of hurricane season running from September 10 to November.

**2024 Atlantic hurricane season update: Above average activity expected**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be above average, according to forecasts from NOAA and CSU. As of mid-August, 5 named storms have formed, with 3 reaching hurricane status. The strongest storm so far was Category 5 hurricane Beryl, which caused significant damage in the Caribbean and Texas. NOAA predicts a 90% chance of an above-normal season, with 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. CSU forecasts a very active season, with 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes. The official peak of hurricane season is September 10, and the season will run until November 30. Experts attribute the above-average forecasts to warm sea surface temperatures, a cool ENSO Neutral or La Niña, and an above-average west African monsoon season.

**Another storm is in the South Atlantic, with little threat to SC. Height of season still to come.**
A new weather disturbance, Potential Tropical Cyclone 5, is tracking across the South Atlantic, but it poses no threat to the United States. According to the current prediction, the system will continue on a west-northwest track until it reaches the Dominican Republic on Aug. 14, then turn north and steam into the Central Atlantic, gaining strength along its path. The Colorado State University has revised its forecast for the 2024 hurricane season, predicting 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and six major hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also issued its mid-season hurricane outlook, predicting 17 to 24 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes, and four to seven major hurricanes. NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad stated, 'The hurricane season got off to an early and violent start with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category-5 Atlantic hurricane on record.' The peak season is roughly from mid-August to the end of September.

**Peak of Hurricane Season Approaches; National Hurricane Center Monitoring Tropical Wave Headed for Caribbean**
The 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season is expected to be exceptionally active, with 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes predicted. National Weather Service lead hurricane seasonal forecaster Matt Rosencrans stated, 'The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is still expecting a busy hurricane season.' The peak of hurricane season is September 10, with most activity occurring between mid-August and mid-October. A tropical wave is currently being monitored by the National Hurricane Center and is expected to pass near the U.S.V.I. and Puerto Rico next week, potentially bringing inclement weather and flooding risks. Residents and visitors are urged to remain vigilant and monitor updates from official sources, and to prepare early by reviewing emergency plans, assembling disaster supplies, and securing their homes. Rosencrans emphasized the importance of early planning, stating, 'Prepare now, and make plans for how to shelter or evacuate if necessary.'

**NOAA updates hurricane forecast as peak of Atlantic season approaches**
NOAA has updated its hurricane forecast for the remainder of the 2024 season, predicting an 'extremely active' Atlantic hurricane season. The Climate Prediction Center's latest outlook calls for between 17 and 24 named storms, with 8-13 becoming hurricanes and 4-7 major hurricanes. This is a slight decrease from the initial forecast of 17-25 named storms. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September 10, and hurricane season runs through November 30. According to Matthew Rosencrans, Lead Hurricane Season Forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, 'Hurricane Beryl broke multiple long-standing records in the Atlantic basin, and we're continuing to see the climatological hallmarks of an active season.' Sea surface temperatures remain abnormally high, and La Niña is expected to emerge during the hurricane season, making it essential to prepare now.

**Forecasters still predict highly active Atlantic hurricane season...**
Federal forecasters are still predicting a highly active Atlantic hurricane season due to near-record sea surface temperatures and the possibility of La Nina. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's updated hurricane outlook shows that atmospheric and oceanic conditions have set the stage for an extremely active hurricane season. NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said, 'The hurricane season got off to an early and violent start with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category-5 Atlantic hurricane on record.' The updated outlook includes 17 to 24 named storms, 8 to 13 of which are likely to become hurricanes with sustained winds of at least 75 mph, including 4 to 7 major hurricanes with at least 111 mph winds. The peak of hurricane season is right around the corner, when historically the most significant impacts from hurricanes and tropical storms tend to occur. La Nina tends to turbocharge Atlantic storm activity while depressing storminess in the Pacific, and forecasters are expecting a La Nina to emerge between September and November, which could overlap with peak hurricane season.
