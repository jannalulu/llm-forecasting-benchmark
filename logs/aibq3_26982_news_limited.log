**18 Chinese aircraft cross into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone**
Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence (MND) reported that 21 Chinese military aircraft, including J-16 and KJ-500, were detected on Tuesday, with 18 crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entering Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). This is part of a series of provocations by China in recent months, including regular air and naval incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ and military exercises near the island. Since September 2020, China has intensified its use of gray zone tactics, increasing the number of military aircraft and naval vessels operating around Taiwan. Taiwan has detected PLA aircraft 71 times and Chinese ships 36 times in August so far, according to Taiwan News. The MND stated, 'Overall 21 #PLA aircraft in various types (including J-16, KJ-500, etc.) were detected from 1830hr today. Out of which, 18 crossed the median line of the #Taiwan Strait and entered the northern, central, southwestern and eastern ADIZ,' on X.

**27 Chinese aircrafts cross into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone**
Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence reported a surge in activity by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) near the Taiwan Strait on Saturday. A total of 28 Chinese aircraft, including J-16 and KJ-500, were detected, with 27 breaching the median line and entering Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). Taiwan's military closely monitored the situation and responded promptly. This incident comes after Taiwan President Lai Ching-te accused the Chinese government of misinterpreting a United Nations resolution to justify its military activities against Taiwan. Lai condemned China for its inaccurate interpretation of UN Resolution 2758, which he said is aimed to construct a legal basis for China's military aggression against Taiwan and obstruct Taiwan's efforts to participate in international organisations.

**Chinese Rocket to Fly Over Taiwan's Air Defense Zone**
A Chinese rocket carrying a satellite is expected to fly over Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on August 1. According to Taiwan's Ministry of Defense, China has launched around 10 satellite missions in the past 18 months with a flight path over the island or its ADIZ. However, none of these launches have posed a threat to Taiwan's security. The ADIZ is an area where foreign aircraft approaching are located and monitored, but it does not fall within Taiwan's territorial airspace. 'None of the launches have represented a threat to the security of Taiwan,' the Ministry of Defense stated. 'The area is not within our territorial airspace, but we are monitoring the situation closely.'

**Taiwan Reports Record Number of Chinese Military Aircraft Incursions**
Taiwan reported 56 Chinese military aircraft incursions on July 11, 2024, the highest number since October 2021. The aircraft flew over the Taiwan Strait, a non-official border between Taiwan and China, and into the island's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The incursions equal the record set in October 2021, when 56 Chinese aircraft violated Taiwan's ADIZ. Taiwan's military detected 37 Chinese aircraft, including fighter jets and bombers, operating near the island. The Taiwanese government stated that it was in 'total control' of the situation and that the Chinese aircraft did not pass through the Bashi Strait, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines. The tensions between Taiwan and China have increased since the election of pro-independence President William Lai, who has been accused by China of being a 'separatist' and 'agitator'. Since Lai's election, Taiwan's Defense Ministry has detected a total of 939 Chinese military aircraft operating around the island, with 701 crossing the Taiwan Strait or violating Taiwan's ADIZ.

**China sends 141 military aircraft into Taiwan ADIZ over past week  Taiwan News**
China has sent 141 military aircraft into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the past week, according to a US-based consultant. Ian Ellis, founder of IEJ Media, pointed out that this is the most seen in a single week since August 2022 and April 2023. Taiwan has tracked PLA aircraft over 2,000 times operating around the Taiwan Strait in 2024 and over 1,000 times entering the ADIZ. The surge began with one of the largest ADIZ intrusions this year, with 34 detected in the zone between June 20 and 21. The MND announced that 35 PLA planes had been detected around Taiwan on Thursday. Ellis said that the only other one-week periods that recorded more ADIZ incursions were August 2-8, 2022, when 182 PLA planes were tracked, and April 6-12, 2023, when 169 were detected.
