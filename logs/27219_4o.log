Based on the provided information and the news articles, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. **Current Situation:** Ukrainian forces have advanced deeply into Russia's Kursk Oblast, reaching up to 35 kilometers from the border, with multiple sources confirming this incursion. There are conflicting reports about how much of the territory is controlled by Ukraine, but significant gains have been reported up to mid-August.

2. **Comparison with Past Events:** Cross-border incursions by Ukraine into Russian territory have been rare since the start of the conflict in 2022. The current incursion seems to be an exceptional case linked to broader strategic goals, possibly aimed at diverting Russian attention away from other fronts.

3. **Possible Outcomes:** By October 1, 2024, there are a few possible scenarios regarding Ukrainian-held territory in Russian Kursk Oblast:
   - **Ukrainian Control Sustained:** Ukraine could hold its gains in Kursk Oblast.
   - **Retreat or Loss:** Russian counteroffensives could push Ukrainian forces back before October 1, 2024.
   - **Expansion to Other Oblasts:** Ukraine might expand operations to other oblasts, though such expansion could stretch resources and risk overextension.

4. **Influencing Factors:**
   - **Russian Response:** The effectiveness of any Russian counteroffensive or stabilization efforts will significantly influence territorial control.
   - **Ukrainian Intentions and Capabilities:** Ukraine's strategic intentions, resources, and international support will affect its capacity to hold and expand territorial control.

5. **Predictive Analysis:**
   - **Base Rate:** Comparing this to historical incursions of similar magnitude is challenging due to the unique context. 
   - **Updates and Adjustments:** The situation is highly dynamic, and recent reports suggest Ukrainian forces have made notable incursions but face challenges maintaining this over time.

Given these factors, the likelihood that Ukraine's offensives, reaching at least five miles into Russian territory, will include only Kursk Oblast by October 1, 2024, is moderate. While penetration into other oblasts is possible, the current focus appears to be on Kursk.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To assess the likelihood of Ukraine's offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory including Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts by October 1, 2024, I will follow a structured analytic process:

### Reference Classes and Base Rates:
- The historical precedent of cross-border incursions into adversary territory during conflicts can serve as a reference class. These incursions often focus on tactical targets and may not result in sustained control of specific areas, particularly when faced with substantial resistance.
- Based on ISW reports, incursions deeper than five miles have been noted in Kursk Oblast. Control is another matter, subject to fluid front lines and military objectives.

### Current Evidence:
1. **Advances Noted**: Reports indicate Ukrainian forces have advanced significantly into Kursk, penetrating well beyond the five-mile threshold. However, controlling and sustaining territory is different from initial advances.
   
2. **Geolocated Evidence**: ISW mentioned advances up to 35 km into Kursk, suggesting substantial penetration reflective of strategic maneuvers rather than fleeting raids. There is evidence of Ukrainian tactical gains in Kursk Oblast, partly corroborated by open-source intelligence and military reports.
   
3. **Ambiguity of Control**: The degree and permanence of Ukrainian control remain ambiguous. The presence of Ukrainian forces could be more tactical rather than for long-term territorial control.
   
4. **Potential Overreach Concerns**: Ukrainians face the risk of overextending supply lines and troop deployments, which could result in reversals or strategic withdrawals, especially with increased Russian military responses.

### External Predictions: 
- I could not locate specific forecasts from sources like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus for this event, necessitating reliance on the outlined evidence and analysis.

### Causal Forces Analysis:
- **Ukrainian Motivations**: Ensuring tactical leverage, disrupting Russian logistics, and potential bargaining chips for negotiations could motivate sustained presence in the Kurz region, absent in other regions due to logistical constraints.
- **Russian Counteractions**: Russia is likely mounting counteroffensives to reclaim territory, making sustained control uncertain.

### Balancing Evidence:
- The news articles largely agree that Ukrainian forces have entered Kursk significantly and possibly no other oblasts in a comparable manner. However, the dynamic and fluid nature of warfare makes sustained and exclusive control into October 1, 2024, difficult to assert with high confidence.

### Forecast Range:
Considering the above points and the need to manage risk between overconfidence and underestimation, the final forecast should recognize the mixed signals of long-term control against initial significant advances. 

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To evaluate the question of whether Ukraine's offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory include Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts on October 1, 2024, several factors must be considered:

1. **Current Situation Analysis**: Reports indicate that Ukrainian offensives have penetrated deeply into Russian territory in Kursk Oblast with advances reported up to 30-35 kilometers, equating to approximately 18-22 miles. There is consistent reporting of Ukrainian presence in Kursk, substantiated by multiple sources including Russian sources, the ISW, and various media outlets.

2. **Geographical Considerations**: No strong evidence or reports suggest similar incursions into other Russian oblasts, specifically Belgorod or Bryansk, on October 1, 2024. The operation appears focused on the Kursk Oblast.

3. **Duration and Sustainability**: The extent to which Ukraine can maintain control or sustain operations exclusively within Kursk is uncertain, but the question focuses on the snapshot status as of October 1, 2024. Current trends suggest consistent focus on Kursk.

4. **Strategic Implications**: Keeping the operation contained in Kursk could align with strategic calculations to apply pressure on specific fronts and gain negotiation leverage without overly broadening the conflict zone.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: Historically, targeting specific oblasts while avoiding widespread incursions into multiple regions is a strategic military approach to focus resources and minimize overextension.

6. **Potential Adversarial and Coalition Responses**: Russian defenses and narratives have focused on countering incursions in Kursk. There is no evidence of widespread engagement in other territories beyond localized reporting in Kursk.

Based on these considerations, a forecast can be constructed by balancing the likelihood of sustained Ukrainian operations within Kursk alone against the improbability of significant operations in any other Russian oblast as of October 1, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 85.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.**

To predict whether Ukraine’s offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory will include Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts on October 1, 2024, let's analyze the situation using the superforecasting framework.

### Background Analysis:
1. **Historical Context and Trends**:
   - Historically, cross-border incursions and control over foreign territory can be temporary and subject to change due to military dynamics and international pressure.

2. **Current Situation**:
   - The recent news reports suggest significant Ukrainian advances into the Kursk region, with Ukrainian forces allegedly advancing up to 35 km (around 22 miles) into the Kursk Oblast.
   - The operation appears strategically driven to stretch Russian forces thin and possibly to create a bargaining chip in negotiations.
   - Reports indicate Ukrainian control of strategic positions and settlements in Kursk. However, the dynamic nature of military engagements implies this could change by October 1, 2024.

3. **Potential for Changes**:
   - Military situations are often volatile, with changes possible due to counter-offensives or negotiations.
   - While Ukraine has advanced into Kursk, it is uncertain if they will hold the area without expanding into other oblasts by October 2024.
   - Russian military response or diplomatic negotiations could alter the situation before the resolution date.

4. **Likelihood of Integration with Other Oblasts**:
   - No current reports suggest Ukrainian forces significantly advancing into other Russian oblasts beyond localized incursions or specific targets, making Kursk likely one of the primary focuses.
   - The challenge lies in maintaining focus on Kursk without unnecessary expansion, which is strategically plausible if intended to pressure Russia without overextending militarily.

### Probability Considerations:
- **Base Rate**: Past instances of military operations crossing borders might temporarily capture territory, but maintaining such control until October 2024 is uncertain.
- **Inside View**: Current reports suggest Kursk is the primary Ukrainian offensive front, with significant advances already made.
- **Outside View**: Military history often shows that controlling foreign land can be challenging, and focuses might shift based on strategic needs or constraints.

### Forecast:
Given the analysis:
- **Strengths**: Ukrainian advancements into Kursk are significant, with strategic motivations aligning with maintaining focus on specific areas.
- **Weaknesses**: Military control can be fleeting, and external pressures or counter-actions could alter the course.

Considering these factors and the volatility of military operations, there is a moderate likelihood that by October 1, 2024, Ukraine's advance will include Kursk Oblast but no other areas. 

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To accurately forecast whether Ukraine’s offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory will include Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts by October 1, 2024, I'll go through the necessary steps before concluding my prediction.

1. **Reference and Base Rates**: These types of cross-border incursions are relatively rare in modern warfare, especially given the geopolitical risk involved. However, the unexpected nature of military tactics means they can occur despite low base rates. Given the ongoing conflict dynamics, historical incursions into recognized Russian territory have been limited, but the current conflict context may allow for such a strategic maneuver.

2. **Review Current Evidence**: 
    - Multiple credible reports indicate Ukraine has made significant advances into Kursk Oblast, with ranges stated from 5 to 35 kilometers into Russian territory.
    - News articles from various dates provide substantiation of consistent control in parts of Kursk, but none clearly establish similar control in any other named oblast.
    - Conflicting reports about control and repelled advances complicate the clarity but frequently centralize around Kursk.

3. **Analysis and Likelihood**: 
    - From the evidence at hand, since all mentions are strictly regarding Kursk Oblast with a significant distance of Ukrainian advance already achieved, the probability of Ukrainian establishings similar control in another oblast while securely holding Kursk alone seems less likely.
    - Russia's counter-arms actions appear to focus on Kursk, reducing immediate possibilities of broader-scale simultaneous offensives.

4. **Confounding Factors**:
   - The evolving nature of military and political situations might lead to sudden changes. For example, negotiatory pressures or new military strategies.
   - The ambiguity around Ukrainian control in reported areas, with reliance on geolocation from footage rather than official military confirmations, creates uncertainty.

5. **Balancing Evidence and Forecast**: 
    - Considering the weights of reports regarding solely Kursk, the current conflict dynamics, and its supporting data, the progression suggests an achievable, albeit challenging, likelihood.
    - The improbability of other territories being similarly held, given logistics and Russia's defensive posture concentrated on alternative fronts, further supports the singular focus.

Based on all available information as of this forecast, the likelihood of Ukrainian forces holding locations at least five miles inside Russian territory in Kursk Oblast but not in other oblasts on October 1, 2024, is as follows:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To accurately forecast whether Ukraine’s offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory will include Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts by October 1, 2024, I'll go through the necessary steps before concluding my prediction.

1. **Reference and Base Rates**: These types of cross-border incursions are relatively rare in modern warfare, especially given the geopolitical risk involved. However, the unexpected nature of military tactics means they can occur despite low base rates. Given the ongoing conflict dynamics, historical incursions into recognized Russian territory have been limited, but the current conflict context may allow for such a strategic maneuver.

2. **Review Current Evidence**: 
    - Multiple credible reports indicate Ukraine has made significant advances into Kursk Oblast, with ranges stated from 5 to 35 kilometers into Russian territory.
    - News articles from various dates provide substantiation of consistent control in parts of Kursk, but none clearly establish similar control in any other named oblast.
    - Conflicting reports about control and repelled advances complicate the clarity but frequently centralize around Kursk.

3. **Analysis and Likelihood**: 
    - From the evidence at hand, since all mentions are strictly regarding Kursk Oblast with a significant distance of Ukrainian advance already achieved, the probability of Ukrainian establishings similar control in another oblast while securely holding Kursk alone seems less likely.
    - Russia's counter-arms actions appear to focus on Kursk, reducing immediate possibilities of broader-scale simultaneous offensives.

4. **Confounding Factors**:
   - The evolving nature of military and political situations might lead to sudden changes. For example, negotiatory pressures or new military strategies.
   - The ambiguity around Ukrainian control in reported areas, with reliance on geolocation from footage rather than official military confirmations, creates uncertainty.

5. **Balancing Evidence and Forecast**: 
    - Considering the weights of reports regarding solely Kursk, the current conflict dynamics, and its supporting data, the progression suggests an achievable, albeit challenging, likelihood.
    - The improbability of other territories being similarly held, given logistics and Russia's defensive posture concentrated on alternative fronts, further supports the singular focus.
