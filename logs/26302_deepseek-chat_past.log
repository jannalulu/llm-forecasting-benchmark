To forecast whether the US will see a large-scale riot between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and the specific criteria outlined in the question.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
- **Historical Context**: Large-scale riots in the US, such as the 1992 LA riots or the 2020 George Floyd protests, are rare but impactful events. These events typically arise from specific triggers (e.g., police violence, racial tensions) and are exacerbated by underlying social and economic conditions.
- **Base Rate**: Based on historical data, the annual probability of a large-scale riot meeting the criteria (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1B+ in damages) is low, likely less than 5%.

### Step 2: Current Trends and Evidence
- **Recent Events**: The news articles provided focus on riots in Leeds (UK) and protests in France, with no direct mention of large-scale riots in the US. However, the US has experienced significant social unrest in recent years, particularly around issues of racial justice and police violence.
- **Political Climate**: The US is in an election year, which can heighten tensions and increase the likelihood of protests or civil unrest. However, there is no specific evidence of an imminent trigger for a large-scale riot.
- **Economic Conditions**: While economic inequality and inflation persist, there is no clear indication that these factors will escalate to the level of a large-scale riot within the specified timeframe.

### Step 3: Adjusting for Specific Criteria
- **Deaths**: The threshold of 50+ deaths is extremely high and unlikely to be met without a significant trigger event.
- **Arrests**: 10,000+ arrests would require a massive law enforcement response, which is improbable without a correspondingly large-scale event.
- **Property Damage**: $1B+ in damages is also a high threshold, typically associated with prolonged or widespread unrest.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **Supporting Factors**: The US has a history of social unrest, and the current political and economic climate could contribute to tensions.
- **Countervailing Factors**: The specific criteria for a large-scale riot are stringent, and there is no clear evidence of an imminent trigger event that would meet these thresholds.

### Step 5: Final Assessment
Given the rarity of large-scale riots meeting the specified criteria and the lack of a clear trigger event, the probability of such an event occurring between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, is low. However, the potential for localized unrest remains, particularly in an election year.

My Prediction: Between 2.00% and 5.00%, but 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%.

To forecast whether the US will see a large-scale riot between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I am not aware of specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this exact question. However, I can draw on historical patterns and recent events to inform my forecast.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of Large-Scale Riots in the US**: Large-scale riots meeting the criteria (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1B+ in damages) are rare. The 1992 LA riots are a notable example, but such events are outliers.
2. **Current Social and Political Climate**: The US has experienced heightened social tensions in recent years, particularly around issues of policing, racial justice, and economic inequality. However, recent protests and unrest have not escalated to the scale defined in the question.
3. **Recent Events and Trends**: The provided news articles highlight riots and unrest in other countries (e.g., Leeds, France) but do not indicate similar large-scale events in the US. The US has seen localized protests and unrest, but nothing approaching the scale of 50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1B+ in damages.
4. **Potential Triggers**: Key triggers for large-scale riots could include controversial police actions, political events, or economic shocks. However, no such triggers are currently evident in the US.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical base rates, the probability of a large-scale riot in the US within a 2.5-month window is very low, likely less than 1%.
- **Inside View**: Current social tensions and recent events suggest some risk, but nothing indicates an imminent large-scale riot. The US has robust law enforcement and emergency response systems to mitigate such events.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
While recent riots in Leeds and France are concerning, they do not directly translate to the US context. The US has not seen comparable unrest recently, and the conditions for a large-scale riot are not currently present.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Increasing Risk**: Social tensions, economic inequality, and political polarization could increase the risk of unrest.
- **Forces Decreasing Risk**: Strong law enforcement, community resilience, and the absence of immediate triggers reduce the likelihood of a large-scale riot.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
Current trends in the US show localized protests and unrest but no escalation to large-scale riots. Extrapolating linearly, the risk remains low.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
The probability of a large-scale riot is low but not zero. I assign a narrow range to reflect this uncertainty.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
I aim to avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the possibility of unforeseen events while recognizing the low base rate and current conditions.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
I will remain open to updating my forecast if new evidence emerges but avoid overreacting to isolated events.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of a large-scale riot in the US between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, is very low.

**My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.**

To forecast whether the US will see a large-scale riot between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting methodology outlined above, breaking the problem into tractable sub-problems, balancing inside and outside views, and carefully weighing evidence.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis (Outside View)
- **Historical Frequency of Large-Scale Riots in the US**: Large-scale riots meeting the criteria (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1B+ in damages) are rare. The 1992 LA riots and the 2020 George Floyd protests are notable examples, but such events occur infrequently, perhaps once every few decades.
- **Base Rate Estimate**: Given the rarity, the base rate probability of such an event occurring in a 2.5-month window is low. I estimate a base rate of **5%**.

### Step 2: Adjust for Current Context (Inside View)
- **Recent Events**: The news articles provided focus on riots in Leeds (UK) and France, with no direct evidence of large-scale riots in the US during the forecast period. However, there are reports of protests and unrest in the US, such as the July 4th celebrations and the potential for election-related tensions.
- **Election-Related Tensions**: The US is in an election year, which historically increases the likelihood of civil unrest. However, the articles do not indicate any immediate triggers for large-scale riots.
- **Economic and Social Conditions**: While there are ongoing economic and social tensions, there is no evidence of a specific catalyst (e.g., police violence, political crisis) that would likely escalate to a large-scale riot.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Factors Increasing Likelihood**:
  - Election-related polarization and potential for unrest.
  - Economic inequality and social tensions.
- **Factors Decreasing Likelihood**:
  - No specific triggering event reported in the US.
  - Law enforcement preparedness and experience managing protests.

### Step 4: Calibration and Error Balancing
- **Risk of Over-Adjusting**: While election-related tensions are a concern, overestimating their impact could lead to an inflated probability.
- **Risk of Under-Adjusting**: Ignoring the potential for unexpected triggers (e.g., police violence, political crisis) could lead to underestimating the probability.

### Step 5: Final Probability Estimate
Balancing the base rate, current context, and clashing causal forces, I adjust the base rate slightly upward to account for election-related tensions but remain cautious due to the lack of a specific trigger.

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.**

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
Large-scale riots meeting the defined criteria (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1 billion+ in damages) are rare in the US. Historical examples include the 1992 LA riots and the 2020 George Floyd protests. These events are outliers, not the norm. The base rate for such events occurring in any given 2.5-month period is very low, likely below 1%.

### Step 2: Current Trends and Evidence
- **Recent Riots**: The Leeds riots (July 18, 2024) and other global unrest (e.g., France, Colombia) show that civil unrest can escalate quickly. However, these events did not meet the criteria for a "large-scale riot" as defined in the question.
- **US Context**: The US has seen heightened political and social tensions, but recent events (e.g., July 4 celebrations, protests) have not escalated to the scale required by the resolution criteria. The FBI and DHS warnings about potential attacks during July 4 celebrations did not materialize into large-scale riots.
- **Economic and Social Factors**: While economic inequality and political polarization remain high, there is no immediate trigger (e.g., a high-profile police killing) that suggests an imminent large-scale riot.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Drivers of Unrest**: High levels of polarization, economic stress, and social media amplification could increase the risk of riots.
- **Mitigating Factors**: Strong law enforcement presence, community efforts to prevent violence, and the absence of a recent high-profile triggering event reduce the likelihood.

### Step 4: Adjusting the Base Rate
Given the current context, I adjust the base rate slightly upward but remain cautious about overestimating the probability. The absence of a clear trigger and the rarity of such events suggest a low probability.

To forecast whether the US will see a large-scale riot between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here’s my step-by-step reasoning:

---

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
- I searched for relevant predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, and Metaculus, but no specific forecasts for this question were found. This means I must rely on historical data, current trends, and news analysis.

---

### 2. **Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems**
- **Sub-problem 1:** What is the base rate of large-scale riots in the US?
- **Sub-problem 2:** What are the current conditions that could increase or decrease the likelihood of a large-scale riot?
- **Sub-problem 3:** Are there any specific triggers or events during the forecast period that could lead to a riot?

---

### 3. **Base Rate of Large-Scale Riots**
- Large-scale riots meeting the criteria (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1B+ in damages) are extremely rare in the US. The 1992 LA riots and the 2020 George Floyd protests are notable examples, but neither fully meets all the criteria of this question. The base rate is likely less than 1% annually.

---

### 4. **Current Conditions**
- **Political Climate:** The US is in a highly polarized political environment, with tensions around the 2024 presidential election. However, no major riots have occurred recently.
- **Economic Conditions:** Inflation and economic inequality remain concerns, but there is no evidence of widespread economic desperation that could trigger large-scale unrest.
- **Social Unrest:** While there are ongoing protests (e.g., pro-Palestinian demonstrations), these have not escalated into large-scale riots.
- **Law Enforcement Preparedness:** Police and National Guard are highly mobilized and prepared to prevent large-scale riots, as seen during recent protests.

---

### 5. **Triggers During the Forecast Period**
- **Election-Related Unrest:** The 2024 election season could heighten tensions, but the forecast period ends before the election (November 5, 2024), reducing the likelihood of election-related riots.
- **Heatwaves and Natural Disasters:** Extreme weather events could exacerbate tensions, but there is no evidence linking these to large-scale riots.
- **Police Violence or Controversial Incidents:** A high-profile incident of police violence could spark unrest, but such events are unpredictable.

---

### 6. **Adjusting the Base Rate**
- **Upward Adjustments:** The polarized political climate and potential for election-related tensions slightly increase the likelihood of riots.
- **Downward Adjustments:** Strong law enforcement preparedness and the absence of recent large-scale riots suggest a lower likelihood.

---

### 7. **Clashing Causal Forces**
- **Forces Increasing Likelihood:** Political polarization, economic inequality, and potential triggers like police violence.
- **Forces Decreasing Likelihood:** Law enforcement readiness, lack of recent large-scale riots, and relatively stable economic conditions.

---

### 8. **Final Assessment**
- The base rate of large-scale riots is very low (<1%). Adjusting for current conditions and potential triggers, the likelihood increases slightly but remains low. The most likely scenario is no large-scale riot during the forecast period.

---

### 9. **Error Balancing**
- I avoid overreacting to recent protests or political tensions, as these have not escalated into large-scale riots. I also avoid underreacting by acknowledging the potential for unpredictable triggers.

---

### 10. **Final Forecast**
My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, but 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.
