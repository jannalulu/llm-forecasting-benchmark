**Netanyahu: Israel Will Continue War in Gaza Until Complete Victory Over Hamas**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his determination to achieve all previously announced goals in the Gaza Strip until a complete victory over the Palestinian movement Hamas. 'We are determined to fight until we achieve all our goals. Our warriors did not die in vain. We will not stop the war until we achieve all our goals,' Netanyahu said, opening a cabinet meeting. He emphasized the need to eliminate Hamas, return all prisoners, and provide guarantees that the Gaza Strip will no longer pose a threat to Israel. 'To those who doubt the achievement of these goals, I repeat - there are no alternatives to victory,' he stressed. It is worth noting that on June 28, the International Criminal Court's pre-trial chamber postponed a decision on issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant at the request of prosecutor Karim Khan on charges of war crimes. The delay occurred after the United Kingdom filed a statement against the ICC's position.

**Netanyahu's tactical manoeuvring amid political, military turmoil**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has managed to survive the current political and military turmoil, despite the Biden administration's efforts to weaken him. Netanyahu has maintained his position by balancing on the edge of the abyss, and his government has secured stability with supportive votes in the Knesset. However, the opposition's demands for elections next September may put pressure on Netanyahu, and he may be forced to respond to the country's democratic sovereignty by agreeing to elections. Internationally, the real pressure may come from the American administration, which is preparing for upcoming elections and will likely use the war in Gaza and Middle East issues as electoral fodder. Netanyahu's strategy may involve working to postpone Israeli elections until after the American elections, with a focus on negotiations with the opposition and judiciary to obtain guarantees regarding his future in the event of defeat.

**Netanyahu Dissolves War Cabinet After Gantz's Resignation**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his war cabinet after Benny Gantz, a former defense minister, resigned from the government. Gantz had demanded a 'plan of action' for the post-war situation in the Gaza Strip, but Netanyahu refused. Netanyahu stated that the war cabinet depended on an agreement with Gantz, and his departure renders the agreement invalid. The Prime Minister has also stated that he has taken decisions that the military has not always found acceptable in order to achieve his goal of neutralizing Hamas' capabilities. Netanyahu's Likud party has called for early elections in September, which could lead to a change in government. The next elections in Israel are currently scheduled for 2026.

**Netanyahu to Testify in Corruption Trial on December 2, 2024**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will begin his testimony in his corruption trial on December 2, 2024, according to a decision made by the Jerusalem District Court. This date, set during wartime, represents a compromise between the defense's and prosecution's demands. The judges explained that they weighed 'the Prime Minister's ability to prepare during a period of war with the public interest in advancing the case.' Two weeks ago, Netanyahu's lawyer requested a delay until at least March 2025, citing the demands of the ongoing war. The prosecution opposed this request, demanding that the testimony begin no later than November 1, 2024. Netanyahu's trial, which involves accusations of corruption, fraud, and breach of trust, began in May 2020. He is the first serving Israeli Prime Minister to be tried for corruption. His testimony will be a crucial moment in the trial, potentially determining his political future and the future of the country.

**Netanyahu to Testify in Corruption Trial in December**
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will begin testifying in his corruption trial on December 2, according to the Jerusalem District Court, after his lawyers requested a delay until March 2025. The court took into account Netanyahu's exceptional situation and the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, but deemed the time set for his testimony sufficient to prepare him, citing the public interest in advancing the case. Netanyahu's legal team had previously requested a delay until March 2025 due to the war, but the Jerusalem District Court resumed the corruption trial against Netanyahu in November 2023, charging him with fraud and bribery in three cases, which he has denied, claiming it is a political persecution.

**Netanyahu: Israel will not stop fighting until Hamas is destroyed**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel will continue military operations in the Gaza Strip until Hamas is destroyed and all war goals are achieved. He emphasized that the mission of the fallen is to be fulfilled, and that the Israeli government's goals include the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza and ensuring that the territory no longer poses a threat to Israel. The US is pushing for a three-way agreement to cease fire, which includes several conditions, including the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza cities, humanitarian aid, and the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of Hamas-held hostages and Israeli soldiers. However, negotiations have stalled as Hamas wants the talks to focus on prisoner exchanges, while the Israeli government insists that they also address the demilitarization of Gaza. Israel launched a military operation in Gaza after a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed around 1,200 Israelis and left approximately 250 in captivity. Netanyahu has stated that he is open to a 42-day ceasefire to return hostages, but has not ruled out the possibility of a full ceasefire.

**Netanyahu Rejects Calls to End Aggression on Gaza**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls to end the aggression on Gaza, stating that there is no change in his stance regarding the 'liberation plan' that US President Biden has welcomed. Netanyahu accused Hamas of being the only obstacle to the liberation of the captives, despite families of the captives accusing him of failing to reach a deal with Hamas to exchange prisoners and stop the violence. He reiterated that through a combination of political and military pressure, and military pressure first, all 120 captives and the dead will be returned. The article is from the Yemen Revolution newspaper and was published on June 30, 2024.

**Netanyahu's Secret Plan to Stay in Power**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to delay the 2026 Israeli elections by making internal changes that will change the face of Israel, and relying on US President Donald Trump's presidency. According to a former Likud member who worked with Netanyahu, the Prime Minister aims to delay the elections by at least 5 years, or until Trump takes office. The former member stated that Netanyahu's goal is to escalate the conflict in the north and clash with Biden and Trump. Trump, in turn, will grant Netanyahu the freedom to launch a comprehensive war with Lebanon, which will last for a long time and prevent any possibility of holding elections. After that, he will complete the takeover of the internal systems, allowing Netanyahu to delay the elections as long as he feels healthy enough to remain in power.

**Netanyahu's Survival Politics: A Masterclass in Machiavellianism**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shown an extraordinary ability to survive politically, making him the longest-serving Israeli leader in history, with 16 years and 263 days in office. He was called upon to lead Israel's response to the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, 2023, and has continued to do so despite some internal discontent, including a judicial setback that overturned his reform to increase control over the judiciary. The opposition was incorporated into a war cabinet, including six members, including fierce opponents of Netanyahu such as centrist Benny Gantz and his ally Gadi Eisenkot. The war continues, with months and dead bodies piling up, and no clear end in sight, as the Israeli objective is not to occupy Gaza, but to destroy Hamas and erase it from the strip. Gantz and Eisenkot have decided to leave the war cabinet, disagreeing with Netanyahu's political leadership. This move can be seen as a distancing from Netanyahu ahead of the next elections, a referendum on his leadership. When the war is over, it will be time to demand accountability, which does not bode well for the current prime minister.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that 'all of Jerusalem' will always be part of Israel, comparing the current Gaza war to the 1967 Six-Day War, when Israel occupied the eastern part of the city.

The statement comes as Israel continues to attack the Gaza Strip, with the latest escalation occurring in the north. Meanwhile, Israel has ordered the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to vacate its headquarters in East Jerusalem, citing a 30-day deadline.
