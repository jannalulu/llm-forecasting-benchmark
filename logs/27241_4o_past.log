To estimate whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister will be less than 60 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach to forecasting based on the information available and the historical context.

1. **Reference Class and Base Rate**:
   - Approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers can vary widely based on political and situational contexts. It's common for Prime Ministers to face fluctuating approval ratings depending on their handling of significant events.
   - Given current events and historical trends, base rates for approval ratings at or above 60% for UK Prime Ministers have often been during periods of national unity or strong leadership on significant issues. In a crisis or mishandling of situations, ratings below 60% are likely.

2. **Current Situation Analysis**:
   - Keir Starmer's current approval rating is reportedly low, with some sources indicating a recent low of 3%. This suggests significant public discontent, which would make recovering to an approval rating above 60% within a month unlikely unless there's a substantial turnaround.
   - The current unrest, economic challenges, and criticism over handling protests and political decisions (e.g., cutting benefits) are negative pressures on Starmer's ratings.

3. **Latest Evidence and Trends**:
   - Multiple surveys indicate dissatisfaction with Starmer's handling of recent riots and policy decisions, such as winter fuel benefits cuts.
   - Comparisons with previous UK Prime Ministers show that gaining high approval ratings following periods of public unrest is challenging unless there is visible progress in managing the situation effectively.

4. **Causal Forces at Play**:
   - Strong negative factors: ongoing unrest, public dissatisfaction, high disapproval ratings.
   - Potential positive factors: possible future policy moves or successful interventions in managing current crises, which might marginally improve ratings but not likely enough to reach 60%.

5. **Balancing Views and Forecasting Range**:
   - Inside View: Keir Starmer's low current approval is rooted in significant ongoing dissatisfaction, with no immediate resolution in sight.
   - Outside View: UK Prime Ministers rarely recover approval rating peaks above 60% amid crises quickly, especially without successful interventions.

6. **Extrapolating Trends**:
   - Given the current trends and historical data, it is reasonable to predict that Starmer's approval rating will remain below 60% by September 18, 2024, barring unforeseen positive turns.

**Forecasting Outcome**:
Based on the analysis, it seems highly probable that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 60%. The combination of recent dramatic lows, historical precedence, and ongoing unrest suggests that an approval rating under 60% is much more likely than a substantial improvement above this threshold within a short timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom being less than 60 on September 18, 2024, I'll break down the forecast in several steps:

**1. Initial Context and Reference Classes:** 
Keir Starmer became Prime Minister in July 2024. The initial "honeymoon period" typically sees high approval ratings due to post-election optimism. However, several reports indicate a decline in his approval ratings due to recent social unrest and criticism of his handling of riots. Historically, significant political turmoil or unrest can greatly affect approval ratings.

**2. Polling Data Analysis:**
Recent polling data indicates a significant drop in Starmer's approval ratings. Some reports even claim ratings as low as 3%. Although this is likely an outlier, even more modestly reported approval figures such as 35% (according to the Opinium poll) indicate a sharp decline. An approval rating below 60% is strongly supported by most recent polling data.

**3. Balancing Recent Evidence:** 
We must acknowledge potential volatility in approval ratings. Dramatic events like widespread riots or unpopular policy decisions can cause sharp, though potentially temporary, declines. But given the severe criticism from multiple sources and the reported data, expecting a considerable rebound by September 18, 2024, under current projections seems unlikely.

**4. Extrapolation and Trends:** 
Looking ahead to September 18, one must consider the potential for circumstances to change. However, with the immediate negative press and unrest, regaining approval over 60% seems improbable without significant policy or social interventions and successful results visible to the public.

**5. External Forecasts and Comparison:** 
Currently, there are no explicit forecasts from platforms like Metaculus or FiveThirtyEight regarding Starmer's approval, but the general expert commentary in news articles leans towards maintaining or further declining approval ratings due to ongoing challenges.

**Conclusion:**
Given recent events resulting in significant disapproval, coupled with extrapolation of current trends, it's highly likely that Starmer's rating on September 18, 2024, will be below 60%. This assessment factors in recent downturns and the political climate, assuming no significant and rapid improvements or changes occur.

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 60% on September 18, 2024, we'll apply the superforecasting principles:

1. **Current Approval Ratings**: Recent news articles indicate that Keir Starmer's approval rating has plummeted significantly due to the handling of riots and unrest across the UK. Several reports mention his approval dropping as low as 3%, though this figure may vary across different polls.

2. **Historical Context and Base Rates**: Historically, high approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers, especially post-election, can be volatile. Early-term 'honeymoon' periods often see higher ratings, but significant political or social unrest can quickly erode these ratings, as seen in past situations with other leaders.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing this scenario to other leaders who faced severe public unrest and declining approval can be useful. Leaders in the past who have experienced such steep drops rarely recover to above 60% within a short timeframe without significant positive developments or a major political turnaround.

4. **Inside View**: From the inside view, there's a pattern of criticism towards Starmer's handling of the crisis and cuts in welfare benefits which decreases his popularity, suggesting difficulty in achieving a rebound to above 60%.

5. **Outside View**: Looking at broader patterns of political unrest and leadership approval, major dips below 60% during such crises are common, and recovery typically requires substantial policy shifts or problem resolution.

6. **Short-Term Projections**: Given the current trends of approval ratings falling steeply amidst unrest, and considering the time left until September 18, 2024, the probability of recovery to an approval rating of 60% seems slim unless unexpected positive changes occur.

7. **Political Dynamics**: Factors such as further unrest, economic conditions, and the Labour Party's ability to manage public perception effectively will influence trends. The potential for approval to fall further is notable if unrest persists or policies remain unpopular.

8. **Clashing Causal Forces**: While there is potential for reform or resolution of issues to boost approval, the immediate negative impact of current events is a significant force driving approval ratings down.

9. **Extrapolation**: If current trends hold and no major positive breakthroughs occur, the likelihood of Starmer's approval rating being less than 60% is high.

Based on these considerations, it seems probable that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 60% by September 18, 2024, given current trends, statistical norms, and the impact of recent events.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating will be less than 60% on September 18, 2024, several factors must be considered. Based on the information provided in the news articles and my understanding of forecasting, the main points for consideration are:

**Current Trends:**
1. **Low Approval Ratings:** Multiple news sources, including surveys by Savanta and Opinium, indicate that Keir Starmer's approval ratings have drastically dropped. The reports consistently mention his ratings being at their lowest levels since taking office, amid incidents such as riots and public discontent towards policy decisions.
  
2. **Specific Data Points:** One survey reports an alarmingly low 3% approval rating. Even if this is an outlier, other sources also report significant declines, indicating broader dissatisfaction.

3. **Comparison to Past Performance:** Historically, approval ratings that fall significantly, particularly in response to national crises or unpopular policy decisions, tend to recover only slowly. Starmer's reported 36% approval rating before recent events was already moderate, suggesting recovery may be difficult.

**Causal Factors:**
1. **Civil Unrest:** Key events like riots and Starmer's perceived mishandling of these situations are major contributors to his low approval ratings. This unrest has vast media coverage, amplifying public perception of ineffective leadership.
  
2. **Economic Stress:** Decisions like cutting winter fuel benefits correspond with declining approval ratings, reflecting growing economic dissatisfaction under Starmer's leadership.

**Historical Patterns:**
Given the context, prime ministers facing similar political pressure and public dissatisfaction rarely see rapid improvements in approval ratings in the short term. Any negative impressions become particularly durable when involving crises with high public visibility and ongoing economic pressure.

**Balancing Risks:**
While recognition of the potential for changes in public perception or subsequent policy successes that might shift approval ratings should inform our forecast, current conditions present strong immediate weight towards lower ratings persisting at least into the near future.

Considering the detailed evidence and acknowledging the probability of some fluctuation, the assessment is best framed within a range. Given the data:

My Prediction: Between 90.00% and 99.00%, but 95.00% being the most likely. Probability: 95.00%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 60 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a systematic approach aligned with the principles of superforecasting. This will involve examining historical and current data, identifying trends, and carefully balancing probabilistic judgments based on evidence.

1. **Historical Context and Base Rates:** Historically, approval ratings for new Prime Ministers tend to fluctuate after the initial election period. The so-called "honeymoon period" often sees elevated approval ratings, which may decrease as government policies unfold and challenges arise. Base rates for UK Prime Minister approval ratings being above 60% are generally low, especially once immediate post-election enthusiasm wanes.

2. **Current Context and Trends:**
   - **Approval Ratings Trend:** As per recent news articles, Keir Starmer's approval ratings have faced significant challenges due to ongoing events such as the riots and criticism over his handling of them. Latest reports indicate his ratings have dropped to unprecedented lows, with specific polls showing approval as low as 3%. This dramatic drop suggests considerable public dissatisfaction.
   - **Political Environment:** The UK is currently dealing with significant unrest and economic challenges, which typically do not foster high approval ratings for political leaders. There is also a trend of diminishing support due to unpopular policy decisions, such as cutting winter benefits.
   - **Comparison Class:** Comparing Starmer’s situation to other newly elected Prime Ministers facing crises, such as Theresa May during Brexit or Gordon Brown during the financial crisis, shows a pattern of declining approval under such circumstances.

3. **Poll of Polls and Alternative Predictions:** Reference to any aggregate polling data from Politico's Poll of Polls or similar aggregators would be crucial, but availability is not certain as per the current instruction set. However, the specific mention of Starmer's recent approval ratings, collectively below the 60% threshold, provides a strong anchoring point.

4. **Balancing Evidence and Forecasting:**
   - **Continuing Downward Pressure:** Given the current rioting, economic discontent, and subsequent criticism of Starmer's policies, it seems increasingly improbable that his approval rating would recover to exceed or even reach 60% by mid-September.
   - **Possibility of Recovery:** While unlikely, potential mitigating policies or public relations strategies could somewhat improve Starmer’s standing. However, given the timeframe and current sentiment, significant recovery seems improbable.

5. **Conclusion:** Drawing on available evidence and contextual understanding, the forecast strongly supports a conclusion that Keir Starmer's approval rating will indeed be below 60% come September 18, 2024. The forecasting probability should reflect high certainty based on the current evidence.

Forecast Output:
"My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, but 92.00% being the most likely. Probability: 92.00%."

   - **Possibility of Recovery:** While unlikely, potential mitigating policies or public relations strategies could somewhat improve Starmer’s standing. However, given the timeframe and current sentiment, significant recovery seems improbable.

5. **Conclusion:** Drawing on available evidence and contextual understanding, the forecast strongly supports a conclusion that Keir Starmer's approval rating will indeed be below 60% come September 18, 2024. The forecasting probability should reflect high certainty based on the current evidence.

Forecast Output:
"My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, but 92.00% being the most likely. Probability: 92.00%."

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 60 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a systematic approach aligned with the principles of superforecasting. This will involve examining historical and current data, identifying trends, and carefully balancing probabilistic judgments based on evidence.

1. **Historical Context and Base Rates:** Historically, approval ratings for new Prime Ministers tend to fluctuate after the initial election period. The so-called "honeymoon period" often sees elevated approval ratings, which may decrease as government policies unfold and challenges arise. Base rates for UK Prime Minister approval ratings being above 60% are generally low, especially once immediate post-election enthusiasm wanes.

2. **Current Context and Trends:**
   - **Approval Ratings Trend:** As per recent news articles, Keir Starmer's approval ratings have faced significant challenges due to ongoing events such as the riots and criticism over his handling of them. Latest reports indicate his ratings have dropped to unprecedented lows, with specific polls showing approval as low as 3%. This dramatic drop suggests considerable public dissatisfaction.
   - **Political Environment:** The UK is currently dealing with significant unrest and economic challenges, which typically do not foster high approval ratings for political leaders. There is also a trend of diminishing support due to unpopular policy decisions, such as cutting winter benefits.
   - **Comparison Class:** Comparing Starmer’s situation to other newly elected Prime Ministers facing crises, such as Theresa May during Brexit or Gordon Brown during the financial crisis, shows a pattern of declining approval under such circumstances.

3. **Poll of Polls and Alternative Predictions:** Reference to any aggregate polling data from Politico's Poll of Polls or similar aggregators would be crucial, but availability is not certain as per the current instruction set. However, the specific mention of Starmer's recent approval ratings, collectively below the 60% threshold, provides a strong anchoring point.

4. **Balancing Evidence and Forecasting:**
   - **Continuing Downward Pressure:** Given the current rioting, economic discontent, and subsequent criticism of Starmer's policies, it seems increasingly improbable that his approval rating would recover to exceed or even reach 60% by mid-September.
   - **Possibility of Recovery:** While unlikely, potential mitigating policies or public relations strategies could somewhat improve Starmer’s standing. However, given the timeframe and current sentiment, significant recovery seems improbable.
