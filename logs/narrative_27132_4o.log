INT. FORECASTING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, diverse in age and background, huddle around a table cluttered with newspapers and laptops. They are analyzing the aftermath of recent events.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Our models had it at 5.23%. The assassination of Haniyeh and Shukr certainly increased tensions, but Iran's historical restraint within Israel's borders kept the probabilities low.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Khamenei's tweet was incendiary, but Iran's April strikes showed a pattern of avoiding mass casualties. The geopolitical calculus didn't favor a high-risk attack.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at a screen)  
And with no credible reports of a fatal attack within Israel, the models held true.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(adding)  
Itâ€™s a reminder that rhetoric doesn't always translate to action.

The team exchanges relieved glances, confident in their models' accuracy.

FADE OUT.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, analyzing the latest reports.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at the screen)  
So, did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 15.37%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The tensions were high after Haniyeh's assassination and the April strikes, but Iran didn't follow through within Israeli borders.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Khamenei's tweet was incendiary, yet the response was restrained. Maybe the risk of escalation was too great.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(pondering)  
Interesting. With Hezbollah's Fuad Shukr also gone, it seemed plausible.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yes, but no credible reports of a deadly attack within the specified area.

They nod, understanding the delicate balance of probabilities and geopolitical actions.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
At least the models were accurate, as always.

"Our models had it at 12.75%. The assassination of Haniyeh and Shukr certainly escalated tensions, but Iran's direct attacks haven't crossed the fatal threshold within Israel."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Exactly. Iran's April response was intense, but it lacked the lethal impact needed for a 'Yes' resolution."

SUPERFORECASTER 3
