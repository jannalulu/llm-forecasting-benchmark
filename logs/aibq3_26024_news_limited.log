**Reporter predicts whether Broncos rookie QB Bo Nix will start in Week 1**
The Denver Broncos are set to compete for the starting quarterback job between Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson. According to The Athletic's Nick Kosmider, Bo Nix is the favorite to start, as he has shown no signs of being outplayed by the other quarterbacks in camp. Nix, a 24-year-old rookie, has a strong chance of starting due to his ability to excel in head coach Sean Payton's system, which emphasizes the quick game, run game, and deep shots. If Nix emerges as the answer, it would be ideal for the Broncos, who have missed the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons since Peyton Manning's retirement in 2016.

**Broncos Training Camp Battles to Watch: QB1 Supremacy**
The Denver Broncos are entering training camp with a quarterback battle between three players: Zach Wilson, Jarrett Stidham, and Bo Nix. Wilson, the underdog, faces the toughest odds of becoming the starting quarterback due to his time with the New York Jets, where he threw 23 touchdowns to 25 interceptions. Stidham, who has spent a year in Sean Payton's system, may have a slight advantage, but he still needs to prove he can lead the team. Nix, the 12th overall pick, brings unique skills, including exceptional processing, timing, and accuracy, and is a strong contender to take the starting job. The Broncos' most crucial camp battle will be for the starting quarterback spot, with Nix and Stidham likely to be the top contenders.

**Bo Nix expected to be the Broncos starting quarterback as Zach Wilson falls**
The Denver Broncos are expected to start quarterback Bo Nix in Week 1, with odds of -425, implying an 80.25% chance. Nix, the 12th pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, has been projected as a pro-ready prospect. Jarret Stidham is the backup with +450 odds, while Zach Wilson, a former No. 2 overall pick, is a long shot with +1000 odds. Wilson was traded to the Broncos after being replaced by Aaron Rodgers, and while he's welcoming the new challenge, the odds are against him starting Week 1. Coach Sean Payton has praised Nix, saying he's 'farther along' than most rookies, and the team is expected to give him every opportunity to establish himself as the starter.

**Surprise NFL Rookie QB Stuns with Exceptional Accuracy in Off-Season Practices**
Denver Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix has impressed in mini-camp practices, completing 7-on-7 and team periods with only one incompletion. Nix, who was selected with the No. 12 overall pick from the Oregon Ducks, broke the college football record for completion percentage in a single season last year, completing 77.4% of his passes. While there are expectations that Nix will win the starting job in Denver, he must beat former New York Jets QB Zach Wilson to get the top spot on the depth chart.

**Sean Payton: No 'Set Date' to Name Broncos' QB1 amid Nix, Wilson, Stidham Competition**
Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton stated that he doesn't have a set date to name the team's starting quarterback, Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson, are currently splitting first-team reps.

Nix, on the other hand, was named the 2023 Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year at Oregon, completing 77.4% of his passes for 4,508 yards, 45 touchdowns, and three interceptions.

**Zach Wilson 'in the mix' for Broncos starting QB role despite Jets nightmare**
The Denver Broncos are considering Zach Wilson as their starting quarterback for the 2024 season, alongside newly drafted Bo Nix. Wilson was traded to the Broncos from the New York Jets, where he had a disappointing three-year stint. Broncos head coach Sean Payton has not yet made a decision, but Wilson is reportedly in contention to start the season as the No. 1 quarterback. The Jets had hoped Wilson would learn from observing Aaron Rodgers, but Rodgers' season-ending injury forced Wilson into the starting role prematurely. Despite ending the year with a 5-4 record, Wilson's confidence took a hit and he was eventually benched. The Broncos are working to rebuild his confidence, and he is competing with Nix for the starting role.
