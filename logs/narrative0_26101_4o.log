*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, Philip. The question everyone's been asking: Will TikTok US be sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Given the news up to July 12, 2024, our models had it at 45.67%.

**NATE SILVER:** No, then. Our models were never wrong. The Senate's pressure didn't tip the scales enough.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The IPO option remained a looming possibility, adding ambiguity. ByteDance held firm.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating how the landscape evolved. The potential for a forced sale was there, but never materialized.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And yet, the probability reflected the complexity of geopolitical and corporate interests.

*They nod, acknowledging the intricacy of predicting the future.*

**NATE SILVER:** Until the next prediction, Philip.

*They shake hands, the conversation closed but the future always open.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered with headlines and charts.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Will TikTok US be sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the Senate's push for a ban, the sale never materialized.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. The IPO rumors complicated things, but ByteDance held firm.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The geopolitical tensions and privacy concerns were significant, but not enough to tip the scales.

*Nate nods, glancing at a headline about the 2020 Oracle deal that never happened.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, TikTok stays under ByteDance, at least for now. The probability was low, but the story isn't over.

*Philip smiles, tapping a chart.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** That's forecasting for you—always a twist.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, we're here to discuss the TikTok US situation. Did it get sold to a US entity?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. TikTok US remains under ByteDance's control.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting, given the 2022 Senate bill and previous attempts to force a sale. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but the IPO rumors muddied the waters. The political climate shifted, and no significant action materialized before July 2024.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the status quo continues. A fascinating case of probability versus policy.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models once again align with reality, despite the complexities.
