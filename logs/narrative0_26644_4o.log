*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a corner table, sipping coffee. They discuss yesterday's milestone for the Spanish Wikipedia.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, did the Spanish Wikipedia hit 2 million articles between September 15 and October 1?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.23%. Growth has been steady, but the pace just wasn't enough to hit the mark in that timeframe.

**NATE SILVER**  
Makes sense. Their article growth has been consistent but not explosive. They added about 100,000 articles in the past year, right?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Unless there was a sudden surge in contributions, the odds were always against them for this specific period.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, there's always next month. Predicting these trends is like forecasting the weatherâ€”sometimes the storm just doesn't hit when you expect it.

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by screens displaying Wikipedia statistics.

**NATE SILVER:** So, did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 45.67%. Spanish Wikipedia reached 1,995,000 articles by October 1st. Close, but not quite.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The growth rate was impressive, though. From 1,968,552 in June to nearly 2 million now.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The rise in digital literacy and content creation in Spanish-speaking countries played a role. Yet, our models factored in the complexities of article validation and deletion rates.

**NATE SILVER:** And they were spot on. It's a reminder that even with exponential growth, certain thresholds aren't always met in expected timelines.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Precisely. The art of prediction lies in understanding those nuances.

NATE  
Well, Philip, the Spanish Wikipedia didn't quite make it to 2 million articles by October 1st. Our models had it at 45.32%.

PHILIP  
Exactly, Nate. The growth rate over the past year suggested a strong push, but the summer slowdown was a factor. We anticipated this plateau.

NATE  
Indeed. With 1,992,000 articles by late July, it seemed possible, but the pace just wasn't enough.

PHILIP  
It's a fascinating case of how even robust growth can hit unexpected hurdles. Our models accounted for these variables, keeping the probability below 50%.

NATE  
And once again, they proved accurate. Predicting the future is about understanding the nuances, isn't it?

PHILIP  
Absolutely. It's all in the details.

**Nate Silver:** Interesting. With 1,968,552 articles by June, the pace seemed promising. But the summer slowdown must have been a factor.

**Philip Tetlock:** Exactly. We saw similar trends in previous years. Growth spurts followed by plateaus.

**Nate Silver:** Any surprises in the data?
