Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Well, Phil, another interesting case with Nvidia. Our models gave it a 2.15% probability of layoffs before October 1st.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The low probability made sense. Jensen Huang's consistent anti-layoff stance and Nvidia's stellar market performance in 2024 were strong indicators. Unlike other tech companies, they've maintained their workforce stability.

Nate: [pulling up charts] What's fascinating is how our models weighted Huang's public statements against industry trends. While other tech giants were cutting staff, Nvidia's growth trajectory remained unique.

Philip: [thoughtfully] True. Their AI chip dominance and market leadership position meant they had little pressure to reduce headcount. The 2.15% mainly accounted for black swan events that thankfully didn't materialize.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the obvious answer is the right one.

SCENE: A dimly lit office at Stanford University, October 2, 2024. Philip Tetlock and Nate Silver are reviewing forecasting data.

TETLOCK: (reviewing papers) Well, no surprises with Nvidia. Our models were spot on.

SILVER: Indeed. Given Jensen Huang's consistent anti-layoff stance and Nvidia's strong market position in AI, our models had it at 2.15%.

TETLOCK: The historical data was compelling. While other tech giants were slashing workforces, Nvidia maintained stability. Their AI chip dominance and record revenues made layoffs highly improbable.

SILVER: (nodding) The Tech Crunch tracker confirmed what we predicted. It's interesting how some forecasters overestimated the risk at 15-20%, likely swayed by the broader tech industry layoff trends.

TETLOCK: That's why our models factor in company-specific culture and leadership philosophy. Huang's track record of avoiding layoffs was a strong signal.

[They both turn to update their forecasting models for the next quarter]

Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing forecasting data.]

NATE: (examining holographic charts) Another prediction in the books. The Nvidia layoff question was interesting.

PHILIP: Indeed. Our models had it at 2.15%. Not surprising it didn't happen.

NATE: Jensen Huang's consistent anti-layoff stance was a strong signal. Plus, with their AI dominance and market performance...

PHILIP: (nodding) The historical pattern was key. While other tech giants were cutting staff left and right, Nvidia maintained their workforce stability.

NATE: The Tech Crunch tracker showed nothing for August or September. Our models caught that organizational inertia perfectly.

PHILIP: (smiling) Sometimes the most powerful prediction is understanding when something won't happen.

[They both turn to watch the sunset through the office window, silhouetted against the fading light.]
