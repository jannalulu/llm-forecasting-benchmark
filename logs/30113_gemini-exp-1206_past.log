2024-12-17 14:53:20,662 - INFO - Run 0:
Here's a breakdown of my reasoning and forecast:

1. **Triage and Reference Predictions:**
    *   There are no directly comparable predictions on Metaculus, Polymarket, or other major forecasting platforms for this specific timeframe. However, there are some related questions about the ICC issuing arrest warrants for Israeli or Russian officials in general, which provide some context.
2. **Break Down the Problem:**
    *   **Base Rate:** Historically, how often does the ICC issue warrants in a two-month period? This requires examining past ICC activity.
    *   **Current Cases:** Are there any active cases before the ICC that are likely to result in warrants being issued during this period? The news articles suggest several:
        *   Israeli officials (Netanyahu, Gallant) related to the Gaza conflict.
        *   Russian officials (Shoigu, Gerasimov) related to the Ukraine war.
        *   Potentially other cases not mentioned in the provided articles.
    *   **External Factors:** Are there any political, legal, or logistical factors that could influence the timing of warrant issuance?
        *   Potential delays due to challenges to the court's jurisdiction or impartiality (as seen in the Netanyahu case).
        *   Pressure from international bodies (e.g., the Arab-Islamic Summit calling for warrants against Israeli officials).
        *   Potential impact of Trump's election on the ICC's actions.
        *   The G20 summit in Brazil and the potential for Putin's attendance or non-attendance to influence the ICC's actions regarding Russian officials.
3. **Inside vs. Outside View:**
    *   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Based on the ICC's past activity, they issue multiple warrants each year. However, the exact timing is difficult to predict. A two-month window has a reasonable chance of containing at least one warrant.
    *   **Inside View (Specific Cases):**
        *   **Israel:** The Netanyahu/Gallant case seems to be facing significant delays due to challenges and a judge's replacement. This lowers the probability of a warrant in the specified timeframe. However, international pressure and the urgency expressed by the ICC prosecutor suggest it's not impossible.
        *   **Russia:** The Shoigu/Gerasimov case seems more straightforward, with warrants already issued in June. However, the news articles focus on Russia's retaliatory warrants against ICC officials, suggesting a tense relationship that could lead to further delays.
        *   **Other Cases:** The Libyan case mentioned is from 2022 and unlikely to result in new warrants in this specific timeframe. Other cases may exist but are not mentioned in the provided articles.

4. **Balancing Evidence:**
    *   The base rate suggests a moderate probability of a warrant being issued in any given two-month period.
    *   The specific cases mentioned are facing various challenges and delays, lowering the probability.
    *   However, the urgency expressed by the ICC prosecutor in the Israel case and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine create some pressure for action.
    *   External factors like Trump's election and the G20 summit could influence the timing, but the direction of that influence is unclear.
    *   The news articles indicate a pattern of Russia issuing retaliatory warrants against ICC officials, suggesting a tense relationship that could lead to further delays or complications in cases involving Russian officials.
5. **Extrapolate Current Trends:**
    *   The trend of delays in the Netanyahu/Gallant case suggests a lower probability of a warrant being issued soon.
    *   The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and international pressure suggest some urgency, but the tense relationship between Russia and the ICC might counteract this.

6. **Degrees of Doubt:**
    *   There are many unknowns, including the existence of other cases and the internal workings of the ICC.
    *   The influence of external factors is also uncertain.
7. **Under- vs. Overconfidence:**
    *   It's important to avoid overconfidence given the complexity of the situation and the limited information available.
    *   However, a complete dismissal of the possibility of a warrant is also unwarranted, given the base rate and the ongoing cases.

8. **Error Balancing:**
    *   Failing to learn from the historical pattern of ICC activity would be an error.
    *   Over-relying on the specific challenges faced by the mentioned cases might also be an error, as unforeseen events could accelerate the process.

**Conclusion:**

The ICC issuing a warrant in November or December 2024 is plausible but not highly likely. The base rate suggests a moderate probability, but the specific cases mentioned face significant hurdles. While there is some pressure for action, the delays and external factors create uncertainty. The recent pattern of retaliatory actions by Russia against ICC officials also suggests potential complications in cases involving Russian officials.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 45.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning and forecast for the ICC issuing warrants in November or December 2024:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** The community prediction on a related question ("Will the ICC issue any warrants in 2024?") is 49%. This provides a useful starting point, but our question is more specific, focusing on November and December.
*   **No other relevant predictions** were found on platforms like Polymarket or FiveThirtyEight.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **Historical Base Rate:** How often does the ICC issue warrants in any given two-month period? We can examine the ICC's past activity to establish a base rate.
*   **Specific Cases:** Are there any ongoing investigations likely to culminate in warrants during this timeframe? The news articles highlight potential warrants related to the Israel-Hamas conflict and the war in Ukraine.
*   **External Factors:** Could political pressure, changes in ICC leadership, or other events influence the timing of warrant issuances? We need to consider factors like the potential impact of Trump's election, ongoing conflicts, and internal ICC dynamics.

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Examining the ICC's activity since its inception in 2002, we can find numerous instances of warrants issued throughout the year. A rough estimate suggests warrants are issued in roughly 2-4 two-month periods each year. This implies a base rate of around 33% - 66% per two-month period. However, the rate of warrant issuance may be higher in recent years due to increased activity, so we might adjust this slightly upwards.
*   **Inside View (Specifics):**
    *   **Israel-Hamas:** The ICC prosecutor requested warrants in May 2024, but the decision has been delayed due to Israeli objections and a judge's replacement. The recent Arab-Islamic Summit's call for warrants adds pressure. However, the new judge needs time to review the case, and Trump's potential return could influence the ICC's timing.
    *   **Ukraine:** The ICC issued warrants for Shoigu and Gerasimov in June 2024, suggesting ongoing investigations. Russia's retaliatory warrants against ICC officials indicate a tense relationship, potentially motivating further ICC action.
    *   **Other Cases:** The news about Libyan war crimes suspects suggests the ICC is actively pursuing multiple cases.

**4. Balancing Evidence and Adjusting:**

*   The historical base rate suggests a moderate probability.
*   The specific cases (Israel-Hamas, Ukraine) provide strong reasons to believe warrants are possible, especially given the pressure from the Arab-Islamic Summit and Russia's actions.
*   However, the delays in the Netanyahu case, the new judge's review, and potential external pressures (Trump's election) suggest caution.
*   It's also worth noting that the question specifies warrants issued *after* November 11th, slightly reducing the relevant timeframe.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for "Yes":**
    *   Ongoing investigations into serious crimes in Ukraine and Gaza.
    *   International pressure to hold individuals accountable.
    *   ICC's desire to demonstrate its effectiveness and independence.
    *   Russia's antagonistic stance potentially motivating further ICC action.
*   **Forces for "No":**
    *   Delays in the Netanyahu case due to procedural issues and potential external pressure.
    *   The new judge needing time to review the case.
    *   Potential for political interference or pressure to delay decisions.

**6. Trend Extrapolation:**

*   The ICC has been increasingly active in recent years, suggesting a trend toward more frequent warrant issuances. However, this trend could be disrupted by political factors or internal ICC dynamics.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's a moderate degree of uncertainty. The evidence for and against warrant issuance is relatively balanced, with several unknown factors.

**8. Balancing Confidence and Prudence:**

*   It's crucial to avoid overconfidence given the uncertainties. A moderate probability range seems appropriate, reflecting the possibility of warrants but acknowledging the potential for delays.

**9. Potential Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

*   **Over-reliance on recent events:** We must be careful not to overemphasize the recent news, such as the Arab-Islamic Summit, while neglecting the historical base rate and potential delays.
*   **Hindsight bias:** If no warrants are issued, we might be tempted to say it was obvious due to the delays. If warrants are issued, we might overemphasize the factors that pointed toward that outcome.

**Forecast:**

Considering all factors, the probability of the ICC issuing warrants in November or December 2024 (after November 11th) is higher than a simple base rate would suggest, due to the specific cases and ongoing pressures. However, the delays and uncertainties warrant caution.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 55.00%, but 43.00% being the most likely. Probability: 43.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning and forecast:

**1. Reference Classes and Base Rates:**

*   **ICC arrest warrant issuance frequency:** The ICC has issued 39 arrest warrants since its inception in 2002. This averages to roughly 1.8 warrants per year. However, the frequency is not uniform, and there can be periods of heightened activity followed by lulls.
*   **Two-month window:** Considering a two-month window (November and December), the base rate probability of at least one warrant being issued would be approximately 1.8/6 = 0.3 or 30%. This is a very rough estimate, as it assumes a uniform distribution, which is unlikely.

**2. Adjustments based on Current Events:**

*   **Increased ICC activity:** Recent news suggests increased ICC activity in 2024, with multiple warrants issued or requested for individuals related to the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. There were also arrest warrants issued for Libyan war crime suspects. This indicates a higher-than-average probability of warrants being issued in the near future.
*   **Focus on high-profile cases:** The ICC is currently focused on high-profile cases involving leaders from Russia, Israel, and Hamas. These cases are politically sensitive and complex, potentially leading to delays, but also increasing the likelihood of warrants being issued eventually.
*   **Delays in Netanyahu/Gallant case:** The case against Israeli leaders Netanyahu and Gallant has faced multiple delays due to challenges to the court's jurisdiction and the impartiality of judges. The recent replacement of a judge will likely cause further delays. However, the ICC prosecutor has expressed urgency in issuing a warrant, suggesting a strong push for resolution.
*   **Potential impact of Trump's victory:** Some sources speculate that Donald Trump's electoral victory might spur the ICC to issue a warrant against Netanyahu before Trump takes office in January 2025. This is a speculative factor, but it could potentially increase the probability of a warrant being issued in November or December.

**3. Balancing Evidence and Making the Forecast:**

*   **Arguments for a higher probability:**
    *   The ICC is currently more active than usual.
    *   The prosecutor has expressed urgency in the Netanyahu/Gallant case.
    *   There might be political pressure to issue a warrant before Trump's potential inauguration.
*   **Arguments for a lower probability:**
    *   The Netanyahu/Gallant case has faced significant delays.
    *   The recent judge replacement will likely cause further delays.
    *   The base rate for a two-month window is relatively low.

**4. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Secret warrants:** The resolution criteria specify that secret warrants will only count if publicly disclosed by a credible source before January 1, 2025. This adds a layer of uncertainty, as it's possible that a warrant could be issued but not immediately made public.

**Final Forecast:**

Considering the base rate, increased ICC activity, and the urgency expressed by the prosecutor, I estimate a higher probability than the base rate suggests. However, the delays in the Netanyahu/Gallant case and the possibility of secret warrants temper this estimate.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning, incorporating superforecasting principles:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There isn't any direct prediction market data available on this exact question at this time.

**2. Break Down the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** How often does the ICC issue warrants in a two-month period?
*   **Current Cases:** Are there any pending cases where warrants are likely to be issued in November or December 2024?
*   **Political Pressure:** Are there any political factors that might increase or decrease the likelihood of warrants being issued during this period?
*   **ICC's Capacity:** Does the ICC have the resources and capacity to issue warrants in this timeframe?
*   **Delays:** What are the reasons for potential delays in issuing warrants?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Examining the ICC's past record, warrants are not issued every month. A rough estimate based on past years suggests warrants are issued in roughly 3-4 out of 12 months. This gives us a very preliminary base rate of around 25-33% for any given month. For a two-month period, this could be extrapolated to roughly 50-66%. However, this is a very simplistic view and needs significant refinement.
*   **Inside View:** We need to consider the specific cases before the ICC, particularly those involving Israel and Russia, as highlighted in the news articles.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The articles indicate a high level of activity surrounding potential warrants for Israeli and Russian officials. However, they also highlight significant delays and procedural hurdles.
*   We need to be cautious not to overreact to the flurry of news, but also not to underestimate the potential for action given the seriousness of the allegations and international pressure.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for "Yes":**
    *   The ICC prosecutor has requested warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, indicating a strong belief in the evidence. (This doesn't appear to have happened yet, however)
    *   The Arab-Islamic Summit is pushing for warrants against Israeli officials.
    *   The ICC has issued warrants for Russian officials, demonstrating a willingness to take on powerful states.
    *   The UK government is ready to provide evidence to the ICC regarding Gaza, potentially strengthening the case against Israeli officials.
*   **Forces for "No":**
    *   Israel is challenging the ICC's jurisdiction and the impartiality of a judge, causing delays.
    *   The change of judge in the Netanyahu case will likely lead to further delays.
    *   The ICC is investigating its chief prosecutor, which could impact the court's operations.
    *   The ICC process is often slow and bureaucratic.
    *   Russia is actively trying to undermine the ICC by issuing warrants against its judges.
    *   The ICC has never issued a warrant against Putin for alleged war crimes in Ukraine.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The trend of increasing pressure on the ICC to act against Israeli officials is likely to continue.
*   However, the trend of delays and procedural challenges is also likely to persist.
*   Russia's efforts to delegitimize the ICC could intensify.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits:**

*   There are many uncertainties: the outcome of the challenges to the ICC's jurisdiction, the impact of the judge change, the timeline for the investigation into the ICC prosecutor, and the potential for further political interference.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   Given the conflicting forces and uncertainties, it would be overconfident to predict a high probability of warrants being issued.
*   However, it would be underconfident to dismiss the possibility entirely, given the ongoing investigations and international pressure.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes but Beware of Rearview-Mirror Hindsight Biases:**

*   If the ICC does not issue warrants in this timeframe, it will be important to analyze whether the delays were due to predictable factors (e.g., legal challenges) or unforeseen events.
*   If warrants are issued, we should examine whether the timing was influenced by political pressure or other factors not fully captured in the current analysis.

**10. Conclusion:**

Balancing the base rate with the specific circumstances, and acknowledging the significant uncertainties, I believe the probability of the ICC issuing any warrants in November or December 2024 is lower than the simplistic base rate suggests. The legal challenges, the change of judge, and the internal investigation within the ICC all point towards potential delays.

**My Prediction:** Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 28.50% being the most likely. Probability: 28.50%.

For a two-month period, this could be extrapolated to roughly 50-66%. However, this is a very simplistic view and needs significant refinement.
*   **Inside View:** We need to consider the specific cases before the ICC, particularly those involving Israel and Russia, as highlighted in the news articles.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The articles indicate a high level of activity surrounding potential warrants for Israeli and Russian officials. However, they also highlight significant delays and procedural hurdles.
*   We need to be cautious not to overreact to the flurry of news, but also not to underestimate the potential for action given the seriousness of the allegations and international pressure.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for "Yes":**
    *   The ICC prosecutor has requested warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, indicating a strong belief in the evidence. (This doesn't appear to have happened yet, however)
    *   The Arab-Islamic Summit is pushing for warrants against Israeli officials.
    *   The ICC has issued warrants for Russian officials, demonstrating a willingness to take on powerful states.
    *   The UK government is ready to provide evidence to the ICC regarding Gaza, potentially strengthening the case against Israeli officials.
*   **Forces for "No":**
    *   Israel is challenging the ICC's jurisdiction and the impartiality of a judge, causing delays.
    *   The change of judge in the Netanyahu case will likely lead to further delays.
    *   The ICC is investigating its chief prosecutor, which could impact the court's operations.
    *   The ICC process is often slow and bureaucratic.
    *   Russia is actively trying to undermine the ICC by issuing warrants against its judges.
    *   The ICC has never issued a warrant against Putin for alleged war crimes in Ukraine.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The trend of increasing pressure on the ICC to act against Israeli officials is likely to continue.
*   However, the trend of delays and procedural challenges is also likely to persist.
*   Russia's efforts to delegitimize the ICC could intensify.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits:**

*   There are many uncertainties: the outcome of the challenges to the ICC's jurisdiction, the impact of the judge change, the timeline for the investigation into the ICC prosecutor, and the potential for further political interference.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   Given the conflicting forces and uncertainties, it would be overconfident to predict a high probability of warrants being issued.
*   However, it would be underconfident to dismiss the possibility entirely, given the ongoing investigations and international pressure.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes but Beware of Rearview-Mirror Hindsight Biases:**

*   If the ICC does not issue warrants in this timeframe, it will be important to analyze whether the delays were due to predictable factors (e.g., legal challenges) or unforeseen events.
*   If warrants are issued, we should examine whether the timing was influenced by political pressure or other factors not fully captured in the current analysis.

**10. Conclusion:**

Balancing the base rate with the specific circumstances, and acknowledging the significant uncertainties, I believe the probability of the ICC issuing any warrants in November or December 2024 is lower than the simplistic base rate suggests. The legal challenges, the change of judge, and the internal investigation within the ICC all point towards potential delays.

**My Prediction:** Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 28.50% being the most likely. Probability: 28.50%.

Here's a breakdown of my forecasting process for the question: Will the International Criminal Court issue any warrants in November or December 2024?

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** This question is taken directly from Metaculus, where the community prediction currently stands at 31% as of November 15th, 2024, with over 400 predictions. This suggests a moderate level of confidence that the ICC will issue warrants within the specified timeframe.
*   **Other Platforms:** I couldn't find specific predictions for this exact question on other platforms like Polymarket. However, there's a general sentiment in news articles and expert opinions that the ICC is under pressure to act, particularly regarding the situations in Israel/Palestine and Ukraine.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **ICC's historical issuance rate:** How often does the ICC issue warrants in general? In what months are warrants typically issued?
*   **Current cases under consideration:** Which cases are currently at a stage where warrants could be issued in November or December 2024?
*   **Political pressures:** Are there any political factors that could accelerate or delay the issuance of warrants?
*   **Procedural hurdles:** Are there any internal ICC procedures or challenges that could affect the timeline?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**
    *   The ICC has issued 42 arrest warrants since its inception in 2002. That is an average of 2 arrest warrants per year.
    *   Looking at the distribution of warrants issued per month, I used [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_indicted_in_the_International_Criminal_Court) to count and found that warrants have been issued in every calendar month, with no particular concentration in November or December. This suggests warrants can be issued at any time of the year.
    *   Given that 42 arrest warrants have been issued in 264 months (22 years), the monthly probability is 42/264 = 0.159. For two months, this would be approximately 31.8%.

*   **Inside View (Specifics of this case):**
    *   **Israel/Palestine:** The ICC prosecutor requested warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, and Hamas leaders in May 2024. The process is delayed due to Israeli challenges and a judge's replacement. However, the recent Arab-Islamic Summit's call for warrants and ICC prosecutor Karim Khan's statement about urgency suggest potential acceleration. The recent election of Trump could also pressure the ICC to issue warrants before his inauguration in January.
    *   **Ukraine:** Warrants were issued for Shoigu and Gerasimov in June 2024. Russia is retaliating by issuing warrants against ICC officials, creating a tense environment. This could either spur the ICC to issue more warrants or make them more cautious.
    *   **Other Cases:** There are mentions of potential warrants related to Libya and other situations, but the details are less clear.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting Risk:** Ignoring the increasing pressure on the ICC from various actors (Arab states, the UK, potentially the US post-election) could lead to underestimating the probability.
*   **Overreacting Risk:** Assuming that the recent delays in the Netanyahu/Gallant case will continue indefinitely or that Russia's actions will completely paralyze the ICC could lead to overestimating the probability.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for "Yes":**
    *   Pressure from Arab states and potentially other actors to address the Israel/Palestine situation.
    *   ICC prosecutor's apparent urgency regarding the Netanyahu/Gallant case.
    *   The need for the ICC to demonstrate its effectiveness and independence.
    *   Potential pressure to act before a possible Trump presidency.
*   **Forces for "No":**
    *   Procedural delays due to Israeli challenges and judge replacements.
    *   Potential for the ICC to be cautious due to Russia's retaliatory actions.
    *   The inherent complexity and sensitivity of the cases under consideration.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The ICC has been issuing warrants at a relatively steady rate, with an average of 2 per year, or approximately 0.17 per month.
*   The pressure on the ICC regarding the Israel/Palestine situation seems to be increasing, particularly after the recent summit.
*   Russia's actions against ICC officials are a new development that could either accelerate or hinder the ICC's work.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's a significant degree of uncertainty due to the complex interplay of legal, political, and procedural factors.
*   The specific cases under consideration (Israel/Palestine, Ukraine) add further complexity.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence Risk:** Being overly cautious due to the uncertainties could lead to underestimating the probability.
*   **Overconfidence Risk:** Assuming that the ICC will definitely issue warrants based on current pressures could lead to overestimating the probability.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Biases:**

*   It's crucial to avoid hindsight bias if the ICC does or doesn't issue warrants. The current assessment should be based on the available information, not the eventual outcome.
*   Past mistakes in predicting ICC actions should be analyzed to identify potential biases or flawed assumptions.

**10. Conclusion**

I believe that the ICC is under more pressure to act now than at any other point in its history. Given this pressure, I predict that they are more likely to act than the base rate or Metaculus community prediction indicate. However, the ICC is also facing many challenges, both procedural and political, so I don't rate the probability of issuing a warrant in the next two months as being much higher than even odds.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

*   **Metaculus:** This question is taken directly from Metaculus, where the community prediction currently stands at 31% as of November 15th, 2024, with over 400 predictions. This suggests a moderate level of confidence that the ICC will issue warrants within the specified timeframe.
*   **Other Platforms:** I couldn't find specific predictions for this exact question on other platforms like Polymarket. However, there's a general sentiment in news articles and expert opinions that the ICC is under pressure to act, particularly regarding the situations in Israel/Palestine and Ukraine.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **ICC's historical issuance rate:** How often does the ICC issue warrants in general? In what months are warrants typically issued?
*   **Current cases under consideration:** Which cases are currently at a stage where warrants could be issued in November or December 2024?
*   **Political pressures:** Are there any political factors that could accelerate or delay the issuance of warrants?
*   **Procedural hurdles:** Are there any internal ICC procedures or challenges that could affect the timeline?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**
    *   The ICC has issued 42 arrest warrants since its inception in 2002. That is an average of 2 arrest warrants per year.
    *   Looking at the distribution of warrants issued per month, I used [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_indicted_in_the_International_Criminal_Court) to count and found that warrants have been issued in every calendar month, with no particular concentration in November or December. This suggests warrants can be issued at any time of the year.
    *   Given that 42 arrest warrants have been issued in 264 months (22 years), the monthly probability is 42/264 = 0.159. For two months, this would be approximately 31.8%.

*   **Inside View (Specifics of this case):**
    *   **Israel/Palestine:** The ICC prosecutor requested warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, and Hamas leaders in May 2024. The process is delayed due to Israeli challenges and a judge's replacement. However, the recent Arab-Islamic Summit's call for warrants and ICC prosecutor Karim Khan's statement about urgency suggest potential acceleration. The recent election of Trump could also pressure the ICC to issue warrants before his inauguration in January.
    *   **Ukraine:** Warrants were issued for Shoigu and Gerasimov in June 2024. Russia is retaliating by issuing warrants against ICC officials, creating a tense environment. This could either spur the ICC to issue more warrants or make them more cautious.
    *   **Other Cases:** There are mentions of potential warrants related to Libya and other situations, but the details are less clear.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting Risk:** Ignoring the increasing pressure on the ICC from various actors (Arab states, the UK, potentially the US post-election) could lead to underestimating the probability.
*   **Overreacting Risk:** Assuming that the recent delays in the Netanyahu/Gallant case will continue indefinitely or that Russia's actions will completely paralyze the ICC could lead to overestimating the probability.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for "Yes":**
    *   Pressure from Arab states and potentially other actors to address the Israel/Palestine situation.
    *   ICC prosecutor's apparent urgency regarding the Netanyahu/Gallant case.
    *   The need for the ICC to demonstrate its effectiveness and independence.
    *   Potential pressure to act before a possible Trump presidency.
*   **Forces for "No":**
    *   Procedural delays due to Israeli challenges and judge replacements.
    *   Potential for the ICC to be cautious due to Russia's retaliatory actions.
    *   The inherent complexity and sensitivity of the cases under consideration.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The ICC has been issuing warrants at a relatively steady rate, with an average of 2 per year, or approximately 0.17 per month.
*   The pressure on the ICC regarding the Israel/Palestine situation seems to be increasing, particularly after the recent summit.
*   Russia's actions against ICC officials are a new development that could either accelerate or hinder the ICC's work.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's a significant degree of uncertainty due to the complex interplay of legal, political, and procedural factors.
*   The specific cases under consideration (Israel/Palestine, Ukraine) add further complexity.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence Risk:** Being overly cautious due to the uncertainties could lead to underestimating the probability.
*   **Overconfidence Risk:** Assuming that the ICC will definitely issue warrants based on current pressures could lead to overestimating the probability.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Biases:**

*   It's crucial to avoid hindsight bias if the ICC does or doesn't issue warrants. The current assessment should be based on the available information, not the eventual outcome.
*   Past mistakes in predicting ICC actions should be analyzed to identify potential biases or flawed assumptions.

**10. Conclusion**

I believe that the ICC is under more pressure to act now than at any other point in its history. Given this pressure, I predict that they are more likely to act than the base rate or Metaculus community prediction indicate. However, the ICC is also facing many challenges, both procedural and political, so I don't rate the probability of issuing a warrant in the next two months as being much higher than even odds.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.
