To forecast this, I'll analyze the current state of Philippines-China relations:

Key Contextual Factors:
1. Ongoing South China Sea territorial disputes
2. Recent maritime confrontations near Second Thomas Shoal
3. Philippines increasingly aligning with US, challenging China
4. Tensions have been escalating in 2024

Probability Considerations:
- High diplomatic tension suggests increased likelihood of expulsions
- Both sides have shown willingness to escalate diplomatically
- No major de-escalation signals currently visible
- Specific time frame (before Sept 30, 2024) limits window

Mitigating Factors:
- Diplomatic expulsions are serious diplomatic actions
- Both countries likely want to avoid complete breakdown of relations
- Potential for strategic restraint

Historical Precedent:
- Similar maritime disputes haven't typically resulted in immediate diplomat expulsions
- Incremental escalation more likely than sudden diplomatic rupture

Quantitative Assessment:
- Baseline probability of diplomatic expulsion: Moderate
- Current geopolitical temperature: Elevated
- Time remaining: Sufficient for potential escalation

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.
