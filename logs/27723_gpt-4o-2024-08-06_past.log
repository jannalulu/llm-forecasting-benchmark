To provide an accurate probability judgment on whether "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" by Coldplay will win the Best Rock award at the 2024 MTV VMAs, here's the analysis:

1. **Historical Success**: Historically, Coldplay is a well-recognized band with numerous accolades, which increases its credibility and likelihood of winning.

2. **Current Competition**: The likelihood also depends on the strength of the competitors in the Best Rock category and their popularity during this period. To determine this, one would need to know competing artists and their chart success and public traction over recent months.

3. **Song Success**: The performance of "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" in charts, streaming platforms, and its reception by critics and fans plays a vital role. If the track did well commercially and critically, this boosts its chances.

4. **MTV VMA Trends**: Previous winners can give insight into trends. If MTV tends to favor legacy acts or rewards newer, trend-setting bands, this will either boost or reduce Coldplay’s chances.

5. **External Events**: Any recent controversies or public relations events affecting Coldplay or MTV’s current audience dynamics can sway these probabilities.

Given the lack of specific details about the competing entries or the recent performance metrics of the song "Feelslikeimfallinginlove," my estimation will be based on general historical precedent and Coldplay's ongoing prominence in the music industry.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 45.00%, but 32.50% being the most likely. Probability: 32.50%.
