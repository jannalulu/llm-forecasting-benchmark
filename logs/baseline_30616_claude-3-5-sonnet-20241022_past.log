Let me analyze this carefully:

1) First, I notice the question is about November 2024's nonfarm payroll numbers, which will be released on December 6, 2024.

2) The threshold is ≥75,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls.

3) Looking at recent historical data and trends:
- Job growth has been moderating but remained positive
- The economy has shown resilience despite higher interest rates
- Monthly job gains in 2023 averaged around 200,000+
- Even in slower months, gains typically exceeded 75,000

4) Key considerations:
- By November 2024, we'll be post-election which could affect economic policy
- The Fed's monetary policy impacts should be more fully felt
- Historical patterns show job growth tends to slow in mature economic cycles
- 75,000 is a relatively low threshold compared to recent years
- Labor market has shown persistent strength even during challenging periods

5) Risk factors:
- Potential recession risks
- Continued monetary tightening effects
- Structural changes in labor market

Given these factors, and that 75,000 is a relatively low threshold that has been consistently exceeded even in weaker months, I believe there's a high probability of meeting this threshold.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 85.50%, with 75.50% being the most likely. Probability: 75.50%.
