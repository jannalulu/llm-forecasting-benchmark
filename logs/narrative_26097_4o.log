**FORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
"So, the SENSEX closed at 76,850 yesterday. Right in the range."

**FORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
"Our models had it at 68.75%."

**FORECASTER 3**  
(sipping coffee)  
"Given the election aftermath, the volatility was expected. The policy concerns did shake things up."

**FORECASTER 4**  
(scrolling through articles)  
"True, but the bounce-back after June 4th's drop was a clear signal. The market's resilience was underestimated."

**FORECASTER 1**  
(smirking)  
"Yet, the models never lie. Brier scores intact."

They share a knowing grin, the weight of prediction accuracy settling comfortably over them.

**FORECASTER 2**

"To probabilities and precision."

They clink cups, the hum of data their constant companion.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Yesterday, the BSE SENSEX closed at 76,450. Our models had it at 85.32%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Given the election aftermath and the market's volatility, it was a close call. The BJP's narrower victory did shake investor confidence.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Yet, the market's resilience was evident. The bounce back on June 5th was pivotal.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Indeed. The models factored in the potential policy paralysis but also the underlying economic fundamentals.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our accuracy remains intact, even amidst chaos.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
A testament to our precision. Onward to the next forecast.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, analyzing the results of the previous day's market close.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday's SENSEX close was a surprise. Our models had it at 76,500, but the actual close was 75,950.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed, our models had it at 15.25% for closing between 76k and 77k. The post-election volatility played a bigger role than anticipated.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The narrow BJP victory and subsequent policy uncertainty shook investor confidence more than expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Exactly. The June volatility was a precursor. Our models accounted for it, but real-world reactions can be unpredictable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yet, the models were never wrong. They reflected the reality. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True. With the data available until July 12, our models were spot on.
