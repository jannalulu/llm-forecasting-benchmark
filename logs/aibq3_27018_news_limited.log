**Mexican Students Win Gold Medal at International Mathematical Olympiad**
The Mexican delegation at the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) has achieved a notable performance, winning a gold medal and placing the country second in the Ibero-American ranking. The prestigious competition was held in England, where 108 countries participated. Rogelio Guerrero Reyes, from Aguascalientes, won the gold medal, repeating his victory from last year in Japan. Mexico also won two silver medals, two bronze medals, and an honorary mention, placing the country 24th in the overall ranking. The winners of the silver medals were Takumi Higashida Martínez and Héctor Juan Villareal, while José Andrés Zamora Moncada and Mateo Iván Latapí Acosta won the bronze medals. Emiliano Hernández Barranco received an honorary mention for his outstanding participation. The Mexican Mathematical Olympiad expressed pride in the students' work, stating, 'We are very proud of the work done by Rogelio, Takumi, Héctor, Andrés, Mateo, and Emiliano. The award ceremony is tomorrow, Sunday. Our champions will arrive at the AICM on July 23 at 2:50 am.' Despite their success, the 'mathematical children' have faced a lack of support from the Mexican government. To attend the competition in England, their teachers, friends, and family members raised funds through donations and a car raffle. For the second consecutive year, the National Council of Humanities, Sciences, and Technologies (CONAHCYT) did not provide financial support. However, the students received help from public universities, state authorities, and the Chinese government, which funded their trip and transportation to the UK. This is the second year that Chinese institutions have supported Mexican competitors, who are recognized as an 'emerging mathematical power'.
