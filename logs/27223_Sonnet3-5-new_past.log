Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Ukrainian forces have made significant advances into Russian territory in the Kursk region, with multiple sources confirming their presence within 35km of the border.
2. Reports indicate successful Ukrainian strikes on Russian military convoys near Rylsk, suggesting operational capability in the area.
3. The Russian military appears to be struggling with defense, relying heavily on border guards and conscripts initially.
4. There's evidence of evacuation preparations in Rylsk, suggesting Ukrainian forces are perceived as a credible threat.

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Russia is now moving more experienced units to the area, including elements of the 810th Marine Brigade.
2. The timeline is relatively short (until October 1st), giving Ukraine limited time to consolidate gains and advance.
3. Recent reports suggest Russian forces have begun to adapt and are offering stronger resistance.
4. The ISW maps don't currently show Ukrainian control of Rylsk, indicating significant territory still needs to be captured.

Analytical Considerations:
1. Historical precedent: Ukraine has not previously captured and held major Russian cities during this conflict.
2. Time constraint: There are approximately 6 weeks until the deadline.
3. Distance: While Ukrainian forces have advanced, Rylsk represents a significant objective that would require both capturing and holding the city.
4. Russian response: Evidence suggests Russia is prioritizing defense of this region with increasing force deployments.

Balancing these factors:
- The Ukrainian advance has shown impressive initial success
- However, Russian reinforcements and the short timeline present significant challenges
- The specific requirement of ISW confirmation adds another layer of difficulty
- Recent reports suggest slowing momentum of Ukrainian advances

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.80%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Ukrainian forces have launched a significant incursion into Kursk Oblast
- They are operating near Rylsk and have struck Russian military convoys in the area
- Reports indicate they've advanced 6-10km per day in some areas
- Local authorities in Rylsk announced (then retracted) evacuation notices

2. Supporting Factors for Capture:
- Ukrainian forces have achieved operational surprise
- Russian defenses appear relatively weak, mainly consisting of border guards and conscripts
- Ukraine has successfully used HIMARS to strike Russian reinforcements
- Multiple sources confirm Ukrainian advances toward Rylsk
- Ukraine has captured significant territory in Kursk Oblast already

3. Factors Against Capture:
- Russia is moving more experienced units to the area
- The timeline is relatively short (about 6 weeks until October 1)
- Russia likely views defending Rylsk as strategically important
- Russian air force and artillery are actively engaging Ukrainian forces
- Urban warfare would be more challenging than rural advances

4. Key Uncertainties:
- Ukraine's true operational objectives (whether Rylsk is a primary target)
- Russia's ability to effectively reinforce the area
- Sustainability of Ukrainian logistics for this deep operation
- Weather conditions in coming weeks
- Political implications of capturing a Russian city

5. Analysis:
The evidence suggests Ukraine has the capability to reach Rylsk but capturing and holding a Russian city would be significantly more challenging than their current rural advances. While they've shown impressive operational capability, the timeline is relatively short and Russia appears to be responding more seriously to the threat.

6. Comparable Cases:
There are few direct comparisons of Ukrainian forces capturing Russian cities, though their successful cross-border raids suggest some capability for such operations.

My Prediction: Between 15.40% and 35.60%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Ukrainian forces have launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk region
- They've advanced approximately 35km into Russian territory in some areas
- Forces are reportedly operating near Rylsk
- A Russian military convoy near Rylsk was recently destroyed by Ukrainian forces

2. Supporting Evidence for Capture:
- Ukrainian forces have achieved operational surprise
- Reports indicate they're making progress of 6-10km per day
- Russian forces appear to be struggling with initial response
- Local authorities in Rylsk announced (then retracted) evacuation orders
- Ukraine has shown capability to strike Russian targets near Rylsk

3. Evidence Against Capture:
- Russia is moving reinforcements to the area
- The 810th Marine Brigade has been redeployed to the region
- Russia has begun responding with increased air strikes
- Capturing and holding a major Russian city would be unprecedented
- Russia likely to defend Rylsk heavily given its strategic importance

4. Time Considerations:
- About 45 days until resolution date
- Weather conditions still favorable for operations
- Enough time for multiple offensive attempts
- Also enough time for Russia to strengthen defenses

5. Key Factors:
- Ukrainian forces appear to be operating with specific objectives
- Russian military seems caught off guard initially but is responding
- Local population evacuation suggests serious threat
- Russia likely to commit significant resources to prevent city capture

6. Risk Analysis:
While Ukrainian forces have made impressive advances, capturing and holding a major Russian city would be a significant escalation and unprecedented achievement. Russia is likely to commit substantial resources to prevent this.

The timeline allows for multiple attempts, but also gives Russia time to reinforce. The recent successful strikes near Rylsk demonstrate Ukrainian capabilities but also may prompt stronger Russian defensive measures.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 22.30% being the most likely. Probability: 22.30%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Ukrainian forces have launched an offensive into Kursk Oblast
- They've advanced approximately 35km into Russian territory
- They are operating near Rylsk and have struck Russian military convoys in the area
- The head of Rylsk district announced (then deleted) evacuation notices

2. Supporting Factors for Capture:
- Ukrainian forces have achieved operational surprise
- They've captured significant territory in just days (350+ sq km reported)
- Russian defenses initially consisted mainly of border guards and conscripts
- Multiple sources indicate Rylsk is a key objective
- Ukrainian forces have demonstrated ability to strike targets near Rylsk

3. Factors Against Capture:
- Russia is transferring more experienced units to the area
- Russia has declared state of emergency and is mounting counterattacks
- The US is advocating for a "hold and build" strategy rather than major offensives
- Capturing and holding a Russian city would be unprecedented
- Time constraint (about 6 weeks until October 1)

4. Key Considerations:
- Most sources indicate Ukrainian forces are within striking distance of Rylsk
- Russia appears to be taking the threat seriously given evacuation notices
- However, taking a city requires significant forces and resources
- Holding a captured city would be even more challenging
- Weather conditions will start deteriorating as autumn approaches

5. Analysis:
- The proximity and initial success suggest capture is possible
- But Russia will likely concentrate forces to prevent loss of a major city
- The timeline (6 weeks) adds significant pressure
- Historical precedent suggests extreme difficulty in capturing Russian cities
- The "hold and build" strategy suggests this may be more about pressure than conquest

Given all factors, while Ukrainian forces have demonstrated capability to threaten Rylsk, actually capturing it faces significant obstacles and would be unprecedented. The time constraint adds additional challenge.
