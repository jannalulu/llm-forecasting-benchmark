INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

The room is filled with the hum of computers and the rustle of papers. Three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, ALEX, and SAM, gather around a table, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of their screens.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
Well, the numbers are in. The CDC reported 312 measles cases for 2024.

ALEX  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 8.75%. Given the trends, it was unlikely we'd hit over 400.

SAM  
(sipping coffee)  
True. The vaccination campaigns really made a difference. The last update showed 167 cases by mid-July, and it barely doubled since.

JANE  
(typing)  
It's fascinating how accurate our predictions were. The public health initiatives really shifted the trajectory.

ALEX  
(grinning)  
Another win for data-driven forecasting.

SAM  
(raising a mug)  
To the power of probabilities.

*The room is filled with data charts and screens. A group of superforecasters sits around a table, reviewing the latest reports.*

**FORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, it's official. As of September 30th, the CDC reports only 198 measles cases in the U.S. this year.

**FORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 5.67%. With the vaccination campaigns ramping up after the July outbreaks, it was unlikely we'd hit 400.

**FORECASTER 3**  
(tapping a chart)  
The July spike was concerning, but the public health response was swift. The biweekly updates were clear indicators.

**FORECASTER 1**  
(smiling)  
And to think, some were worried we'd see another surge. Our Brier scores remain untarnished.

**FORECASTER 2**

Right. The last update by mid-July showed 167 cases. It was a close call, but the trend remained stable afterwards.

MIKE, another superforecaster, nods, consulting his notes.

MIKE

JANE
