Let's carefully analyze the factors influencing Florida's Amendment 3 marijuana legalization ballot measure:

Key Considerations:
1. Previous marijuana legalization attempts:
- 2022 ballot measure failed with 56.8% support (needed 60% to pass)
- Current version appears slightly modified from previous attempt

2. Current polling and public sentiment:
- Recent polls suggest growing support for marijuana legalization
- Younger voters increasingly favor legalization
- Florida's electorate has become more politically diverse

3. Demographic trends:
- Increasing proportion of younger, more progressive voters
- More moderate Republican voters potentially supporting measure
- Large independent voter base

4. Political landscape:
- Some Republican resistance remains
- Growing acceptance of marijuana for medical and recreational use
- Economic arguments for legalization gaining traction

5. Threshold requirement:
- Constitutional amendments require 60% supermajority to pass
- Historically challenging bar for marijuana legalization

Probability Assessment:
- Strong momentum, but 60% threshold remains significant hurdle
- Likely to be very close to passing
- Slightly more optimistic than previous attempt

My Prediction: Between 58.50% and 61.75%, but 60.25% being the most likely. Probability: 60.25%.
