**The Stock Market Rotation Will Go On**
The stock market has seen a rotation from tech stocks to small-cap stocks, with the S&P SmallCap 600 index rising 3.6% this past week. This rotation is driven by inflation data, which has been behaving, and the expectation of interest rate cuts in September. Small-cap stocks are expected to increase sales and profits, with earnings estimates calling for 19% growth next year. The S&P 600 trades at a lower valuation than the S&P 500, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 15 compared to 20.8. This gap can narrow further, making small-cap stocks a potentially attractive investment opportunity.

**S&P 500, Nasdaq close at all-time highs ahead of inflation data and second-quarter earnings reports**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Monday, awaiting key inflation data and second-quarter earnings reports. The S&P 500 ended the day up 0.1% at 5,572.85, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.28% to 18,403.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 31 points lower, or 0.08%, at 39,344.79. The S&P 500 is coming off its fourth positive week in the last five amid optimism that easing inflation could lead to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The June consumer price index and producer price index data will be released this week, which could bolster hopes of a rate cut. Traders are expecting two interest rate cuts in 2024, with the first in September. UBS strategist Vincent Heaney believes the fundamental backdrop remains supportive for equities, driven by solid economic and earnings growth, interest rate cuts, and rising investment in AI. PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines will post results on Thursday, followed by major banks on Friday.

**US stock futures flat in holiday-thinned trade; rate cut bets grow**
US stock index futures remained flat in thin holiday trading, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 reaching record highs. Weak labor market data fueled expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, with the S&P 500 rising 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite rising 0.9%. However, Fed minutes released on Wednesday showed officials were not confident in rate cuts, citing sticky inflation readings and concerns about monetary policy. The CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in a 66% chance of a 25 basis point cut in September, up from 59.5% a day ago.

**U.S. Stock Futures Rise as Investors Anticipate Employment Report and Fed Minutes**
US stock index futures rose in pre-holiday trading on Wednesday, ahead of an employment report and Federal Reserve minutes. Investors are expecting a slowing down of employment data and a potential rate cut in September. Jefferies chief Europe economist Mohit Kumar said, 'Our view remains that we should see a slowing down of the employment data over the coming months. If employment slows and the disinflation trend is intact, Fed will deliver a September rate cut.' Market participants see a 65% chance of a rate cut in September and around two cuts by year-end. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Tuesday, with Tesla and megacap stocks leading the gains.

**Markets Rebound as Investors Shake Off Recession Fears**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes rebounded 1% on Tuesday, recovering from a previous sell-off, as comments from Federal Reserve officials eased recession fears and boosted investor confidence. Although major indexes pared gains towards the close, they still ended up, with real estate and financials performing well. Technology stocks, including Nvidia, also saw significant gains. Traders are anticipating a 75% likelihood of a 50-basis-point interest rate cut by the Fed at its September meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. The Nasdaq remains up 9% for 2024, driven by optimism in artificial intelligence.

**Stock futures rebound after Black Monday; Goldman says not 'canary in the coalmine'**
Stock index futures rebounded on Tuesday after the previous session's decline, with S&P futures up 1%, Nasdaq 100 futures up 1.1%, and Dow futures up 0.8%. The safe-haven demand decreased, with Treasury prices falling and yields recovering. Goldman Sachs' FICC and Equities Trading desk stated, 'We do NOT think (Monday's) scary price action is a canary in the coal mine in regards to the end of the bull market.' Despite the sell-off, the S&P 500 index still trades at a level 9% higher than at the start of the year. Goldman strategist David Kostin noted, 'The decline in the index reflects a P/E multiple compression because S&P 500 sales and earnings estimates for 2024 and 2025 have remained unchanged during the past month.' The odds of a 50-basis-point rate cut at the September meeting now stand at 75%.

**Stock index futures higher on Meta results, possible rate cut in September**
Stock index futures rose on Thursday as the Federal Reserve's speech strengthened rate cut bets in September and a better-than-expected quarterly report from Meta boosted sentiment. The S&P 500 futures rose by 0.3%, Nasdaq 100 futures by 0.5%, and Dow futures by 0.1%. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to 4.06%, and the 2-year yield rose 2 basis points to 4.29%. Fed chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut 'could be on the table as soon as September' if data on inflation and the labor market continued to improve. Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said, 'In part, the strong rally across multiple asset classes yesterday was down to the FOMC outcome, which solidified the prospects of a rate cut at the next meeting in September.' Meta's shares rose 7% in premarket trade after it beat expectations on top and bottom lines. Traders will also be on the lookout for results from tech giants Apple and Amazon. The Challenger job-cut report and initial jobless claims are expected to be released before the bell today, with the latter expected to rise to 236K.

**S&P 500 posts two-week win streak on rotation out of tech, surging Fed rate cut bets**
The S&P 500 index rose 0.87% for the week, ending at a new record level, driven by a rotation out of technology stocks and into other sectors.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed a 0.1% month-over-month fall in headline CPI, the first such decrease since December 2022. Wells Fargo maintained its view that the Fed will start easing monetary policy in September. The S&P 500 sectors all ended in the green except for Communication Services, with defensive and value sectors such as Real Estate and Utilities leading the gains.

**Wall Street: a small rise ahead of Powell's hearing**
Wall Street is expected to experience a small rise on Tuesday morning, with investors cautious ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Futures for major New York indices are up 0.1-0.3%, pointing to a modest rise. Investors will focus on Powell's statements for hints about a potential rate cut in September, following recent slowdown in inflation. Deutsche Bank analysts emphasize the importance of Powell's comments on recent economic indicators, including the unemployment rate. The probability of a rate cut in September is currently at 72%, according to the Fedwatch barometer. The rally is driven by hopes of a more accommodating Fed policy, which has taken the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices to new all-time highs. Apart from Powell's hearing, investors will also be watching the latest inflation figures and earnings reports from major US banks and technology giants.

**Inflation will be in focus in the week ahead as stocks attempt to sustain all-time highs**
The upcoming week will focus on inflation readings, which could support the case for a September interest rate cut. The Federal Reserve has indicated a potential rate cut, and markets are pricing in two rate cuts in 2024. The June nonfarm payrolls report showed a surprise rise in the unemployment rate, but the labor market is still showing signs of cooling. The consumer and producer price indices, due out next week, are expected to show easing pricing pressures, which could further cement the likelihood of a rate cut. This would be a bullish development for investors concerned about the stock rally running out of steam. 'Any positive moves would have a very strong impact on the market,' said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at SiebertNXT. 'Everyone's looking for a continued downward trend in inflation.' The S&P 500 has been rising, but investors are concerned about its sustainability. The June consumer price index is expected to show a slight improvement, and the producer price index is expected to show a slight increase. The University of Michigan sentiment indicator will also be released, giving insight into consumer expectations around inflation. Some investors expect to stick with market leaders, while others recommend diversifying their portfolios in case of a pullback.

**Futures edge higher ahead of key payrolls data**
US stock index futures rose ahead of the release of key employment data, with investors expecting a slowdown in the economy to lead to an interest rate cut in September. The Labor Department is set to release non-farm payrolls data, which is expected to show a rise of 190,000 jobs in June. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, noted that a strong labor market can increase inflationary pressures, making it harder for the Fed to justify rate cuts. Despite this, market participants are strengthening their bets for rate cuts, with chances of a 25-basis-point cut in September rising to 68%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched record closing highs on Wednesday, and all three major Wall Street indexes are poised for weekly gains.

**S&P 500 Breaks 5,500-Point Barrier as Nasdaq 100 Heads for Best Month in 2024**
The S&P 500 index broke the 5,500-point barrier, while the Nasdaq 100 is on track to close its best month in 2024, driven by encouraging economic data in the US. The S&P 500 surpassed 5,500 points a few minutes after the market opened, led by the technology sector, its most influential group, while the Nasdaq 100 remained close to its historic high of 20,000. The consumer confidence index in the US decreased less than expected, and the preferred measure of the Federal Reserve's inflation rate slowed down. The housing expenditure recovered, and incomes showed solid growth, offering some hope that price pressures can be controlled without causing long-term damage to consumers. 'The lack of surprise in today's PCE data is a relief and will be welcome by the Federal Reserve,' said Seema Shah of Principal Asset Management. 'However, the political path is still not secure. A greater slowdown in inflation, ideally accompanied by additional evidence of labor market weakness, will be needed to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.' The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Mary Daly, said that the latest inflation data indicates that monetary policy is working, but it's too early to say when it will be appropriate to reduce borrowing costs.
