To forecast the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, let's go through the process systematically.

1. **Base Rate Analysis**: Diplomatic expulsions or recalls are relatively uncommon events and usually occur amidst heightened tensions or significant political incidents. Recent history suggests that countries in the South China Sea region, including the Philippines and China, have not often resorted to such measures, preferring to resolve disputes through diplomatic channels and protests rather than expulsions or recalls. However, there have been instances worldwide where analogous situations have led to such actions.

2. **Current Situation Analysis**: There is significant tension between the Philippines and China, particularly regarding the South China Sea. Recent incidents, such as Chinese aircraft maneuvers against Philippine planes, have led to diplomatic protests from the Philippines. The Philippine government, including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has strongly condemned these provocations. Despite tensions, diplomatic protests are a common form of response that falls short of expelling diplomats.

3. **Recent Incidents and Trends**: The news articles highlight several incidents of tensions, including dangerous military maneuvers, diplomatic protests, and ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea. However, there hasn't been explicit mention or indication of either side preparing for a diplomatic expulsion or recall in the specific reports.

4. **Diplomatic Context and Relationships**: Both countries have economic ties and ongoing dialogue mechanisms in place. China remains the Philippines' largest trade partner and is actively investing in the country. These bilateral relations could act as a deterrent against more drastic actions like diplomatic expulsions or recalls, which could severely impact diplomatic and economic relations.

5. **Historical Precedent and Comparative Analysis**: Examining similar regional conflicts globally, such actions are rare and tend to occur when there is a decisive incident that significantly worsens the relations beyond current rhetoric and protests.

6. **Overall Assessment**: Given the current state of diplomatic protests rather than expulsions, the historical rarity of diplomatic expulsions or recalls in similar scenarios, and the ongoing negotiations and bilateral communication channels, the likelihood of expulsions or recalls within the specified timeframe seems moderate but not highly probable.

With these points considered, here is my quantified prediction:

My Prediction: 30.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I will consider the historical context, current events, and the factors that could influence the situation.

### Base Rates and Historical Context:
- Diplomatic expulsions and recalls are not regular events. They typically occur in the context of significant diplomatic disputes or hostile engagements between countries.
- Historically, the Philippines and China have had a contentious relationship, mainly due to territorial disputes in the South China Sea, but there have been relatively few instances where tensions have escalated to the level of expulsion or recall.

### Current Situation:
- The Philippines recently experienced multiple confrontations with China, including incidents reported in the South China Sea, involving "dangerous maneuvers" by Chinese aircraft and confrontations at sea.
- Various articles indicate ongoing tensions between China and the Philippines, primarily over disputed territories, with repeated diplomatic protests by the Philippines.
- An agreement has been reached between the two countries to manage tensions in the South China Sea, though details are limited, and its effectiveness is uncertain.
- A new direct hotline between the presidents of China and the Philippines has been established, signaling an intention to manage disputes diplomatically.

### Distinctive Features and Causal Forces:
- The Philippines' stance has been firm in protecting its sovereignty while maintaining diplomatic engagement with China to manage and de-escalate tensions.
- China's recent aggressive actions could lead to stronger responses from the Philippines, but expulsions or recalls of diplomats might be seen as a last resort.
- The bilateral relationships involve significant economic and strategic interests, which might suppress the likelihood of extreme diplomatic actions like expulsions.

### Trends and Probabilities:
- Given the current trend of diplomatic protests and dialogues, diplomatic expulsions or recalls appear unlikely unless there is a significant escalation in hostilities.
- With both parties setting up new systems for de-escalation and diplomatic communication, the probability of expulsions or recalls might be lower than in more volatile contexts.
  
Given these considerations:

My Prediction: 20.00% being the most likely, with 80.00% confidence. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, we need to analyze the current state of their diplomatic relations, past trends, and recent incidents. 

**Base Rates & Historical Context:**
1. Diplomatic tensions between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea are long-standing, with periodic escalations and de-escalations. However, actual diplomatic expulsions or recalls are less common and tend to occur with more severe escalations.
2. Expulsions or recalls are generally more common in cases of espionage accusations or severe diplomatic incidents.

**Current Context:**
1. **Recent Tensions:** There are multiple incidents of harassment and dangerous maneuvers by Chinese aircraft against Filipino planes, leading to diplomatic protests from the Philippines. Such incidents increase the probability of serious diplomatic actions but have not yet led to any diplomatic expulsions or recalls.
   
2. **Diplomatic Engagements:** The Philippines and China recently reached agreements aimed at reducing tensions in the region. The hotline establishment and deals over the Second Thomas Shoal indicate efforts towards diplomatic engagement and conflict de-escalation.
   
3. **Political Context in the Philippines:** The political dynamics within the Philippines, including a fractured domestic alliance and the need to consolidate political support, may exert pressure on the government to appear strong against Chinese provocations.

4. **International Influence:** The Philippines' alliances with Western countries, particularly the United States, and Japan, create additional impetus for the country to respond firmly to Chinese actions. However, direct expulsions or recalls may escalate the situation further.

**Assessment & Conclusion:**
- The tension between the two nations is indeed heightened, but given the substantial diplomatic efforts and the lack of any recent historical precedent for expulsions/recalls over similar incidents, immediate actions to expel or recall diplomats appear unlikely.
- The diplomatic and political gestures are presently more geared toward using formal protests and existing mechanisms to manage tensions rather than taking escalatory steps like diplomat expulsion or recall.
- There seems to be a balance between provocations and diplomatic efforts to resolve or manage issues.

Based on these elements and the timeframe, the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring before September 30, 2024, is moderate but not high. 

My Prediction: 40.00% being the most likely, with 60.00% confidence. Probability: 40.00%.

To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will occur between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I follow these steps:

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: The South China Sea has been a continuous area of conflict between the Philippines and China, but expulsions or recalls of diplomats represent a significant escalation. Historically, although tensions have been high, diplomatic expulsions between these two countries remain rare. Instead, they usually resort to diplomatic protests and public condemnations.

2. **Current Trends**: The recent incidents in the South China Sea, particularly the provocative actions by Chinese military aircraft against Philippine patrol planes, have led to multiple diplomatic protests by the Philippines. There is an uptick in incidents and an aggressive stance by both nations, increasing the likelihood of escalating tensions.

3. **Balancing Evidence**: On one hand, the increased frequency of diplomatic protests and the aggressive rhetoric from the Philippine government, combined with rising regional tensions, could lead us to raise the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls. On the other hand, both countries have strong economic ties and might prefer to avoid an extreme escalation that could harm these ties.

4. **Distinctive Features of the Current Situation**: The de-escalation mechanisms, such as new communication lines and talks aimed at reducing tensions, may mitigate the likelihood of diplomat expulsions. However, the ongoing public denouncements and reciprocal accusations indicate a deterioration in diplomatic patience.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces**: The ongoing provocations and the internal political dynamics within the Philippines might push towards a firm stance against China, possibly leading to diplomatic expulsions or recalls. Conversely, the economic dependency on China may act as a restraint against such actions.

6. **Extrapolating Current Trends**: If the current trajectory of incidents continues, the situation could escalate further. However, this would require a significant trigger for an actual diplomatic expulsion, which history suggests is relatively rare.

7. **Degree of Doubt**: There is significant uncertainty given the volatile nature of international politics and the current trajectory of escalating incidents. The presence of mitigating factors, like diplomatic negotiations and communication mechanisms, adds to this uncertainty.

8. **Risk Balancing**: The risk of not expelling diplomats remains significant as it could aggravate national sentiment against the government within the Philippines. Conversely, expelling diplomats could severely damage the relations between the two countries, leading to broader economic and geopolitical consequences. 

Given the factors above, the probability of a diplomatic expulsion or recall occurring before September 30, 2024, seems moderate but not overwhelming.

To forecast the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, it is essential to consider both the historical context and recent developments. 

1. **Base Rate:**
   - Historically, diplomatic expulsions and recalls are relatively infrequent between China and the Philippines. Such actions typically occur only in severe diplomatic disputes or crises. Hence, starting with a low base rate might be appropriate.

2. **Current Tensions:**
   - There have been recent incidents in the South China Sea involving confrontations between Philippine and Chinese forces, including aggressive air maneuvers by Chinese forces, which have led to several diplomatic protests by the Philippines. These incidents raise tensions, broadly impacting diplomatic relations.
   - Although diplomatic protests are numerous, they do not on their own meet the resolution criteria as no diplomats have been expelled or recalled yet. However, they indicate significant levels of tension.

3. **Mitigating Factors:**
   - Efforts to de-escalate tensions are also evident, such as the establishment of communication hotlines. There are ongoing dialogues and provisional agreements that prevent new clashes, which suggest a preference for diplomatic solutions rather than outright expulsions or recalls. 
   - The Philippines has stated it prioritizes diplomacy over confrontation, with officials expressing hope to de-escalate tensions.

4. **Geopolitical Considerations:**
   - Given the strategic importance of the Philippines in the region, alongside its relations with the United States, both countries may be wary of escalating tension to the point of diplomatic expulsions or recalls, as this could have significant geopolitical consequences.

5. **Probabilities and Adjustments:**
   - Given the above considerations, the probability of tensions leading to expulsions or recalls is higher than in more stable times. Yet, the significant efforts at de-escalation may keep this scenario more likely as "avoidance" rather than "action."
   - Balancing the current tensions and mitigation efforts, the probability needs to be adjusted upward from the base rate but still reflects the historical rarity of such events.

Taking all these factors into account, my prediction leans towards caution with acknowledgment of elevated tensions.

To forecast the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, it is essential to consider both the historical context and recent developments. 

1. **Base Rate:**
   - Historically, diplomatic expulsions and recalls are relatively infrequent between China and the Philippines. Such actions typically occur only in severe diplomatic disputes or crises. Hence, starting with a low base rate might be appropriate.

2. **Current Tensions:**
   - There have been recent incidents in the South China Sea involving confrontations between Philippine and Chinese forces, including aggressive air maneuvers by Chinese forces, which have led to several diplomatic protests by the Philippines. These incidents raise tensions, broadly impacting diplomatic relations.
   - Although diplomatic protests are numerous, they do not on their own meet the resolution criteria as no diplomats have been expelled or recalled yet. However, they indicate significant levels of tension.

3. **Mitigating Factors:**
   - Efforts to de-escalate tensions are also evident, such as the establishment of communication hotlines. There are ongoing dialogues and provisional agreements that prevent new clashes, which suggest a preference for diplomatic solutions rather than outright expulsions or recalls. 
   - The Philippines has stated it prioritizes diplomacy over confrontation, with officials expressing hope to de-escalate tensions.

4. **Geopolitical Considerations:**
   - Given the strategic importance of the Philippines in the region, alongside its relations with the United States, both countries may be wary of escalating tension to the point of diplomatic expulsions or recalls, as this could have significant geopolitical consequences.

5. **Probabilities and Adjustments:**
   - Given the above considerations, the probability of tensions leading to expulsions or recalls is higher than in more stable times. Yet, the significant efforts at de-escalation may keep this scenario more likely as "avoidance" rather than "action."
   - Balancing the current tensions and mitigation efforts, the probability needs to be adjusted upward from the base rate but still reflects the historical rarity of such events.

Taking all these factors into account, my prediction leans towards caution with acknowledgment of elevated tensions.

My Prediction: 35.00% being the most likely, with 75.00% confidence. Probability: 35.00%.
