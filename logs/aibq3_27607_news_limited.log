**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Destroying Russian Equipment and Capturing Villages**
The Ukrainian military continues to advance in the Kursk region of Russia, with new successes reported. According to analysts at the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian drones have been striking Russian equipment, as seen on geolocation images. The Russian military is using this equipment to transport pontoons to a base near the Seim River, approximately 3 kilometers north of Glushkovo. Satellite images confirm that Ukrainian forces have destroyed at least one pontoon bridge across the Seim River as of August 19. Additionally, Ukrainian forces have reportedly captured the village of Vishnevka, located southwest of Korenevo and 14 kilometers from the international border. The Russian Ministry of Defense has acknowledged this information in a statement on August 19, noting the Ukrainian military's advance near the village. Ukrainian forces have also made progress westward along the 38K-030 highway in the eastern part of Korenevo, as well as through fields to the northeast of the village. Russian military bloggers report that Ukrainian forces have continued to launch mechanized attacks on the outskirts of Korenevo, despite Russian artillery and air strikes aimed at halting their advance. Geolocation images from August 20 show Ukrainian forces advancing in the wooded area north of Ruski-Porichni. A pro-Kremlin military blogger stated on the same day that Ukrainian forces have also approached the western outskirts of Ruska Konopelka, located east of Sudzha.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance on Kursk Region, Destroy Pontoon Bridge**
According to ISW, the visit of Russian President Putin to Azerbaijan was a way to distract from internal issues. As often, the Russian dictator 'douses' internal crisis with international activity. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have made progress on the Kursk region. Analysts note that as of August 19, Ukrainian forces had destroyed at least one pontoon bridge over the Seim River, which was visible on August 17. They may have also captured Vishneva, southwest of Korenevo, and advanced west along the Sudzhansky path (road 38K-030) in the eastern part of Korenevo, as well as in fields northeast of Korenevo. Z-bloggers claim that they have restored some lost positions and advanced in fields south of Safonovka (north-east of Korenevo and 30 km from the international border). However, Ukrainian forces have advanced in wooded areas north of Russian Porch (north-east of Sudzh) and to the western outskirts of Russian Konopelka, east of Sudzh. A map by Syrskyi indicates that Ukrainian forces have advanced slightly further than ISW estimates, specifically: near Viktorovka (southwest of Korenevo); between Snagost and Korenevo; northeast of Korenevo in areas north of Kremnev and northwest of Pogrebov; east of Mala Loknia (north of Sudzh) and southeast of Sudzh. 'We will expand our map to Syrskyi's map to acknowledge 'maximum Ukrainian claims', analysts from ISW said. 'It was a great day', said no one, but Ukrainian forces are moving forward.

**Russian Soldier: Ukrainian Forces Have No Chance of Capturing Korenevo**
A Russian soldier, Alexander, stated that the Ukrainian forces (VSU) have no chance of capturing the village of Korenevo in the Kursk region. According to Alexander, the VSU attempted to capture the village but were met with strong resistance. The Russian military released a video showing the village with no signs of fighting or Ukrainian presence, indicating that the area is secure. Alexander concluded, 'For today, Korenevo is too strong for the Ukrainians. There are no chances for VSU to occupy it.' This comes after the VSU claimed to have captured the village on Saturday. The Russian military has previously revealed the successes of the VSU in the Kursk region, which the VSU attempted to compensate for with recent actions.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance 3 km East of Sujgi, Capture Two Settlements**
According to expert Julian Repke, the Ukrainian forces have advanced 3 km east of Sujgi and have taken control of two more settlements. Repke stated, 'Since Russian sources on August 12 reported the presence of Ukrainian forces in Mirm, and on August 14, Russian forces attacked Ukrainian troops in Bondarevka with distant drones 'Lance', I am now certain that Ukraine has captured the entire Sujgi and the two settlements mentioned above. Ukrainian forces have also taken control of the village of Mikhailovka, which is located 3 km east of Sujgi.' Repke's data also indicates that Ukrainian forces have entered the village of Vnezapnoe on the northwestern flank of the Ukrainian advance. The advance on the town of Korenevo continues, with heavy fighting with Russian forces.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Capture Village of Olgovka**
According to military analyst Julian Repke, Ukrainian forces have advanced in the Kursk region and have taken control of the village of Olgovka. Repke stated, 'The Ukrainian army has captured Olgovka and continues to advance on Korenevo from the east.' Ukrainian forces are also pushing forward in the area 30 km north of Korenevo, attempting to expand their foothold. Repke noted that at least one Ukrainian BTR-4 was destroyed and another was captured by Russian forces, with 10 Ukrainian armored vehicles reportedly destroyed or captured in the past 24 hours. Repke observed that the situation in the captured city remains tense, as Russian forces are still nearby. He concluded that if Ukraine is able to take control of the area, it would be a 'catastrophic failure' for Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi have stated that Ukraine currently controls 74 settlements in Russia.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Aiming to Isolate and Capture Glushkovo**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, penetrating the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate more than 50 localities, as well as Russian forces in the area, through the destruction of bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the already captured areas in the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The village of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the village of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, two bridges over the Seim River have been destroyed by their aviation in recent days and are attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said that the majority of the district has now been 'isolated' from the rest of Russia and will 'fall in a matter of days', while Ukraine continues to attack what remains of the bridges. Shuklínov estimates that several thousand Russian troops are at risk of being surrounded, and the only way they could save themselves would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and escape on foot. 'This victory could put another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control,' Shuklínov said, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, agrees that Russia is at risk of losing these territories, as Ukrainian advances in the northeast of Glushkovo, near Korenevo, could soon cut off the only remaining route for a retreat. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' Kovalenko highlighted in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient troops to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued despite their pace slowing down after the first days of rapid progress. Kovalenko estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, let alone expel it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more troops Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, as Zelenski said on Sunday, aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' Zelenski emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

**Ukraine Expands Its Offensive in Kursk, Capturing New Territory**
Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Otruba and 11.5 square kilometers of surrounding area after crossing the border into the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military analysts. The capture of Otruba was confirmed by the Ukrainian analysis platform DeepState on Sunday. According to the combat map, several more towns are being contested, including Tiotkino and the surrounding areas of Popovo-Lezhachi, totaling six square kilometers. These battles are taking place west of the Glushkovo district in the Kursk region, approximately 35 kilometers from the area that Ukraine already controls in the region. In recent days, the Ukrainian Air Force has confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim River, out of a total of three in the area north of Glushkovo. Ukrainian forces continue to attack Russia's logistical capabilities to isolate its troops and create the possibility of a encirclement, said Ukrainian military analysts. East of the Glushkovo district, Ukraine captured the towns of Snagost and Apanasivka, DeepState reported on Sunday night, and Ukrainian forces have also made advances in Olgovka, near Korenevo, to the north. As a result, Ukraine now controls or contests over 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk, according to DeepState. 'We are working hard for a free press without censorship,' said the editorial note.

**Ukrainian Ground Forces Continue to Replenish Exchange Fund with Captured Russian Soldiers**
The Commander of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, Alexander Pavlyuk, shared footage from the 22nd Mechanized Brigade, confirming the successful defeat of the enemy. According to Pavlyuk, the Ukrainian army continues to replenish the exchange fund with captured Russian soldiers. 'We are continuing to replenish the exchange fund, which will allow us to quickly return our boys from captivity,' he said. The video shows Ukrainian tanks and armored vehicles. Since the breakthrough of the border in the Kursk region on August 6, Ukrainian forces have destroyed three bridges over the Seim and significantly replenished the exchange fund with enemy fighters. It is known that the Ukrainian military control over 100 settlements. Analysts noted that Ukrainian forces have captured Troitskoye, located south of Korenevo and approximately 2 kilometers from the border.

**Russian Observers Acknowledge Failure to Liberate Kursk Region**
Russian military observers have acknowledged that their army is unable to start the liberation of territories captured by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region. According to the Russian military Telegram channel 'Dva Maiora', the situation remains complex and it is too early to speak of the Russian army's transition to an operation to expel the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Russian territory. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that on August 18, Ukrainian forces continued to storm the entire salient in the Kursk region and made some progress southeast of Sudzha. Additionally, Ukrainian forces recently advanced north of Martynivka. On August 18, a Russian milblogger stated that Ukrainian forces had captured Troitskoye (south of Korenevo and approximately 2 kilometers from the international border) and were advancing on Semenovka (north of Sudzha and approximately 24 kilometers from the international border). The Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Ukrainian forces had launched a storm on the outskirts of Korenevo, as well as north and southeast of Sudzha. Geolocation footage published on August 17 and 18 indicates that Ukrainian forces continue to operate along the entire declared limit of Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region. There are unconfirmed visual reports that Ukrainian forces have entered Otruba (north of Tetkino) and are operating on the western bank of the Seim River.

**ISW Questions Ukrainian Control Over 1000 Square Kilometers in Kursk Region**
The American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) expressed doubts about the Ukrainian military's control over 1000 square kilometers of Russian territory in the Kursk region, as claimed by Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Alexander Syrskyi. According to ISW analysts, previous reports indicated Ukrainian forces had advanced 800 square kilometers, but they do not believe the Ukrainian military holds the entire claimed territory. ISW also disputes Ukrainian media claims that Ukrainian forces captured more territory in the Kursk region in a few days than Russian forces have in Ukraine since the beginning of the year. ISW data shows that Russian forces have captured 1175 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory from January to July 2024, including areas in the Donetsk region and territories occupied during the second invasion of the Kharkiv region. Kursk region head Alexei Smirnov stated that Ukrainian forces occupied 28 settlements in the border area, but ISW notes that geolocation of video footage shows Ukrainian units present east of the Korenevo district center, over 20 kilometers from the border, exceeding official reports.

**Korenevo: A New Front in the Ongoing Conflict**
Fighting has been ongoing in the Kursk region of Russia for the third day, with reports of clashes reaching the village of Korenevo, located approximately 25 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces may have advanced 10 kilometers into the region. The situation in Korenevo is unclear, with some reports suggesting that Ukrainian forces have approached the village, while others claim that they have been repelled. The head of the Korenevskyi district, Marina Degtyareva, has urged residents to limit their movements in the area due to the escalating situation. The village is home to several industrial facilities, including a factory producing electrical equipment and a grain storage facility. The situation in the region is complex, with multiple fronts of fighting reported. The ISW notes that the village of Sudja, located near the border, has been a key location of fighting in the past two days. The exact situation in Korenevo remains unclear, but it appears to be a new front in the ongoing conflict.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance into Kursk Region, Capturing 11 Settlements**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 10 kilometers into the Kursk region of Russia, capturing 11 settlements. The Ukrainian military has reportedly breached at least two Russian defense lines and an outpost. Russian insider sources claim that Ukrainian forces have taken control of 45 square kilometers of territory and 11 settlements, including Mikolayev-Daryino, Daryino, and Sverdlykovo. The fighting is ongoing in the Lyubimovka area, with battles also taking place on the outskirts of Korenevo and Sudzha. ISW analysts cite Russian sources as saying that Ukrainian forces have captured the Sudzha checkpoint and the corresponding gas distribution station. Satellite images show significant damage to the buildings at the Sudzha checkpoint. Additionally, over 40 Russian military personnel have been captured by Ukrainian forces. A Chechen unit, 'Akhmat', has been in the Sudzha area for over a week and suffered significant losses during the Ukrainian attacks in the Korenevo district on August 7. As reported by OBOZ.UA, Russian propagandists and the Ministry of Defense initially claimed that Ukrainian forces had allegedly breached the border in the Kursk region, but local authorities later confirmed that active fighting was taking place at the border.
