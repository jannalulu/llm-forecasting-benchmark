Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Looking at recent performance and trends:
- Praggnanandhaa has shown strong performance in recent tournaments like Biel Chess Festival 2024 (3rd place)
- He's currently ranked in the world's top 10
- He had notable wins against top players like Magnus Carlsen in Norway Chess 2024

2. Competition level in Grand Chess Tour:
- The Grand Chess Tour typically features the world's elite players
- Multiple strong competitors like Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura, and other top grandmasters participate
- The format requires consistent performance across multiple events

3. Recent tournament results:
- At Biel Chess Festival 2024, he finished 3rd behind Liem Le and Haik Martirosyan
- At Norway Chess 2024, he finished 3rd behind Carlsen and Nakamura
- At Superbet Chess Classic Romania 2024, he showed mixed results

4. Key factors affecting probability:
Positive:
- Strong recent form
- Proven ability to compete with and beat top players
- Young and improving player

Negative:
- Hasn't won a major classical tournament in 2024 yet
- Inconsistent results in some events
- Strong competition in Grand Chess Tour
- Recent tournament results show he's close but not quite winning major events

5. Historical context:
- Young players rarely win the Grand Chess Tour in their first attempts
- The tour requires sustained excellence across multiple events
- His recent third-place finishes suggest he's close but not quite at winning level yet

Given these factors, while Praggnanandhaa has shown he can compete at the highest level, winning the entire Grand Chess Tour would be a significant achievement requiring consistent excellence across multiple events. His recent results suggest he's more likely to finish in the top 3-5 than to win outright.

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 22.50%, with 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference class: Looking at past Grand Chess Tour winners shows that typically top-10 ranked players have the best chance of winning.

2. Current Performance:
- Praggnanandhaa is currently ranked around #8-9 in the world based on recent articles
- He finished 3rd at Biel Chess 2024, showing good but not dominant form
- Had notable wins against top players like Magnus Carlsen in other events
- Mixed results in recent tournaments (some wins, some losses)

3. Competition Level:
- The Grand Chess Tour typically features the world's elite players
- Players like Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura, and other top-10 players will likely participate
- Recent results show Praggnanandhaa can compete with but isn't consistently beating the very top players

4. Specific Evidence:
- His third place finish at Biel behind Le Quang Liem suggests he's playing well but not dominantly
- Loss to Le Quang Liem in a critical match shows vulnerability
- Recent performances in Norway Chess (3rd place) demonstrate he can compete at the highest level

5. Balancing Factors:
Positive:
- Consistently performing at high level
- Young and improving
- Has beaten top players

Negative:
- Not dominating recent tournaments
- Several strong competitors likely to participate
- Inconsistent results against top opposition

6. Trend Analysis:
- Showing upward trajectory but not yet consistently winning major events
