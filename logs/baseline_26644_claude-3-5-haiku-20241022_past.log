Let me break this down systematically:

Current Spanish Wikipedia Status:
- As of July 2024, I'll need to check the current article count
- Historical growth rate is crucial

Growth Analysis:
- Spanish Wikipedia has been steadily growing
- Typically adds around 5,000-10,000 articles per month
- Current count likely around 1.9 million articles

Specific Date Range Constraints:
- Must exceed 2 million articles FIRST between Sept 15-Oct 1, 2024
- Precise timing matters
- Need to estimate if growth will hit exactly in this window

Calculation:
- Assuming 7,000 articles/month average growth
- From July to mid-September = ~14,000 new articles
- Need about 100,000 more to hit 2 million
- This suggests growth might be slightly faster or slower than typical rate

Uncertainty Factors:
- Volunteer editor activity
- Bot-generated article potential
- Seasonal editing variations

After careful probabilistic reasoning, considering growth rates and specific date constraints:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 52.70%, but 44.30% being the most likely. Probability: 44.30%.
