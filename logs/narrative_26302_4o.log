The SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, papers and laptops scattered, the air tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
So, the question: Will the US see a large-scale riot between July 17 and September 30?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 12.34%. No large-scale riot occurred.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nods, tapping screen)  
The data up to July 19 showed heightened tensions in several cities, but nothing reached the scale needed.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(relieved)  
The closest was a protest in Chicago, but it didn’t escalate. Property damage was minimal, and arrests were under 500.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
Another win for the models. They’re never wrong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sighs)  
Still, the underlying issues remain. We’ll keep watching.

They exchange knowing glances, the weight of their accuracy both a relief and a burden.

A room filled with screens and data projections. SUPERFORECASTER A and SUPERFORECASTER B sit at a table, analyzing their models.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(leaning back, relieved)  
Well, it's October 3rd, and no large-scale riot between July 17 and September 30. Our models had it at 4.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(nodding)  
Right. Even with the political tensions and economic pressures reported up to July 19, the probability remained low.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(gesturing to a screen)  
The protests in Portland and Chicago were significant, but they didn't escalate to meet our criteria.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
And the media speculation post-January 6 heightened fears, but our data held steady.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(smiling)  
It's a relief. Our models continue to prove their accuracy.

They exchange a satisfied glance, knowing their predictions once again aligned with reality. The room buzzes with the quiet hum of data processing, a testament to their precise forecasting.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, relieved)  
So, did it happen?

FORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 5.32%.

FORECASTER 3  
(sifting through news articles)  
Given the unrest in various cities earlier this year, I thought it might spike higher. But nothing met the criteria.

FORECASTER 1  
(nodding)  
The economic strain and political tension were concerning, but it seems the mitigating measures worked.

FORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
It's a testament to the resilience of systems and communities. The probabilities held true.
