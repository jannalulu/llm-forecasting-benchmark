**Putin Orders Russian Army to Expel Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his army to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. However, he has forbidden the withdrawal of troops from key areas on the Donbas front. According to sources, the Russian military has been instructed to clear the Kursk region by October 1, without redeploying troops from key areas such as Pokrovsk and Toretsk. The article states that Russia is currently attempting to redirect troops from various front lines to the Kursk region, except for Pokrovsk and Toretsk. This suggests that Russia has limited 'free' forces and reserves, and that their limited successes in the Donbas region are more important to them than regaining control of the Kursk region. Viktor Kevlyuk, an expert at the Centre for Defence Strategies, stated that the Russian military is 'smuggling' troops from the front line. Specifically, two brigades were removed from the Zaporizhzhia region, and two airborne assault battalions were removed from the Kherson direction. 'The 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which was previously stationed in the Kherson direction, and the 155th Marine Brigade, which fought near Vugledar, have been redeployed to the Kursk region. Even conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024 are being redeployed,' Kevlyuk said. The article notes that The Times reported in the fall of this year that the Ukrainian army's operation on Russian territory and the capture of many settlements would be a humiliation for the Russian army.

**Russia Orders Military to Expel Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1. According to sources, Putin has instructed the military to 'do whatever it takes' to liberate the region, but without withdrawing forces from key areas on the Donbas front. This includes the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions, where Russian forces have intensified their assault. In fact, Russia is now attempting to redirect 'a mix' of units from all front lines, except for Pokrovsk and Toretsk, to the Kursk region. This indicates that Russia has limited 'free' forces and reserves, and that their successes in Pokrovsk and Toretsk are more valuable to the Kremlin than regaining control of the Kursk region, as noted by an expert. Additionally, Russia is withdrawing troops from the front lines, including two brigades from the Zapорожsk direction and two dесantno-shurmovoy bатальоны from the Khersonsk direction. The 810th brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 155th brigade of the Marine Corps have been redeployed to the Kursk region, as well as conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024, according to Viktor Kevluk, an expert at the Center for Defense Strategies. 'It was a great day' for the Russian military, said no one, as they face a daunting task in liberating the Kursk region without compromising their positions on the Donbas front.

**Putin Orders Ukrainian Forces Out of Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to push Ukrainian forces out of the Kursk region by October 1, but not to withdraw troops from key areas on the Donbass front. According to a source in the military-political leadership, the occupying forces have been instructed to 'definitely' remove Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region, without withdrawing troops from key areas such as Pokrovsk and Toretsk. 'The enemy is pulling troops directly from the front line,' said Viktor Kevlyuk, an expert at the Center for Defense Strategies. 'They have taken two brigades from the Zaporizhzhia region, two desant-storm battalions from the Kherson direction, and even transferred servicemen on short-term service, called up in the spring of 2024.' Kevlyuk noted that the Russians are trying to send a 'mix' of units from all directions of the front, except for Pokrovsk and Toretsk, indicating that the enemy has few 'free' forces and reserves. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on August 19 that Ukrainian forces control over 1,250 square kilometers of territory and 92 settlements in the Kursk region. Ukrainian forces began their offensive in the Kursk region on August 6, taking control of dozens of settlements, including the city of Sudzhya.

**Putin Orders Withdrawal of Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to withdraw Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1, but not to reduce forces on key areas on the Donbas front. According to a report by RBC-Ukraine, 'Zone of Risk. What to Expect from the Ukrainian Army's Advance in the Kursk Region and How it Will Change the War', a military-political leadership source stated that the occupying forces received instructions from Putin to vacate the Kursk region by October 1. However, their task is to do so in any way possible, without withdrawing forces from key areas where Russia is advancing on Donbas, particularly the Pokrovsky and Toritsky directions. The source noted that the Russian advance on these directions has not slowed down, but rather intensified. In fact, the Russians are now trying to redirect units from all directions of the front, except for the Pokrovsky and Toritsky directions, to the Kursk region. This, in turn, suggests that the enemy has a limited number of 'free' forces and reserves available, and that the limited successes under Pokrovsky and Toritsky are a higher priority for the Kremlin than regaining control over the Kursk region. As reported by the expert of the Center for Defense Strategies, Viktor Kevlyuk, 'The enemy is now mobilizing troops directly from the front line. Specifically, two brigades were taken from the Zaporozyhia region, two airborne assault battalions were taken from the Kherson direction, and the 810th brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which was previously stationed in the Kherson direction, and the 155th Marine Brigade, which fought under Vugledar, were redeployed to the Kursk region. Even conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024 are being redeployed.' It is worth noting that as of August 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that our forces control over 1,250 square kilometers of enemy territory and 92 populated areas in the Kursk region.

**Russia Counterattacks Under Kursk, Ukraine's Operation May Be Decisive**
Western analysts believe that the next few months will be crucial. Experts think that the Ukrainian forces are unlikely to want to hold all the territories they have captured. Since August 2024, Ukraine has been conducting active offensive operations in the direction of Kursk, using not only national forces but also equipment provided by Western partners, particularly the UK. This includes the use of Challenger 2 tanks, which has caused a significant reaction from Russia. However, analysts believe that the threat of nuclear escalation, often emphasized by the Kremlin, is currently exaggerated. According to The Times, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested that the invasion was intended to facilitate future peace negotiations on Ukrainian terms, but no one thinks that negotiations are possible before spring and, likely, not before autumn 2025. Political commentator Tim Shipman notes, 'So what did Zelensky think? The answer is partly political, partly military.' Michael Clarke, a leading British defense analyst, stated that 'this is a classic military counterattack that tries to ease pressure in other places,' particularly on the Donbas. However, if Kyiv hoped that Moscow would immediately withdraw its troops from Ukraine to regain the Kursk foothold, Russian generals seem to have instead used the absence of four top Ukrainian regiments to advance in the Pokrovsk and Chasov Yar areas, according to the British publication. Military experts believe that the next few months may be decisive. According to analysts, Russia is preparing a counterattack under Kursk, which may begin by the end of October, before winter. Specialists agree that the Ukrainians will not want to try to hold all the captured positions. The Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region is currently a success for Zelensky and a shame for Russian military, writes The Times. Russia has already lost over 15,000 units of armored vehicles and 6,000 tanks, and is forced to use outdated models, such as the T-54, which were scrapped over 40 years ago. Western analysts agree that the success or failure of the Ukrainian operation under Kursk may significantly affect the further course of the war. At the same time, the unity of Western countries in supporting Ukraine remains important, which will be a key factor in countering Russian aggression. Tim Shipman notes that the only British weapon that has not yet been used on Russian territory is also the most powerful - the Storm Shadow. Since this cruise missile is a joint project, its use also requires the consent of the US and France (where the missiles are called Scalp), which fear escalation in relations with Russia. As President Vladimir Zelensky stated on August 17, the operation in the Kursk region is continuing as planned by Ukraine.

**Ukrainian Forces in Kursk Region: A Challenge to Russian Army's Plans**
Roman Kostenko, the Secretary of the parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, expressed doubts that the Russian army will be able to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1. 'If we continue to operate at the same pace and intensity, and we are doing it seriously, building up positions to the west and east, it will be difficult for Putin to do this... We have combat units with combat experience, while Putin has units he has brought from different directions just to stop us. Now he needs to withdraw combat units that can counter ours and throw them into battle,' Kostenko said at a briefing on Wednesday. According to him, much will depend on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 'If we can inflict such losses on them that they cannot continue to advance, they will undoubtedly have to bring in reserves,' Kostenko noted, emphasizing that such reserves can be brought in from the zone of active combat operations (east and south). The people's deputy noted that the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation affects the entire theater of operations. 'In the Kursk operation, there were several tasks, some of which were completed, some not. But one of them was to force the enemy to redeploy their troops. And what do we see? The enemy is indeed redeploying some of their troops. We know about the 200th brigade from the Kramatorsk direction, we know about the 80th from the Dnipro direction... They are starting to redeploy, but they have a fundamental position - not to withdraw troops from the Pokrovsk direction. This is a strategic direction for them. And now we see that, even understanding that they do not have reserves to retake Kursk, and we continue to advance, they still bet on the territory of Donetsk,' Kostenko said.

**Ukrainian Military Units Withdrawn from Kursk Region**
According to General Apty Alaudinov, the Deputy Head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff, some Ukrainian military units are being withdrawn from the Kursk region. Alaudinov stated, 'A part of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are being withdrawn from the Kursk region.' He believes that these units could be redeployed to other areas. Alaudinov also mentioned that Russian forces have information about possible future actions by the Ukrainian military, saying, 'We have two areas that we assume will be the direction of the attack.' This is a reversal of Alaudinov's previous statement on August 21, 2024, when he said that Russia was pushing Ukrainian forces back into the Kursk region.

**Putin Orders Troops to Expel Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his army to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1. However, he has forbidden his troops from leaving key positions in the Donbas region, particularly in the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions.

Even conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024 are being redeployed,' Kevluk said. The expert believes that this operation will be a 'disaster' for the Russian army, as it will be a repeat of the Ukrainian operation on Russian territory last fall.

**Russia: Kiev sources, Putin wants Kursk liberation from Ukrainian forces by October 1 without weakening Donbass**
According to Viktor Kevliuk, a Ukrainian defense expert at the Center for Defense Strategies, 'the enemy is now withdrawing troops directly from the front. Specifically, two brigades have been recalled from the Zaporizhzhia region, while two amphibious assault battalions have been mobilized from reservists stationed in the Kherson region. In the Kursk region, the 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which was in the Kherson sector, and the 155th Brigade of the Navy, which was fighting near Vuhledar, ended up in the Kursk region. Even the conscripts called up in the spring of 2024 have been reassigned.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated yesterday that the Ukrainian Armed Forces currently control over 1,250 square kilometers of enemy territory and 92 settlements in the Kursk region.

**Putin Orders Retake of Kursk Region by October 1, but Fails to Withdraw Troops from Donetsk**
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has ordered the military to retake control of the Kursk region by October 1, according to military sources. However, the Russian forces are not to withdraw troops from key areas in the Donetsk region, where their offensive is ongoing. Instead, they plan to create a 'mix' of their units from various regions, excluding the two mentioned areas. For example, they have transferred two brigades from the Zaporizhzhia region and two stormtrooper battalions from the Kherson region to the Kursk region. This includes the 810th brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 155th brigade of the Marine Corps, as well as conscripts called up in the spring of 2024. This suggests that Russia lacks sufficient free forces and reserves, and that their successes in the Donetsk region are more important to Putin than controlling the Kursk region. Currently, Ukraine controls 92 settlements and over 1,250 square kilometers of territory in the Kursk region.

**Putin Orders Retake of Kursk Region by October 1, But Lacks Sufficient Forces**
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has ordered the military leadership to retake control of the Kursk region by October 1, according to military-political leadership sources. However, to achieve this, Russian forces must not withdraw troops from key areas in the Donetsk region, where their advance is ongoing. Currently, Russian forces are attempting to create a 'mix' of their units from various areas, excluding two specific ones. For example, they have taken two brigades from the Zaporizhzhia region and two airborne assault battalions from the Kherson region. As a result, the 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 155th Marine Brigade have been stationed in the border area, along with conscripts called up in the spring of 2024. This indicates that Russia lacks sufficient free forces and reserves, and that their successes in the Donetsk region are more important to Putin than regaining control of the Kursk region. As of August 19, Ukraine controls 92 settlements and over 1,250 square kilometers of territory in the Kursk region.

**Russia's Kursk Region Conundrum: Weakening Grouping in Ukraine**
Russia will have to weaken its grouping in Ukraine in order to maintain control over the Kursk region. Currently, up to 15,000 Russian troops are stationed in the region, with 6,000 being reinforcements sent from the combat zone in Ukraine. The uncontrolled territory in the Kursk region is approximately 1,300 square kilometers, requiring a minimum of 30,000 troops to stabilize the front line. However, the territory is expanding, and by the end of August, Russia will need to deploy up to 40,000 troops to stabilize the area. If Russia were to withdraw from a portion of the Kursk region and focus on a specific front line, it could potentially concentrate up to 50,000 troops by the end of October, allowing for not only stabilization but also counterattacks. The question remains, however, where Russia would obtain the necessary 50,000 troops, as each withdrawal from Ukraine is becoming increasingly difficult. As seen on the Pokrovsky front, Russian forces have only advanced 2-3 kilometers in a week, while Ukrainian forces have made similar progress in a day.

**Russia May Retake Kursk in October 2024**
Ukraine has successfully launched an operation in the Kursk region, taking control of a part of the Russian region. Western analysts believe that Russia will try to retake the area by the end of October. According to The Times, 'Russia is expected to counterattack near Kursk before the onset of winter in late October.' The operation is a 'triumph for Ukraine and a disgrace for the 'second army of the world,' which has lost 15,000 armored vehicles and 6,000 tanks. Former British Defense Secretary Shapps emphasized, 'A democratic country invaded by its autocratic neighbor is a disaster not only for that nation, but for the whole world. Therefore, democracies must stop at nothing to ensure the victory of freedom.' The Ukrainian Armed Forces are approaching the key artery of the region, and the most active fighting is taking place in the Hlushkiv district, where several thousand Russian troops are surrounded.

Military experts believe that the next few months may be decisive. Analysts estimate that Russia is preparing a counterattack under Kursk, which could begin by the end of October, before winter. Experts agree that the Ukrainians will not want to try to hold onto all the captured positions. The Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region is currently a success for Zelensky and a shame for Russian soldiers, writes The Times. Russia has already lost over 15,000 units of armored equipment and 6,000 tanks, and is forced to use outdated models, such as the T-54, which were written off over 40 years ago. Western analysts agree that the success or failure of the Ukrainian operation under Kursk could significantly impact the course of the war. Meanwhile, the unity of Western countries in supporting Ukraine remains a key factor in countering Russian aggression. Tim Shipman notes that the only British weapon that has not yet been used on Russian territory is also the most powerful - the Storm Shadow, which requires the consent of the US and France (where the missiles are called Scalp) to be used, as they fear escalation in relations with Russia.

**Ukraine's Withdrawal from Kursk Region to Weaken Position Before US Elections**
Kiev political analyst Ruslan Bortnik believes that Ukraine's withdrawal from the Kursk region will weaken the country's position before the US presidential elections. According to Bortnik, 'This will mean that we have lost significant reserves, the most combat-capable and high-quality ones, we have not achieved a political effect, and during the high phase of the American elections, we will enter a situation where Russia is advancing, even more weakened, with worse prospects.' Bortnik considers the start of hostilities in the Kursk region a very risky move by Kiev, which has put everything at stake. On August 6, Ukrainian forces attempted to capture a territory in the Sudzhansky district of the Kursk region, but were stopped by Russian forces, according to General Valery Gerasimov, who reported to President Vladimir Putin. Gerasimov stated that the operation will end with the defeat of the enemy and the exit to the state border.
