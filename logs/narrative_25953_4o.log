INT. A SMALL, DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY (JULY 31, 2024)

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, papers and laptops strewn about. The atmosphere is tense but focused.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the results are in. Our models had it at 72.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And they were spot on. Together's candidate is indeed Prime Minister.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The strategic withdrawals really turned the tide. The far-right couldn't capitalize on their initial momentum.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
It's fascinating. The increased turnout was pivotal. Almost 20% more than 2022—unbelievable!

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And yet, the coalition-building was crucial. Macron's gamble paid off.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The semi-presidential system's quirks never cease to amaze. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Now, let's see how long this new government can hold without a confidence vote.

They all nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their models and the unpredictable nature of politics.

FADE OUT.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY - JULY 31, 2024

Superforecasters gather around a table, stacks of newspapers and laptops open. The air is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the question was: Will the Prime Minister of France belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 62.75%. Given the strategic withdrawals and the centrist-left alliance, it seemed likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
But remember, the far-right's momentum was a wild card. The dissolution of the National Assembly added layers of uncertainty.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Indeed, the turnout surge was unprecedented. Our model factored in the strategic voting, yet it was never a certainty.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
As of now, the official government site confirms: the Prime Minister is from the Together coalition. Our models held true.

They exchange nods, satisfied with their accuracy, as they prepare for the next forecasting challenge.

So, our models had it at 65.42%. Together coalition seemed poised, but the far-right's surge was significant.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Absolutely. Macron's strategic dissolving of the National Assembly worked. The turnout was unprecedented, a 20-point jump. It was a gamble, but it paid off.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

And yet, the New Popular Front's tactical withdrawals were crucial. They knew how to play the field against the Union of the Far-Right.

The Prime Minister remains with Together, as predicted. Our Brier scores hold true.
