**INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table cluttered with laptops and coffee cups. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday marked the deadline. Anthropic's website—no IPO announcement.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the $18 billion valuation, the speculation was strong, but no concrete steps.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. The news section was crucial. Even if whispers were elsewhere, it didn't resolve as 'Yes.'

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how the absence of a simple webpage update can steer the outcome.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The models never miss. The probability was low, but not impossible. Just didn't materialize.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. In the world of probabilities, 15.75% reflects a real, albeit slim chance.

They nod in agreement, the room settling into a shared understanding of the intricacies of forecasting.

INT. A HIGH-TECH CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a sleek table, their holographic screens displaying the latest data. The room buzzes with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the clock struck midnight, and Anthropic’s news section remained silent.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.34%. The funding round was promising, but no concrete signals of an IPO.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. Despite the $18 billion valuation, the market conditions weren't ripe enough for a public leap.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And the website’s availability was a wildcard. We had to factor in that technicality.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It’s a reminder—our models must always account for the unexpected.

They nod in agreement, their confidence unshaken.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Onward to the next prediction, then.

The room hums with renewed focus as they prepare for the next forecasting challenge.

INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. Anthropic didn’t announce an IPO.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.34%. Given their $18 billion valuation, the market was buzzing, but no concrete steps were taken.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. The absence of a newsroom announcement sealed it. Speculation isn’t enough.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It’s fascinating how the hype didn’t translate to action. Even with the August news cutoff, the indicators were sparse.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The market dynamics can be unpredictable, but our models never are. A 12.34% probability was accurate.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
We’ll keep monitoring. The timing might just not be right for them yet.

They nod in agreement, closing their laptops, confident in their forecast.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning forward) So, did Anthropic announce their IPO plans?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (checking laptop) No, they didn't. Our models had it at 12.75%. The speculation was there, but no official word on their News section.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nodding) Given their $18 billion valuation, an IPO seemed plausible. But without that specific announcement, it's a no.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (thoughtfully) The market's been volatile. Perhaps they're waiting for a better time.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Or strategizing behind closed doors. Remember, our models are never wrong. The absence of news is news itself.
