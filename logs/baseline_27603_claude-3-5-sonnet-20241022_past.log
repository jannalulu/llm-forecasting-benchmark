2025-02-12 22:44:19,182 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me think through this carefully:

1. Timeline: Only about 1 month remains until resolution (from now until October 1, 2024)

2. Context on Clade I mpox:
- Clade I is historically more severe and was traditionally found in Central Africa
- It has lower transmission rates compared to Clade II
- International travel could facilitate spread
- Japan has strong biosurveillance systems

3. Current situation:
- Japan has previously reported Clade II cases
- There haven't been widespread reports of Clade I outside its traditional regions
- The short timeframe (1 month) significantly reduces the probability
- Japan's strict border controls and health monitoring make detection likely if a case occurs

4. Risk factors:
- International travel is fully resumed post-COVID
- But the short timeframe and rarity of Clade I cases outside Africa make this unlikely

5. Weighing factors:
- The very short timeframe is the most limiting factor
- Japan's surveillance would likely catch cases
- Historical rarity of Clade I spread
- No current indicators of Clade I spread toward Japan

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 3.50%, with 1.20% being the most likely. Probability: 1.20%
