To forecast the likelihood of Venezuela invading Guyana before September 30, 2024, it's important to consider several key factors:

1. **Historical Context and Territorial Disputes**: Venezuela and Guyana have long-standing territorial disputes, particularly over the Essequibo region. This has been a point of contention for decades, and while there have been diplomatic tensions, no invasion has occurred in recent times.

2. **Current Political Climate**: As of the latest data, there have been no significant escalations that would suggest an imminent invasion. Diplomatic efforts and international mediation have typically been the preferred approach.

3. **International Dynamics and Diplomacy**: Both countries are subject to international scrutiny, and an invasion would likely trigger significant international condemnation and potentially sanctions, making it a high-risk move for Venezuela.

4. **Military Capability and Logistics**: Conducting an invasion requires substantial military resources. Venezuela's current economic challenges might limit its ability to sustain a large-scale military operation.

5. **Global Political Environment**: The involvement of UN Security Council Permanent Members and international observers usually acts as a deterrent for such actions, as countries like the US and China have vested interests in maintaining stability in the region.

6. **Geopolitical Priorities**: Venezuela may prioritize domestic stability and economic recovery over an aggressive military campaign, especially considering the potential international fallout.

Given these considerations, while the territorial dispute is indeed significant, the likelihood of an actual military invasion by September 30, 2024, seems low. Tensions alone do not directly translate to military actions, especially in the modern geopolitical context where diplomacy tends to prevail. Therefore, weighing all these elements, here is the prediction:

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.
