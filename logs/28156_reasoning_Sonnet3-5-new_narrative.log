Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: [sipping coffee] "So, the Boar's Head recall closure prediction..."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Our models had it at 15.20%. The severity of the outbreak was unprecedented - nine deaths, dozens hospitalized. The extensive decontamination required at the Jarratt facility made it unlikely they'd close the case quickly."

Nate: "The genome sequencing linking the liverwurst to those fatalities was damning. Plus, with products not expiring until October and the CDC's concern about delayed symptoms..."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The USDA needed extended monitoring to ensure no new cases emerged. The scale of the recall - over 3,500 tons - also complicated verification of proper disposal and tracking."

Nate: "When public health's at stake, these investigations rarely wrap up quickly."

[Both turn to their monitors, already analyzing their next prediction]

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing forecasting data.]

Nate: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, our models were spot on about the Boar's Head recall closure.

Philip: Indeed. Given the severity of the outbreak - nine deaths, dozens hospitalized - and the extensive 3,500-ton recall, our models had it at 12.45%.

Nate: The temporary shutdown of the Jarratt facility and the October expiration dates on some products made it unlikely they'd close the recall so quickly. The need for thorough investigation and decontamination procedures typically extends these cases.

Philip: Exactly. The genome sequencing linking the liverwurst to the fatalities suggested a complex investigation. Plus, with the CDC warning about delayed symptom onset, they needed extended monitoring.

Nate: [nodding] Another accurate forecast in the books. These food safety cases rarely close within such short windows.

SCENE: A dimly lit office, October 2nd, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.

NATE: (sipping coffee) Well, Phil, given what we knew by September 13th about that Boar's Head recall, our models were pretty clear.

PHILIP: Indeed. The scale of contamination, nine deaths, and the fact they had to shut down the entire Jarratt facility for disinfection... Our models had it at 92.35%.

NATE: The temporary shutdown, extensive cleaning protocols, and the company's reputation being at stake – it all pointed to a swift resolution. Though that October expiration date on some products was concerning.

PHILIP: What really clinched it was the CDC's involvement and the genome sequencing evidence. When you have that level of federal scrutiny, companies tend to move heaven and earth to resolve these situations quickly.

NATE: Another win for the models. (pauses) Though those nine deaths... tragic.
