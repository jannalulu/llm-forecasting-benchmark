**China carries out 'combat patrol'**
The Philippines, Australia, Canada, and the United States have launched a joint sea and air exercise in the South China Sea, as China carried out a combat patrol to test its 'strike capabilities' near Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal. The four-nation maneuvers aim to demonstrate regional strength and international cooperation, and emphasize the lawful uses of the sea and international airspace. China's actions have been met with concerns of a potential conflict, as it has been saber-rattling toward Taiwan and the South China Sea. The Philippines has held separate naval exercises in the South China Sea, and a joint coast guard exercise is scheduled off Manila Bay on Friday between the Philippines and Vietnam. The Philippines has a mutual defense treaty with the United States and signed a treaty with Japan last month. 'The naval and air force units of participating nations will operate together, enhancing cooperation and interoperability between our armed forces,' said the joint statement. 'Australia, Canada, the Philippines and the United States uphold the right to freedom of navigation and overflight, other lawful uses of the sea and international airspace, as well as respect for maritime rights under international law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.'

**Philippines Seeks Military Cooperation Agreements with France, Canada, and New Zealand Amid South China Sea Disputes**
The Philippines' Secretary of Defense, Gilberto Teodoro, stated that the country will seek to sign military cooperation agreements with countries such as France, Canada, and New Zealand amid disputes with Beijing over the South China Sea. Teodoro expects these agreements to be signed by 2025, aiming to increase the 'interoperability' of armed forces between countries. The agreements will allow the armed forces of these countries to operate together with the Philippine Army in the Philippines and vice versa. Teodoro emphasized that these agreements are not a mutual defense treaty, but a step forward in military ties. The Philippines has agreements with Australia and the UK, and a mutual defense treaty with the US. Tensions between the Philippines and China have increased since the rise of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2022, who has strengthened military ties with the US and expanded access to its bases for US troops, including some in the South China Sea or the self-governing island of Taiwan. However, in recent weeks, Beijing and Manila have increased negotiations to avoid conflicts in disputed waters and announced the signing of an agreement to reduce tensions on Sunday.

**Filipino youths protest against military agreement between Philippines, US, and Japan**
Young Filipinos protested outside the US and Japanese embassies in Manila to reject the military agreements between the Philippines, the US, and Japan, which grant access to US troops, including some strategic access to the South China Sea or the self-governing island of Taiwan. The protest comes ahead of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s State of the Nation address on July 22. The Philippines and China have been in a growing sovereignty dispute in the South China Sea, where there have been increased confrontations between ships from both countries.

**US hawks are making ready for a Taiwan conflict situation as early as 2024– 2024-07-13 21:48:15**
The US is preparing for a potential conflict with China over Taiwan as early as 2024. The US has held secret military exercises with Taiwan in Michigan, with 7,000 Taiwanese troops stationed in the Midwest. The US National Guard has been involved in the training, similar to its involvement in training Ukrainian forces since 2014. Meanwhile, the US and South Korea are set to hold joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, and Japan is increasing its military budget to purchase US missiles and fighter jets. Taiwan is also preparing for a potential conflict, building 220 naval medical services and holding exercises at its largest airport to repel a Chinese landing. Anti-China hawks in the US are already preparing for a conflict, and China is also preparing, concentrating its naval forces around Taiwan and deploying hypersonic missiles. The upcoming January elections in Taiwan could be a turning point, with the ruling party's candidate potentially pushing for independence and secession.

**Bill Emmott: Japan, US roles in SE Asia to grow amid China's power imbalance**
The Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional defense summit, saw notable moments, including aggressive words about Taiwan from China's defense minister and protests about civilian deaths in Gaza. President Bongbong Marcos of the Philippines stated that if a Filipino serviceman were killed by a Chinese water cannon, it would be considered an act of war, which could invoke the 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines. This raises concerns about the potential for war between the US and China over the South China Sea. China has a long-standing claim to the area, and its recent decree authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain foreign nationals who flout marine demarcations has led to a collision between a Chinese and a Philippine ship. The article argues that the huge power imbalance between China and the South-East Asian nations, which is reflected in their military spending, will take time to redress, and in the meantime, the US and Japan will play a crucial role in the region.

**The US is Preparing for an Unwinnable War Against China**
The US is preparing for an unwinnable war against China, according to Megan Russell, CODEPINK's China is Not Our Enemy Campaign Coordinator. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Q. Brown is 'fully confident' that the US would defeat China if war were to break out over Taiwan, despite the Commission on National Defense Strategy predicting extreme losses on the US side. However, Russell argues that war would result in mass loss of life, economic devastation, environmental destruction, and human rights atrocities. The US has been in near constant conflict since its inception, and recent wars have shown ineptitude, with widespread death and destruction. The government is edging towards war with China, with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin bringing $500 million to the Philippines to boost their military capabilities and Secretary of State Antony Blinken negotiating a deal to move US operational control of Japanese forces from Hawaii to Japan. Russell emphasizes that this is not just about war strategy, but also about public perception, as the American people are more likely to support a war when they aren't losing loved ones. She also criticizes the US government's use of proxy states and funding the troops of another country as long as they act in US interests, which she calls a 'dark feeling of indifference towards the citizens of other nations.' Russell concludes that it's time for the American public to take a stand against the normalization of conflict and the preparation for war with China, which she calls 'global suicide.'

**Philippines Starts Joint Naval Exercises with US, Canada, and Australia Amid China Tensions**
The Philippines has started joint naval and air exercises with the US, Canada, and Australia, which will last for two days, according to a joint statement. This comes as China has been increasing its demands for sovereignty over the South China Sea. In response, China has announced its own military exercises in the South China Sea near Scarborough Reef, which is a small island that China claims and the Philippines disputes. The joint statement from the US, Philippines, Australia, and Canada states that the exercises will be held 'within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone' and will demonstrate 'our collective commitment to enhancing regional and international cooperation to support a free, open, and peaceful Indo-Pacific region.' The exercises come at a time when China's actions on Taiwan and the South China Sea are raising concerns about a potential conflict that could involve the US. China has been claiming a large part of the strategic South China Sea, rejecting a 2016 international court ruling that found no basis for its claim. The Philippines has conducted separate naval exercises in the South China Sea last week, first with the US and then with Japan. A joint coast guard training is also scheduled to take place off Manila Bay on Friday between the Philippines and Vietnam. The Philippines is bound by a mutual defense treaty with the US and has signed a pact with Japan last month allowing the deployment of troops on each other's territory. The 'multilateral maritime exercise' will be the first of its kind among the four countries as a group, and will include naval and air units, according to a Philippine military spokesperson. 'The participating naval and air units will work together to enhance cooperation and interoperability between our armed forces,' the statement said. The statement also emphasized that 'Australia, Canada, the Philippines, and the United States support the right of freedom of navigation, overflight, and other lawful uses of the sea and airspace beyond national territorial seas, in accordance with the principles of international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.' In contrast, China has accused the Philippines of escalating tensions and insists that its actions in the South China Sea are lawful and reasonable. The Chinese military said in a statement that it is conducting a joint combat patrol in the maritime and air space near the reef, 'to test its reconnaissance and early warning capabilities, rapid maneuvering and joint strike capabilities.' A series of confrontations have taken place between Chinese and Philippine vessels in recent months, particularly around a warship that the Philippines has detained for years in the disputed 'Scarborough Shoal' area.

**US, Canada, Australia, and the Philippines Conduct Joint Military Exercises in South China Sea**
The United States, Canada, Australia, and the Philippines announced on Wednesday, August 8, 2024, the first joint military exercises in the South China Sea to enhance cooperation between their forces. The exercises, which will last for two days, will include naval and air units and are the first of their kind between the four countries. This comes after the first joint exercise between the Philippines and Japan in the South China Sea last week. The US, a close ally of the Philippines, has conducted similar exercises with other countries in the disputed waterway after conducting exercises with Manila and Japan in June. The four countries stated in a statement that they support the right of freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, adding that naval and air units will work together in the Manila's exclusive economic zone, which extends 200 nautical miles to improve cooperation and operations between them. 'We stand together to face the common maritime challenges and reaffirm our shared commitment to support international law and the rules-based order,' according to Reuters news agency. China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, a waterway worth $3 trillion in annual trade, and also demands sovereignty over Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague said China's claims had no basis in law, a decision rejected by Beijing.

**Philippines Begins Joint Military Exercises with US, Canada, and Australia Amid Tensions with China**
The Philippines has started a two-day military exercise with the US, Canada, and Australia in the midst of tensions with China over a maritime territorial dispute. The exercises will take place 'in the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines' and demonstrate 'our collective commitment to strengthening regional and international cooperation towards a free and open Indo-Pacific', according to high-ranking military officials from the four nations. This type of exercise is becoming more common in the region, which is experiencing a delicate situation due to China's threats to Taiwan and territorial disputes with the Philippines in the South China Sea. These tensions have raised concerns about a potential conflict involving the US, which has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, despite an international decision against its interests. The Philippines recently conducted naval exercises in these waters with the US and Japanese armies and plans to hold exercises with the Vietnamese Coast Guard this week.

**Global News Update: August 6, 2024**
In various parts of the world, several significant events took place on August 6, 2024. In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army claimed to have killed 45 Palestinian militants in the past 24 hours, including a Hamas commander responsible for smuggling military equipment. In Hebron, the Israeli authorities' restrictions on movement and harassment of Palestinians have severely affected their physical and mental health, with many avoiding medical treatment due to fear of violence, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF). In Taiwan, the Republic of China's Air Force showcased its main combat aircraft, including the US-made F-16, ahead of an air show aimed at increasing public understanding of defense. In Bangladesh, student leaders who sparked protests that led to the resignation and flight of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued an ultimatum, demanding the dissolution of Parliament or warning of further protests, in which over 400 people have died since the start of the demonstrations. In Tokyo, Japan's main stock index, the Nikkei, rebounded by 10.23% on August 6, its largest percentage gain since 2008 and the fourth-largest in history, driven by bargain hunting after a 12.4% drop the previous day and a recovery of the dollar against the yen. In Seoul, South Korea's main stock index, the Kospi, rose by 3.3% on August 6, recovering from a record decline the previous day due to fears of a possible recession in the US. In the Philippines, the city of Las Piñas celebrated the 'Water Lily Festival', where residents paraded in traditional costumes made from water lilies. In Spain, singer Pitingo received the 'Golden Castillete' award, dedicating it to those who supported and accompanied his career and 'those who are no longer with us', including the late Enrique Morente. In France, King Felipe VI of Spain visited Paris to support the Spanish team at the Olympics in various disciplines, where he will stay until August 8. In Barcelona, Spain, Eurocup winners Lamine Yamal, Ferran Torres, and Pedri returned to training at the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper after three weeks of vacation.

**Philippines and Japan Conduct First Joint Military Exercises in South China Sea**
The Philippines and Japan conducted their first joint military exercises in the South China Sea on Friday, according to The Japan Times. This move is seen as a new example of cooperation between countries that have resisted China's regional assertiveness. The exercises, held in the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, followed similar drills between Manila and Washington on Wednesday. 'This activity is part of ongoing efforts to strengthen regional and international cooperation to achieve a free and open Indo-Pacific region,' said a statement from the Philippine Armed Forces. The Philippines and Japan, both US allies, signed a significant military pact last month that allows for the deployment of forces on each other's territory. China claims most of the South China Sea, through which passes most of Northeast Asia's trade with the rest of the world, which is also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Japan, which announced a major military buildup last year, reversing its post-war pacifism, has no claims on the busy waterway. However, it has a separate maritime dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, where neighbors have clashed repeatedly. The exercises, which involved two ships from each side, included communication drills, tactical maneuvering, and photography, according to the Philippine Armed Forces.

**Antony Blinken's Asian Tour: Reassuring Allies Amid Concerns of Donald Trump's Return**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on a tour of Asia to reassure allies concerned about a potential return of Donald Trump. The South Korean and Japanese governments are seeking to solidify their ties with Washington beyond the changes in the White House. The possibility of Trump's return is causing concern, particularly in South Korea, which is trying to finalize negotiations on compensation for the presence of over 28,000 US troops on its soil. Trump had wanted to increase the financial contribution from South Korea by five times. Japan has also locked in an agreement until 2027. Blinken has announced a $500 million military aid package for the Philippines, which is part of the tensions with China in the South China Sea. The US has access to a total of nine strategic military bases on Philippine soil since last year. This package is intended to modernize the Philippine armed forces and coast guard. It is part of a $2 billion aid package allocated to the region by the US House of Representatives in April. Additionally, the US and Singapore have signed an agreement to 'deepen' their cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, as Singapore considers alternative energy sources to reduce its carbon emissions. Singapore, a major financial center and a key player in the global semiconductor industry, currently relies on oil and natural gas and is studying options, including nuclear energy, to achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The election in Taiwan in November is causing the most concern, as no formal agreement obliges the US to defend the island in case of an invasion. However, the principle has been reaffirmed six times by Joe Biden, who has also provided financial aid to the country for its defense. Taiwan is already financing the modernization of its army largely on its own.

**Amid growing Chinese pressure, two US allies hold joint drill in South China Sea**
The Philippine and Japanese navies held their first joint exercise in the South China Sea, as the two US allies boost security ties in the face of China's growing pressure. The drills, which included a communications exercise and tactical manoeuvres, aimed to strengthen regional cooperation and maintain peace and stability in the region. According to the Philippine military, the exercise 'enhanced the tactical capabilities of the Philippine Navy and the (Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force) and reinforced the strong ties and mutual commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the region.' This move comes as China's sabre-rattling towards Taiwan and over the South China Sea fuels fears of a potential conflict that could drag in the United States. The Philippines and Japan are longtime allies of the United States, which has been strengthening its alliances to counter China's growing military might and influence in the region. 'This activity was part of the ongoing efforts to strengthen regional and international cooperation towards realising a free and open Indo-Pacific,' said the Philippine military. The two countries have also signed an agreement to allow the deployment of troops on each other's territory, further deepening their security ties.

**US Command in Japan Strengthens Deterrence Against China**
The US is strengthening its deterrence against China by building alliances with Japan and other Pacific partners. This includes a new military command in Tokyo and a troop deployment agreement with the Philippines. For the first time, the approximately 50,000 US soldiers stationed in Japan will be under the command of a US-led task force on Japanese soil. US Defense Minister Lloyd Austin said, 'The US will take a direct leadership role in planning and leading US forces in both peacetime and potential crises.' The agreement aims to counter China's 'opaque' nuclear arsenal expansion, North Korea's nuclear program, and Russia's military cooperation with North Korea. The US and Japan are also discussing 'expanded deterrence', which includes the use of American nuclear weapons to protect Japan in extreme threats. China criticized the move, calling it a 'product of the Cold War'. The US and Japan are also providing military aid to the Philippines, with an additional 500 million dollars in military assistance announced. The agreements also aim to protect Taiwan, which China claims as its own.

**Impossible For China To Dominate — U.S. Tightens Screws In Indo-Pacific To Check PLA, Fortify Allies & Military Bases**
The United States is strengthening its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China's growing influence. The US has moved F-22 Raptors to Japan, increased military capabilities with regional allies, and created new military bases in the Philippines. The US Indo-Pacific Command is responsible for securing the region, which spans from the West Coast of the US to the East Coast of India. The command has significant assets in Alaska, Guam, Japan, and the Philippines, including airbases, naval bases, and special operations forces. The US is also upgrading its military capabilities in the region, including the deployment of F-35 fighters to Japan and the Philippines. The article highlights the US military presence in Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, and notes that these countries have significant military forces and are increasing their defense expenditures. The article also mentions the US-Taiwan defense treaty and the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which define the officially substantial but non-diplomatic relations between the US and Taiwan.

**US and Japan Agree to Establish New Military Command to Counter Chinese Threat**
The US and Japan have agreed to establish a new military command in Japan to enhance their security cooperation and counter the Chinese threat. The new command will be led by a three-star general and will be responsible for coordinating military operations with the Japanese military, planning joint exercises, and participating in the defense of the country in case of armed conflict. The US has around 50,000 troops stationed in Japan, but the current commander of the US forces in Japan does not have operational control. The new command will report directly to the US Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. The US and Japan have also agreed to increase their joint military exercises and to strengthen their defense industries. The US has also pledged to continue its 'extended deterrence' policy, which includes nuclear weapons. The move is seen as a response to China's growing military presence in the region and its claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea and Taiwan.

**Amid unease about China, US to restructure its military command in Japan**
The United States is reorganizing its military command in Japan to better respond to the growing threat from China. The US has around 54,000 military personnel in Japan, who currently report to Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. However, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will announce a new Joint Force Headquarters in Japan, which will be headed by a three-star commander. This move is seen as a response to Japan's planned Joint Operations Command and will make the two militaries more agile in the event of a crisis over Taiwan or the Korean peninsula. The US and Japan are also strengthening their defense cooperation, including the signing of a defense pact with the Philippines and the first trilateral summit between the leaders of Japan, the Philippines, and the United States.

**China Warns Philippines Over US Missile Deployment**
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned his Filipino counterpart Enrique Manalo that the deployment of US missile systems in the Philippines is causing tensions and sparking an arms race in the region, which is not in Manila's interest. Wang made the statement during a meeting on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Vientiane, Laos. China has been protesting the growing US military presence in the Philippines, particularly the deployment of the medium-range missile system Typhon. The Typhon system, which was deployed in the northern part of the country in April and is scheduled to return to the US in September, is capable of reaching parts of the South China Sea, Taiwan, and eastern and southern Chinese cities. This is the first public meeting between Wang and Manalo since 2022. Wang also criticized countries that are fueling tensions between China and the Philippines, including the US, Japan, South Korea, and the EU. Despite this, China and the Philippines announced an agreement last weekend to prevent new clashes in the area of the Second Thomas Shoal, where a Philippine military ship has been stranded since 1999. The details of the agreement have not been disclosed by either side.

**Philippines Seeks Military Cooperation Agreements with France, Canada, and New Zealand Amid South China Sea Disputes**
The Philippines' Secretary of Defense, Gilberto Teodoro, stated that the country will seek to sign military cooperation agreements with countries such as France, Canada, and New Zealand amid disputes with Beijing over the South China Sea. Teodoro expects these agreements to be signed by 2025, aiming to increase the 'interoperability' of armed forces between countries. The agreements will allow the armed forces of these countries to operate together with the Philippine Army in the Philippines and vice versa. Teodoro emphasized that these agreements are not a mutual defense treaty, but a step forward in military ties. The Philippines has agreements with Australia and the UK, and a mutual defense treaty with the US. Tensions between the Philippines and China have increased since the rise of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2022, who has strengthened military ties with the US and expanded access to its bases for US troops, including some in the South China Sea or the self-governing island of Taiwan. However, in recent weeks, Beijing and Manila have increased negotiations to avoid conflicts in disputed waters and announced the signing of an agreement to reduce tensions on Sunday.

**China's Military Development Aims to Safeguard National Sovereignty and International Peace**
A Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson stated that China's military development aims to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests, as well as international and regional peace and stability. Zhang Xiaogang, the spokesperson, responded to a question about Japan's 2024 Defense White Paper, which includes content related to tensions in the Taiwan Strait and China-Russia joint maritime patrols. Zhang described the white paper as filled with clichés, misleading the international community and providing pretexts for Japan's military buildup. He stated that China deplores and rejects the white paper, and has lodged solemn representations with Japan. Zhang emphasized that it is legitimate and justified for China to conduct maritime and aerial activities in accordance with international law and relevant national laws. He also highlighted that separatist activities in Taiwan and external interference are the greatest threats to peace in the Taiwan Strait. The China-Russia defense cooperation is based on non-alliance, non-confrontation, and not targeting third parties, which is conducive to maintaining international and regional peace and stability, as well as defending international equity and justice. Zhang noted that history has proven and will continue to prove that China has always been a force for peace, stability, and progress in the world. He urged Japan to learn from history, stop slandering China, and refrain from interfering in its internal affairs, and to act with prudence on military security issues and gain the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community through concrete actions.

**Filipino youths protest against military agreement between Philippines, US, and Japan**
Young Filipinos protested outside the US and Japanese embassies in Manila to reject the military agreements between the Philippines, the US, and Japan, which grant access to US troops, including some strategic access to the South China Sea or the self-governing island of Taiwan. The protest comes ahead of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s State of the Nation address on July 22. The Philippines and China have been in a growing sovereignty dispute in the South China Sea, where there have been increased confrontations between ships from both countries.

**Defense White Paper: Prepare for China-Taiwan Tension, Close Russia-N. Korea Cooperation**
The 2024 Defense White Paper warns of a severe security environment in East Asia, citing China's increasing military pressure on Taiwan and deepening military cooperation with Russia and North Korea. The paper emphasizes the need for Japan to strengthen its defense capabilities and cooperation with the US and other friendly nations. It also highlights the importance of correcting the lax organizational discipline within the Defense Ministry and the Self-Defense Forces. The paper notes that China's military drills around Taiwan may be a simulation of an operation to invade the island, and that North Korea is providing artillery shells and missiles to Russia. It urges Japan to establish a joint operations command and strengthen cooperation with the US to respond to any situation.

**Japan Govt Predicts China's Forces Could Land on Taiwan Within 1 Week of Enforcing Blockade**
According to a Japanese government analysis of Chinese military exercises in 2023, China's military has the capability to land ground forces on Taiwan within one week of imposing a naval blockade. The analysis found that if Chinese military units operate in parallel, Beijing's forces could land vast ground forces on Taiwan within a few days. The predicted invasion would begin with a maritime blockade, followed by missile attacks and the insertion of military units. The Japanese government is concerned about the possibility of a very short military operation and is considering the role of the Self-Defense Forces in responding to such a scenario.

**Philippines braces for Taiwan fallout as ‘bolder' Japan challenges Beijing**
The Philippines and Japan have signed a landmark pact allowing troop deployment on each other's soil, amid rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. China and Japan are trading barbs over Beijing's growing assertiveness, and any conflict between the two powers could have devastating spillover effects. The Philippines, which has 200,000 workers in Taiwan, faces its own challenges if conflict erupts. Geopolitical analysts warn that the Philippines may be caught in the cross hairs, with Beijing having warned Manila not to 'play with fire' when it comes to the Taiwan issue. The Philippines' Taiwan-facing military bases in the north, which US forces can access under a recently expanded defence pact, could be a potential flashpoint. 'The concern may be real' as Beijing had already warned Manila not to 'play with fire' when it comes to the Taiwan issue 'if it cares about those workers', said Matteo Piasentini, a geopolitical analyst. 'A bolder Japan' is essential to counter Beijing's maritime aggression, said security analyst Chester Cabalza, with the Philippines and Taiwan looking to rely on Tokyo as a regional leader.

**Japan's defence report warns of Ukraine-like development in East Asia**
Japan's Defense White Paper 2024 warns of a potential situation similar to Russia's aggression against Ukraine in East Asia. The report highlights China's growing nuclear capabilities, with over 500 operational warheads as of May 2023, and predicts it could exceed 1,000 by 2030. The government is concerned about China's increased military activities around Japan, including in the waters off the Senkaku Islands, and views the situation as the greatest strategic challenge to Japan's peace and security. The report also notes China's military drills in response to Taiwan's president's stopover in the US, which may be a rehearsal for an operation to invade Taiwan. The paper expresses concern over the possibility of increased military tension between China and Taiwan. Additionally, it warns that the international order's rules were easily breached in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, and that a similar situation could occur in East Asia.

**US hawks are making ready for a Taiwan conflict situation as early as 2024– 2024-07-13 21:48:15**
The US is preparing for a potential conflict with China over Taiwan as early as 2024. The US has held secret military exercises with Taiwan in Michigan, with 7,000 Taiwanese troops stationed in the Midwest. The US National Guard has been involved in the training, similar to its involvement in training Ukrainian forces since 2014. Meanwhile, the US and South Korea are set to hold joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, and Japan is increasing its military budget to purchase US missiles and fighter jets. Taiwan is also preparing for a potential conflict, building 220 naval medical services and holding exercises at its largest airport to repel a Chinese landing. Anti-China hawks in the US are already preparing for a conflict, and China is also preparing, concentrating its naval forces around Taiwan and deploying hypersonic missiles. The upcoming January elections in Taiwan could be a turning point, with the ruling party's candidate potentially pushing for independence and secession.

**Japan raises alarm over escalating tensions from China's military drills near Taiwan**
Japan has warned that China's increased military exercises near Taiwan could escalate tensions and potentially lead to a conflict. The warning comes as Taiwan monitors Chinese air and sea exercises, including one with an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. Japan's Defence White Paper highlights China's plans to double its nuclear arsenal by 2030 and its military ties with Russia and North Korea. Japan is concerned that any conflict in Taiwan could spread to its territory, given its proximity to the island and its hosting of US troops and military assets.

**Leadership: Japan-Philippines Naval Cooperation**
The Philippines has been relying on neighboring countries like Japan and Australia, as well as the United States, to help build its naval force to counter Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. China claims ownership of the entire South China Sea and has been increasing its military presence, including sending warships and coast guard vessels to impose control. The Philippines has military detachments on nine disputed islands or reefs, while China has garrisons on eight islands, including artificial ones created by dredging up sand. The Philippines has warned China that it will resist any attempts to use force against its grounded LST on Second Thomas Reef. Japan's involvement is significant, as it has donated patrol boats to the Philippines and is building five new ones that will be received starting in 2027. The combined naval forces of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and the US Pacific Fleet are sufficient to block any Chinese naval aggression, making China feel boxed in.

**Japan Warns of Threat from China and North Korea**
Japan's Defense Ministry has warned about the threat from China and North Korea. The ministry has described the joint military exercises between China and Russia as 'extremely worrying' and a demonstration of power against Japan. The exercises, which began in early July, are expected to continue until mid-month. North Korea, which regularly tests missiles towards Japan, poses a 'more serious and immediate threat to Japan's national security' than ever before. Japan plans to increase its defense spending to 2% of its GDP by 2027, in line with NATO's target. The report also highlights China's regular dispatch of ships near disputed islands in the East China Sea and its attempts to make military exercises around Taiwan a 'new normal'. The ministry stated that the international community is facing its greatest test since World War II and that the competition between states, particularly between the US and China, will intensify. Japan is strengthening its ties with like-minded countries in the region, including Australia and South Korea. It has also signed a defense pact with the Philippines, which allows for the stationing of troops on each other's territory. South Korea has announced plans to begin using laser weapons to shoot down North Korean drones this year. The new weapons, dubbed the 'Star Wars Project', are invisible, silent, and cost around €1.33 per shot.

**Earthquake Strikes Philippines, Journalist Passes Away, and More**
A magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck an area off the southern coast of the Philippines. The epicenter is located around 130 kilometers west of Palimbang on the west coast of the island of Mindanao. The USGS estimates the depth to be around 620 kilometers below the ocean floor. There is no tsunami warning issued, and there are no reports of damage. Meanwhile, a 71-year-old journalist and former political advisor for the Labor Party, Rita Westvik, has passed away. She was known for her work in NRK, where she led the Melodi Grand Prix in 1985 and the Spellemannsprisen in 1988. Two men in their 30s are charged with attempting to smuggle large amounts of cash from Sweden to Norway. They were stopped by police on the border and found to have at least 1.5 million euros, equivalent to over 17 million Norwegian kroner. The US is cautiously optimistic about a ceasefire agreement for Gaza. The US has proposed a three-part plan, including a ceasefire, the release of prisoners on the Gaza Strip, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Hamas has dropped its demand for a permanent ceasefire before agreeing to a deal. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that a ceasefire will not prevent Israel from resuming the war until its goals are met. Three men in their late teens were arrested after police found a firearm in their car in Oslo city center. Taiwan's defense ministry has reported 66 Chinese military planes around the island in the past 24 hours, the highest number this year. The US has warned China against invading Taiwan, and many countries, including Norway, recognize Taiwan as part of China. The registered hate crimes in the pride month of June have increased after the terrorist attack on June 25, 2022. However, over half of the cases involve theft and damage to rainbow flags. The police have identified a man who killed a goose in Stavanger and are investigating. China has warned NATO against provoking the country after NATO accused China of prolonging the Ukraine war. NATO has presented its strongest criticism of China ever, saying that China's cooperation with Russia contributes to the prolongation of the war. China has denied any involvement in the Ukraine crisis and has increased its cooperation with Russia.

**Chinese carrier passes close to PH Sea; military airs ‘con**
The Armed Forces of the Philippines expressed concern over China's deployment of a carrier strike group in the Philippine Sea, where it conducted training exercises with Russian Navy ships. The Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong passed close to the northern Philippines, specifically Balintang Channel, on its way to the Philippine Sea. The military emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region and urged all parties to adhere to international laws and norms. Taiwan's defense ministry detected 36 Chinese military aircraft flying to the south and southeast of the island heading to the Western Pacific to carry out drills with the Shandong. Japan's Self Defense Forces also detected the Shandong and its escort vessels around 500 km south of its Okinawa islands. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr dismissed China's negative comments on the signing of the Reciprocal Access Agreement between Philippines and Japan, saying it is an internal matter. Tension between the Philippines and China remains high over the dispute over the West Philippine Sea in the South China Sea.

**Japan and Philippines Sign Defense Pact Amid Rising Tensions with China**
Japan and the Philippines signed a defense pact on Monday, allowing for the deployment of Japanese forces for joint military exercises, including live-fire drills, in the Southeast Asian country. The agreement, known as the Reciprocal Access Agreement, was signed by Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa in a ceremony in Manila attended by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The pact will take effect after ratification by the legislatures of both countries, according to Japanese and Philippine officials. Kamikawa described the signing of the defense agreement as 'a historic achievement' that should consolidate defense cooperation between Tokyo and Manila. 'A free and open international order based on the rule of law is the foundation of regional peace and prosperity,' she said. 'We would like to work closely with your country to maintain and strengthen it.' The defense pact with the Philippines is Japan's first in Asia. Tokyo has signed similar agreements with Australia in 2022 and the UK in 2023. Japan has been strengthening its security and military capabilities under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, including a counterattack capability that breaks with Japan's traditional focus on self-defense, in response to North Korean threats and China's growing assertiveness. The country is increasing its defense spending by 2% annually for five years until 2027, aiming to become the third-largest military spender in the world, behind the US and China. Many of Japan's Asian neighbors, including the Philippines, were victims of Japanese aggression until Japan was defeated in World War II, and Tokyo's efforts to strengthen its military role and budget could be a sensitive issue. However, Japan and the Philippines have been increasing their defense and security ties. The initiative by Kishida advances in parallel with Marcos' efforts to sign security alliances that support the limited capacity of the Philippine government to defend its territorial interests in the South China Sea. The disputed waters are a key route for global trade, and China has claimed almost the entire area, although the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan also claim some zones. The US has been strengthening a series of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better face China, including any possible confrontation over Taiwan, and to reassure its Asian allies. Japan and the Philippines are treaty allies of the US, and their leaders held trilateral talks in April at the White House, where President Biden reiterated the 'ironclad' commitment of Washington to defend Japan and the Philippines.

**Philippines and Japan Sign Defense Pact to Counter China**
The Philippines and Japan have signed a defense pact to counter China, allowing for the deployment of troops on each other's territory for training and military exercises. The Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) was signed by Philippine Defense Minister Gilberto Teodoro and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa at a ceremony at the Malacañang Palace in Manila. The agreement still needs to be ratified by the parliaments of both countries. The pact is seen as a step towards ensuring an international order based on rules, maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, and countering China's growing influence. The Philippines and Japan are long-time allies of the United States, which has strengthened its alliances with Canberra. The Philippines has already signed similar agreements with Canberra and Washington and is considering one with France. The agreement comes amid tensions in the South China Sea, where incidents between Chinese and Philippine vessels have increased, and concerns over Taiwan's status. The pact is seen as crucial for the Philippines' defense and could play a significant role in any potential conflict involving the United States.

**Philippines and Japan Sign Defense Pact Amid Tensions with China**
The governments of the Philippines and Japan signed a military cooperation agreement, allowing the deployment of their troops in each other's countries, amid growing tensions with China in the Indo-Pacific. The pact, signed during the visit of Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa to Manila, enables both countries to deploy troops for exercises and training. This will facilitate Japan's participation in the annual Balikatan military exercises, where it has previously participated as an observer alongside Philippine and US troops. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. emphasized the 'hard work' of both countries in achieving this defense pact and praised the 'confidence and importance' it brings to both governments. The agreement aims to 'maintain and strengthen the international order based on the rule of law'. The two countries, historical allies of the US, have been strengthening their defense ties in recent months in response to China's growing assertiveness. The disputed South China Sea is a key area of contention, with the Philippines, China, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan all having claims to the region. Tensions between China and the Philippines have increased since Marcos Jr. took office in 2022, with the Philippines strengthening its military alliance with the US and expanding access to its bases for US troops, including some with strategic access to the South China Sea or Taiwan.

Philippine Defense Minister Gilberto Teodoro described the deal as 'another milestone in our joint efforts to ensure a rule-based international order.' Japan's Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa also hailed the agreement as a milestone. The pact aims to promote 'peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and especially in our region,' said Teodoro. The deal is significant not only because of the growing tensions with China but also due to Japan's historical occupation of the Philippines during World War II, during which Japanese forces committed numerous war crimes. The Philippines is a key partner for the US in the event of a conflict with China over Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory.

Lin warned that any action that undermines regional peace and stability and destroys regional unity and cooperation will attract common vigilance and opposition from regional countries. He also urged Japan to 'reflect on its history of aggression' and be prudent in its words and actions regarding military security. The statement comes amid tensions between Japan and the Philippines, allies of the United States, over the South China Sea, where China has been increasingly assertive in its territorial claims. The Philippines and China have been in a growing dispute over sovereignty in the South China Sea, where Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan also have claims.

**Japan and the Philippines Sign Defense Agreement to Counter China's Growing Military Power**
Japan and the Philippines signed a defense agreement to focus on China's growing military power in the region. The agreement allows for the deployment of troops on each other's soil, amid shared concerns about China's military expansion. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kishida and Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro signed the agreement on Monday during a ceremony in Manila. The agreement enables Japanese troops to deploy in the Philippines for joint military exercises, and Philippine troops to conduct combat training in Japan. The agreement requires ratification by the legislative bodies of both countries to take effect. The agreement comes as Japan and the Philippines, both US allies, express concern over China's growing influence in the region. China claims more than 90% of the South China Sea, including waters within the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines and four other Southeast Asian countries. In 2016, an international court in The Hague ruled that China's claims had no legal basis. The Chinese and Philippine coast guards and navies have been involved in several confrontations in disputed waters, including a recent incident where Chinese coast guards used knives and harpoons and rammed two Philippine Navy supply ships. Japan has a long-standing territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands, located between Taiwan and Okinawa. Under Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Tokyo has sought to strengthen its military power, including through reciprocal access agreements with Australia and the UK. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. strongly condemned China's actions in the South China Sea and warned that his country would consider any Filipino killed by China as a 'war crime'. Manila has long-standing defense agreements with Australia and the US, and is exploring a similar agreement with France. In April, leaders of the US, Japan, and the Philippines held their first trilateral summit in Washington, as part of efforts to strengthen military cooperation between the three countries. The summit followed joint military exercises in the South China Sea, which also involved Australia.

**Philippines and Japan Sign Defense Pact to Counter China's Growing Influence**
The Philippines and Japan have signed a crucial defense pact that allows the deployment of troops in each other's territory to strengthen their relations and counter China's growing influence. The Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) was signed by Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa at a ceremony at the Malacañang Palace in Manila. The pact allows for the deployment of troops for training and military exercises. The Philippines and Japan are long-standing allies of the United States, which has strengthened its alliances with Canberra. The Philippines has already signed similar agreements with Canberra and Washington and is considering one with France. The agreement comes amid rising tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea, which could lead to a larger conflict involving the United States, a key ally of the Philippines. The Philippines and Japan have been involved in a series of incidents in the South China Sea, including a recent incident in which Chinese coast guards armed with knives, clubs, and a hatchet surrounded and boarded three Philippine Navy ships that were on a mission to resupply Filipino soldiers stationed on a ship that ran aground on the Second Thomas Shoal. A Filipino sailor lost his finger in the incident. The tensions are also high between Tokyo and Beijing over disputed islands in the East China Sea. Japan occupied the Philippines during World War II, but the two countries have since strengthened their economic ties and more recently, their defense cooperation to counter China's growing power. Tokyo is one of the main suppliers of security equipment to the Philippines, providing patrol ships and radar systems for its coastlines. According to Japanese Ambassador to Manila Kazuya Endo, the agreement is significant because it will allow the Philippines to improve its interoperability with partners sharing the same vision. The Philippines has been at the center of US efforts to build alliances, due to its position in the South China Sea and proximity to Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. Beijing has increased its diplomatic and military pressure around the autonomous island, sending frequent flights and naval vessels to its surroundings. In the event of a conflict, Manila's support would be crucial for the US. Japanese leaders, Philippine leaders, and US leaders held their first trilateral summit in April to strengthen defense ties in Washington. The summit followed joint military exercises organized by Manila in the South China Sea, which involved the US, Japan, and Australia. Japan is cautious about possible changes in US policy in the region and seeks to 'play a more important role' as an independent and stabilizing force, notes Don McLain Gill, a geopolitical analyst based in Manila.

**Philippines and Japan sign defence pact, with eyes on China, Asia News**
The Philippines and Japan have signed a reciprocal access agreement (RAA) allowing them to deploy their forces on each other's soil, a milestone in their security relations amid rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The agreement creates a framework to facilitate military cooperation, including the entry of foreign personnel and equipment. This deal could help the Philippines counter Chinese influence in the South China Sea, where Beijing's expansive maritime claims conflict with those of several Southeast Asian nations. Japan does not have any claim to the South China Sea, but has a separate maritime dispute with China in the East China Sea. Japan has sought to strengthen defense ties with other nations due to its concerns about China's behavior, including pressure on Taiwan, freedom of navigation, and trade disputes.

The deal allows for Filipino and Japanese troops to harmonize strategies in preparing for potential conflicts in the East and South China Seas and the Taiwan Strait. The agreement marks a significant shift in bilateral military engagements between Manila and Tokyo, which were previously limited to humanitarian and disaster relief operations. Japan has no claim over the waters, but has a separate territorial dispute with China over small islands in the East China Sea.

**Myanmar Conflict Intensifies: Civilians Killed and Injured in Clashes**
The Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) launched attacks in Shan state's Kyaukme and Nawnghkio districts and Mogoke area on June 25, in response to the Myanmar military's continuous violation of a ceasefire agreement brokered by China. The attacks resulted in the capture of some military bases and a police station by the TNLA. The Myanmar military responded with artillery fire and airstrikes. The artillery fire resulted in 14 civilian deaths and 17 civilian injuries in Kyaukme. The airstrikes and artillery fire also damaged 13 homes in Kyaukme. A monastery was hit in Mogoke, resulting in the deaths of 4 civilians, including a child, and 4 civilian injuries. Two civilians were killed and 2 injured in Nawnghkio. The military's attacks over the past four days have resulted in a total of 20 civilian deaths and 23 civilian injuries. Thousands of people living in the affected areas have been displaced due to the clashes. The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, Arakan Army, and Ta'ang National Liberation Army, which are part of the 'Three Brothers Alliance', launched armed attacks on the Myanmar military near the Chinese border in northern Shan state on October 27, 2023. China had called on all parties to cease fire and start a peaceful dialogue to prevent further escalation of the conflict. The Myanmar military seized power in February 2021 after allegations of election fraud in the 2020 general election and a political crisis. The military arrested many officials, including the country's de facto leader and Foreign Minister Aung San Suu Kyi, and declared a state of emergency for one year. The military's crackdown on anti-coup protesters and insurgents has resulted in the deaths of over 902 people and the arrest of thousands. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, approximately 1,400 people have died and 10,000 have been arrested since the coup.

**China's Aggressive Actions in Asia Cause Concern**
China is increasingly showing its dominance in Asia through aggressive actions, causing concern in the international community. Recent incidents include confrontations with Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, as well as the imposition of the death penalty on Taiwanese independence activists. China has been building artificial islands in the South China Sea and increasing its naval capabilities, which has led to concerns about its intentions. The US has responded by reorganizing its forces in Asia and creating a new naval unit based in Okinawa, Japan. The US has also expressed support for Taiwan and has signed a bilateral defense agreement with the Philippines. The situation remains tense, with China's aggressive actions causing concern about the potential for conflict.

**Bill Emmott: Japan, US roles in SE Asia to grow amid China's power imbalance**
The Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional defense summit, saw notable moments, including aggressive words about Taiwan from China's defense minister and protests about civilian deaths in Gaza. President Bongbong Marcos of the Philippines stated that if a Filipino serviceman were killed by a Chinese water cannon, it would be considered an act of war, which could invoke the 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines. This raises concerns about the potential for war between the US and China over the South China Sea. China has a long-standing claim to the area, and its recent decree authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain foreign nationals who flout marine demarcations has led to a collision between a Chinese and a Philippine ship. The article argues that the huge power imbalance between China and the South-East Asian nations, which is reflected in their military spending, will take time to redress, and in the meantime, the US and Japan will play a crucial role in the region.

**China Continues to Pressure Taiwan, 41 Military Aircraft Detected**
Taiwan's Ministry of Defense reported detecting 41 Chinese military aircraft around the island, following multiple intrusions since the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te. The ministry stated that 32 of these aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which separates the island from mainland China. Additionally, 7 Chinese ships were detected in the area over the past 24 hours. The ministry said it has been monitoring the situation and responding accordingly. This Chinese incursion comes after China issued new judicial guidelines that include the death penalty for 'irreducible' Taiwanese independence supporters. Taiwan's government has been under increasing military pressure from China, with almost daily flights and naval deployments. Experts describe this as a 'gray zone' tactic, where China is using intimidation without crossing the threshold of actual war. Some analysts believe this is a response to joint US-Philippines military exercises in April, which simulated the recapture of occupied islands in the South China Sea.

**US and China Resume Talks on Nuclear Weapons Amid Taiwan Tensions**
The United States and China have resumed unofficial talks on nuclear weapons for the first time in five years, amid concerns over the threat of war over Taiwan. According to Reuters, US representatives expressed concerns that China may use or threaten to use nuclear weapons if it loses in a conflict over Taiwan. Chinese representatives assured that this will not happen, as they are confident that the Chinese army can win a conventional battle with Taiwan without using nuclear weapons. The talks took place in a Shanghai hotel conference room, with six US scientists and former officials participating, and several former PLA officers, analysts, and scholars from China. In March 2024, US Admiral Aquilino stated that China may be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense reported on May 23 that China was conducting military exercises near the island, which China called 'unreasonable provocations'. The Associated Press reported that Taiwan's military has been put on high alert due to China's military exercises. On June 4, Biden stated that the US is not ruling out the possibility of deploying its military forces to Taiwan if China invades the island.

**258th Day of the 'Iron Swords' War: A Summary of the Conflict**
The 258th day of the 'Iron Swords' war between Israel and terrorist organizations in Gaza, Judea, and Samaria, as well as in Lebanon, began on October 7, 2023. The war started with a terrorist attack on a music festival near the Gaza border, killing hundreds and taking many hostages. The terrorist organization Hamas announced the start of the war, calling it 'The Flood of Al-Aksa'. In response, the Israeli government declared a state of war and launched Operation 'Iron Swords'. Since the start of the war, over 1,500 people have been killed, including citizens of Israel, the US, Canada, the UK, France, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Brazil, China, India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines, Nepal, South Africa, Sudan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. The Israeli military has suffered significant losses, with over 310 soldiers killed and around 14,000 terrorists and their commanders eliminated. The war has also caused significant damage to infrastructure in Gaza, with over 10,000 rockets fired at Israeli cities and towns. The Israeli military has responded with airstrikes on targets in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, and has also launched a naval operation to intercept ships carrying weapons to Gaza. The war has displaced over 1.7 million people in Gaza, with many forced to flee their homes and live in shelters. The United Nations has reported that over 40% of the dead in Gaza are men of fighting age, 20% are women, and 32% are children. The war has also caused significant economic and humanitarian crises in Gaza, with many people struggling to access basic necessities such as food and medicine.

**Terrorist attacks likely before China invasion: Ex-Japanese officer**
A retired Japanese Lieutenant General, Hirotaka Yamashita, predicted that terrorist activities, including bomb attacks on presidential vehicles and major metro stations in Taipei, would likely occur before a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan. Yamashita, who formerly served as the vice chief of staff of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, made the statement at a press event in Taipei to promote his book on how China might invade Taiwan. He believes that these terrorist activities would be aimed at shaking the Taiwanese public's faith in their government and influencing public opinion. Yamashita also predicted that China would likely invade Taiwan between 2035 and 2050, when China's nuclear arsenal would rival that of the US, and that China would frame its use of nuclear weapons on Taiwan as a way to tackle 'domestic affairs'.
