**Comando con Vzla Condemns Arrest Warrant Against Edmundo González as 'Illegal and Immoral'**
The organization Comando con Vzla strongly rejected the arrest warrant issued against Edmundo González, a former presidential candidate, calling it 'illegal, unconstitutional, and immoral.' They stated that this action is an attempt to undermine the will of the people, which was clearly expressed in the elections. Comando con Vzla emphasized that even those who did not vote for González want a country where democracy and freedom prevail. They claimed that this act represents a 'red line' crossed by the government, but that it will not deter the determination of the Venezuelan people to seek peaceful and constitutional change. 'Nothing they do can hide the truth. On July 28, the people of Venezuela, honest and brave, raised their voice for peace and freedom. They did so without distinction of political color and overcoming all the barriers imposed on them,' they said. The group also stated that the international community has supported the opposition forces. 'We are all united in fighting for truth, justice, liberty, and the Republic... Liberty is our right and we will not give it up,' they concluded. The arrest warrant was issued on September 2, 2024, at the request of prosecutor Luis Ernesto Dueñez Reyes, accusing González of various crimes, including usurpation of functions, forgery of public documents, instigation of disobedience of laws, conspiracy, and sabotage.

**Edmundo González Urrutia Faces Contempt of Court Charges**
Edmundo González Urrutia, a Venezuelan politician, has been involved in a case of contempt of court after failing to appear before the Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) as required by a citation. González Urrutia justified his absence on social media, claiming that his freedom and the will of the Venezuelan people were at risk. According to Cecilia Sosa Gómez, González Urrutia's actions constitute a contempt of authority, as defined by Article 483 of the Penal Code, which carries penalties such as arrest or fine. The Electoral Chamber has ordered the Public Ministry to investigate alleged crimes related to usurpation of functions, forgery of public documents, instigation to disobey the law, computer crimes, association to commit a crime, and conspiracy. González Urrutia has been cited three times as an investigated person, and if he fails to appear, an arrest warrant will be issued. This situation highlights that contempt of court citations can result in the deprivation of liberty while the investigation is ongoing.

**Edmundo González Urrutia Faces Third Summons and Possible Arrest**
Edmundo González Urrutia, the leader of the opposition and the Plataforma Unitaria Democrática, is facing a third summons from the Public Ministry in an investigation into the electoral results. If González does not attend this new summons, the consequences could be severe, as the Prosecutor's Office has warned that, if he does not present himself, an arrest warrant will be issued against him. The summons, scheduled for this Friday, is part of a series of legal actions that seek to investigate the accusations made by the presidential candidate, who claimed to have collected 83.5% of the electoral acts to demonstrate a supposed fraud in the presidential elections of July 28. These acts, published by the Plataforma Unitaria and qualified as 'false' by the government of Nicolás Maduro, has led the Public Ministry to investigate the alleged commission of several crimes, including usurpation of functions, forgery of a public document, and association for delinquency. The Chavist Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, explained that, according to Venezuelan jurisprudence, it is allowed to summon a person up to three times before taking more severe measures. Given González Urrutia's refusal to attend the first two summonses, the Prosecutor's Office prepared the third and last summons, clearly stating that the absence could trigger his arrest. In this context, the Venezuelan diplomat could face not only the deprivation of his liberty, but also an irregular judicial process, as has happened with the political prisoners of the Chavist government. Additionally, the risk of flight pointed out by the Prosecutor's Office could be used to justify more stringent precautionary measures, complicating the situation of the opposition leader even further. As Tarek William Saab said, 'According to Venezuelan jurisprudence, we allow summoning a person up to three times before taking more severe measures.'

**Venezuela Arrest Warrant for Presidential Candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Sparks International Outcry**
A warrant for the arrest of Edmundo Gonzalez, a former diplomat and presidential candidate in Venezuela's July 28, 2024 election, was published on the Venezuelan Attorney General's Instagram account on September 2, 2024. Gonzalez is accused of six crimes, including forgery, incitement to disobedience, conspiracy, electoral sabotage, and association to commit a crime. He faces over 20 years in prison. More than 1700 people, including opposition leaders like Biagio Pilieri, have been arrested following protests after the National Electoral Council announced that Nicolas Maduro had won his third presidential term. The opposition claims that Pilieri is being held at the Helicoïde prison, a former shopping mall turned torture center by Venezuelan security forces. Nine Latin American countries have rejected the arrest warrant, stating that it is 'a new attempt to silence Mr. González, ignore the Venezuelan people's will, and constitute a political persecution.' The whereabouts of Gonzalez and Maria Corina Machado, another opposition leader, are unknown as they have gone into hiding. Meanwhile, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has declared that Christmas celebrations will begin on October 1, 2024.

**Edmundo González Rejects Supreme Court Decision Confirming Maduro's Victory**
Edmundo González, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition coalition Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD), rejected the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) on Thursday, August 22, 2024, which confirmed the victory of Nicolás Maduro in the presidential elections. According to González, 'the sovereignty resides intransferiblemente in the people', as stated in the Constitution. The TSJ validated the election results at the request of Maduro, who filed a lawsuit that was never known and for which the 10 former presidential candidates were summoned. However, González declined to attend, considering that the verification is not the competence of the TSJ, but rather the National Electoral Council (CNE). González warned that the decision of the Supreme Court 'will only aggravate the crisis' in the country, which is already experiencing a crisis after the disputed victory of Maduro. He also stated that the Venezuelans are not willing to 'renounce' their 'liberty' or their 'right to change peacefully to live better' after the presidential elections. The PUD considers that González obtained the victory, according to the '83.5% of the acts' that they claim to have collected through witnesses and members of the electoral table, documents that the government considers 'false'.

**Paola Holguín Rejects Petro's Plans for Venezuela: Emphasizes Need for Prudence, Not Complicity**
Senator Paola Holguín, a prominent figure in the opposition party Centro Democrático, reiterated the official stance of her party regarding the recent elections in Venezuela, emphasizing support for the recognition of Edmundo González Urrutia as the undisputed winner of the elections. Holguín expressed her rejection of the possibility of holding new elections or considering alternative options to a peaceful transition, as proposed by President Gustavo Petro and his Brazilian counterpart, Lula da Silva. 'We as a party have been clear in recognizing Edmundo González's victory; we have also been clear about the inconvenience of proposing new elections or a different exit to the peaceful transition that must be given and the recognition of the indiscutible winner,' Holguín emphasized. She also highlighted that her party consistently denounces the Venezuelan regime's abuses against its citizens, mentioning that 'today more than 1,000 people are deprived of liberty, more than 20 dead and disappeared, and in front of this as democrats the position has always been very clear.' Holguín also emphasized the importance of being 'prudent, but not complicit' in the situation in Venezuela, reiterating that the electoral result is 'clear and conclusive' and was ratified by entities such as the Carter Center and the Electoral Observation Mission (MOE), which acted as observers in the process.

**Venezuela: Edmundo González rejects TSJ summons to certify election results**
Edmundo González Urrutia, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, has rejected the summons to the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) to certify the results of the presidential elections, considering it a 'violation of due process' and not corresponding to any procedure in Venezuelan law. According to González Urrutia, if he were to attend the Electoral Chamber, he would do so in a situation of 'absolute defenselessness' because the procedure followed by the Electoral Chamber does not correspond to any legal procedure in the Organic Law of the TSJ and another law on electoral jurisdiction. González Urrutia stated that the Electoral Chamber cannot 'usurp' the constitutional functions of the National Electoral Council (CNE) and 'certify' results that have not been produced in accordance with the Constitution and the law, with access to the original acts that serve as the basis for a totalization and proclamation, and with the necessary audits. González Urrutia warned that if he attends the TSJ, he will be in 'absolute vulnerability due to defenselessness and violation of due process' and will put his liberty and the 'will of the Venezuelan people expressed on July 28, 2024' at risk. He also called on the authorities to 'recover their sanity and seek dialogue in a frank and acceptable framework that safeguards human rights'.
