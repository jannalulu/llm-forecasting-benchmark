Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Growing strategic partnership between US and India to counter China's influence
2. India's demonstrated interest in nuclear submarines (previous leasing from Russia)
3. Recent news about India's expanding nuclear submarine capabilities and base construction
4. US's increasing openness to sharing nuclear technology with allies (AUKUS precedent)

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. No direct indication of ongoing US-India negotiations for nuclear submarines
2. Recent US statement about being unlikely to help South Korea with nuclear submarines due to AUKUS commitments
3. India's existing relationships with France and Russia for submarine technology
4. Short timeframe (less than 3 months) until September 30, 2024
5. Complex nature of such agreements requiring significant negotiation and approval processes

Additional Considerations:
1. India is currently focusing on indigenous submarine development
2. Recent news shows India pursuing deals with France for Scorpène submarines
3. US appears focused on fulfilling AUKUS commitments
4. No historical precedent of US offering nuclear submarines to India

Key Timeline Constraints:
- Less than 3 months remaining until deadline
- Complex military agreements typically take years to negotiate

Weighing these factors:
- The extremely short timeframe is the most critical factor
- No current public negotiations or discussions about US-India nuclear submarine deals
- India's existing submarine procurement plans with other nations
- US's current focus on AUKUS commitments

Given the tight timeline and lack of any current negotiations, combined with US's recent statement about AUKUS commitments limiting such arrangements, a very low probability is warranted.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Historical precedent:
- The US has never offered nuclear submarines to India before
- The US has only shared nuclear submarine technology with the UK (historically) and recently Australia through AUKUS
- The timeframe is very short (less than 3 months from now)

2. Arguments for a higher probability:
- India is seeking to counter China's growing naval presence
- India has experience operating nuclear submarines (leased from Russia)
- India is building a major nuclear submarine base (INS Varsha)
- US-India strategic partnership has been strengthening

3. Arguments for a lower probability:
- Recent news indicates US refused to help South Korea with nuclear submarines due to AUKUS commitments
- No reported ongoing negotiations between US-India specifically about nuclear submarines
- India is pursuing other submarine deals (with France for Scorpène submarines)
- The process of offering nuclear submarines requires significant diplomatic and technical groundwork

4. Key timing factors:
- The resolution date (Sept 30, 2024) is less than 3 months away
- No current public discussions or negotiations about US nuclear submarines to India
- Major naval technology transfers typically take years to negotiate

5. Distinctive features:
- AUKUS precedent suggests US is very selective about sharing nuclear submarine technology
- India's current focus appears to be on conventional submarines and indigenous nuclear submarine development

Given the very short timeframe, lack of any current negotiations, and US's recent refusal to South Korea for similar technology sharing, combined with the historical rarity of such transfers, this appears highly unlikely in the given timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Context:
- India has previously leased nuclear submarines from Russia, but returned them early due to maintenance issues
- The US has only shared nuclear submarine technology with UK through AUKUS, and recently Australia
- US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated it's unlikely US would help South Korea build nuclear submarines due to AUKUS commitments

2. Current Situation:
- No direct evidence of ongoing US-India negotiations for nuclear submarines
- India is building its own nuclear submarine base (INS Varsha)
- India is focusing on indigenous submarine development and French conventional submarines
- Recent news shows India-France negotiations for Scorpène submarines
- India-US defense cooperation is increasing but focused on other areas

3. Factors Against:
- AUKUS commitments limit US ability to share nuclear tech
- US focusing on delivering submarines to Australia first
- No public discussions or leaks about potential US-India nuclear submarine deal
- Short timeframe (less than 3 months) makes new major agreement unlikely
- India's established relationship with Russia and France for submarines

4. Factors For:
- Growing US-India strategic partnership
- US concern about China's naval expansion
- India's desire to counter Chinese influence
- US considering more competitive nuclear strategy

5. Timeline Analysis:
The question asks about before September 30, 2024, which is less than 3 months away. Major defense agreements typically take years to negotiate, especially involving nuclear technology.

Given all these factors, particularly the AUKUS precedent, lack of evidence of ongoing negotiations, and the very short timeline, the probability is very low but not zero given strategic imperatives.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, with 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- The US has only shared nuclear submarine technology with the UK historically, and very recently with Australia through AUKUS
- This suggests a very low base rate for sharing nuclear submarine technology

2. Recent evidence against:
- US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated it's unlikely US would help South Korea build nuclear submarines due to AUKUS commitments
- There's no indication of active negotiations between US-India on nuclear submarines
- The US Navy is facing its own submarine production challenges and delays
- US is focusing on delivering submarines to Australia under AUKUS

3. Recent evidence for:
- India is actively expanding its nuclear submarine capabilities with INS Varsha base
- Growing US-India strategic partnership to counter China
- India has experience operating nuclear submarines (leased from Russia)
- China's naval expansion creates pressure for India to strengthen its capabilities

4. Context:
- The timeframe is very short (less than 3 months until Sept 30, 2024)
- Such deals typically require lengthy negotiations and approvals
- No public reports of ongoing discussions specifically about US nuclear submarines
- India is currently pursuing other submarine options (French Scorpène)

5. Balancing factors:
- While strategic logic might support such cooperation, the extremely short timeframe and lack of preparatory signals make it highly unlikely before September 2024
- The US commitment to AUKUS and recent statement about South Korea suggest strong barriers to sharing nuclear submarine technology with additional countries
- India appears focused on other submarine procurement paths currently

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

Key factors favoring a lower probability:

1. Historical precedent: The US has never offered nuclear submarines to India before. The only countries the US has agreed to share nuclear submarine technology with are the UK (historically) and Australia (AUKUS).

2. Recent statements: US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated it's unlikely the US would help even South Korea build nuclear submarines due to AUKUS commitments.

3. Time constraint: With only about 2.5 months until the September 30, 2024 deadline, there's very limited time for such a major agreement.

4. Current focus: The US is currently focused on delivering on its AUKUS commitments and dealing with Virginia-class submarine production challenges.

Key factors favoring a higher probability:

1. Strategic context: India is seen as a key counter to China in the Indo-Pacific, and there's evidence of increasing US-India defense cooperation.

2. India's submarine ambitions: Multiple articles indicate India's strong interest in expanding its nuclear submarine fleet and building new submarine bases.

3. Competition with China: Reports show China rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and naval capabilities, which might motivate the US to strengthen India's capabilities.

Balancing these factors:

1. The extremely short timeframe (less than 3 months) is a major constraint.

2. The US's recent explicit statement about not sharing nuclear submarine technology with South Korea sets a very recent precedent.

3. The complexity and sensitivity of nuclear submarine technology transfer would likely require much longer negotiations and planning.

4. The US's current submarine production challenges make it unlikely they would take on additional commitments.
