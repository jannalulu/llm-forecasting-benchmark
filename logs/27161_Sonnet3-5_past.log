To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and consider the available evidence:

1. Timeline: The question asks about Week 4, which would be around September 29, 2024. This gives Bo Nix about 6 weeks from the current date to secure the starting position.

2. Current status: As of the most recent reports (mid-August 2024), Bo Nix is in a competition for the starting quarterback position, primarily against Jarrett Stidham.

3. Recent performance: Nix impressed in his preseason debut against the Colts, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown. This strong performance supports his case for the starting role.

4. Coach's statements: Sean Payton has announced that Nix will start the second preseason game against the Packers. This suggests Payton is giving Nix a serious opportunity to win the starting job.

5. Odds and expert opinions: Multiple sources, including DraftKings Sportsbook, list Nix as the favorite to start Week 1. If he starts Week 1, it's more likely he'll still be starting by Week 4.

6. Historical precedent: The Broncos have had a revolving door at quarterback since Peyton Manning's retirement. They may be inclined to give their first-round pick an early opportunity.

7. Potential risks: As a rookie, Nix could struggle in his first few NFL starts, which might lead to a change by Week 4. However, given the investment in Nix and the lack of a clear superior alternative, the Broncos are likely to be patient.

Balancing these factors:

- The strong preseason performance, coach's decision to start him in the second preseason game, and betting odds all point towards Nix being the likely Week 1 starter.
- If he starts Week 1, there's a high probability he'll still be starting in Week 4, barring injury or extremely poor performance.
- The main risk factors are potential poor performance in the first three weeks or a surprisingly strong showing from Stidham in the remaining preseason games.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a high probability that Nix will be the Week 4 starter, but there's still some uncertainty due to his rookie status and the potential for early-season struggles.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

Let's approach this question step-by-step:

1. Reference class: Rookie quarterbacks starting in Week 4 of their first NFL season. This is relatively common, especially for first-round draft picks.

2. Current situation: Bo Nix was drafted 12th overall by the Broncos in 2024. He's competing with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson for the starting job.

3. Evidence for Nix starting:
   - Multiple sources report Nix as the favorite to start Week 1.
   - DraftKings Sportsbook gives Nix -310 odds to start Week 1 (as of August 13, 2024).
   - Nix performed well in the preseason opener (15/21, 125 yards, 1 TD).
   - Coach Sean Payton announced Nix will start the second preseason game.
   - Nix has been taking first-team reps in practice.
   - Analysts and insiders consistently predict Nix will win the starting job.

4. Evidence against Nix starting:
   - Initial depth chart listed Nix as QB3 (though this was unofficial).
   - Jarrett Stidham started the first preseason game.
   - There's always a chance of injury or unforeseen performance issues.

5. Timeline: The question is about Week 4, not Week 1. If Nix starts Week 1, he's very likely to still be starting in Week 4 unless he performs terribly or gets injured.

6. Trend analysis: The trend is clearly in Nix's favor. Each new piece of information strengthens his position.

7. Error balancing: The risk of overconfidence seems lower than the risk of underestimating Nix's chances based on the overwhelming evidence in his favor.

8. Uncertainty factors: Injuries, unexpected poor performance, or a surprise decision by the coaching staff could change things.

Given all this information, it seems highly likely that Nix will be the starter in Week 4. The main risks are injury or unexpectedly poor performance in the first three weeks. 

My Prediction: Between 82.50% and 92.50%, with 87.50% being the most likely. Probability: 87.50%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the evidence:

1. Base rate: How often do first-round rookie QBs start by Week 4?
This varies, but it's relatively common. Many teams aim to start their first-round QBs early if they show promise in preseason and training camp.

2. Broncos' QB situation:
- Bo Nix was drafted 12th overall, indicating the team sees him as their future starter.
- Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson are his main competition.
- Sean Payton is known for developing QBs and may prefer a veteran initially.

3. Preseason performance:
- Nix impressed in his preseason debut, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a TD.
- He led four scoring drives on five possessions.
- Payton announced Nix will start the second preseason game against the Packers.

4. Training camp reports:
- Nix has been taking first-team reps and impressing coaches.
- Payton praised Nix's progress and decision-making.

5. Betting odds:
- DraftKings Sportsbook gives Nix -310 odds to start Week 1, indicating strong confidence.

6. Timeline:
- The question is about Week 4, giving Nix additional time to prepare if he doesn't start Week 1.

Factors favoring Nix starting:
- Strong preseason performance
- First-round draft status
- Positive coach feedback
- Favorable betting odds
- Time to prepare (4 weeks)

Factors against Nix starting:
- Veteran competition (Stidham, Wilson)
- Potential preference for experienced QB to start the season
- Risk of rushing a rookie QB

Balancing these factors, there's strong evidence pointing towards Nix starting by Week 4. His preseason performance and coach's comments suggest he's progressing well. The betting odds also heavily favor him. Even if he doesn't start Week 1, four weeks is ample time for a promising rookie to earn the starting role.

However, we must account for uncertainty. Injuries, unexpected poor performance, or a strong showing from Stidham or Wilson could change the situation.

Given this analysis, I believe there's a high probability of Nix starting in Week 4, but not a certainty.

To answer this question, let's break it down and analyze the available information:

1. Timeline:
Today is August 14, 2024. Week 4 of the NFL season typically occurs in late September or early October, so we're looking about 6-8 weeks into the future.

2. Current situation:
- Bo Nix is a rookie quarterback drafted 12th overall by the Broncos in 2024.
- He's in a competition with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson for the starting job.
- Recent news articles suggest Nix is impressing in training camp and preseason.

3. Evidence supporting Nix starting in Week 4:
- Nix performed well in the first preseason game, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown.
- Coach Sean Payton announced Nix will start the second preseason game against the Packers.
- Betting odds from DraftKings Sportsbook have Nix at -310 to start Week 1.
- Multiple articles suggest Nix is the favorite to win the starting job.
- Nix has been taking first-team reps in practice.

4. Evidence against Nix starting in Week 4:
- Jarrett Stidham started the first preseason game and has more NFL experience.
- The competition is still ongoing, and Payton hasn't officially named a starter.
- As a rookie, Nix might struggle early and be replaced by a veteran.

5. Historical context:
- Rookie quarterbacks drafted in the first round often start early in the season.
- The Broncos have had a revolving door at quarterback since Peyton Manning retired.

6. Potential scenarios:
a) Nix wins the job outright and starts Week 1 through Week 4.
b) Nix starts the season but struggles and is replaced by Week 4.
c) Another QB starts the season, but Nix takes over by Week 4.
d) Another QB starts and keeps the job through Week 4.

Considering all these factors, it seems highly likely that Nix will be the starter in Week 4. The team invested a high draft pick in him, he's performing well, and the coaches seem to be giving him every opportunity to win the job.

The main risk to this prediction is the possibility of Nix struggling early and being replaced, but given the team's investment in him and the positive reports so far, this seems less likely.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key factors and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current QB competition status:
The most recent reports indicate that Bo Nix is the favorite to win the starting job. He's been impressive in training camp and preseason games, with coach Sean Payton praising his performance. The odds from DraftKings Sportsbook in mid-August had Nix at -310 to be the Week 1 starter.

2. Performance in preseason games:
Nix has performed well in preseason, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown in the opener against the Colts. He's scheduled to start the second preseason game against the Packers, which suggests he's leading the competition.

3. Coach's statements:
Sean Payton has been positive about Nix's progress, calling him "impressive" and saying he's "really everything" Payton thought he would be. This suggests Payton is leaning towards starting Nix.

4. Competition:
Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson are Nix's main competition. While Stidham has more NFL experience, reports suggest he's fallen behind Nix in the competition. Wilson seems to be a distant third at this point.

5. Team investment:
The Broncos drafted Nix 12th overall, indicating a significant investment and likely desire to start him sooner rather than later.

6. Timeline:
The question asks about Week 4, not Week 1. This gives Nix more time to solidify his position if he does start Week 1, or to take over if he doesn't.

Balancing these factors:
- The strong positive indicators for Nix starting Week 1 suggest a high probability he'll still be starting by Week 4.
- However, there's always a risk of injury or poor performance in the first three weeks that could lead to a change.
- The additional time between Week 1 and Week 4 slightly increases uncertainty.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a very high chance Nix will be the starter in Week 4, but it's not certain.

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

Nix has performed well in preseason, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown in the opener against the Colts. He's scheduled to start the second preseason game against the Packers, which suggests he's leading the competition.

3. Coach's statements:
Sean Payton has been positive about Nix's progress, calling him "impressive" and saying he's "really everything" Payton thought he would be. This suggests Payton is leaning towards starting Nix.

4. Competition:
Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson are Nix's main competition. While Stidham has more NFL experience, reports suggest he's fallen behind Nix in the competition. Wilson seems to be a distant third at this point.

5. Team investment:
The Broncos drafted Nix 12th overall, indicating a significant investment and likely desire to start him sooner rather than later.

6. Timeline:
The question asks about Week 4, not Week 1. This gives Nix more time to solidify his position if he does start Week 1, or to take over if he doesn't.

Balancing these factors:
- The strong positive indicators for Nix starting Week 1 suggest a high probability he'll still be starting by Week 4.
- However, there's always a risk of injury or poor performance in the first three weeks that could lead to a change.
- The additional time between Week 1 and Week 4 slightly increases uncertainty.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a very high chance Nix will be the starter in Week 4, but it's not certain.

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.
