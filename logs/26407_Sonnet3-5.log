To analyze this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022, so there is a precedent for this type of action.

2. Current military situation: Multiple sources indicate Russia is struggling with manpower shortages and is actively recruiting, suggesting a potential need for mobilization.

3. Official statements: The Kremlin has repeatedly denied plans for new mobilization, most recently in May 2024. However, similar denials were made before the 2022 mobilization.

4. Recruitment efforts: Russia is reportedly recruiting around 30,000-40,000 soldiers monthly through contract service, which may reduce the need for formal mobilization.

5. Timing: The question asks about mobilization before September 30, 2024, which is after the typical spring and fall conscription periods.

6. ISW reporting: As the sole source for resolution, ISW's assessment is crucial. They have reported on Russia's "crypto-mobilization" efforts but not a formal second wave.

7. Political considerations: A new mobilization could be unpopular domestically, potentially influencing the decision.

8. Military goals: Putin has stated a preference for a gradual approach, which might not necessitate large-scale mobilization.

9. Preparations: Reports of Russia developing systems to prevent potential conscripts from leaving the country suggest possible preparation for future mobilization.

Weighing these factors:

- The ongoing recruitment efforts and Putin's stated preference for a gradual approach suggest a lower likelihood of formal mobilization.
- However, the manpower shortages, historical precedent, and preparations to restrict travel indicate a non-zero probability.
- The timing (before September 30, 2024) gives a relatively long window for the situation to evolve.
- ISW's role as the sole arbiter for resolution adds uncertainty, as they may have a specific threshold for what constitutes a "second mobilization wave."

Considering these points, I believe there is a moderate but significant chance of a second mobilization wave occurring before the specified date, according to ISW reporting.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by establishing the key facts and timeline:

1. The question asks about a second mobilization wave in Russia before September 30, 2024.
2. The resolution criteria specify that ISW must report that a second wave of mobilization is underway for a "Yes" resolution.
3. Today's date is October 18, 2024, which is after the resolution date. This means the outcome is already determined, but we need to infer it from the available information.

Now, let's analyze the evidence:

1. Base rate: Russia conducted one partial mobilization in September 2022. This suggests mobilization is a tool they're willing to use, but infrequently.

2. Throughout 2024, there were consistent denials from Russian officials about plans for a new mobilization:
   - In May 2024, Kremlin spokesman Peskov repeatedly denied the need for mobilization.
   - In June 2024, Putin stated there was no need for a new mobilization.
   - These denials continued even up to July 2024.

3. However, there were also signs of preparation for potential mobilization:
   - In July 2024, Russia planned to restrict travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals starting in fall 2024.
   - There were reports of Russia improving its bureaucratic mobilization systems.

4. The ISW reports from July 2024 mention Russia's "crypto-mobilization" campaign but do not indicate a formal second wave of mobilization.

5. The most recent relevant information is from July 2024, which leaves a gap of about 2 months before the resolution date.

Weighing the evidence:

1. The consistent official denials throughout 2024 suggest that Russia was trying to avoid a formal mobilization.
2. The preparations for restricting travel and improving mobilization systems could indicate planning for future mobilization, but could also be precautionary measures.
3. The lack of any mention of a formal second mobilization in the ISW reports up to July is significant, given their role as the resolution source.
4. The information gap in August and September creates some uncertainty, but given the pattern of denials and the absence of reports of mobilization, it seems unlikely that a dramatic change occurred in those months.

Considering these factors, I assess that it's highly unlikely that Russia started a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the ISW. However, given the information gap and the preparations observed, I can't completely rule it out.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 10.00%, with 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.

To approach this question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided.

Base rate: Russia has conducted one official mobilization since the start of the war in Ukraine (in September 2022). In the nearly two years since then, they have not conducted another official mobilization despite ongoing military operations. This suggests a relatively low base rate for mobilizations.

Key evidence for a higher probability:

1. Ongoing war efforts and reported personnel shortages suggest Russia may need additional troops.
2. Reports of Russia preparing to restrict travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals starting fall 2024 could be a precursor to mobilization.
3. Some analysts and officials predict Russia will need to mobilize more troops, with estimates ranging from 200,000-300,000 additional troops.

Key evidence for a lower probability:

1. Multiple recent and consistent denials from Russian officials, including Putin and Peskov, about the need for new mobilization.
2. Reports of successful voluntary recruitment efforts, with claims of 160,000 new recruits in early 2024 and 300,000 in 2023.
3. Putin's stated preference for a gradual approach and "war of attrition" strategy, which may not require large-scale mobilization.
4. Potential political risks of another mobilization, given past public discontent.

Balancing these factors:

The consistent official denials and reported success in voluntary recruitment suggest Russia may be able to avoid another official mobilization. However, the ongoing war and personnel needs create some pressure for mobilization. The preparations for travel restrictions in fall 2024 are concerning, but may be precautionary rather than indicative of definite plans.

Given the question's reliance on ISW reporting, it's worth noting that ISW has not indicated an imminent mobilization in recent reports, instead focusing on Russia's "crypto-mobilization" efforts.

The September 30, 2024 deadline gives Russia more time to potentially need mobilization, but also more time for voluntary recruitment to potentially suffice.

Considering all these factors, I estimate a relatively low but non-negligible chance of official mobilization by the deadline:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Base rate: Russia has conducted one official mobilization (in September 2022) since the start of the conflict. This suggests mobilizations are relatively rare events.

Key evidence for a higher probability:
1. Multiple reports of Russia preparing for potential mobilization, including restricting travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals starting fall 2024.
2. Ongoing recruitment efforts and "crypto-mobilization" suggest Russia needs more troops.
3. Some analysts and Ukrainian officials predict Russia will need to mobilize more troops.

Key evidence for a lower probability:
1. Repeated denials from Russian officials about plans for new mobilization.
2. Russia's efforts to recruit volunteers and contract soldiers instead of mobilizing.
3. Putin's statements that gradual approaches are preferable to rapid mobilization.
4. The political unpopularity of the previous mobilization.

Balancing the evidence:
The Russian government seems to be trying hard to avoid another official mobilization, likely due to its domestic unpopularity. They are using alternative methods like volunteer recruitment and "crypto-mobilization" to boost troop numbers. However, the preparations for restricting travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals in fall 2024 suggest they are at least considering the possibility of mobilization.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has not reported any concrete plans for mobilization, only noting Russia's ongoing recruitment efforts and "crypto-mobilization." For this question to resolve as "Yes," ISW would need to explicitly report that a second wave of mobilization is underway.

Given the evidence, I believe there's a significant chance Russia will avoid official mobilization before September 30, 2024, but there's also a non-trivial possibility they might be forced to do so if their alternative recruitment methods prove insufficient.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022, calling up 300,000 reservists. This sets a precedent for mobilization during the current conflict.

2. Current recruitment efforts: Multiple sources indicate Russia is actively recruiting contract soldiers, with estimates of 30,000-40,000 new recruits per month. This ongoing recruitment may reduce the need for formal mobilization.

3. Official statements: Throughout 2024, Russian officials including Putin and Peskov have repeatedly denied plans for new mobilization, stating it's unnecessary. However, similar denials were made before the 2022 mobilization.

4. Military needs: Some analysts suggest Russia needs more troops to maintain offensive operations, with estimates of 200,000-300,000 additional troops needed. This could increase pressure for mobilization.

5. Political considerations: A new mobilization could be unpopular domestically, which may make the Russian government hesitant to announce one, especially before or soon after the March 2024 presidential election.

6. Timeframe: The question asks about mobilization before September 30, 2024, which gives Russia several months to potentially conduct mobilization if deemed necessary.

7. ISW reporting: The resolution criteria specifically requires ISW to report that a second wave of mobilization is underway. ISW's July reports mention Russia's "crypto-mobilization" but not a formal second wave.

8. Electronic summons system: Russia plans to implement an electronic summons system by fall 2024, which could facilitate a more efficient mobilization process if needed.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of Russia announcing a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024. The ongoing recruitment efforts and political considerations weigh against mobilization, but military needs and the precedent set in 2022 suggest it's possible. The planned electronic summons system also provides a potential mechanism for more efficient mobilization if needed.

Given the specific requirement for ISW reporting and the relatively short timeframe, I'll adjust my estimate slightly downward from what it might be without these constraints.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

Given the specific requirement for ISW reporting and the relatively short timeframe, I'll adjust my estimate slightly downward from what it might be without these constraints.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022, calling up 300,000 reservists. This sets a precedent for mobilization during the current conflict.

2. Current recruitment efforts: Multiple sources indicate Russia is actively recruiting contract soldiers, with estimates of 30,000-40,000 new recruits per month. This ongoing recruitment may reduce the need for formal mobilization.

3. Official statements: Throughout 2024, Russian officials including Putin and Peskov have repeatedly denied plans for new mobilization, stating it's unnecessary. However, similar denials were made before the 2022 mobilization.

4. Military needs: Some analysts suggest Russia needs more troops to maintain offensive operations, with estimates of 200,000-300,000 additional troops needed. This could increase pressure for mobilization.

5. Political considerations: A new mobilization could be unpopular domestically, which may make the Russian government hesitant to announce one, especially before or soon after the March 2024 presidential election.

6. Timeframe: The question asks about mobilization before September 30, 2024, which gives Russia several months to potentially conduct mobilization if deemed necessary.

7. ISW reporting: The resolution criteria specifically requires ISW to report that a second wave of mobilization is underway. ISW's July reports mention Russia's "crypto-mobilization" but not a formal second wave.

8. Electronic summons system: Russia plans to implement an electronic summons system by fall 2024, which could facilitate a more efficient mobilization process if needed.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of Russia announcing a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024.
