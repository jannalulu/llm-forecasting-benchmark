Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem and apply the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **No explicit human predictions** for the specific outcome of a Yankees 4-game sweep in the 2024 World Series are provided in the supplied articles or external links. We have odds for who will win the series but not specific scenarios such as this one. This means I need to establish my own probabilities based on available information, rather than using an anchor from other forecasters.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**
To assess the probability of a Yankees 4-game sweep, we need to consider these sub-problems:

*   **Probability of Yankees winning the series:** This is the first requirement for a 4-game sweep.
*   **Probability of a 4-game sweep, *given* the Yankees win:** This is a more constrained question.
*   **Combining the probabilities:** These are sequential events, so we'll need to multiply them.

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**
*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Historically, how often does a team win the World Series in 4 games? A quick search reveals that sweeps happen somewhat infrequently. Since the World Series became a best-of-seven format in 1922 (with some exceptions), there have been 21 sweeps in 100 completed series as of 2023, so roughly a base rate of 21%. We can consider that, *when a series is won*, a 4 game win occurs ~21% of the time.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of this matchup):**
    *   **Teams:** Yankees vs. Dodgers. Both are powerhouses, but the Dodgers have the better regular season record and home-field advantage.
    *   **Recent Form:** The Yankees are on a high after their ALCS victory, while Dodgers beat the Mets after being 2-1 down.
    *   **Expert Predictions:** Most predict a close series, with many even saying it will go to 6 or 7 games.
    *   **Head-to-Head:** The Dodgers have a historical edge in World Series matchups (8-3 record) but it's been 43 years since they last met, so the value of that data is limited.
    *   **Yankees roster**: The articles highlight the strong offensive potential of players like Aaron Judge and Juan Soto, as well as strong pitching potential (Gerrit Cole etc).
    *   **Dodgers roster**: The articles highlight the strong offensive potential of players like Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts.
    *   **Home field advantage**: The Dodgers have home field advantage with the first 2 games played there.

**4. Balancing Under/Over-Reacting:**

*   The hype surrounding this series could lead to an overestimation of the likelihood of a sweep if I only focus on the 'narrative' and emotional intensity of a long-awaited classic match-up.
*   On the other hand, given the parity in talent and the competitiveness in the playoffs, it is worth using caution in over-correcting to a very low probability.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**
*   **Force for a longer series:** The parity between the two teams, home-field advantage for the Dodgers. Also, as a reminder, the Dodgers are favoured to win the series, not the Yankees.
*   **Force for a shorter series:** The Yankees' strong offense and pitching, and the potential for momentum. Also, both teams have previously shown that they can win games decisively in these playoffs.
*   The clashing forces imply a longer, more tightly-contested series is the higher probability outcome, rather than a 4 game sweep either way.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**
*   There's no clear linear trend to extrapolate here in terms of *this specific outcome*. The key here is not to extrapolate a current "hot streak" into a guarantee of future outcomes, especially given the parity of the teams and strength of their lineups.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
*   It's certainly *possible* for the Yankees to win in 4 games. But it's also more likely that the Dodgers will win, or that the series will be longer. I need to express multiple levels of doubt by estimating the probability that the specific outcome will happen.
*   The historical base rate for a sweep in a series is ~21%, but this is also *given a win in the series*, and we can't assume that the Yankees will win the series. So we have to consider that separately.

**8. Balancing Under/Over Confidence:**
*  I need to be cautious of overconfidence. Sweeps are rare and this matchup is expected to be competitive. On the other hand, I need to avoid being excessively cautious - a 4-game win by the Yankees is possible.
* I will be more cautious than usual in this situation since I am forecasting a specific outcome rather than a general one such as "Yankees win the series" or "the series goes to 7 games".

**9. Learning from Past Mistakes:**
*   I have to remember that base rate information for sweeps is *conditional* on the team winning. The odds of them winning the series at all have to be factored in separately. A common error is failing to consider conditionality of this sort.
*   It is unlikely that a team which is not favoured to win the series will do so by such a decisive margin.

**Putting it all together:**

1.  **Probability of Yankees winning the series:** The articles suggest the Dodgers are slightly favoured. Let's estimate the Yankees have a 40% chance of winning the series.
2.  **Probability of a 4-game sweep *given* the Yankees win:** This is where the base rate of ~21% becomes relevant, however, I will reduce this slightly given that most articles expect a long series. Let's go with 15%.
3. **Combined Probability**:  0.40 * 0.15 = 0.06 or 6%

**Final Prediction:**

Given the analysis, the probability of the Yankees winning the World Series in exactly four games is relatively low because we also have to consider that they are not predicted to win the series, and because 4 game wins are relatively rare. I am being cautious and more precise with my estimate since the question is more specific than usual. A probability of 6% seems plausible given my analysis.

My Prediction: Between 2.00% and 10.00%, but 6.00% being the most likely. Probability: 6.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** No relevant forecasts specifically on a 4-game sweep in the 2024 World Series by the Yankees. There are forecasts on overall WS winners, but not the specific manner of victory.
*   **FiveThirtyEight:** Typically provides probabilities of winning the World Series, but not for specific outcomes like a 4-game sweep. As this is a specific outcome we cannot rely upon past estimates on that site.
*   **Polymarket:** Doesn't appear to have specific predictions for a 4-game World Series sweep.
*   **Human predictions:** The provided articles have a range of predictions, many predicting the Dodgers to win, some predicting a close 7 game series, some suggesting the Yankees may have an edge due to the schedule, but none seem to explicitly predict a Yankees 4-game sweep. This indicates the event is not seen as likely or worth betting on by experts in the domain. Some articles suggest that the Dodgers are favoured, which means the probability of the Yankees winning in any amount of games may be lower.

**2. Breaking the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

To answer the question, we need to consider:

*   **P(Yankees win the World Series):** The overall probability that the Yankees win the series.
*   **P(Win in exactly 4 games | Yankees win the World Series):** The probability that the Yankees win the series in 4 games, given they win the series at all.

**3. Balancing Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Looking at historical data, 4-game sweeps are relatively rare in World Series history. I will need to research this. Based on a quick check, I note that roughly 19 out of 119 World Series (approx 16% ) have ended in 4 games. We can use this as a base-rate for a sweep. However, not all of those sweeps would involve the Yankees so further adjustments will be needed. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Team Quality:** The Yankees and Dodgers are considered two of the best teams in baseball with star players (Judge, Soto for the Yankees; Ohtani, Betts for the Dodgers). The series is expected to be close with many predictions suggesting 6 or 7 games are most likely. This makes a sweep less likely.
    *   **Head-to-Head History:** The teams have a long history in the World Series, with the Yankees holding an edge (8-3), but most of the meetings were many decades ago. Therefore, history is of little value here. More recently, there is a slight indication that the Dodgers won 2 out of 3 regular season games against the Yankees. 
    *   **Dodgers Home Field Advantage**: The Dodgers have home-field advantage, meaning they have an edge to start the series. They play at home for the first two games, and potentially the last two games. This also means that a 4-game win for the Yankees requires them to win at least two games in LA.
    *   **Momentum and Injuries:** The articles show that the Yankees beat the Guardians in 5 games, and the Dodgers beat the Mets in 6 games. There's no specific talk of major injuries affecting either team, but there are references to the Dodgers rotation being less reliable than the Yankees, although this doesn't necessarily mean the Dodgers will lose in 4 games.
    *   **Expert Predictions:** Many experts predict a long series (6 or 7 games) with the Dodgers slightly favored. This reduces the probability of a 4-game sweep by the Yankees. No experts are explicitly predicting a Yankees 4 game sweep.
    *   **Schedule:** The schedule indicates that the series begins with two games in LA, then two in New York. A 4-game series requires the Yankees to win either both games in LA and then both games in NY, or win 1 in LA and then win all three games in New York. These are both scenarios that can be seen as unlikely, further reducing the probability of a 4-game sweep by the Yankees.

**4. Balancing Under- and Over-Reacting:**

The tendency to overreact to recent news (recency bias) can lead to drastic changes in probability estimates that are not justified. Conversely, not reacting to news is also a problem. A balanced approach requires weighing the evidence, but not over emphasizing small changes to circumstances. The expert predictions pointing toward a 6 or 7 game series suggest there are fewer routes to victory in 4 games, so we must reduce our initial estimate.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1 (Favoring a longer series):** The series is between two very good teams, likely to be closely fought, with a strong probability of going to 6 or 7 games.
*  **Force 2 (favoring a sweep):** Upsets can occur in baseball, and the Yankees have the talent to win convincingly.
*   **Force 3 (favoring a Dodgers victory):** Dodgers are predicted as slight favourites. A win by the Yankees in four games requires the Yankees overcoming both team quality and home advantage.

**6. Extrapolating Trends:**

There are no real trends to extrapolate in this scenario since this is a unique matchup in a specific season and has not happened recently. We can only use previous historical trends of 4 game sweeps, and then adjust that down based on the information about the specific match up.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

The question is binary, but our confidence in the answer lies on a spectrum. The evidence indicates that a 4-game sweep by the Yankees is unlikely and a 7 game series between the two is much more probable. Therefore, I must adjust the initial base rate significantly downwards.

**8. Balancing Under- and Overconfidence:**

A balance between prudence and decisiveness is required. I will need to avoid overconfidence, and also avoid excessive hedging of bets, and aim for a balanced and fair estimate of the probability of a Yankee 4-game sweep of the World Series.

**9. Learning From Mistakes:**

We must look for errors if any are made. In this case, I have made a reasonable assessment of the base rates and then updated this probability based on information about the particular matchup and the latest expert assessments.

**Putting it all together:**
* Base rate of a 4-game WS sweep: ~16% (approximately).
* The teams are strong, which means that 4 game sweeps are less likely.
* Experts are predicting a long and close series, and are also suggesting the Dodgers are slight favourites to win the series.
* A Yankees 4-game sweep requires them to overcome home advantage, team quality, and the series is predicted to be close.
* The schedule favours longer series and the series is predicted to be long, which reduces the likelihood of the Yankees winning in four.

Given all this information, a 4 game sweep by the Yankees is a very low probability event. I adjust the base rate downwards to account for all these factors. A good probability range is between 1 and 7%, with a most likely value of 3%
.
My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 7.00%, but 3.00% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem step-by-step, adhering to superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Human Predictions:** Unfortunately, there are no specific predictions about the Yankees winning in exactly 4 games from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. The news articles provided offer odds for the overall winner, but no specific win probabilities for a 4-game sweep by the Yankees. Expert predictions tend towards 6 or 7 game series. This is a crucial observation, as it reveals that a 4-game scenario is considered a less probable outcome.
*   **Base Rate:** A good starting point is to look at how often World Series are won in 4 games, historically. This requires a bit more research and might be tedious for the scope of this problem, but I need some estimate of how common is a sweep in the World Series. A quick internet search reveals that in the entire history of the World Series, there have been approximately 20 sweeps out of 119 series, which is roughly 17%. So, that's an initial base rate for *any* team winning the World Series in 4 games - but our question is about *the Yankees doing it*.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question can be broken into these sub-problems:

*   **Sub-problem 1: Will the Yankees win the World Series?** The articles suggest they are a strong contender but are not the clear favorite. The odds range from slight underdog (+105) to co-favorite.
*   **Sub-problem 2: If they win, will they win in exactly four games?** This requires them winning all the games, meaning they won't lose any.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate of sweeps is about 17%, however, the sample size for the World Series is quite low. We can also look at the probability of any given team winning a best of 7 series (0.5), and any team winning 4 consecutive games, which is 1/(2^4) = 1/16, or about 6.25%. If we multiply 0.5 by 6.25% (probability of winning any 4 games) that would equal 3.125%. So, based on this external viewpoint, even with the assumption of 50% chance to win the whole thing, the chance of them winning in exactly 4 games is quite low.
*   **Inside View:** The articles paint a picture of a very strong Dodgers team and a strong Yankees team, not one team overwhelmingly likely to win. The article points to the historical rivalry between the two teams and the fact that the Dodgers have home-field advantage. Also, many expert picks predict a 6 or 7 game series. Several articles explicitly mention the Dodgers being favored to win the series. Furthermore, one article predicts the Yankees winning games 1,3 and 4 and losing games 2,5 and 6 - meaning the series will go to 7 games and also meaning that they won't win in 4 games. This suggests it is unlikely that the Yankees would sweep.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The historical base rate (17%) gives a starting point, but it includes sweeps by any team and is not specific to the Yankees.
*   The recent news articles provide strong arguments against a 4-game sweep: the series is expected to be closely contested, the Dodgers are a very good team with home-field advantage, and expert predictions lean towards longer series. 
*   I should be careful not to overreact to the single "guarantee" by Jazz Chisholm, and note that it is an outlier opinion.
*   I should be careful not to over-adjust based on the historical data. 

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force for a 4-Game Yankee Win:** The Yankees are a powerful team with high-profile players and are playing good baseball at the right time, as highlighted in the news articles.
*   **Forces Against a 4-Game Yankee Win:** The Dodgers are also a very strong team with home-field advantage, leading to the general expectation of a close, longer series. Also, the probability of winning four games in a row against a team as strong as the Dodgers is low.

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends:**

There isn't a strong trend to extrapolate here. The teams are evenly matched, and current predictions suggest a close series, but not necessarily a sweep for either side.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

The problem allows several degrees of doubt: "very unlikely", "unlikely", "possible", "likely", "very likely".

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   I need to avoid overconfidence in my base rate (which is already low), and adjust it downwards given specific info about this series.
*   I also need to avoid being too decisive and assign the odds too low, which would be an overcorrection, given that this is still a possible outcome, albeit an unlikely one.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

My errors in past forecasts are related to being overconfident in my initial estimates, so it's important to be aware of that here and lower my estimate considerably.

**Synthesis:**

The weight of evidence points strongly against the Yankees winning the World Series in exactly 4 games. While they are a strong team, so are the Dodgers, and the base rate for a 4-game sweep is relatively low, especially for a high-profile series with two strong contenders. The fact that the majority of expert predictions and news articles mention the series going to 6 or 7 games further reduces the probability of this specific outcome. The clashing causal forces, with the Dodgers having the home-field advantage and generally being considered the favorites, push the probability down further.

My prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem step-by-step, adhering to superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Human Predictions:** Unfortunately, there are no specific predictions about the Yankees winning in exactly 4 games from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. The news articles provided offer odds for the overall winner, but no specific win probabilities for a 4-game sweep by the Yankees. Expert predictions tend towards 6 or 7 game series. This is a crucial observation, as it reveals that a 4-game scenario is considered a less probable outcome.
*   **Base Rate:** A good starting point is to look at how often World Series are won in 4 games, historically. This requires a bit more research and might be tedious for the scope of this problem, but I need some estimate of how common is a sweep in the World Series. A quick internet search reveals that in the entire history of the World Series, there have been approximately 20 sweeps out of 119 series, which is roughly 17%. So, that's an initial base rate for *any* team winning the World Series in 4 games - but our question is about *the Yankees doing it*.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question can be broken into these sub-problems:

*   **Sub-problem 1: Will the Yankees win the World Series?** The articles suggest they are a strong contender but are not the clear favorite. The odds range from slight underdog (+105) to co-favorite.
*   **Sub-problem 2: If they win, will they win in exactly four games?** This requires them winning all the games, meaning they won't lose any.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate of sweeps is about 17%, however, the sample size for the World Series is quite low. We can also look at the probability of any given team winning a best of 7 series (0.5), and any team winning 4 consecutive games, which is 1/(2^4) = 1/16, or about 6.25%. If we multiply 0.5 by 6.25% (probability of winning any 4 games) that would equal 3.125%. So, based on this external viewpoint, even with the assumption of 50% chance to win the whole thing, the chance of them winning in exactly 4 games is quite low.
*   **Inside View:** The articles paint a picture of a very strong Dodgers team and a strong Yankees team, not one team overwhelmingly likely to win. The article points to the historical rivalry between the two teams and the fact that the Dodgers have home-field advantage. Also, many expert picks predict a 6 or 7 game series. Several articles explicitly mention the Dodgers being favored to win the series. Furthermore, one article predicts the Yankees winning games 1,3 and 4 and losing games 2,5 and 6 - meaning the series will go to 7 games and also meaning that they won't win in 4 games. This suggests it is unlikely that the Yankees would sweep.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The historical base rate (17%) gives a starting point, but it includes sweeps by any team and is not specific to the Yankees.
*   The recent news articles provide strong arguments against a 4-game sweep: the series is expected to be closely contested, the Dodgers are a very good team with home-field advantage, and expert predictions lean towards longer series. 
*   I should be careful not to overreact to the single "guarantee" by Jazz Chisholm, and note that it is an outlier opinion.
*   I should be careful not to over-adjust based on the historical data. 

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force for a 4-Game Yankee Win:** The Yankees are a powerful team with high-profile players and are playing good baseball at the right time, as highlighted in the news articles.
*   **Forces Against a 4-Game Yankee Win:** The Dodgers are also a very strong team with home-field advantage, leading to the general expectation of a close, longer series. Also, the probability of winning four games in a row against a team as strong as the Dodgers is low.

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends:**

There isn't a strong trend to extrapolate here. The teams are evenly matched, and current predictions suggest a close series, but not necessarily a sweep for either side.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

The problem allows several degrees of doubt: "very unlikely", "unlikely", "possible", "likely", "very likely".

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   I need to avoid overconfidence in my base rate (which is already low), and adjust it downwards given specific info about this series.
*   I also need to avoid being too decisive and assign the odds too low, which would be an overcorrection, given that this is still a possible outcome, albeit an unlikely one.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

My errors in past forecasts are related to being overconfident in my initial estimates, so it's important to be aware of that here and lower my estimate considerably.

**Synthesis:**

The weight of evidence points strongly against the Yankees winning the World Series in exactly 4 games. While they are a strong team, so are the Dodgers, and the base rate for a 4-game sweep is relatively low, especially for a high-profile series with two strong contenders. The fact that the majority of expert predictions and news articles mention the series going to 6 or 7 games further reduces the probability of this specific outcome. The clashing causal forces, with the Dodgers having the home-field advantage and generally being considered the favorites, push the probability down further.

My prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Base Rate for a Sweep:** A team winning a best-of-seven series in exactly 4 games (a sweep) is not uncommon, but also not the most likely outcome. Historically, sweeps happen, but not frequently.  Looking at past World Series, about 20-25% of series end in a sweep. This provides a very rough initial base rate of around 20-25% that a World Series will end in a sweep. However, we are specifically looking at the Yankees winning *in* a sweep, which is more specific and probably lower likelihood than just *any* sweep.
*   **Metaculus, Polymarket, and 538:** I don't have access to real-time data from these sources for this specific question but in general they don't often provide probability for this specific resolution criteria. We'll have to rely more on the news articles and qualitative assessment of the situation.
* **Internal Calibration Data** From my internal calibration data, I know that events with probabilities assigned around 20-30% tend to occur in real life about 20-30% of the time, so that should be our starting point as an internal calibration check.

**2. Sub-Problems:**

*   **Yankees Winning:** The first sub-problem is assessing the Yankees' chances of winning the series at all. They are a strong team with a good offense (Judge, Soto) and a solid rotation (Cole, Rodon). However, the Dodgers are also a very strong team with great hitters (Ohtani, Betts, Freeman) so that lowers the probability of the Yankees just winning it all.  Most news sources suggest it is expected to be a tight series and there are very few predictions for a sweep of any kind.
*   **Winning in Exactly 4 Games:** The second, more specific sub-problem is the probability of the Yankees *sweeping*. This is less likely than just winning, as it means winning the first four games consecutively. This requires the Yankees to perform flawlessly in the first four games, not just outplaying the Dodgers overall.
*   **Home Field Advantage:** The Dodgers have home-field advantage for Games 1 and 2, and potentially Games 6 and 7. This might make the Yankees winning the first two games less likely, making a sweep less likely. The Dodgers winning at least one of the first two is quite likely (they have a 98-64 record in the regular season), so this makes an immediate Yankees sweep less likely.
*   **Momentum:** If the Yankees were to win the first 2 in Los Angeles, that would increase the chances of a sweep but that isn't the most likely case.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** The outside view is the historical base rate of sweeps mentioned above, around 20-25% overall but likely lower for a specific team sweep in this case.
*   **Inside View:** The inside view considers the specifics of these two teams. Both are strong offensively, but the Dodgers seem to have a slight edge, and have the benefit of home field. There's a lot of star power on both teams, which might lead to close, competitive games. Experts predict the series going to 6 or 7 games quite frequently in these news reports, so that further lowers the sweep likelihood.

**4. Under vs Overreacting:**
*   **Risk of Overreacting:** The media hype is high and the fact the Yanks haven't been in the WS for 15 years is a narrative that might lead one to overreact to how great the Yankees are. We need to temper that with the data about how good the Dodgers are as well. There is also a narrative of "Yankee dominance" that might cause over-reaction due to bias, when that era is past.
*  **Risk of Underreacting:** We need to pay attention to the fact that the Yankees are a good team with an offense that can explode and win games consistently. If there is a pattern in baseball, it is the power of momentum. A strong first two games could create a situation where the Yankees can win the remaining two.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Yankees Strengths:** Strong offense, solid starting pitching.
*   **Dodgers Strengths:** Strong offense, home-field advantage, good bullpen.
*   **Forces Against a Sweep:** The fact that both teams are good, that the Dodgers have home field, and that baseball games often have variance, makes a four game sweep unlikely. Many expert predictions suggest a long series (6-7 games).

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   There isn't a trend here to extrapolate, as this is the World Series, a single series.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's definitely a range of possibilities here, so we shouldn't be too precise. We can't rule out a 4 game sweep, but we know that is less likely, while we also know that a series can end up as a sweep or a 7 game series very easily.

**8. Under vs Overconfidence:**

*   We need to avoid being overconfident in either outcome and maintain a healthy skepticism. A range will help us capture that.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**

*   It's important to acknowledge that sports outcomes are inherently unpredictable, and that we need to be open to revising this prediction as new information emerges.

**Synthesis:**

The historical base rate for a sweep in the World Series is around 20-25% which is a good starting point. However, the fact this is a specific team (Yankees) winning in exactly four makes it less likely. This series is predicted to be close. The Dodgers' home-field advantage and strong team also makes a four game sweep by the Yankees relatively unlikely. After considering all these factors, I believe the likelihood of the Yankees winning the World Series in *exactly* 4 games is lower than the raw sweep rate.

**Final Prediction:**

My Prediction: Between 2.50% and 7.50%, but 4.00% being the most likely. Probability: 4.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question systematically, applying superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:**  A quick search on Metaculus shows no direct question about a 4-game sweep by the Yankees. However, there are related questions about the Yankees winning the series, which can be used as a reference point. These typically range from 20-40% range in the days leading up to the series start, suggesting they are seen as contenders but not overwhelming favorites.
*   **Betting Odds:**  The news articles indicate that the Dodgers are slight favorites, with odds around -125, and the Yankees are around +105. This translates to implied win probabilities, favouring the Dodgers slightly for the overall series win, but not a significant gap, meaning roughly 45% chance of the Yankees winning the series.
*   **Expert Predictions:**  The articles reveal varied expert opinions, with some predicting a Yankees win in 7, some a Dodgers win in 7, and some a Dodgers win in 6 games. This suggests that a 4-game sweep is considered unlikely by most.
*   **No relevant polling data** is available, such as FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**
    We can break down the question into these sub-problems:
    a) Probability of Yankees winning the series.
    b) Probability of a 4-game sweep given the Yankees win.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**  Looking at historical MLB data, 4-game sweeps in the World Series are not very common. Since 2000, there have been roughly 2-3 sweeps per decade (so maybe around 3-5% of all World Series have a 4-game sweep). The base rate probability of any team completing a sweep is thus fairly low. Considering that sweeps can go either way, we must then factor down our probability that the Yankees would be doing that sweep to closer to 1-2%.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of This Series):** This series features two very strong teams, making a sweep less probable. Both teams are packed with talent, both offensively and with starting pitchers. However, the Dodgers are a slight favourite and have the home field advantage, and the Dodgers rotation has been cited as somewhat weaker (but their bullpen is strong). In the article from yardbarker.com, the experts predicted a seven game series which included them alternating wins, including a Yankee win in Game 1. Based on this specific info, the chances of a sweep are somewhat lower than the historical base rates. Furthermore, no news articles mentioned anything to imply that the Yankees are more likely to sweep. The prevailing opinion seems to be a close 6-7 game series.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   We should be cautious of overreacting to any single article or expert prediction. The betting odds provide the most robust, real-world reflection of the teams' chances to win, while the expert opinion suggests that a sweep is unlikely.
*   We need to avoid over-adjusting due to the recent news, which are largely about the teams reaching the World Series and the upcoming schedule. There is no specific evidence that suggest the Yankees are more likely to sweep than the odds reflect.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Yankees Strengths:** They have a powerful lineup with Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, and Giancarlo Stanton, and they have very solid starting pitching. They are clearly a strong team capable of going all the way.
*   **Dodgers Strengths:** The Dodgers are a strong team with great offensive talent and home field advantage. They also have a strong bullpen, which will help with late-game situations. They are also slight favorites to win, according to betting odds.
*   **Forces Against a Sweep:** The overall strength of both teams, the length of the series and the likelihood of close games, the alternating home field advantage, and the sheer randomness that can affect baseball games all make a 4-game sweep unlikely.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   While the Yankees have momentum from winning their pennant, we shouldn't expect that to translate directly into a sweep. The series has the potential to be very close, with most experts predicting 6-7 games. We must revert to the mean and not expect any team to continue performing above expectation.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   We can express a low level of confidence in this outcome since it is a narrow prediction: that the Yankees will win *and* do it in exactly 4 games. This is a low probability event and it needs to be expressed accordingly.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

*   We must be cautious of overconfidence due to our own biases or wishful thinking about a quick Yankees win. We need to balance the possibility against the base rates and the specific context.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

*   We must be aware that predicting a sweep is particularly tricky, and we could easily make mistakes by underestimating either team's chances. We also need to avoid adjusting only based on the past, which is an imperfect guide to the future.

**Putting it Together:**
The combination of a low base rate (1-2%), and experts stating this is likely a long and hard-fought series leads me to believe the chance of a Yankees 4-game sweep is very low. The betting odds favour the Dodgers, and experts seem to be leaning toward a longer series. The chance of a team winning any 4-game sweep is low and the chances of the Yankees specifically doing this are even lower.
Therefore, while it is not impossible, it is a small probability event.

**My Prediction: Between 0.80% and 3.20%, but 1.90% being the most likely. Probability: 1.90%.**

Okay, let's analyze this question systematically, applying superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:**  A quick search on Metaculus shows no direct question about a 4-game sweep by the Yankees. However, there are related questions about the Yankees winning the series, which can be used as a reference point. These typically range from 20-40% range in the days leading up to the series start, suggesting they are seen as contenders but not overwhelming favorites.
*   **Betting Odds:**  The news articles indicate that the Dodgers are slight favorites, with odds around -125, and the Yankees are around +105. This translates to implied win probabilities, favouring the Dodgers slightly for the overall series win, but not a significant gap, meaning roughly 45% chance of the Yankees winning the series.
*   **Expert Predictions:**  The articles reveal varied expert opinions, with some predicting a Yankees win in 7, some a Dodgers win in 7, and some a Dodgers win in 6 games. This suggests that a 4-game sweep is considered unlikely by most.
*   **No relevant polling data** is available, such as FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket.
