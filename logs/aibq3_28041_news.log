**VA Hurricane Season: Forecasters Downgrade Prediction For 2024 Storms**
AccuWeather has revised its forecast for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, predicting 16 to 20 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes, and three to six major hurricanes. This is still above the historical average of 14 named storms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had previously called for 17 to 24 named storms. So far, there have been five named storms this season, with none directly hitting Virginia. However, the remnants of Beryl and Debby brought heavy rain and thunderstorms, and Ernesto kicked up rough surf. Meteorologists are monitoring six potential tropical threats that might bring impacts to the United States starting September 7. AccuWeather's lead hurricane expert, Alex DaSilva, said that the amount of dry air and Saharan dust in the Atlantic, as well as the slower-than-expected progression to a La Ni√±a pattern, has caused more wind shear in the first half of the season, slowing the formation of storms. 'Extremely warm waters across much of the Atlantic basin area ideal for tropical development and rapid intensification, but the surge of dry air, dust, wind shear, and cold waters off the coast of Africa have prevented most tropical waves from developing into a tropical storm or a hurricane,' DaSilva added. AccuWeather's chief meteorologist, Jon Porter, said, 'Should the current lull continue deeper into September, reductions in the forecast number of named storms will be needed because a longer time period in the core of the hurricane season will have been devoid of named storms.' Despite the reduction in forecast storms, it's 'already been a very impactful and destructive hurricane season,' Porter said. 'We warned that Texas, the Florida Panhandle, South Florida, and the Carolinas faced a higher-than-average risk of direct impacts this season. Three of those four areas have already verified this season,' Porter continued.

**An updated look at the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has started off with a deadly pace, with Alberto forming on June 17 and causing five deaths, and Beryl becoming the earliest Category 5 storm on record in the Atlantic basin on July 1, resulting in catastrophic damage and approximately 20 fatalities. Despite recent tropical development halting due to Saharan dust plumes and an unusually warm upper atmosphere, NOAA's final seasonal forecast calls for 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. Colorado State University's final seasonal update also predicts 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and six major hurricanes. The peak of the season is September 10, but the Atlantic can remain active well into October, emphasizing the importance of remaining prepared for the next storm. As one expert noted, 'it only takes one storm to have a devastating impact.'

**Are we done yet? An updated look at the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season**
As of September 4th, the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season has seen minimal major activity, despite predictions of an above-average season. The statistical peak of the season is September 10th, and many are wondering when the expected activity will occur. Meteorologist Jackson Chastain points to the lack of African Easterly Waves (AEWs) as a key factor in the underperforming season. Normally, AEWs form over Africa, track west, and then move off the coast where they encounter a warm and low shear environment for tropical development. However, recently, AEWs have been forming at a higher latitude and tracking west in the Sahara, where they rain out over the desert before reaching the ocean. This has resulted in fewer storms. Colorado State University's updated forecast predicts 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, but currently, there have only been 4 named storms this year. It's still too early to call it quits on the season, but there's a lot of catching up to do.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024: Projections and Expectations**
The Atlantic hurricane season 2024 is entering September, a month historically considered the most active of the year, after a relatively quiet August. So far, five named storms have formed, of which three have reached category 1 hurricane status. Despite the formation of tropical cyclones being below average for this time of year, the intensity of the systems has exceeded expectations. Projections for September suggest the formation of six named systems, including two hurricanes. According to the FOX Forecast Center, September may start quietly, but there is a disturbance in the Atlantic with moderate chances of development. Water temperatures remain above average, but have not been sufficient to cause a significant increase in cyclonic activity. Some experts believe that climate change may be influencing the weather more than recognized in meteorological projections. Research has shown a significant decrease in the number of hurricanes and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) globally, especially in the western North Pacific. However, there has also been an increase in damage related to cyclones and rapid intensification events. With 12 weeks remaining in the season, which extends until November 30, initial projections of 20-30 named storms seem increasingly difficult to meet. Historically, the most cyclones that occurred after September 1 occurred in 2020, with 15 named storms. To meet the higher projections, the season would need to average 1-2 new storms per week. The number of storms does not always have a high impact on the season, as seen in the 2022 season, which was considered almost normal, but produced the hurricane Ian, making that year the third most costly in history. The 2023 season had more storms, but had less impact.

**How does hurricane season 2024 compare to the predictions as peak nears?**
As hurricane season 2024 approaches its peak on September 10, the National Hurricane Center has identified three areas of interest in the Atlantic. Two of these areas have a moderate chance for development, while one has a low chance. The first tropical wave is located in the Caribbean Sea and has a low chance for development over the next couple of days, but conditions will be more favorable for development in the western Caribbean and southwestern Gulf of Mexico. The second tropical wave is located in the eastern Atlantic and may bring heavy rain and gusty winds to the Cabo Verde Islands. The third tropical wave is located between the west coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles and has a low chance for development. As of September 1, the 2024 season has seen five named storms, three of which reached hurricane strength with one major hurricane. According to NOAA, the season is slightly behind schedule compared to their original forecast, but ahead of schedule in terms of storm strength. If no additional development occurs before September 7, the season will be considered 'normal' for all three categories: named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes.

**Unexpected Lull Challenges Predictions For Rest Of Hurricane Season**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has taken an unexpected turn, with a lull in activity since August 12, challenging predictions of above-average activity. The reason behind this lull is an unusually warm layer of air in the upper atmosphere, increased Saharan dust, and the West African monsoon shifting northward. This pause has raised questions about our understanding of hurricane formation and forecasting. Despite the current lull, conditions remain favorable for storm development, with warm ocean temperatures. A close examination of historical data reveals a nuanced reality, with a notable increase in named storms since 1995, but no corresponding increase in hurricanes or major hurricanes. The trend of stronger storms has remained relatively flat, with 10-year averages no higher now than in the 1950s. Research shows that there's been no increase in the number of hurricanes or major hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. since 1900. However, there is an increase in the volatility of the storms, with warmer waters increasing the favorability for potential storm intensity. It's essential to maintain a balanced perspective and focus on preparedness through the remainder of the season, as the potential for extreme storms always exists.

**The 2024 hurricane season was expected to be especially bad. Why is it so quiet?**
The 2024 hurricane season was expected to be 'above-normal' with 25 named storms, 13 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes. However, over halfway through the season, only 5 named storms have formed, with 3 being hurricanes and 1 major hurricane. Accuweather meteorologist Alex DaSilva attributed the difference to dust from the Sahara Desert, cold water off the western coast of Africa, and a slow-to-develop La Ni√±a. Climate Prediction Center meteorologist Dan Harnos noted that warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic are still ideal for storm development, and La Ni√±a is expected to form between September and October, potentially fueling a strong end to the season.

**Four storms are brewing in the Atlantic as hurricane season peaks - but will any impact the US?**
Four tropical disturbances are currently being tracked across the Atlantic, although only a couple have the potential for cyclone formation. A tropical wave in the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico is producing showers and thunderstorms, and there is a medium chance that a tropical depression could form next week. This year's hurricane season has seen only five named storms, but forecasters still predict an above-average season with as many as 24 named storms. The recent lull in Atlantic hurricane activity may be due to a combination of factors, including a northward-shifted monsoon trough, atmospheric stabilization, and unfavorable subseasonal variability associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation. However, forecasters believe that large-scale conditions will become more favorable around the middle of September, indicating that the season may still pick up in its second half. Dr. Phil Klotzbach noted that the warm Atlantic, a trend towards a La Ni√±a climate pattern, and forecast low shear indicate that the season may still pick up in its second half. 'We believe that it is likely a combination of these factors (and perhaps others) that have led to this recent quiet period,' the authors said. 'We still do anticipate an above-normal season overall, however, given that large-scale conditions appear to become more favorable around the middle of September.'

**The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is incredibly weird, experts confirm**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has taken an unexpected turn, with a prolonged period of quiet activity in the Atlantic. After a strong start with Hurricane Beryl, which became the earliest-forming Category 5 in the Atlantic on record, the season has seen only three hurricanes and five total named storms to date. According to CSU researchers, this is the quietest period in the Atlantic since the advent of satellite tracking. Eric Berger, a meteorologist at Space City Weather, attributes this to a lack of rising air in the Atlantic and a northward shift in the African wave train, which is causing low-pressure systems to form farther north and outside of the most favorable area for storm formation. While the season remains in this lull, background conditions for storm generation remain, and Berger predicts a burst of activity in the Atlantic later in September and October. However, the odds of Texas being hit by a hurricane after September 24 are about 1 in 50, and the state has never been hit on record after the middle of October. 'The Atlantic hurricane season has gotten extremely quiet,' CSU researchers wrote in their report. 'The Atlantic has produced no named storm formations since Ernesto on 12 August. Only one other time in the satellite era has the Atlantic not produced any named storms between 13 August and 3 September. That other year was 1968.'

**No Tropical Storms Or Hurricanes Have Developed In The Atlantic For 3 Weeks**
It's been over three weeks since a named tropical storm or hurricane has developed in the Atlantic, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). While five low-pressure disturbances have been spotted, there is little chance that this streak will end in the next few days. Stan Goldenberg, a meteorologist for NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory, said, 'Overall, the tropics (Atlantic basin) are starting to awaken from the slumber we have had for the last few weeks.' He added that dry air is inhibiting activity, but it is expected to clear out soon. The NHC has given a 30 percent chance of development to a storm in the northwest Atlantic, labeled L99, which could acquire tropical or subtropical characteristics over the next day or two. The NOAA Climate Prediction Center's Global Tropical Hazards Outlook suggests a greater than 40 percent chance that a hurricane will develop between Sept. 11 and 17 in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. According to NOAA, the 2024 season is expected to have 17 to 24 named storms, with eight to 13 of them being hurricanes and four to seven being major hurricanes.

**The National Hurricane Center is watching four disturbances. What they could mean for NE**
The National Hurricane Center is monitoring four disturbances in the Atlantic Basin, one of which could affect the Northeast this weekend. Although it's unlikely to directly hit Massachusetts, the storm, known as 99L, is predicted to bring increasing surf and rip currents to the coastline. The National Weather Service is forecasting rain and wind for Saturday night, with precipitation amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch possible. AccuWeather's Lead Hurricane Expert, Alex DaSilva, expects the storm to land in Canada, potentially bringing strong winds and over two inches of rain to areas like New Brunswick. The National Hurricane Center is also monitoring three other areas for tropical cyclone development in the next seven days. Initially, AccuWeather predicted 20-25 hurricanes for the 2024 season, but has since revised the forecast to 20-23 hurricanes. The historical average for named storms in the Atlantic Basin from August 27 to September 30 is six, with a record of 16 named storms from September 1 to the end of the season.

**Forecasts showed an active tropics season. Why haven't we seen many named storms?**
Despite forecasts showing an active tropics season, the Atlantic has remained quiet with only five named storms developing. According to NOAA's 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season Outlook, there should be 17-25 named storms. However, several factors have contributed to the lack of activity, including high wind shear, a dip in the jet stream, and cooler waters near the equator. As a result, tropical waves have been emerging over cooler waters and have become engrossed in Saharan Dust, inhibiting tropical development. 'A more typical tropical pattern appears to return by mid-to-late September,' according to the article.

**Why have there been so few hurricanes so far in 2024?**
Despite global climate change posing a threat to human lives, natural disasters have been relatively low in 2024, with a notable exception being wildfires. However, the reason behind the small number of hurricanes so far this year is due to the Saharan Dust moving across the Atlantic Ocean, which has dried out the area and limited hurricane formation. According to Philip Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University, this is the first time in over 50 years that there have been no named storms between Aug. 12 and Sept. 3. The National Hurricane Center predicts that the peak of Atlantic hurricane season, which is Sept. 10, will bring more named storms, with NOAA's hurricane outlook predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in total, and between 8 and 13 of those expected to become hurricanes. 'The worst is still ahead,' experts warn, as the season is expected to turn a corner towards the middle of September.

**NJ Hurricane Season: Forecasters Downgrade Prediction For 2024 Storms**
Forecasters have downgraded the prediction for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, expecting 16 to 20 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes, and three to six major hurricanes. This is still above the historical average of 14 named storms. The reduction in forecast storms is due to a 'lull' in tropical activity in the Atlantic basin during an 'unusual August'. Accuweather's lead hurricane expert, Alex DaSilva, said that the amount of dry air and Saharan dust in the Atlantic, as well as the slower-than-expected progression to a La Ni√±a pattern, has caused more wind shear in the first half of the season, slowing the formation of storms. Despite the reduction in forecast storms, the season has already been 'very impactful and destructive', with several major records broken, including the earliest major hurricane on record to form east of the Lesser Antilles in June. Jon Porter, Accuweather chief meteorologist, said, 'Should the current lull continue deeper into September, reductions in the forecast number of named storms will be needed because a longer time period in the core of the hurricane season will have been devoid of named storms.'

**Why there have been so few hurricanes this year as peak season approaches**
The Atlantic hurricane season has been quiet so far, with no named storm formations since Ernesto on Aug. 12. According to Philip Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University, this is the first time since 1968 that there have been no named storm formations between Aug. 13 and Sept. 3. The National Hurricane Center states that the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is Sept. 10, and historically, about two-thirds of all storm activity occurs between Aug. 20 and Oct. 10. Scientists attribute the lack of storm systems to the Saharan Dust moving across the Atlantic Ocean, which has been more intense and widespread in nature. Ed Nowottnick, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said, 'The timing and location of any dust plumes and large areas of dry air play a big role in tropical development.' However, dust levels are trending down, and experts predict that conditions will become more favorable for tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic Basin towards the middle of the month. Currently, three tropical disturbances are being monitored, but they all have a low chance of development over the next seven days. NOAA's Climate Prediction Center's long-range Global Tropical Hazards Outlook calls for a slight to moderate chance of new tropical development over the Central Atlantic Ocean in mid-September. According to NOAA's hurricane outlook for the 2024 season, there will be 17 to 24 named storms, with eight to 13 of them becoming hurricanes, and four to seven of those reaching major hurricane strength.

**September 10th: The Peak Day of the Atlantic Hurricane Season**
September 10th is considered the peak day of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 87% of category 1 and 2 hurricanes and 96% of intense hurricanes (categories 3, 4, and 5) occur between mid-August and mid-October. However, it is around September 10th that these weather phenomena find the perfect conditions to intensify. The explanation behind this peak day lies in the interaction of key climate factors, including the weakening of winds in the upper atmosphere and the warming of ocean waters. As a result, the 10th of September represents the statistical climax of the hurricane season, with around 95 tropical storms and 55 hurricanes forming on this day over the past 100 years. This phenomenon is short-lived, as the arrival of autumn in October brings a change, with winds in the upper atmosphere strengthening and ocean temperatures decreasing, making it more difficult for powerful storms to form.

**US weather forecast: Three hurricanes to hit USA soon? Details here**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring three potential tropical threats in the central Atlantic Ocean, eastern Atlantic Ocean, and Caribbean Sea. However, weather pundits in the US have assured that there won't be any concern for the next seven days. According to Colorado State University's forecasters, tropical storm activity in the first week of September will likely be below average, but conditions will become more conducive for tropical cyclone activity towards the middle of September. The forecasters still predict an above-average Atlantic hurricane season with six major hurricanes. 'With the exception of the western Caribbean and southern Gulf of Mexico, large scale environmental conditions look relatively unfavorable for the next (approximately) 7 days but look to get more conducive for tropical cyclone activity towards the middle of September,' the meteorologists wrote. The Atlantic hurricane season 2024 is nearing its peak.

**Colorado State University says next 2 weeks will be below average for tropical development**
Researchers at Colorado State University predict a 60% likelihood of below-average tropical activity for the next two weeks, citing hostile conditions in the atmosphere. However, they still expect a busy Atlantic hurricane season, with 23 named storms, 12 of which could reach hurricane strength and six that could become major hurricanes. Meteorologist Noah Bergren noted that historically, about 60-65% of all activity remains after September 4th, regardless of La Ni√±a or El Ni√±o. Bergren emphasized that it's essential not to let our guard down, even if the season has been relatively quiet so far. 'This is due to multiple hostile conditions in the atmosphere limiting tropical genesis,' explained Bergren. 'Too much dry air in the eastern Atlantic, too much sinking air over the basin broadly, and too warm of air high up in the atmosphere limiting the ability for deep thunderstorms to even form over the ocean to start the process of a tropical system.'

**Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024: Projections and Expectations**
The Atlantic hurricane season 2024 is entering September, a month historically considered the most active of the year, after a relatively quiet August. So far, five named storms have formed, of which three have reached category 1 hurricane status. Despite the formation of tropical cyclones being below average for this time of year, the intensity of the systems has exceeded expectations. Projections for September suggest the formation of six named systems, including two hurricanes. According to the FOX Forecast Center, September may start quietly, but there is a disturbance in the Atlantic with moderate chances of development. Water temperatures remain above average, but have not been sufficient to cause a significant increase in cyclonic activity.

As hurricane season 2024 approaches its peak on September 10, the National Hurricane Center has identified three areas of interest in the Atlantic. Two of these areas have a moderate chance for development, while one has a low chance. The first tropical wave is located in the Caribbean Sea and has a low chance for development over the next couple of days, but conditions will be more favorable for development in the western Caribbean and southwestern Gulf of Mexico. The second tropical wave is located in the eastern Atlantic and may bring heavy rain and gusty winds to the Cabo Verde Islands. The third tropical wave is located between the west coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles and has a low chance for development. As of September 1, the 2024 season has seen five named storms, three of which reached hurricane strength with one major hurricane. According to NOAA, the season is slightly behind schedule compared to their original forecast, but ahead of schedule in terms of storm strength. If no additional development occurs before September 7, the season will be considered 'normal' for all three categories: named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes.

**Colorado State University says forecast for the Atlantic should remain quiet next 2 weeks**
Researchers at Colorado State University released their updated forecast for the Atlantic Hurricane Season, stating that the next two weeks should remain relatively quiet. Although the forecast for the season remains at an above-normal level of activity, with 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes expected, the next two weeks are forecasted to be below normal. According to CSU, 'it only takes one storm to devastate a community,' and they emphasize that the quiet period is not a guarantee of an inactive season. The National Weather Service defines a major hurricane as a Category 3 or above or a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 111 mph and higher. CSU has issued its next two-week forecast for 2024 Atlantic hurricane activity, favoring below-normal activity (60% chance) relative to normal (30%) and above normal (10%).

**The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season keeps underperforming expectations**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is underperforming expectations, despite record-warm ocean temperatures and a favorable La Ni√±a climate cycle. Computer models initially predicted multiple storms forming in the next two weeks, but have since shown conflicting results. The National Hurricane Center is giving two areas a 40% chance of developing into tropical cyclones in the next 7 days. Some hurricane experts, such as Michael Lowry, believe that the season may still pick up in the latter half, while others, like Sam Lillo, think that the outlooks for the season may be a 'bust of historic proportions.' The African Monsoon and Intertropical Convergence Zone are located north of their typical position, causing tropical storms to move over colder waters and collapse. Additionally, unusually warm air at high altitudes and an anomalously high amount of dry air are hindering storm development. Meteorologists and climate scientists are debating the causes of these factors, including the potential impact of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai undersea volcano eruption in 2022. As Jim Kossin notes, the ongoing lull shows the limits of seasonal storm forecasting, and it is increasingly unlikely that the forecasts will verify.

**Anything to watch in the tropics? Peak of season ahead**
The Atlantic hurricane season is reaching its peak on September 10, but forecasters do not expect any named storms to form in the next week. This is unexpected given the predicted supercharged 2024 Atlantic hurricane season and record-warm tropical seas. According to NOAA's hurricane season outlook, there should be 17-24 named storms before the season ends. However, so far in 2024, there have been only five named storms, and the Atlantic basin is running behind climatology. Despite this, there have been three hurricanes this season, including Beryl, which peaked as a Category 5 on July 1, the earliest Category 5 in the Atlantic on record. A tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic has a 40% chance of becoming a depression in the next week, and another disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico has a 10% chance. The National Weather Service is keeping a close eye on these systems, but for now, there is no cause for concern along the coasts.

**Hurricane season 2024: After a quiet August, could Delaware face 'supercharged September'**
After a quiet August, AccuWeather hurricane experts are predicting a busy September with 20-23 named storms, down from their initial forecast of 20-25. According to AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter, the reason for the reduction is the long lull in recent weeks with no named storms during a typically active time. However, conditions are expected to change in September with less wind shear, dry air, and near-record levels of Sahara dust clearing out. This could lead to a 'supercharged September' with six to 10 named storms through September 30. AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva warns that the Atlantic basin could be incredibly active, with multiple tropical storms and hurricanes developing on the same day. The statistical peak of the hurricane season is September 10. 'We could see a parade of storms developing during the month of September,' said DaSilva. 'There's a possibility that we could see multiple tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic basin on the same day, similar to the frequency of storms that we've seen during other supercharged hurricane seasons like 2020.'

**3 new Atlantic storm systems may become tropical depressions. Could one affect NC?**
The National Hurricane Center is monitoring three disturbances in the Atlantic that could develop into tropical depressions over the next week. The first system is located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and has a 20% chance of developing into a depression. The second system is in the central tropical Atlantic and has a 40% chance of becoming a tropical depression. The third system is in the eastern tropical Atlantic and has a 20% chance of developing into a depression. Forecasters say it's too early to tell if any of these systems will develop into a threat for North Carolina or the Atlantic coast. The 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season is expected to be exceptionally busy, with up to 25 named storms, including 7-8 major hurricanes. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a La Ni√±a is likely to form between September and November, which could lead to a more severe hurricane season. 'Warm water is a major contributing factor in the development of tropical storms,' said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The next named storm in the Atlantic would be called Francine.

**AccuWeather is changing their hurricane forecast for this year. It's good news.**
AccuWeather has revised its hurricane forecast for the 2024 season, reducing the predicted number of hurricanes from 20-25 to 20-23. According to AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter, the reason for this change is the recent lull in hurricane activity, which has been a 'long lull' in a typically active time of the season. The National Hurricane Center is currently tracking two tropical disturbances with a low chance for development. Historically, the record number of named storms in the Atlantic basin from September 1 to the end of the season is 16, and the average for the same time period is six. AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva explained that favorable conditions, including warm oceans and less Saharan dust, could lead to more storm formation. Several regions along the East Coast could face an elevated risk for flash flooding if another tropical storm or hurricane impacts the area in September.

**Where Are The Atlantic Hurricanes? Experts Puzzled By Lack Of Storms**
The 2024 hurricane season is taking an unexpected turn, with more storms forming in the Pacific than in the Atlantic. As of now, three storms are spinning in the Pacific, while the Atlantic has been unusually calm. According to Phil Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, 'It is quiet out there.' The last time the Atlantic went without a named storm from August 21 to September 2 was in 1997. Meteorologist Ryan Maue suggested that the Atlantic tropics are 'broken' for now, due to cool ocean temperatures that are not suitable for storm formation. In contrast, the eastern and central Pacific basins have seen nine named storms, including three hurricanes. This is not what the experts predicted, with forecasts pointing to a very active season in the Atlantic and a below-normal season in the eastern Pacific.

**National Hurricane Center tracking 2 tropical disturbances. See Florida impact for Labor Day**
The National Hurricane Center is tracking two tropical disturbances in the Atlantic basin, with a low chance of development. According to AccuWeather, there could be a 'parade of storms' in the Atlantic basin, with six to 10 tropical systems predicted for September. The next named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be Francine. A tropical disturbance in the eastern Atlantic is expected to consolidate over the Labor Day weekend, but it's too early to determine if there will be any impact to Florida or the U.S. Residents are urged to continue monitoring the tropics and to always be prepared, as the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be very active. The Florida tax holiday for hurricane supplies continues until Sept. 6, with eligible items including portable generators, tarps, and smoke detectors. 'I think things could get very active potentially very quickly here as soon as that dry air ‚Äî Saharan dust ‚Äî goes away,' said AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva. 'We could see a parade of storms. This dramatic increase in activity will start at the end of August and persist throughout September.'

**Bryan Norcross: A potential disturbance to watch and what's going on with hurricane season 2024?**
Bryan Norcross discusses the current state of hurricane season 2024, which has been above-average in terms of the number of hurricanes and Category 3-plus storms. However, the number of named storms is on schedule, but the National Hurricane Center's forecast suggests that the season may fall behind if no new storms form. Norcross notes that the strong consensus of hurricane season forecasts predicted a 'rip-roaring' season, but something is going on that is different from what was anticipated. He suggests that it may be a combination of multiple independent meteorological and oceanographic features working together to inhibit development. Factors that could be contributing to the suppressed activity include the Saharan dust, colder ocean water off Africa, and an unusually warm upper atmosphere over the Atlantic. Additionally, the polar vortex and the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption in 2022 may also be playing a role. Despite this, the odds still favor hurricanes developing in September and October, intensifying more quickly than average due to the warm ocean, and ending up stronger.

**HURRICANE SEASON PEAKS! STAY ALERT!**
The 2024 hurricane season is now in its peak and most dangerous period, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency has reinforced its earlier outlook for an abnormally active hurricane season, with a 90% chance of above-normal activity. NOAA head Rick Spinrad said, 'The hurricane season got off to an early and violent start with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category-5 Atlantic hurricane on record.' The updated 2024 outlook calls for 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. Weather experts warn that the 2024 season has already seen significant storm activity and that these early storms have set the stage for what could be a particularly devastating season. Disaster management experts emphasize the importance of preparedness as the season moves deeper into its peak period, which is expected to become active again by early-mid September.

**AccuWeather predicts ‚Äòdramatic surge' in storms to close hurricane season**
AccuWeather predicts a 'dramatic surge' in severe storms in the Atlantic Ocean in September, with potentially 6 to 10 tropical storms. This would be similar to the record-breaking 2020 hurricane season. According to AccuWeather's lead hurricane expert, Alex DaSilva, a shift in weather patterns would push out dry air, leading to a 'parade of storms.' The Atlantic hurricane season peaks on September 10, and plentiful warm water could fuel tropical storms and hurricanes into the fall. The areas at the highest risk from tropical storms are the Texas coast, Florida, and the Carolinas, but the danger can extend far beyond where a storm makes landfall. AccuWeather is predicting a total of 20 to 25 named storms in the Atlantic by the end of 2024, well above the historical average of 14.

**Calm before the storms: The peak of a busy hurricane season is near**
The Atlantic hurricane season is rapidly approaching its peak, with most activity expected between mid-August and mid-October. According to the National Hurricane Center, a typical season yields 14 named storms, of which seven become hurricanes and three become major hurricanes. However, this year's forecast is expected to be very active, with 17 to 24 named storms, including eight to 13 hurricanes and four to seven major hurricanes. NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said, 'The hurricane season got off to an early and violent start with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record.' Atmospheric and oceanic conditions indicate an above-normal 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, with a 90% probability. The primary threat-formation area for major hurricanes in late August is the eastern and central tropical Atlantic. Surface water temperatures of 80 degrees and above are the perfect fuel for developing hurricanes, and water temperatures peak in September and October. 'NOAA's update to the hurricane seasonal outlook is an important reminder that the peak of hurricane season is right around the corner,' said Spinrad.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024: Experts Warn of Extreme Activity**
As the tropical activity in the Pacific Ocean intensifies, the Atlantic hurricane season is heading towards its usual peak of activity. Currently, conditions seem calm. According to Jack Beven, a hurricane expert at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in the US, 'no tropical cyclones are expected to form in the next seven days', he told USA Today. However, meteorologists anticipate an intense hurricane season. The CSU hurricane forecasting team told USA Today that 'signals point to a period of increased tropical activity. Large-scale environmental conditions are becoming more favorable for tropical cyclone activity by late August'. Additionally, computer models suggest several potential areas for tropical cyclone formation by late August and early September. AccuWeather meteorologists have been more specific in their predictions, stating that 'Alex DaSilva and the team of expert meteorologists predict between 6 and 10 named storms from August 27 to September 30'. This prediction suggests increased vigilance and preparation for vulnerable communities in affected regions. At the federal level, forecasts also point to an extraordinary season. Federal meteorologists have predicted a possible formation of up to 24 named storms, including the five that have already formed, according to NHC. According to meteorological records dating back to 1991 to 2020, a typical season presents 14 named storms. The NOAA announced earlier this month that this season could 'be among the most active on record'. Although they slightly reduced the number of named storms, the scientific agency increased the probability of an above-normal season to 90%. The probability of tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic central from August 28 to September 3 is high, with at least a 60% chance of formation during that period.

**Atlantic hurricane season to bring 6 to 10 named storms during ‚Äòsupercharged September'**
AccuWeather forecasts a surge in tropical storms this September, with six to 10 named systems expected to form, rivaling the record-breaking activity of 2020. Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said, 'I think things could get very active potentially very quickly here as soon as that dry air goes away.' The favorable conditions, including extremely warm water temperatures and less dry air, could lead to a storm organizing every few days. The main concern of landfall lies with the Texas Coast, Florida, and the Carolinas, but AccuWeather warns that impacts could extend beyond the point of impact. Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter warned that areas along the East Coast could be prone to an elevated risk of flash flooding in September. Even if certain storms fail to make landfall, they still pose a threat, with many years seeing at least one named storm stay hundreds of miles offshore, creating dangerous rough surf and deadly rip currents. AccuWeather has been warning of an 'explosive' Atlantic hurricane season since March, with expert meteorologists calling for 20 to 25 named storms and four to six direct impacts with the U.S. in 2024.

**Supercharged September: Atlantic hurricane season to intensify dramatically**
The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to intensify dramatically in September, with a surge of hurricanes and tropical storms predicted to form across the Atlantic Ocean. According to AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva, 'things could get very active potentially very quickly here as soon as that dry air goes away,' with a 'parade of storms' possible. Between six and 10 tropical systems are predicted for September, similar to the record-breaking 2020 hurricane season. The climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is Sept. 10, but warm water temperatures could fuel plenty of tropical storms and hurricanes heading into autumn. DaSilva warned that Florida, the Carolinas, and Texas are at an elevated risk of a landfalling tropical storm or hurricane, and the danger will extend far beyond where a storm makes landfall. AccuWeather is predicting a total of 20 to 25 named storms across the Atlantic basin by the end of 2024, well above the historical average of 14.

**Tropical Update: Did the predicted ‚Äòintense' hurricane season turn out to be less severe than expected?**
The 2024 hurricane season was predicted to be 'explosive' and 'hyperactive', but so far, it has been less severe than expected. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the season's accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) was primarily generated by major hurricane Beryl, which reached category 5 status. Despite the Atlantic basin being 'primed' for storms, the season has been slow, with one reason being the dry, dusty air in the region off Africa. The Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) has been displaced north, which is typically where it resides. Model guidance suggests that the ITCZ could trend south through September, aligning with the peak of hurricane season. The Climate Prediction Center has given a high chance for tropical development during the first week of September.

The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be above average, according to forecasts from NOAA and CSU. As of mid-August, 5 named storms have formed, with 3 reaching hurricane status. The strongest storm so far was Category 5 hurricane Beryl, which caused significant damage in the Caribbean and Texas. NOAA predicts a 90% chance of an above-normal season, with 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. CSU forecasts a very active season, with 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes. The official peak of hurricane season is September 10, and the season will run until November 30. Experts attribute the above-average forecasts to warm sea surface temperatures, a cool ENSO Neutral or La Ni√±a, and an above-average west African monsoon season.

**New York State Residents Should Prepare Now For More Hurricanes**
New York officials warn residents to prepare for more hurricanes this summer, following the destruction caused by the remnants of Hurricane Debby. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be above-normal, with 17 to 25 named storms, 8 to 13 of which will likely become hurricanes. Four to six of these storms may 'reach major hurricane' status, with at least Category 3 ranking. NOAA's prediction suggests that New York State may deal with more hurricanes than normal this year. Officials advise residents to prepare for the possibility of evacuations and to stock up on essential items, such as food, water, and medical supplies. The 2024 hurricane season lasts until November, and residents are urged to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.

**Hurricane Season 2024: What to Expect for the Rest of the Year**
According to the Atlas Climatol√≥gico de Ciclones Tropicales en M√©xico, the months of July, August, and September are the ones that present the highest number of tropical cyclones. As of now, and according to the models, there are still at least 19 out of the 23 predicted cyclones for the Atlantic that have yet to occur, with 10 of them expected to be hurricanes. In the Pacific, the Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional (SMN) calculated the formation of between 15 and 18 tropical cyclones, with 6 already formed, but only one, Carlotta, reaching hurricane status with a maximum category of 2. It is predicted that there will be the formation of between 3 and 4 more hurricanes in the coming months, with none expected to exceed category 2. The Centro Nacional de Prevenci√≥n de Desastres (CENAPRED) has detected that September is the month with the highest number of cyclones that directly affect the coasts of Mexico.

NOAA's lead hurricane seasonal forecaster, Matt Rosencrans, said 'August through November will be busier than normal' and 'there's a distinct possibility of elevated activity into November.' Residents are advised to prepare for the entirety of hurricane season, which ends on November 30. Rosencrans said 'don't wait until Sept. 1, prepare right now as if a storm could happen next week.' The current tropical wave approaching the Caribbean Sea has a 60% chance of development, and conditions are expected to become more conducive for development in the coming days. The Storm Prediction Center has set the chances of tropical development at 40-60% over the next two weeks. La Ni√±a is also expected to develop from September to November, which typically increases Atlantic hurricane activity.

**NOAA updates hurricane forecast as peak of Atlantic season approaches**
NOAA has updated its hurricane forecast for the remainder of the 2024 season, predicting an 'extremely active' Atlantic hurricane season. The Climate Prediction Center's latest outlook calls for between 17 and 24 named storms, with 8-13 becoming hurricanes and 4-7 major hurricanes. This is a slight decrease from the initial forecast of 17-25 named storms. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September 10, and hurricane season runs through November 30. According to Matthew Rosencrans, Lead Hurricane Season Forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, 'Hurricane Beryl broke multiple long-standing records in the Atlantic basin, and we're continuing to see the climatological hallmarks of an active season.' Sea surface temperatures remain abnormally high, and La Ni√±a is expected to emerge during the hurricane season, making it essential to prepare now.

**Number of Atlantic tropical storms forecast for 2024 lowered slightly; Season still ‚Äòextremely active'**
The 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season is expected to be 'extremely active' with 23 named storms, including 12 hurricanes and 6 major hurricanes, according to the latest forecast by Colorado State University. The update dropped the number of named storms from 25 to 23, citing the formation of La Ni√±a during the peak of hurricane season, which will lead to less vertical wind shear and allow storms to intensify. The season has already seen rapid intensification, with a rare Category 5 hurricane in Beryl, which rapidly intensified from a Tropical Depression to a Category 5 storm in just 24 hours. Hurricane Debby made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 storm, bringing heavy rainfall and flash flooding. Meteorologists and officials are on edge due to concerns of rapid intensification in the Gulf, following the example set by Beryl. 'This year has already seen this forecast come to life with a rare Category 5 hurricane in Beryl,' said the article, highlighting the unpredictability of the season.
