**US Confirms 9 Human Cases of H5N1 Avian Influenza**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States have confirmed nine human cases of H5N1 avian influenza infection in Colorado. The cases involve workers who were exposed to infected poultry at a farm where an outbreak of H5N1 virus had occurred. The virus is transmitted from birds to humans and can cause mild illness, with symptoms including conjunctivitis, eye discharge, and typical flu symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, sore throat, and runny nose. The CDC states that the risk to the general population remains low, and recommends taking precautions when exposed to infected animals. This is the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza reported in the US since 2022, and the total number of human cases since 2022 is around 10.

**US Avian Influenza Outbreak: A Growing Concern for Human Health**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported cases of avian influenza H5 in wild and domestic birds, as well as commercial and recreational poultry, since January 2022. Over 97 million birds have been affected, with 1,161 outbreaks detected in 48 states. The virus has also infected cattle, with the first cases reported in Texas in March. The CDC has stated that the risk to the US population remains 'low'. A fourth person, in Colorado, has been infected with avian influenza in relation to an outbreak in cattle, according to health authorities. The CDC has emphasized the importance of monitoring and testing for the virus, as well as developing vaccines and treatments. Experts are concerned that the current surveillance efforts may not be sufficient to detect new outbreaks, and that the virus could potentially spread to humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low, but that it is essential to be prepared for a potential pandemic. The US and Europe are stockpiling doses of pre-pandemic flu vaccine, and some countries are taking measures to protect their populations, such as vaccinating workers in the poultry industry.

**CDC Confirms Three Additional Human Cases of Avian Influenza H5 in Colorado**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed three additional cases of human infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) virus in workers at a poultry farm in Weld County, Colorado. The cases occurred in people who were working directly with infected birds at a commercial egg-laying operation that had reported an outbreak of avian influenza H5 among birds. The three people have mild illness and have been offered the antiviral medication oseltamivir for treatment. State and local officials are continuing to monitor poultry workers at farms with infected birds. This is a different farm in Colorado from the one where the CDC confirmed two additional human cases of avian influenza H5 on July 19, bringing the total number of cases associated with that farm to six. With the addition of these three new confirmed cases, the total number of human cases associated with the current outbreaks in poultry in Colorado is nine. The CDC has sent a multidisciplinary and bilingual field team to support the response in Colorado to the current outbreaks of avian influenza H5 in poultry in the state. The confirmation of these three additional cases brings the total number of human cases of avian influenza H5 reported in the United States since April 2024 to 13. Before 2024, the only previous case of human infection with avian influenza H5N1 reported in the United States was in a poultry worker in Colorado in April 2022. Counting that case, there have been 14 total human cases of avian influenza H5 in the United States since 2022. According to available data, the CDC's current estimate is that the risk of avian influenza H5N1 to the general public remains low. As we learn more, we will continue to evaluate the situation and provide updates. These preliminary results again highlight the risk of exposure to infected animals. There are no signs of unexpected increases in influenza activity in Colorado or other states affected by outbreaks of avian influenza H5 in cattle and poultry. Human infections with this new virus are concerning due to its potential to cause severe and widespread disease. To date, we have not seen genetic changes in the virus that would make it more likely to transmit between humans, but we are closely monitoring it. CDC recommendations related to the H5 virus have not changed at this time. The findings of the investigation will inform whether changes are needed to guidelines. The investigation will include reviewing compliance with the recommended use of personal protective equipment. Historically, most human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses have occurred in people who were not using recommended personal protective equipment. An analysis of the virus sequences from this outbreak will also be important to determine if it justifies a change in the risk estimate. CDC recommendations include avoiding exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, domestic birds, other domesticated animals, and other wild or domestic animals (including cattle). People should also avoid exposure to animal waste, bedding, unpasteurized milk, or other materials that have come into contact with birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed infection with the A(H5N1) virus, or areas where they have been. The CDC has provisional recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of infections with the A(H5N1) virus in people. The CDC also has updated recommendations for protecting workers and the use of personal protective equipment. Following these recommendations is essential to reduce the risk to people and contain the general public health risk.

**US Confirms Four Cases of Avian Influenza A(H5) Among Poultry Workers**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States have confirmed four cases of high-pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5) infection among workers at a poultry processing plant. The outbreak was identified at a company where an H5N1 virus epidemic had already occurred, which circulates among wild birds and has infected dairy cattle in several US states. The CDC stated that the four confirmed cases include three previously reported suspected cases and one recently identified case, and a fifth suspected case is currently being confirmed. The agency warned that further cases may be reported and subsequently confirmed, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring. The EU has closed a large contract for a pre-pandemic vaccine to combat avian influenza. The symptoms of the virus include mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis, eye discharge, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, and runny nose. The CDC considers the risk to the general population to be low, but high for those exposed to infected animals. The agency recommends the use of adequate protective measures for those working with poultry and cattle. The first human case in Mexico was reported in early June.

**US Confirms Four Cases of Highly Pathogenic Bird Flu A(H5) in Colorado**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed four cases of highly pathogenic bird flu A(H5) in Colorado, USA, with another suspected case pending confirmation. All affected individuals are workers at a poultry farm with a confirmed H5N1 outbreak, who were involved in the culling of the bird population. The CDC reported mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis and runny eyes, as well as typical flu symptoms like fever, chills, cough, sore throat, and runny nose. The CDC stated that further cases may be detected as surveillance and testing continue. This is the first reported case of H5N1 in humans in the USA since a longer period of calm, with the first human case registered in the spring of 2022. In recent weeks and months, several workers have also been infected with bird flu after contact with dairy cattle. The total number of bird flu cases in humans in the USA this year has risen to eight. The CDC has not provided information on the size of the affected business and the number of people employed there. It is also unclear whether the infected individuals were isolated, how their contacts were handled, and whether antiviral medications were used. The CDC continues to emphasize that the risk to the general population is low. A nine-member CDC team is currently on site in Colorado, including epidemiologists, veterinarians, and hygiene experts.

**CDC Reports Fourth Case of Avian Influenza A(H5) in Human in the United States**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified a fourth case of human infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) virus in the United States, in the state of Colorado. This is the first case in Colorado and part of a multi-state outbreak in cattle farms. The person, who works on a dairy farm where the virus was detected in cows, reported only eye symptoms, received oseltamivir treatment, and has recovered. The CDC is closely monitoring influenza surveillance, particularly in affected states, and has not detected any unusual influenza activity in people. The agency considers the risk of avian influenza H5N1 to the general public in the US to be low. However, this event highlights the importance of recommended precautions for people exposed to infected animals. People with close or prolonged exposure, without protection, to birds or other animals infected with the virus, or to contaminated environments, are at higher risk of infection. The CDC has provided provisional recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of A(H5N1) infections in people, as well as updated guidance on worker protection and personal protective equipment (PPE) use.

**Second Human Case of Bird Flu Reported in the US**
A new case of H5N1 bird flu has been reported in a person in the US. The first case was reported on March 25, 2024, and it affected at least 33 farms in eight states. Two farm workers in Texas and Michigan were infected with the virus. Despite the second human case, officials remain optimistic. The CDC has assessed the risk to the public as 'low', but more cases are expected. The CDC has warned that similar human cases may be detected due to high virus levels in milk from infected cows and the virus's spread among cows. A cat in a farm in the US died after drinking raw milk. The first human case of bird flu was reported in Australia. A child infected with the virus in India was treated in Australia and has fully recovered.
