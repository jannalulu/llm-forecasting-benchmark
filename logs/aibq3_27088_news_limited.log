**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate for US Presidential Election**
US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, has announced that she has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the November elections. 'I asked Tim Walz to be my running mate,' she said on X. Walz, 60, has been governor of Minnesota since 2019 and was re-elected in 2022. He previously served in the US House of Representatives for 12 years and in the National Guard from 1981 to 2005, retiring as a sergeant-major. According to US media, Walz is a progressive Democrat and has signed laws to protect abortion rights, legalize marijuana, and restrict gun sales. He often criticizes the Republican Party and its presidential candidate Donald Trump, calling them 'crazy'. Walz has condemned Russia's special military operation and initially banned Minnesota investments in Russia and Belarus, as well as any contracts with these countries. He also participated in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in April 2023, expressing support for Kiev. Walz condemned the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the murder of border community residents and the capture of over 240 hostages. He called for humanitarian aid to Gaza. If Harris wins the election, Walz will have to resign as governor, and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan will take over until the end of his term in 2026.

**Kamala Harris Announces Tim Walz as Running Mate for 2024 US Presidential Election**
Kamala Harris, the current Vice President of the United States and Democratic presidential candidate, announced that Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, will be her running mate and will aspire to the Vice Presidency of the United States. 'I am proud to announce that I have asked Tim Walz to be my running mate,' Harris wrote on X. 'As a governor, coach, teacher, and veteran, he has worked for working-class families like his own.' Harris assured that it will be 'fantastic' to have Walz on her team and added that they will 'get to work' on the presidential campaign. Walz, 60 years old, is a former soldier, teacher, father, and politician preferred by the most progressive factions of the Democratic Party. He was born in a rural community in Nebraska and enlisted in the National Guard as a private to pay for his higher education, a path used by the middle class in the United States. As a teacher, Walz taught at a school, where he met his wife Gwen Wipple, with whom he later moved to Minnesota to continue his work as a high school teacher of Geography and football coach, achieving his team's state championship in 1999. During his years as an educator, Walz taught in China and with his wife organized study trips for adolescents to the Asian country. In 2006, he decided to run for a seat in Congress and managed to renew the confidence of his voters for 12 years, during which he was a member of the Agriculture and Veterans Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives. In 2018, he was elected governor of Minnesota, a state that has voted for the Democratic Party in the last general elections, but whose rural population is predominantly Republican and conservative. In 2022, he was re-elected for another four-year term. Senator Bernie Sanders publicly expressed his support for Walz two days before Kamala Harris confirmed him as the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate. Additionally, Sanders indicated that the Minnesota governor was one of the party's favorites to accompany the current vice president. Walz has boasted of having achieved during his time as governor free lunches for Minnesota students, protections for women's reproductive rights, tax cuts for the middle class, and improvements to benefits for medical and parental leave. The governor is an unusual politician also for his presence on social media, where, for example, he gives advice on his vehicle's fuses and continues: 'Another pro tip: get out and vote.' Walz, nicknamed by some as the 'Father of America,' has also had other standout moments, such as when he presented new regulations for not texting while driving with his daughter Hope, which became a sensation on social media.

**Tim Walz Chosen as Kamala Harris' Running Mate in 2024 Presidential Election**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a 60-year-old father of two, has been chosen by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, to be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election. Walz, who has been married to his teacher wife Gwen since 1994, joins the presidential race as a victory for the progressive left in the Democratic Party, which was concerned about the support of other candidates for Israel. After growing up in a small town in Nebraska, Walz began his career as a teacher, first in China and then in classrooms in Nebraska and Minnesota. He supports the right to abortion and has signed orders for free school meals, recreational marijuana, and voting rights for former prisoners. Walz, a former teacher, is credited with starting the trend of calling Republicans 'strange', a phenomenon that has taken over the campaign since President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race. The duo is expected to be officially chosen as the presidential and vice presidential candidates at the Democratic National Convention, which will begin on August 19 in Chicago. Harris secured enough delegate support in just two days after Biden's announcement of his withdrawal from the presidential race. Walz will join Harris on Tuesday evening during their first campaign stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They will then head to seven swing states over the next five days, including Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Nevada, and Arizona.

**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate**
Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for the US presidential election on November 5, 2024, has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. Harris announced on social media X, 'I'm proud to announce that I've asked Tim Walz to be my running mate.' Walz, a football coach and teacher, has been criticized by the opposition for his support of abortion rights and his commitment to making Minnesota a refuge for women seeking assisted abortion. The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has accused Walz of being a 'dangerous left-wing radical', citing his support for a carbon-neutral agenda and restrictive emissions standards for gas-powered cars. In contrast, former President Barack Obama has praised Walz as a 'great partner' for Harris, highlighting his experience and values as a governor, teacher, and veteran. Walz has committed to protecting abortion rights, implementing family assistance programs, and implementing gun safety measures with common sense.
