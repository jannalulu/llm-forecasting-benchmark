**Fed under pressure to cut rates as market turmoil continues**
The US Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates as the global stock sell-off continues. Some analysts are calling for an emergency rate cut before the September rate decision, citing concerns that the US may be entering a recession. Bank of America economists have written that a September rate cut is 'a virtual lock', while Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel is calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut. Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has also expressed support for an emergency cut, saying 'Real case for an emergency cut soon.' The market's concerns are underscored by the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiking to a high not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.6 percent, while the S&P 500 fell three percent and the Nasdaq closed down more than 3.4 percent.

**US Federal Reserve under pressure to cut rates as market turmoil continues**
The US Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates as the global stock sell-off continues. Some analysts are calling for an emergency rate cut before the September rate decision, citing the recent below-target US jobs report and fears of a recession. Bank of America economists say a September rate cut is 'a virtual lock,' while Wharton School professor emeritus Jeremy Siegel is calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut. However, others, such as Goldman Sachs economists, are urging caution and saying it's a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report. The Fed's decision will be closely watched, especially with the US presidential election in November, as any rate cut before then could thrust the Fed into the middle of the campaign.

**Stock market woes will not trigger emergency rate cut by Fed**
The Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates before their September meeting, despite the ongoing stock market rout, according to Fed watchers. However, the Fed is expected to cut rates significantly more before year-end than previously anticipated. Patrick Horan, a macroeconomist, said, 'A stock market drop, by itself, is not enough to justify a rate cut.' Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, warned of a risk of labor market conditions deteriorating before rate cuts are approved. The odds of the Fed cutting rates by 50 basis points by September are at about 84%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Before 2024-end, about 60% of the futures market now sees reductions totaling 125 basis points. Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist with JonesTrading, said, 'For an emergency rate cut you would need some type of financial or credit crisis to be forming or a major geopolitical event.' Other forces, such as the unwinding of the yen carry trade, are driving the recent spike in volatility, making an emergency rate cut less effective.

**Federal Reserve May Lower Interest Rates Before September**
The Federal Reserve may be forced to lower interest rates before September due to the rapid slowdown in the US labor market, which has caused turmoil in global stock markets. According to Reuters, futures contracts for interest rates, which expire later this month, have risen to their highest level in two months, indicating that rates are expected to be lower by the end of August. However, the chances of this are against it, as said by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Austin Goolsbee, earlier this week, 'The law doesn't say anything about the stock market. It's about employment and price stability.' Many analysts now predict a 0.5% cut in interest rates in September, but few believe the Federal Reserve will act soon. Economist Kathy Bostick wrote in 'Naytived', 'Current economic data does not justify an emergency rate cut between meetings, which would trigger a new round of panic in the markets.' Even former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William Dudley, who called for a rate cut last week - before the latest data showed the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in June - wrote this week that a cut between meetings 'is highly unlikely.' Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, is expected to give new guidance on what may be required when central bankers meet at the annual 'Jackson Hole' economic conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in Wyoming in late August. It is widely expected that Powell will ignore the stock market crash and continue what he said last Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates in the range of 5.25% - 5.50%, saying 'If we get the data we hope to get, a rate cut may be on the table in September.' In the coming weeks, data on employment, inflation, consumer spending, and economic growth may influence whether this cut will be a 0.25% or something bigger. In each of the 8 times in the past 30 years that the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates between meetings, market turmoil has ensued, particularly in the bond market, which has indicated rapid changes in credit flows that maintain business continuity, a factor that has been absent so far, and among those crises that the Federal Reserve has cut rates during: the sharp decline in tech stocks, which it cut by 0.5% at the beginning of the year, after the sharp rise in tech stocks turned into a crash in stocks), and after the 9/11 attacks, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 0.5% after the attacks and the closure of the US financial markets for several days.

**US Interest Rate Cut Hopes Grow as Markets Await Fed Decision**
US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has hinted at a possible interest rate cut in September, citing the need for 'good data' on inflation. However, investors are growing impatient, with some calling for an emergency meeting and a more significant rate cut. According to Fed observer Dan Scott, 'the calls for an extraordinary meeting and an urgent US interest rate cut are getting louder.' The Fed has held 11 emergency meetings in the past 30 years, with the last one being in March 2020 to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This time, the markets are concerned about the possibility of a recession and the Fed's potential delay in cutting rates. As a result, stock markets in Asia, Europe, and the US experienced significant losses at the end of last week. Fed Chairman Powell has signaled his willingness to cut rates, but wants to see more 'good data' on inflation, particularly a decline in the inflation rate to 2%. Experts expect a decline in inflation to 2.9% in July, which would bring the inflation target closer to 2%. Growth signals from the US services sector have also helped to calm the markets. According to Helaba economist Ralf Umlauf, the US economy is likely to continue growing in the third quarter, although the dynamics in the second half of the year may be weaker than in the first half. With rate cuts expected in September and the remainder of the year, investors are also considering the possibility of a more significant rate cut, potentially by half a percentage point. However, this would be a rare move, and some analysts warn that it could be seen as a sign of nervousness. US currency guardian Austan Goolsbee has refused to comment on the possibility of an emergency meeting, saying that 'everything is always on the table,' including rate hikes or cuts. The Fed will have an opportunity to provide further guidance at the symposium in Jackson Hole, which will be held from August 22 to 24. DWS economist Christian Scherrmann expects 'clearer signals' after the door has been opened for a rate cut. The European Central Bank (ECB) has already taken a first step towards easing monetary policy, cutting rates by a quarter of a percentage point in June. A second cut is possible on September 12, just days before the regular Fed meeting in Washington. The deposit rate, which banks receive for storing excess funds at the ECB, is currently 3.75%. The main refinancing rate, which banks can borrow at, has been reduced from 4.5% to 4.25%. According to LBBW rate expert Elmar Völker, the trend towards easing monetary policy is gaining momentum worldwide, with the exception of Japan. In the eurozone, rate cut expectations have received a boost in recent weeks. For the ECB's meetings in September, October, and December, steps down are included in the market prices. 'This is already a very bold move,' he warned. His argument is that inflation in the eurozone has fallen out worse than expected. If the rate does not fall in August, the ECB may come out of its summer break less inclined to cut rates. LBBW expects the ECB to cut the deposit rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.50% in September and to 3.25% by the end of the year.

**US Federal Reserve May Hold Emergency Meeting to Lower Interest Rates**
The US Federal Reserve may hold an emergency meeting to lower interest rates, following negative economic statistics and a global market downturn. However, analysts believe that the Fed will choose a moderate approach. An emergency rate cut could significantly weaken the US dollar against all global currencies. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for September 18, but economists at JPMorgan suggest that an emergency meeting could take place before then. The main argument for an emergency meeting is that the Fed may have made a mistake by not lowering rates at the last meeting, and that the current monetary policy is too tight, putting the economy at risk of recession. However, some analysts, such as Olga Belenka, argue that the situation is not as dire, and that the Fed's goal of a 'soft landing' is still achievable. Belenka notes that the recent job market data shows that the economy is slowing down, but not yet in a recession. She also points out that the Fed has already softened its rhetoric, acknowledging that the risk of a recession is not just about inflation, but also about the labor market. If the data confirms a rapid deterioration in the economy, particularly in terms of employment, or if the market downturn worsens, the Fed may consider an emergency rate cut. However, Belenka notes that the Fed is unlikely to take drastic action, and that a more moderate approach is still the most likely scenario. 'If the subsequent reports do not confirm a significant deterioration in the labor market and/or inflation is not rapidly slowing down, then the Fed may start with a 0.25% rate cut in September and lower the rate by 0.75% by the end of the year. If the data shows that the Fed is lagging in easing monetary policy, then larger steps may be taken - for example, a first step of 0.5% and a reduction of 1 or more percentage points by the end of the year. The Fed has a large margin of maneuver to lower the rate to its long-term neutral level of 2.8%, and this margin can be used in case of a recession threat. However, inflation is still elevated, so the Fed is likely to be cautious.'

**Fed May Not Wait Until September to Cut Interest Rate Amid Market Turbulence**
The Federal Reserve may not wait until its next policy meeting in September to reduce the US interest rate, as a strong slowdown in the US labor market has sparked speculation. However, Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said, 'the law doesn't say anything about the stock market. It's about employment and price stability.' A growing number of analysts now predict a 0.25 percentage point cut in the interest rate for the Fed's September meeting. However, few or no one believes that the Fed will do it before. Kathy Bostjancic, economist at Nationwide, wrote, 'The current economic data does not justify an emergency cut in the interest rate between meetings, and this would only cause a new round of panic in the markets.' Jerome Powell, Fed chair, is expected to provide new guidance on what he thinks may be necessary when the authorities meet at the annual Fed economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. For now, it is expected that Powell will not worry about the stock market and maintain what he said last Wednesday, after the Fed's decision to keep the interest rate at 5.25% to 5.50%. He said, 'If we get the data we expect, a reduction in our interest rate may be considered at the September meeting.' In the coming weeks, data on employment, inflation, consumer spending, and economic growth may influence whether this reduction will be 0.25 percentage points or something larger. In each of the eight occasions in the last 30 years when the US central bank cut interest rates between policy meetings, market agitation went far beyond stocks. See below these occasions:

**‘Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever': Jeremy Siegel says the Fed needs to make an emergency rate cut of 75 basis points now — warns of a ‘bad' market reaction if nothing is done**
Economist Jeremy Siegel is calling for an emergency 75 basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, citing significant progress in the US economy toward its targets. Siegel argues that the economy has surpassed the Fed's unemployment target of 4.2% and has seen a 90% reduction in inflation. However, the Fed has kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5%. Siegel expressed frustration with the Fed's lack of action, stating, 'We've gone down 90% towards the target on the inflation rate. We've overshot the target on employment — those are the two targets explicitly mentioned by the Federal Reserve. How much have we moved the Fed funds rate? Zero. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.' Siegel warned that if the Fed remains inactive until September, the market will react badly.

**Fed Expected to Cut Interest Rates in Upcoming Meetings**
The recent disappointing employment report for July has led to a negative market reaction, with many economists calling for an emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Although there is no indication of an emergency meeting, analysts on Wall Street predict a series of rate cuts starting from September and continuing until 2025. According to FactSet, the expected rate cuts for the last three Fed meetings of 2024 are: a 0.5 percentage point cut in September, a 0.5 percentage point cut in November, and a 0.25 percentage point cut in December. Some analysts, like Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management, believe that the Fed has an incentive to act more quickly to lower rates, given the recent evidence of inflation returning to the Fed's target. A reduction of 1.25% to 1.5% in the highest interest rates in 23 years by the end of 2024 would provide relief for borrowers, including homebuyers and car buyers who have been unable to access the market due to high financing costs.

**Experts Weigh in on Potential Pre-emptive Rate Cut by the Federal Reserve**
The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates in September, but some experts believe that a pre-emptive rate cut could have negative consequences. Desmond Lachman, a former IMF deputy director, says that the Fed should not lower rates before September, as it could create panic on the markets. 'The Fed would lower the rate out of necessity, but only if there were no other option. If the Fed doesn't think the US is about to enter a recession, they wouldn't want to create panic by taking an extreme measure,' Lachman said. Ian Shepherdson, founder of Pantheon Macroeconomics, also believes that a pre-emptive rate cut is unlikely, as it could have an adverse effect on the message sent to investors. 'Fed chairmen wait, even if they know they're going to ease. Three out of four easings in the past 30 years took place during scheduled meetings,' Shepherdson said. John Sheehan, vice chairman of Osterweis Strategic Income Fund, says that the recent job numbers are not bad enough to justify a rate cut and that investors should look at the data in context. 'It's extreme events that make the Fed take emergency action,' Sheehan said. 'It's essential to put it in perspective. The S&P is still up 9% year-to-date. And yes, there's a disappointing employment number, but the unemployment rate is still 4.3%. Those are all pretty manageable numbers.'

**Goldman's David Solomon predicts Fed won't make emergency rate cuts**
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon predicts that the Federal Reserve will not make emergency rate cuts before their September meeting, despite the recent Wall Street meltdown. Solomon believes that the economy will continue to 'chug along' and that a recession is unlikely. He also expects that the Fed might issue a half-point cut in the fall. This prediction was echoed by Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, who also believes that the economy is not headed towards a recession. However, Sahm warned that a recession is possible if the economy continues to weaken without interference. She argued that the Fed needs to 'back off' its restrictions and ease gradually, ahead of time. According to Sahm's Sahm Rule, which has been highly accurate historically, the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate is at 4.1%, which is higher than the 12-month low of 3.5%.

**Goldman CEO doesn't expect emergency rate cut from Fed, recession unlikely**
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon does not expect the Federal Reserve to make an emergency interest rate cut before September, according to an interview with Bloomberg. Solomon stated, 'I don't expect you'll see anything before September.' He also believes that the economy will continue to 'chug along' and that a recession is unlikely. After a weaker-than-expected employment data set off a stock market panic, investors initially increased bets that the Fed would cut rates before September, but have since dialed back. Markets are now pricing in a 50-basis point cut (64.5% probability) in September, while the chances of a 25-bp cut are at 35.5%. Solomon noted that the recent market rout was a 'pretty meaningful correction' and expects more volatility in the short-term, stating, 'I do think we're getting a correction here after a very strong run in the markets, and that might be healthy.'

**The Federal Reserve will not let markets dictate a rate cut**
Global stock markets are in turmoil following a disappointing US jobs report. Speculation is high that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, but the Federal Open Market Committee has not ruled out other options. According to MoneyControl, the committee could decide on an emergency interest rate reduction prior to its regularly scheduled September meeting, similar to its response to the Covid crisis in March 2020. However, no official decision has been made yet.

**Short Call: US Fed faces Hobson's choice on rate cut; realty tax tweak may not calm bulls, Prestige Estates, Marico, LIC Housing in focus**
The US Federal Reserve is facing a difficult decision on whether to cut interest rates before its September policy meeting. Some experts, including Jeremy Siegel, are calling for an immediate 0.75 percent cut, followed by an additional 75 basis points in September, to prevent a market downturn. However, others argue that the US is not in a recession and that there is time to head off a downturn. The bond markets are betting on an emergency rate cut, but this could have unintended consequences, such as exacerbating inflation and leading to unrealistic market expectations. Meanwhile, the Indian government has proposed an amendment to the property tax rule, allowing taxpayers to choose between a 12.5% LTCG rate without indexation or a 20% rate with indexation for property acquired before July 23, 2024. However, this tweak may not be enough to calm market sentiment, which is focused on global factors. In the Indian stock market, Marico, LIC Housing Finance, and Syrma SGS Technology are in focus, with their Q1 results and prospects being analyzed by brokerages.

**Should Fed Make An Emergency Cut Before September Meeting? 'No, Not Even Close,' Analyst Says**
The probability of a 50-basis-point rate cut in September has decreased from nearly 100% to 64% according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Analysts like George Smith and Michael Gapen believe that emergency rate cuts are unlikely, citing historical precedents that require extreme economic or financial stress. Gapen stated, 'History suggests the bar for intermeeting cuts is extremely high and that conditions on the ground today do not warrant such action.' He emphasized that conditions such as global pandemics, significant asset price corrections, and systemic crises are typically required for emergency rate cuts. Currently, the implied probability of a Fed emergency rate cut in 2024 has dropped from 58% to 14% according to Polymarkets.

**How the stock selloff could affect the Federal Reserve  --  and your money**
Renewed concerns about the U.S. economy have led experts to predict that the Federal Reserve will aggressively ease monetary policy, with some forecasting a series of interest rate cuts starting in September and continuing into 2025. Economists polled by FactSet now predict that the Fed will trim rates by 0.5 percentage points, double the prior forecast, and further trim borrowing costs at its November and December meetings. This would bring the benchmark rate to 4% to 4.25% by year-end, or about 1.25 percentage points lower than its current 23-year high. While larger rate cuts would provide relief to borrowers, they would also make high-interest rate savings accounts and CDs less favorable. Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC Financial Services Group, said, 'The market is demanding a lot of rate cuts -- and aggressive rate cuts.' However, many economists say that an emergency rate cut before the September meeting is highly unlikely, as the Fed typically reserves emergency action for broader risks to the financial system or economy. The Fed's benchmark rate has sat at 5.25% to 5.5% since July 2023, and the time for a rate cut 'is approaching,' according to Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, forecasts that rates by year-end will be 1 percentage point lower, or in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.

**Wall Street predictor makes bold claim about future of the US economy**
Financial author and stock market analyst Robert Prechter predicts that the Federal Reserve will initiate an emergency rate cut ahead of its September meeting to address the widespread selloff of equities. Prechter believes the Fed missed an opportunity to cut rates at its last meeting, saying 'I think there's gonna be a surprise rate cut before the September meeting because I think rates have started falling faster.' The last time the Fed made emergency rate cuts was during the early days of COVID. Economists at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have raised the likelihood of a recession within the next year, with JP Morgan analysts predicting a 50 basis point cut at the September meeting followed by another 50 basis point cut in November. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, blames the Fed for the current market state, saying 'I really do worry that we may lose US economic exceptionalism because of a policy mistake.'

**US Federal Reserve under pressure to cut rates as market turmoil continues**
The US Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates as the global stock sell-off continues. Some analysts are calling for an emergency rate cut before the September rate decision, citing the recent below-target US jobs report and fears of a recession. Bank of America economists say a September rate cut is 'a virtual lock,' while Wharton School professor emeritus Jeremy Siegel is calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut. However, others, such as Goldman Sachs economists, are urging caution and saying it's a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report. The Fed's decision will be closely watched, especially with the US presidential election in November, as any rate cut before then could thrust the Fed into the middle of the campaign.

**Siegel Calls for Emergency Rate Cut and Deep Reduction by the Federal Reserve**
Professor Siegel has called for an emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve, in addition to a 75 basis point deep cut, during their September 17-18 meeting. He stated, 'And this is the minimum. The federal funds rate should be between 3.5% and 4% right now.' Siegel recalled that in June, he had said that the long-term federal funds rate should be 2.8% when inflation reaches 2% and unemployment reaches 4.2%. He noted, 'We got the employment numbers on Friday and we are at 4.3% unemployment and 2.5% inflation. We are 90% of the way to the inflation target. We have exceeded the employment target; These were clearly two goals that were expressed by the Fed.'

**What a Legendary Wall Street Prognosticator Thinks Is in Store for the U.S. Economy**
Robert Prechter, founder of Elliott Wave International, predicts that the Federal Reserve will implement an emergency rate cut before its scheduled September meeting to mitigate the recent significant sell-off in equities. Prechter believes that the Fed missed a crucial opportunity at its previous meeting to address the ongoing market turmoil. The anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could have a positive impact on gold prices. Many experts, including economists at Goldman Sachs and analysts at JP Morgan, have increased the probability of the US entering a recession within the next year. Additionally, the article discusses the importance of preparedness, including diversifying financial holdings, stocking up on potable water, pharmaceuticals, and medical supplies, and having backup energy sources. It also highlights the need for high-quality protein in long-term storage and the importance of preparing without fear.

**Siegel: Fed Should Make Emergency Rate Cut**
Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel has called for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to make a 75 basis point emergency rate cut before their September meeting, as they have already reached their inflation and employment targets. In a recent program on CNBC, Siegel also urged the Fed to make a deeper 75 basis point cut at their September 17-18 meeting. Siegel stated, 'And that's the minimum. The federal funds rate should be between 3.5% and 4% right now.' He also reminded that in June, the Fed said that the long-term federal funds rate should be 2.8% when inflation reaches 2% and unemployment is 4.2%. Siegel continued, 'We got the employment numbers on Friday and we are at 4.3% and 2.5% for inflation. We are 90% of the way to the inflation target and we have exceeded the employment target; these were clearly two targets that were mentioned by the Fed.'

The global stock sell-off has led to calls for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates quickly. Some analysts are urging an emergency rate cut before the Fed's scheduled decision in September. Futures markets initially expected a quarter percentage-point cut, but now see a half-point cut as more likely, according to data from CME Group.

**US Economy Faces Growing Fears of Recession, Market Expects Aggressive Rate Cut**
The US economy is facing growing fears of a recession, with weak job data from the past week casting doubt on the expectation of a 'soft landing'. As a result, the market is now expecting a more aggressive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) in September, potentially by 50 basis points. This is in contrast to the previous expectation of a 25 basis point cut. Some analysts even speculate that the Fed may implement an emergency rate cut before the September meeting. The Fed has not yet begun to reverse its policy of raising interest rates, which it has maintained since last year. The market is now pricing in a 98.5% probability of a 50 basis point cut in September, with some analysts expecting two or more rate cuts by the end of the year. The key factor is the weak job data, which showed a decline in non-agricultural employment and an increase in the unemployment rate. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for September 17-18, and the market is expecting a rate cut at that time. However, the exact timing and magnitude of the rate cut are still uncertain. The Fed's decision will be influenced by the upcoming US presidential election and the potential impact of a Republican victory on the economy. The market is also watching the upcoming Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers, where Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may provide some clues about the Fed's plans.

**Cries are getting louder for emergency interest-rate cuts this week, something that's been reserved for pandemics or terrorist attacks**
The US stock market is plummeting, and investors are calling for an emergency interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve. This would be a rare move, typically reserved for pandemics or terrorist attacks. The Federal Reserve has not indicated whether it will cut rates, but some economists, such as Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel, are urging an emergency 75 basis-point cut this week. Siegel said, 'How much have we moved the fed funds rate? Zero. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.' Others, like Jim Smigiel, chief investment officer at SEI, are cautioning against an overreaction, saying that emergency rate cuts 'makes little sense given the economic backdrop in the U.S. and would only serve to destroy policy maker credibility.' The Federal Reserve's next meeting is scheduled for September 18, but some experts are urging more aggressive rate cuts if the economy continues to deteriorate.

**Legendary market watcher predicts surprise Fed rate cut**
Prominent financial analyst Robert Prechter predicts that the Federal Reserve will implement an emergency rate cut ahead of its September meeting, in response to the recent global market selloff. Prechter, the founder and president of Elliott Wave International, believes the Fed missed its chance to lower the Fed funds rate last week and that rates have started falling faster. He stated, 'The Federal Reserve had a wonderful opportunity last Wednesday to lower their Fed funds rate by a quarter point; they didn't take it. I think that was a big mistake.' Prechter expects the Fed to make the unorthodox move of a cut between meetings, citing the average lag time of five months for central banks to follow free market interest rates. This would be a highly unusual move, last seen during the height of COVID, and many economists argue it is highly unlikely.

**Could the Fed enact an emergency rate cut before its next meeting? Here are the odds.**
The recent three-day stock market rout has led some experts to speculate about the possibility of an emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve before its next meeting on September 18. Traders are signaling a roughly 60% likelihood of an emergency 0.25 percentage point cut within one week, according to Bloomberg News. However, some experts believe the odds are much lower, with Pantheon Macroeconomics noting that investors saw a roughly 30% chance of an emergency cut in the next week. Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said that if there's more deterioration in economic conditions, 'we're going to fix it.' But he added that even though the jobs numbers were weaker than expected, he doesn't believe the U.S. is in a recession. The Fed has cut rates at nine emergency meetings in the last 30 years, which means an intra-meeting cut before September 'would not be unprecedented.' However, many economists believe the Fed is likely to wait until its September meeting to start easing borrowing costs, partly as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average remain in positive territory despite the three-day rout. 'From our perspective, this isn't the environment when you want to hastily throw a rate cut out there,' said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC's asset management group. 'An emergency cut could do 'more damage than it helps because then the everyone will say, 'What does the Fed know that we don't?''

**Fed Must Make Emergency Rate Cut to Avoid US Turmoil, Says Top Economist - Decrypt**
Prominent economist Jeremy Siegel is urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 75 basis points, followed by another 75 basis points in September, to avoid US turmoil. Siegel believes the current 5.25% to 5.5% target range is too high and should be between 3.5% and 4%. He argues that the Fed has not moved the fed funds rate despite inflation reaching 2.97% and unemployment at 4.3%, which is 90% progress towards the Fed's target. Siegel warns that inaction could be disastrous, saying 'If they're going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up -- which, by the way, was the worst policy error in 50 years -- then we're not in for a good time with this economy.' The market is currently pricing in 83% odds of a 50 basis point cut in September, but Coinshares' head of research James Butterfill believes a 50 basis point cut is still the most likely course.

**Traders wonder if the Fed could take an emergency rate cut as markets tumble**
As global financial markets tumbled on Monday, investors speculated that the Federal Reserve could make an emergency interest rate cut to cushion the fallout. The Fed only considers emergency cuts in extreme situations, but investors are betting on a half-percentage point or more reduction in the coming months. Some commentators called for rapid and drastic reductions, but Joseph LaVorgna argued that an inter-meeting cut 'would look like a panic move.' Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, noted that the Fed tends to make moves between meetings when there is a risk of credit market disruption, not just because stock prices are falling. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that the Fed's job is to maximize employment, stabilize prices, and maintain financial stability, and suggested that if conditions start weakening, 'We're going to fix it.' Feroli expects a half-point reduction in September, and notes that the Fed may have waited too long to begin reducing rates.

**Stock market woes will not trigger emergency rate cut by Fed**
The Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates before their September meeting, despite the ongoing stock market rout, according to Fed watchers. However, the Fed is expected to cut rates significantly more before year-end than previously anticipated. Patrick Horan, a macroeconomist, said, 'A stock market drop, by itself, is not enough to justify a rate cut.' Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, warned of a risk of labor market conditions deteriorating before rate cuts are approved. The odds of the Fed cutting rates by 50 basis points by September are at about 84%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Before 2024-end, about 60% of the futures market now sees reductions totaling 125 basis points. Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist with JonesTrading, said, 'For an emergency rate cut you would need some type of financial or credit crisis to be forming or a major geopolitical event.' Other forces, such as the unwinding of the yen carry trade, are driving the recent spike in volatility, making an emergency rate cut less effective.

Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel has called for an emergency rate cut of 75 basis points by the Federal Reserve before its September meeting, as the central bank has already reached inflation- and employment-based targets. Siegel said, 'The fed funds rate right now should be somewhere between 3.5% and 4%.' He noted that the Fed has 'overshot the target on the employment' and 'gone down 90% towards the target on the inflation rate.' Siegel also recalled that the Fed made an out-of-schedule cut in early 2001 and said that markets would welcome an emergency rate cut by the Fed. He stated, 'The Fed is so far behind the curve right now…the Fed is up in the bleachers.'

**Fed: Market Expects Emergency Rate Cut Amid Growing Recession Fears**
On a chaotic Monday (5), investors began to estimate an emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in response to the growing possibility of a US recession. The Fed's last decision was to keep interest rates at 5.5% and 5.25%. The market is now pricing a 60% chance of a 0.25 percentage point (p.p.) emergency rate cut within a week, which would bring the Fed Funds to a range of 5.25% to 5.%. Additionally, the market is now estimating a 1.25 p.p. rate cut by the end of 2024. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have increased their estimates of a US recession from 15% to 25%, while JPMorgan sees a 50% chance of a US recession. The market is also expecting a 0.5 p.p. rate cut by the European Central Bank (BCE) in September, and a total of 0.9 p.p. in rate cuts by the end of the year.

Meanwhile, market prices indicate a 95% probability of the Fed cutting its policy rate by 50 basis points in September. Analysts also suggest that the Fed could hold an emergency meeting within a week and cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

**Fed Considers Emergency Rate Cut Amid Growing Recession Concerns**
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) is considering an emergency meeting to lower interest rates due to growing recession concerns in the US. This move would be a repeat of the Fed's previous emergency meetings and rate cuts. The Fed's schedule indicates that the next meeting is due in 44 days, but there is a growing expectation that it will be held sooner. The Fed has a history of making emergency rate cuts in response to economic crises, including the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2008, the Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in October, and in 2020, it cut rates by 50 basis points in March. The Fed's last emergency rate cut was in March 2020, when it cut rates by 50 basis points to 0-0.25%. Since then, the Fed has raised interest rates 11 times, most recently in July 2023, to 5.25-5.50%. Analysts warn that an emergency rate cut could exacerbate economic concerns and lead to market panic. Harvard University's Jason Furman suggests that the Fed should instead focus on more communication-oriented steps and make clear statements about its intentions, such as a 25 or 50 basis point rate cut, at its September meeting.

**US Market Expects Emergency Rate Cut as Economy Fears Grow**
The US fixed income market is starting to bet that the American economy is facing a rapid deterioration, which would prompt the Federal Reserve to aggressively ease monetary policy - possibly before its next meeting in September - to avoid a recession. Concerns about inflation have largely disappeared, replaced by speculation that growth will stall unless the US central bank starts reducing interest rates. The market is now pricing in a 60% chance of an emergency 0.25 percentage point cut within a week. Tracy Chen from Brandywine Global Investment Management said, 'The market's concern is that the Fed is behind the curve and we're moving from a soft landing to a hard landing.' US Treasury bond yields have plummeted, with the two-year yield falling nearly 19 basis points to below 3.7% on Monday, after already falling 50 basis points last week. This is the lowest level since the global financial crisis or the dot-com bubble burst at the turn of the century. The market is now pricing in over 1.25 percentage points of rate cuts by the end of the year, with only three more meetings scheduled. The European Central Bank is also expected to cut rates, with the market now pricing in a 0.50 percentage point cut in September, and a total of 0.90 percentage points of easing for the rest of the year.

**Will the FED Lower Interest Rates Before the Scheduled Meeting?**
The Federal Reserve (FED) is expected to lower interest rates in September, but the recent economic data from the US has led to speculation that the decision may be brought forward. The FED's meeting is scheduled for September 17-18. If the FED lowers interest rates, what will happen to gold and the US dollar? The market is pricing in a 25 basis point interest rate cut by the FED with a 60% probability within the next week. Historically, the FED has taken emergency action in 1994, 1998, 2001, 2007, 2008, and 2020, and some analysts believe that the FED may take a similar step in response to the current economic situation. FED Chairman Jerome Powell said, 'We will do what it takes to support the economy.'

**Emergency Rate Cut by the Federal Reserve: A Possibility?**
The recent decline in global markets has raised the possibility of an emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The ISM's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 46.8 in July, its lowest level in 8 months, below market expectations. Meanwhile, non-agricultural employment in the US increased by 114,000, well below expectations, and the June non-agricultural employment figure was revised downward to 179,000. Resession fears have increased in the US, and today, the Nikkei 225 index in Japan fell 12.40% to 31,458, the largest drop since the 'Black Friday' in 1987. The Kospi index in South Korea also fell 8.77% to 2,441.5. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 2.05% to 16,593, the Shanghai composite index in China fell 1.5% to 2,860, and the Sensex index in India fell 3% to 78,520. US Treasury bonds also fell, and at 11:10 am local time, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell to 3.68%, the lowest level since June 26, 2023. In the wake of the recent decline in markets, the possibility of a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed in September has risen to over 95%. Analysts also suggest that the Fed may make an emergency decision to cut rates by 25 basis points within a week. The Fed's last emergency rate cut was in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points to 1-1.25% on March 3, 2020, and then again on March 16, 2020, cutting rates to 0-0.25%. Following this decision, unemployment rose and consumption declined, and inflation began to rise as the money supply increased. The Fed raised rates to 0.25-0.50% in March 2022 to combat rising inflation. This marked the beginning of the rate hike cycle, and the Fed increased rates 11 times between March 2022 and January 2024, making borrowing more expensive for businesses and individuals. The Fed's last rate hike was in July 2023, when it raised rates to 5.25-5.50%. The Fed's last emergency rate cut before the pandemic was in 2007-2008, during the global financial crisis. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points in September 2007 and again by 50 basis points in October 2008. Experts described the Fed's actions at the time as 'one of the most aggressive economic rescue efforts in history.' The Fed's previous emergency rate cut was on September 17, 2001, after the 9/11 attacks, when it cut rates by 50 basis points. Analysts warn that an emergency rate cut by the Fed could exacerbate concerns about the economy and lead to panic in the markets. They suggest that the Fed should clarify its short-term plans to avoid losing control over the markets. Jason Furman, a professor of economic policy at Harvard University, stated on social media that he did not believe the Fed needed to make an emergency rate cut. He suggested that the Fed should take more communication-oriented steps and make clear statements about its intentions, including a 25 or 50 basis point rate cut, at its upcoming meeting in September.

**Fed Considers Emergency Rate Cut Amid Recession Fears**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is considering an emergency rate cut to alleviate concerns about a recession in the US. The move comes as global stock markets have seen sharp declines due to rising recession fears. The ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for July fell to 46.8, its lowest level in 8 months, below market expectations. Non-farm employment in the US also rose by 114,000, well below expectations, while the June non-farm employment figure was revised down to 179,000. The Fed's emergency rate cuts have been triggered by recession fears, with the latest cut coming in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Fed cut the policy rate by 50 basis points to 1-1.25% and then again by 50 basis points to 0-0.25% in March 2020. The rate hike cycle began in March 2022, with the Fed raising rates 11 times between March 2022 and January 2024, making borrowing more expensive for businesses and individuals. The Fed's last rate hike was in July 2023, raising the policy rate to 5.25-5.50%. Analysts warn that an emergency rate cut could exacerbate recession fears and lead to market panic, while others argue that the Fed should take more communication-oriented steps to address the economic situation. Harvard University's Jason Furman, a professor of economic policy, stated that he does not believe an emergency rate cut is necessary, and that the Fed should make clear statements about its intentions at its upcoming meeting in September, including the possibility of a 25 or 50 basis point rate cut.

**An Emergency Fed Rate Cut Would Be A Mistake**
The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, should ease policy at its next meeting in September, rather than cutting interest rates in response to a slump in stock markets. The current market downturn is primarily a result of investors unwinding over-leveraged trades, rather than a response to an economic shock. According to Bloomberg, there's nothing broken in the US economy, so there's no justification for the monetary authorities to step in and mitigate losses for over-extended equity holders. As one source notes, 'the fabled 'Fed put' is a break-glass lever only to be used in event of a proper emergency — and we're not there yet.'

**Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged, Suggests Possible Cuts in September**
The Federal Reserve of the United States decided to keep interest rates unchanged, but left the possibility of reducing them in their next meeting in September. This decision will depend on how inflation evolves in relation to the 2% target set by the central bank. According to the Federal Open Market Committee, there have been advances towards the inflation target, which could justify a rate cut in September, just weeks before the presidential elections on November 5. The Fed modified its assessment of inflation, describing it as 'somewhat elevated', in contrast to the previous description of 'elevated'. They also adjusted their focus, showing concern for both inflation and employment, in line with their dual mandate of maintaining stable prices and maximizing employment. The central bankers indicated that a rate cut could be necessary before inflation reaches its target, considering the time it takes for monetary policy to impact the economy.

**US Federal Reserve Chair signals possible rate cuts 'as soon as' September**
The US Federal Reserve left its key lending rate unchanged at 5.25-5.50% on July 31, but signaled a possible rate cut as soon as September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the economy is moving closer to the point where it will be appropriate to reduce the policy rate, citing a 'really significant decline in inflation.' Powell made clear that the base-case for Fed officials is to begin cutting rates at the upcoming meeting in September. Recent data suggest the Fed's mission of bringing inflation back down to 2% is now firmly back on track, with headline inflation easing to 2.5% last month. Powell emphasized that the Fed would never use its tools to support or oppose a political party or any politician, and that the decision to cut rates would be based on economic data, not the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.
