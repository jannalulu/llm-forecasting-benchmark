INT. A SMALL MEETING ROOM - DAY

The room is filled with an air of anticipation as the superforecasters gather around a table, laptops open. The clock reads October 2, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the moment of truth. Did the Spanish Wikipedia hit 2 million articles?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 72.35%. Given the growth rate, it seemed likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The numbers were close. Last we checked, it was 1,968,552 articles back in June. 

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The growth was steady, but the summer slowdown affected the pace.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And the verdict?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(looks at the screen)  
It happened. On September 27th, they crossed the mark.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Incredible. Our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Another win for data-driven predictions.

They nod, satisfied with their accurate foresight.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, laptops open, eyes fixed on the screen displaying the Spanish Wikipedia statistics.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it seems the Spanish Wikipedia didn't quite make it. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The growth rate was steady, but it just wasn't enough to hit the 2 million mark by October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
Considering the past year's trajectory, the probability was always low. Our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
It's fascinating how these numbers tell a story. A testament to the power of prediction.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning forward)  
Indeed. Now, we wait and see how the next milestone unfolds. 

They exchange knowing glances, their confidence in their models unshaken.

So, did the Spanish Wikipedia hit the 2 million mark?

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Our models had it at 22.35%. The growth rate just wasn’t there.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Exactly. Even with the spike in June, it wasn’t enough to sustain the momentum.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

The last data we had was from July 26th. Since then, the trend didn’t change much.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Remember, we only had data until July 26th. The article creation rate was steady, but unpredictable factors could've stalled it.

True. But given the growth from May 2022 to June 2024, it seemed likely. Our models factored in past trends and editorial initiatives.
