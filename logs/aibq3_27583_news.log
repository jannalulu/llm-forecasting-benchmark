**Kenya Confirms Second Case of Mpox**
Kenya has confirmed its second case of mpox, a disease previously known as monkeypox, after detecting it in a truck driver who traveled to the epicenter of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). According to the Ministry of Health, the patient presented symptoms of the disease and had a history of travel to the DRC. The patient has been isolated and is receiving treatment in the Busia county. The first case of mpox in the country was detected on July 31 in a border crossing with Uganda. Since the declaration of the first case, 28 contacts of the case have completed a 21-day follow-up period without developing symptoms and have been discharged from active surveillance, said the Ministry of Health. The Kenyan authorities stated that the healthcare facilities 'have the necessary personnel and are well-equipped to diagnose and control this disease.' They also expressed their 'deep gratitude' to all Kenyans 'for their unwavering cooperation and support in the fight against the outbreak in the country.' The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health alert on August 14 due to the rapid spread and high mortality of the new variant (clade 1b) in the African continent and a first case in Sweden of a traveler who was in an area of Africa where the virus is circulating intensely. The variant is different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions, and already led to the declaration of a global health emergency between 2022 and 2023. Twelve member states of the African Union have reported 18,910 cases of mpox and 541 deaths in 2024, although the majority of infections occur in the DRC, reported the African Union's health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Africa (CDC Africa).

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
The Department of Disease Control in Thailand confirmed the first case of the new variant of mpox, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14. The patient tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the department, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, but their progress will be monitored for 21 days. The confirmation of the clade 1b case in Thailand marks the first of its kind in Asia after the global emergency was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Department of Disease Control, called for strengthened infection control measures, including close contact with patients, and assured that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points, especially at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, for passengers from countries with reported cases. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox infections (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. As of 2024, 12 African countries have accumulated 18,910 mpox cases and 541 deaths, mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The clade 1b variant is spreading more easily among people and tends to cause more severe symptoms, although the WHO has sent a message of reassurance, stating that the mpox outbreak 'is not the COVID.'

**Mpox 2024 mapped: All the countries where cases of the new strain have been confirmed**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has spread to 17,000 cases across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. A new strain, clade 1, has been identified, primarily spreading through sexual networks, and has been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Dr. Tedros, the WHO's director general, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The WHO is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of 15 million dollars. The US government has provided an additional 17 million USD to support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Department of Health Responds to Mpox Rumors: 'No Suspected or Confirmed Cases'**
The Department of Health has responded to rumors of an mpox infection in the country, stating that 'there are no suspected or confirmed cases.' According to Joris Moonens, a spokesperson for the department, 'all doctors must immediately report any suspected or confirmed mpox cases in Flanders to the Department of Health.' If a case of the new mpox variant (Clade Ib) is detected in Flanders or Belgium, the department will actively communicate this to the press. Until then, there are no likely or confirmed cases of the new mpox variant (Clade Ib) in Flanders. Moonens notes that there are many skin diseases and conditions that can cause symptoms such as rashes or blisters, which can be mistaken for mpox and lead to unfounded rumors. He also mentions that there have been sporadic cases of the mpox variant Clade IIb, which led to an outbreak in 2022 and is now under control. Moonens emphasizes that the risk of infection with mpox in the general population is 'very low' and that if cases of Clade Ib variant do occur, they are expected to be in people with a recent travel history.

**San Diego County on High Alert for Mpox Cases**
The San Diego County Health Department is on high alert for mpox cases, particularly the more lethal and contagious 'Clade 1' variant spreading rapidly in some African countries. The department recommends that doctors take a thorough travel history of anyone presenting mpox symptoms, asking about travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo or any adjacent country, or close contact with someone who has visited the region in the 21 days prior to symptom onset. 'If Clade 1 ever arrived here, which we obviously hope does not happen, we want to be prepared,' said Dr. Winston Tilghman, medical director of the Division of HIV, STD, and Hepatitis. The Clade 2, the type of mpox that caused a global outbreak in 2022, continues to appear in San Diego County, with 51 suspected or confirmed cases in 2024, a massive decrease from the 469 cases in 2022, but still significantly higher than the pre-outbreak rate of zero to one case per year. According to the county records, 76% of those who have confirmed or suspected mpox infections this year were not vaccinated. 'Not everyone who would benefit from the vaccine has received it, and that's why we've been trying to encourage people to get vaccinated or complete the two-dose series,' said Tilghman. 'While case activity is definitely low compared to what we observed in 2022, it's still higher than we'd like it to be.' Jynneos is the vaccine used to prevent mpox infection, although it was designed to combat smallpox. In 2023, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the results of a study on the efficacy of Jynneos for mpox, estimating an efficacy of 66% for two doses and nearly 36% for one dose. Dr. David 'Davey' Smith, chief of infectious diseases and global public health at UC San Diego, said in an interview earlier this month that the overall efficacy has been lower than expected. 'There are people we've vaccinated who have gotten re-infected, and that's frustrating,' said Smith. 'The vaccine we have, which is actually a smallpox vaccine, is closely related to mpox enough to generate protective antibodies, but those antibodies decrease rapidly compared to what we see with smallpox. 'Scientists are trying to figure it out, but we still don't have the answer.' In the first eight months of this year, in San Diego County, 12 people who received both doses got infected. However, Tilghman said that these 'recurrent' infections seem to produce milder symptoms than in the case of those who are not vaccinated. 'People who end up being diagnosed and who are completely vaccinated tend to have a milder disease and are less likely to have complications,' said Tilghman. According to the CDC, mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and back pain, swollen lymph nodes, chills, fatigue, and a rash that can resemble pimples or blisters, in many different places, including the chest, hands, feet, chest, face, and groin. The CDC recommends vaccination for anyone exposed to the mpox virus and for anyone who has intimate contact with multiple partners, especially in recreational settings.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of Mpox Variant Clade Ib**
Thailand's Department of Disease Control has confirmed the first case of the new mpox variant clade Ib in a 66-year-old patient who arrived from Africa on August 14. The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.

**Thailand says mpox case is more easily spread variant**
Thailand has confirmed a case of mpox, specifically the Clade 1b strain, in a 66-year-old man who arrived from an unspecified African country. According to Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, 'The test results confirm that he is infected with the Clade 1b strain of monkeypox, which is the first case diagnosed in Thailand, but this man is likely infected from an endemic country.' No local infections have been detected through contact tracing. Clade 1b has raised global concern due to its ease of spread through routine close contact. Thailand has detected 800 cases of mpox Clade 2 since 2022 but has not previously detected a case of the Clade 1 or Clade 1b variants. As a precaution, Singapore will screen the temperatures of travellers arriving from places exposed to the risk of mpox outbreaks from Friday.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of Clade 1 Mpox Variant in Asia**
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand confirmed the first case of the Clade 1 variant of mpox in Asia on August 22. The disease, declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO), was diagnosed in a 66-year-old man who traveled to Africa, the continent with the highest number of infections. According to the Thai government, he returned to the country on August 14 and presented fever and other symptoms compatible with mpox the next day, and was hospitalized for treatment. A team of health surveillance counted 43 people who had close contact with the patient, including those who also traveled to Africa, and were advised to observe for symptoms such as fever, skin rash, and swollen lymph nodes over the next 21 days. If any symptoms appear, the Thai Ministry of Public Health recommends seeking medical attention. In a statement, the ministry highlighted that at least six African countries have reported an outbreak of mpox, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, and Côte d'Ivoire. 'Passengers who have been to these countries will have their body temperature taken and be questioned about symptoms observed, especially skin rashes,' the Thai government emphasized. The patient, who is European, has been confirmed to be infected with the more lethal subtype of mpox, responsible for up to 10% of deaths, according to the Thai Department of Disease Control. In contrast, the Clade 2 variant is the most common type. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 99.9% of those infected with this subtype survive.

Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, said, 'The test results confirm that he is infected with the clade 1b of mpox, which is the first case diagnosed in Thailand, but this man probably got infected from an endemic country.' He stated that no other local infection was detected through contact tracing. The clade 1b has raised global concern due to its ease of spread through close contact. A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its dissemination outside the continent. The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. Thailand reported on Wednesday that the man confirmed to have mpox had transited through a country in the Middle East before flying to Thailand.

The confirmation of the clade 1b case in Thailand marks the first of its kind in Asia after the global emergency was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Department of Disease Control, called for strengthened infection control measures, including close contact with patients, and assured that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points, especially at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, for passengers from countries with reported cases. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox infections (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. As of 2024, 12 African countries have accumulated 18,910 mpox cases and 541 deaths, mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The clade 1b variant is spreading more easily among people and tends to cause more severe symptoms, although the WHO has sent a message of reassurance, stating that the mpox outbreak 'is not the COVID.'

**One case of clade 2 mpox detected in Pakistan, new strain not detected**
Pakistan's ministry of health has confirmed one case of the mpox virus, specifically the clade 2 variety, but no cases of the more contagious clade 1b strain have been detected. According to Sajid Hussain Shah, spokesman for the ministry of national health services, 'As of now, there have been no reported cases of clade 1 in Pakistan.' The World Health Organization has declared the recent outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, with 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths reported mainly among children in the Democratic Republic of Congo since January 2023. Global health officials have confirmed an infection with the new strain of mpox in Sweden, linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, but the WHO has not urged any travel restrictions to curb the spread of the disease.

**Health officials confirm last week's mpox case not a new variant**
Health officials in Pakistan have confirmed that the mpox case announced last week was not the new Clade 1b strain spreading through Africa. According to the health ministry, the virus has been classified as Clade 2b, which was primarily associated with mpox infections that surged worldwide in May 2022, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men. The World Health Organization declared the rapid spread of the new Clade 1b strain in Africa a public health emergency of international concern last week. As of now, there have been no reported cases of Clade 1b in Pakistan, and the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is primarily associated with Clade 1b.

**NHS on ‘high alert' for mpox cases as interactive map reveals 16 virus hotspots – are you eligible for the vaccine?**
The NHS is on 'high alert' for mpox cases as a deadly strain has been confirmed in Europe. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a global health emergency, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk level. According to the NHS website, only men who sleep with men and staff who work at sex-on-premises venues are eligible for the vaccine. However, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has stated that eligible groups for vaccination will be kept under review as information about the current outbreak emerges. Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Public Health Programmes at UKHSA, said, 'Currently the risk to most travellers is small, and vaccination against mpox infection is not recommended for the majority of people.' Professor Paul Hunter told Sky News it is 'very likely' there are already cases in the UK, however it has not been confirmed. He said, 'When someone gets an infection it typically takes several days before they develop the classic appearance that would make people think 'oh, this is mpox'. 'Then it can take longer before the samples are taken and sent to the lab, it's identified as mpox and sent for sequencing so we know which clade of mpox it is.' The WHO has warned that the clade 1 variant is 'far more deadly' than its predecessor, with a fatality rate of around five per cent in adults and 10 per cent in children. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, from the WHO, said, 'In the past month, about 90 cases of clade 1b have been reported in four countries neighbouring the DRC that have not reported mpox before: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.' The WHO's labelling of a 'public health emergency of international concern' is meant to encourage member countries to begin preparing for the virus. This could entail the sharing of vaccines and treatments with poorer nations. Dr Josie Golding, from the Wellcome Trust, said it was a 'strong signal', while Emory University's Dr Boghuma Titanji said the move 'underscores the gravity of the crisis.'

**Britain urgently stockpiles mpox vaccines and treatments as deadly new strain of virus reaches Europe, sparking global health emergency**
Britain has stockpiled mpox vaccines and treatments in preparation for a new, more deadly strain of the virus that has sparked a global health emergency. The Clade 1 mpox variant has a mortality rate of up to 10% and is spreading faster than the previous strain. Experts warn that the disease is now spreading to regions where it has not been endemic before, and that the affected nations lack the resources to effectively stop the spread. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has warned all governments to expect cases, and one patient has been identified in Sweden. Professor Paul Hunter said it is 'very likely' that someone in Britain already has the new variant, although it will probably be a few weeks before that is confirmed. Zeil Rosenberg MD warned that the disease is now spreading to regions where historically it has not been endemic, driving concern of a repeat of the deadly 2022 outbreak that infected nearly 100,000 people. 'The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains the centre of an unchecked explosion of cases with 11,000 cases reported this year alone and showing no signs of slowing,' he said. 'The most severe and lethal Clade 1 mpox, historically endemic to central Africa..., has become predominant and is now found throughout the region,' Professor David Heymann warned. 'Person-to-person transmission is now occurring and if persons with infection travel to other countries, the same situation regarding smallpox vaccination exists... outbreaks of person-to-person transmission could occur.'

**Mpox: No Cases Reported in Guyana Since 2022**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised its highest level of international alert due to the resurgence of Mpox cases in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and a 160% increase in deaths in 2024. A first case of Mpox clade 1b has been detected in Sweden. In France, no contamination by clade 1 [1b] has been reported. In Guyana, no cases have been reported since the beginning of the epidemic in 2022. The Mpox virus, also known as monkeypox, was first isolated in 1958 in a colony of monkeys in Copenhagen, Denmark. The virus is transmitted from rodents to humans, not from monkeys. The WHO has preferred the name Mpox since the end of 2022. The disease manifests with fever, swollen lymph nodes, and skin eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas. The clade 1b variant also causes skin eruptions on the entire body. 'No cases of Mpox confirmed in 2022 in Guyana,' said Loïc Epelboin, head of the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit (UMIT) at the Cayenne Hospital. 'The hospital in Cayenne is prepared' for a potential outbreak, according to an article published on Guyane la 1ère. However, Loïc Epelboin confirmed to Guyaweb that there were no cases of Mpox confirmed in 2022 in Guyana. The hospital has a dedicated sector for high-risk infectious diseases, including Ebola and Mpox.

**Pakistan admits it cannot find mpox patient as tighter screening to be introduced at airports**
Pakistan has confirmed a single case of mpox, a viral infection, in the northern Khyber Pakhtunkwa province. The patient, who recently returned from a Gulf country, is suspected to have gone into hiding after providing samples for tests. The health ministry is carrying out contact tracing and strengthening airport screening to prevent further spread. The new strain, clade 1b, is said to cause milder symptoms with lesions on the genitals, making it harder to spot and more likely for people to infect others without knowing they're infected. According to pox researcher Jonas Albarnaz, 'clade 1b is concerning for two main reasons: it's the first clade 1 mpox virus case outside Africa, and it's associated with a more severe disease and higher mortality rates than the clade 2 virus responsible for the international mpox outbreak in 2022.'

**Mpox 2024 mapped: All the countries where cases of the new strain have been confirmed**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has spread to 17,000 cases across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. A new strain, clade 1, has been identified, primarily spreading through sexual networks, and has been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Dr. Tedros, the WHO's director general, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The WHO is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of 15 million dollars. The US government has provided an additional 17 million USD to support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**EU Raises Alert Level for Mpox as New Strain Spreads**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) raised its risk level for mpox on Friday, a day after global health officials confirmed the first infection with a new strain of the virus outside of Africa, in Sweden. The ECDC director said there will be more imported cases of the new mpox strain in Europe in the coming weeks, although the risk of sustained transmission remains low. The World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency on Wednesday, its highest level of alert, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighboring countries. The WHO plans to hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss ways to ensure fair global access to tests, treatments, and vaccines for the virus, said a senior official. Mpox, a viral infection that causes painful lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is usually mild but can be fatal. In the Congo, two strains are spreading: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new variant called clade Ib. On Friday, the ECDC raised its evaluation of the risk level of mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases in the EU, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. The agency said the general risk to the population had increased from 'very low' to 'low'. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said its director, Pamela Rendi Wagner. Pakistan also confirmed a case of the virus on Friday in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, although it was unclear whether it was the new variant or the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022. Mpox is transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as COVID-19, there is no evidence that it spreads easily through the air. 'We are seeing a significant increase in cases in Europe, and we are concerned about the potential for further spread,' said Wagner. 'It is essential that we take a proactive approach to prevent the spread of mpox and protect the most vulnerable populations.'

**These Countries Have Confirmed Cases Of New Mpox Variant**
The World Health Organization has declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years due to an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A new form of the virus, clade Ib, is spreading quickly and has been confirmed in several countries, including Sweden, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. According to the WHO, the current outbreak has seen 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths since January 2023, mainly among children. Global health officials have confirmed that the person infected in Sweden was infected while in Africa with the clade Ib type of mpox. No deaths have been reported in the newly affected countries as of August 8, according to WHO data.

**Europe Raises Alert Level for Mpox After Case Detected in Sweden**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk level for mpox, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a case of infection with the new strain of the virus in Sweden, the first outside of Africa. The director of the ECDC said that there will be more imported cases of the new strain of mpox in Europe in the coming weeks, although the risk of sustained transmission remains low. The WHO declared on Wednesday that mpox is a global health emergency, its highest level of alert, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to neighboring countries. Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is usually mild but can be fatal. Two strains are now spreading in the Congo: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new branch called clade Ib. The ECDC raised its risk level for mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases appearing in the bloc, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said ECDC director Pamela Rendi Wagner. Pakistan also confirmed a case of the virus mpox in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, although it was unclear whether it was the new variant or the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022. WHO official Margaret Harris said in a press conference on Friday that she expects more cases outside of Africa soon, also due to increased surveillance. However, the WHO discouraged any travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Mpox, Explained: What To Know About Variants, Vaccines And Outbreaks**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency. The Philippines has reported its first case of mpox this year, and Pakistan has confirmed at least one case. Sweden has become the first country outside of Africa to report an mpox infection caused by the clade I variant. The WHO has confirmed 2,863 mpox cases and 517 deaths in 2024, with most cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The preferred vaccine among health officials is Bavarian Nordic's two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, which has a more favorable risk profile. The WHO recommends vaccination for at-risk groups, including gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and laboratory or healthcare workers. The clade II variant that drove the 2022 mpox outbreak is still circulating, and officials monitor its movements closely. 'We encourage all countries to enhance surveillance, share data, and work to better understand the transmission; share tools like vaccines; and apply lessons learned from prior public health emergencies of international concern in addressing the current outbreak,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

**New Mpox Variant Emerges in Congo, Raises Concerns for Global Health**
The Mpox virus, which retreated to Africa after the 2022 pandemic, has not finished evolving and spreading. In 2023, over 15,000 confirmed or suspected cases of infection were reported by several African countries, an increase from previous years. In 2024, African countries have already reported more confirmed and suspected Mpox infections than in all of 2023: 17,500 as of the beginning of the year, concentrated mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Children are particularly vulnerable: about two-thirds of infections in Congo involve people under the age of 15. Some of these infections have been linked to a strain called clade II, which caused the 2022 epidemic; however, in recent months, an increasing percentage of reported infections has been attributed to a strain called clade I. Researchers who analyzed samples collected between the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024 in a mining region and very poor area of the Congo, where a particularly sustained recrudescence is underway, have found a new variant of clade I. This variant is likely already transmissible from person to person, having thus overcome the stage of zoonosis: the main trace of this transmission, namely an accentuated mutation of the viral genome due to the action of a particular human enzyme that attacks the virus, has been found at a very high frequency in the new virus, so that human-to-human transmission must already be sustained, in line with the rapid growth of the number of cases. Now, the lethality measured so far on the cases confirmed of Mpox virus of clade I is much higher than that of clade II, the virus of 2022. In the case of the new virus Ib, the lethality measured on the confirmed cases is 3.4%, but it must be considered that the sample of subjects examined in the published works is limited, and above all that lethality does not depend only on the intrinsic capabilities of the virus, but also on the general health and healthcare conditions of the patients, which are particularly precarious in the region of the Congo most affected. Moreover, the mechanical reason for the higher lethality of viruses of clade I compared to those of clade II is not known, so it is necessary to wait for better data and studies in this regard. 'The new virus has already spread quickly, with the first case outside the continent identified in Sweden; given that it is a virus capable of causing severe pathology and potentially high lethality, the WHO has sounded the alarm, in order to activate all the bureaucratic procedures to contain the emergence of a possible pandemic, just like in 2022. This has already allowed millions of dollars to be allocated to the new emergency, both for monitoring and for preparing vaccine stocks. Although it has not yet been determined whether the available vaccines are effective against the new variant, it is expected that they will work, and since 2022 companies such as Moderna have been preparing new RNA vaccines, which can be adapted more quickly to any new variant. What is needed now are data: on the mechanism and efficiency of virus propagation, on the effectiveness of old and new vaccines, on the clinic and diagnostics. Above all, a new mentality is needed: other viruses will arrive, and this is just one of the new packages of genetic information parasite that evolution has in store for us. Today we can identify them in time, read their genome, copy the product of their evolution and thus obtain vaccines (and soon drugs) based on RNA, able to pursue evolution at its own speed.'

Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden Confirms First Case Of Deadly Clade I Variant Of Mpox Strain Circulating In Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the contagious mpox strain, originating from central and eastern Africa. This marks the first known infection of this strain outside the African continent. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency, and authorities are closely monitoring the situation to prevent further transmission and ensure public health safety. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.' The WHO has reported a concerning rise in Mpox cases in Africa this year, with over 14,000 cases and 524 fatalities. The international vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on sending vaccines to affected countries in Africa, but there may be a delay due to WHO approval. Health experts warn that clade 1 and its variant, clade 1b, can lead to more severe symptoms than clade 2.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first case of a new mpox strain outside of Africa, in Sweden. The person was infected with the clade Ib type of mpox while in Africa and is receiving treatment. Public health experts warn that this could lead to rapid international spread of the disease. According to the WHO, there have been 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the outbreak began in January 2023. The global vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on getting shots to countries affected by the outbreak. The US and Canadian officials have not identified any cases so far, but the CDC is watching the outbreak closely. Dr. Brian Ferguson said, 'There will likely be more here and in other parts of the world as there are currently no mechanisms in place to stop imported cases of mpox happening.' Lawrence Gostin added, 'The emergence of a case on the European continent could spur rapid international spread of mpox.'

Colombia's Minister of Health, Guillermo Jaramillo, confirmed that the clade I variant of the Mpox virus has not been detected in the country. According to Jaramillo, the clade I variant has not been found in the Americas, but Colombia has reported over 4,000 cases of infection by the clade II variant of the virus since May 2022, with 109 cases documented in 2024. The majority of cases, 85%, have been reported in Bogotá, Cali, Medellín, and Barranquilla. Jaramillo stated, 'Colombia remains committed to monitoring and controlling Mpox, working in line with international recommendations to protect the health of all our citizens. We will maintain our prevention and response actions to prevent the spread of the virus.'

**Sweden Confirms First Case of Deadly Mpox Outside of Africa**
The Swedish Public Health Agency has confirmed a case of the more infectious form of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in the country. This is the first reported case outside of Africa. According to the agency, the patient contracted the virus during a trip to Africa and sought medical attention in Stockholm. 'One person was infected during their stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak (of the 1b clade of mpox),' the agency stated. Magnus Gisslen, an epidemiologist with the agency, said that the patient was treated and advised on 'behavioral guidelines.' The mpox virus is primarily spread through close contact with infected individuals, although there has been an increase in zoonotic transmission. 'The fact that a patient with mpox is being treated in the country does not affect the risk to the general population,' the authorities said, adding that experts estimate the risk to be 'very low.' However, imported cases may continue to occur. This announcement comes a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global health emergency, with confirmed cases reported in over a dozen countries. The WHO estimates over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in African countries in 2024, exceeding 2023 records. To date, over 96% of cases and deaths have occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the new form of the disease was first observed. The 1b clade, a descendant of the 1 clade, can kill up to 10% of infected individuals, a much higher rate than the 2 type, which caused the 2022 outbreak in Brazil. There are no reported cases of the new sub-type of the virus in Brazil, and vaccination guidelines remain the same as in 2022, prioritizing high-risk groups.

The person was infected with the clade Ib type of mpox while in Africa and is receiving treatment. The WHO declared the outbreak in Africa a global public health emergency on Wednesday, and officials from the U.S. and Canada have stated that they have not identified any cases so far. Clade Ib is believed to cause a more serious type of mpox than the version that caused a public health emergency in 2022, and the virus is spread by close contact.

**Pakistan confirms first mpox case of 2024, infected person came from Saudi Arabia**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of mpox in 2024, a Pakistani national who recently returned from Saudi Arabia. According to Geo News, the infected person is from the city of Dir and is currently residing in Mardan. The health ministry has collected samples from people who came into contact with the affected man and has ordered strict monitoring of all entry points. This is not the first time Pakistan has dealt with mpox, with nine cases reported last year among travelers returning from the Middle East and other countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared mpox an international public health emergency, with 99,176 laboratory-confirmed cases reported globally from January 2022 to June 2024. Sweden has also confirmed its first case of the more dangerous variant of mpox, which was contracted during a stay in Africa. 'A person who sought care in Stockholm has been diagnosed with mpox caused by the clade I variant,' said the Swedish public health agency.

**Mpox: Sweden confirms first case of 'more grave' variant outside Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious Clade I variant of mpox, a viral infection that spreads through close contact, marking the first time it has been found outside Africa. This comes after the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to other countries. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Mpox 2024 mapped: Find out how many cases have been confirmed around the world**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has seen over 17,000 cases confirmed across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. The emergence of a new strain, clade 1b, is spreading mainly through sexual networks and has been identified in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The organisation is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of $15 million. The US government has stated the risk to the general public is 'very low', with no cases of clade I reported, but has provided $17 million to support mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**Mpox outbreak in Africa: Immediate risk to Singapore is low, says Health Ministry**
Singapore's Health Ministry has stated that the immediate public health risk from the mpox outbreak in Africa is low. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), all mpox infections detected in Singapore have been the milder Clade II infections, mostly during the 2022-2023 global outbreak. As of July 27, there were 10 mpox cases in Singapore, and 32 cases in 2023. The World Health Organization has declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years. MOH has informed medical practitioners and healthcare institutions to be vigilant in detecting and reporting all mpox cases, including those suspected of Clade I infections. Travellers are required to report mpox-related symptoms and travel history through the SG Arrival Card for early detection. Suspected Clade I cases will be isolated in hospitals, and close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined and monitored for up to 21 days.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, declared mpox as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the highest level of alert, after the recommendation of the Emergency Committee. The decision was made after the detection and rapid spread of a new clade of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported mpox, and the potential for further spread within and outside Africa. According to Tedros, 'The emergence last year and the rapid dissemination of clade 1b in the DRC, which seems to be spreading mainly through sexual networks, and its detection in neighboring countries to the DRC are especially concerning and one of the main reasons for my decision to convene this Emergency Committee.' The PHEIC classification indicates that the situation is grave, unexpected, and has significant implications for public health beyond national borders, possibly requiring immediate international action. Although global mpox cases have decreased since the 2022 outbreak, the disease continues to circulate, especially in regions where it was already endemic, such as the DRC. In the country, infections have increased dramatically, reaching over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in 2024, driven by a new lineage of the virus. A growing concern is that the currently circulating strain is not the same as the 2022 outbreak. The mpox virus has two main clades, Clade 1 and Clade 2. Clade 2, which was responsible for the global spread in 2022, was due to its ability to transmit sexually. However, at the end of last year, scientists identified a new version of Clade 1, called Clade 1b, whose lethality is up to 10 times higher than that of Clade 2. This new lineage also spreads through sexual contact and is the main cause of the increase in cases in the DRC. In 2024, the number of infections in the country has already equaled the total recorded in the entire previous year. Additionally, 90 cases of mpox were reported in four neighboring countries that had not previously reported the disease: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, all affected by the new strain. According to the WHO, 66% of cases and 82% of deaths in the DRC involve children under 15, with 73% of victims being men. Virologist Fernando Spilki highlights the importance of countries preparing, considering that the availability of vaccines, originally developed for smallpox, offers protection against mpox. In Brazil, one of the vaccines is already available in the SUS for high-risk groups, such as people living with HIV and low CD4 counts. The WHO has invited manufacturers to submit their vaccines for emergency use approval, which could accelerate access to immunizers in low-income countries, facilitating acquisition and distribution through partners like Gavi and Unicef.

**WHO Declares Global Health Emergency Over New Mpox Variant**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency due to a new, more deadly variant of the mpox virus, previously known as monkeypox, in Africa. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization has declared a 'public health emergency of international concern' (PHEIC). This declaration serves as a warning to authorities worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. The WHO recognizes the risk of mpox spreading internationally again, posing a health risk to various countries. The outbreak is centered in the Congo, with over 14,000 cases and at least 511 deaths reported since January 2023. Recent cases have been registered in four African countries: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Additionally, cases have been confirmed in Morocco, Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa. The WHO has also declared a global health emergency for the coronavirus and a previous outbreak of mpox in 2022. The new variant, mpox clade Ib, has a reported mortality rate of 10%. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' in July. The WHO has chosen to rename the virus to avoid discrimination, as it was previously named after the animal it was discovered in. The mpox virus is a variant of the common smallpox virus, which was eradicated through vaccination. The majority of mpox infections come from two variants: clade I and II. The new variant, clade Ib, causes a rash over the entire body, not just on the face and genital areas. The African Union has previously declared a state of emergency. A vaccine is available, with the Danish company Bavarian Nordic agreeing to supply 40,000 additional doses. The European Union has also pledged to send 215,000 vaccine doses to Africa via the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) at the request of Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke and Development Cooperation Minister Caroline Gennez.

**Africa: Mpox Cases Are Soaring in Africa - What Must Be Done to Prevent a Global Pandemic**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, showing significant differences in case fatality rates. Clade I has a case fatality rate of 3-4%, while clade II has a rate of 0.1%. The virus spreads through contact and is disproportionately affecting women and children, particularly in densely populated, low-income areas. Walter emphasizes the need for urgent measures to contain the epidemic, including educating communities on symptoms and action to take, and increasing vaccine availability.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Assess Mpox Epidemic**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that it will convene an emergency committee to assess the need to declare the Mpox epidemic, previously known as monkeypox, as a public health emergency of international concern. The decision comes in response to the increasing number of cases and the spread of the disease in several African countries. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'Given the spread of Mpox outside the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the possibility of a new international spread within and outside Africa, I have decided to convene an emergency committee to advise me on whether the epidemic constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. The committee will meet as soon as possible.' The situation in the DRC is particularly concerning, with a surge in 2024 that has already affected over 14,000 people and caused 511 deaths. Tedros noted that, despite the disease being endemic in the DRC for decades, the number of cases this year has equaled the total recorded last year and has spread to provinces previously not affected. Additionally, in recent months, around 50 cases of Mpox, along with several suspected cases, have been confirmed in four neighboring countries that had not previously reported the disease: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Uganda notified its first two cases last week in the cities of Mpondwe and Bwera, while Kenya and Burundi reported one and three cases, respectively, last month. A further concern is the strain of the virus in circulation. The current epidemic in eastern DRC is associated with a new branch of clade 1, called clade 1b, which causes a more severe form of the disease than the clade 2 that circulated globally in 2022. Tedros clarified: 'The current outbreak in eastern DRC is caused by a new branch of clade 1, called clade 1b, which causes a more severe disease than clade 2. Clade 1b has been confirmed in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, while in Burundi it is still being analyzed.' In April 2023, the WHO had reported that clade 1 was being transmitted through sexual contact, a significant change in the mode of transmission. An evaluation conducted in June on the outbreak in the DRC revealed that the new strain is associated with 'sustained community transmission, driven by sexual transmission and other forms of close contact,' which increases the risk in the country. The WHO is also continuing to monitor the presence of clade 2 in Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, and South Africa. The disease is characterized by skin eruptions that can affect genital or oral organs and can cause fever, sore throat, and lymph node swelling. Transmission occurs through close contact with infected people or animals, as well as through contaminated objects. Regarding vaccination, Tedros reported that there are two approved immunizers recommended by the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). He announced that the process of Emergency Use Listing for these vaccines has been initiated, which will facilitate access to them, especially for low-income countries. 'I have initiated the process of Emergency Use Listing for both vaccines, which will accelerate access to the vaccine, especially for low-income countries that have not yet issued their own national regulatory approval. The Emergency Use Listing also allows partners such as Gavi and UNICEF to acquire vaccines for distribution,' concluded Tedros.

**Mpox clade 1b outbreak in Central Africa is 'high risk'**
A new type of mpox, called 'clade 1b,' has been detected in Central Africa and is considered a 'high risk' by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). Clade 1b mpox is deadlier and more easily transmissible than previous forms, with mortality rates as high as 10% of infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening an expert committee to advise on whether to declare an international emergency. Between January and July 2024, 14,250 cases and 456 deaths were reported from 10 African countries, with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) being the hotspot of mpox cases, accounting for 96.3% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported this year. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that the risks to the European region are 'very low.' 'Despite a safe and effective vaccine and antiviral treatment against mpox, these are not readily available to most [African Union member states],' wrote Africa CDC in a report on July 30, 2024. 'Thus, we have listed the risk level as high.'

**Kenya Confirms First Mpox Case, Regional Outbreaks Worry Health Authorities**
The Kenyan health authorities have confirmed a 'Mpox outbreak at the Taita-Taveta border post', in the southern part of the country, 'originating from an individual traveling from Uganda to Rwanda via Kenya.' Mpox is a zoonotic disease (transmitted from animals to humans) that can also be transmitted from person to person. The outbreak is not the first in the region, as the Burundi Ministry of Health reported three cases on July 25. The East African Community (EAC) Secretariat has urged its eight member states to 'educate their citizens on how to protect themselves and prevent the spread' of Mpox. The Ivory Coast has also announced two non-fatal Mpox cases today. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), with the Clade I subtype mainly confined to Western and Central African countries, where patients are generally infected by infected animals. However, in May 2022, Mpox infections emerged worldwide, mainly affecting gay and bisexual men. The responsible Clade II subtype has been spreading since September 2023 in the DRC, a new and more deadly strain. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on July 11 of the threat that Mpox poses to global health. The DRC is being particularly affected, with over 10,000 cases reported, including 450 deaths. The WHO has received reports of cases in 26 countries over the past month.

**Burundi Reports 3 Mpox Cases, Ministry of Health Assures Public**
Burundi has reported three cases of Mpox in its capital city and a nearby town, according to the Ministry of Health. The cases, two in Bujumbura and one in Isare, about 30 km away, were confirmed after local lab tests and World Health Organization tests were conducted, said Health Minister Lydwine Baradahana in a statement late Thursday. 'The three cases are being treated in health facilities and are recovering. And the contacts are already listed and their follow-up tests are underway,' she said. 'The Ministry of Health assures the Burundian population that all measures have been taken to combat this disease.' Baradahana did not say which variant of the Mpox virus the ministry had confirmed. Mpox has been endemic in Burundi's neighboring country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for decades, but a new variant of the Clade-I virus emerged last year. The infection spreads through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms and a painful rash. Most cases are mild, but it can be fatal. Another, less severe form of Mpox - Clade IIb - spread globally in 2022, mainly through sexual contact between men. This led the WHO to declare a public health emergency, which is now over, although there are still cases and the agency has stated that Mpox remains a threat to public health.
