**Caruana Takes the Lead in SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz Croatia**
Fabiano Caruana is leading the SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz Croatia tournament with 15 points out of 18 possible, three points ahead of Wesley So, Levon Aronian, and five points ahead of Maxim Vachier-Lagrave, Jan Nepomniachtchi, and Alireza Firouzja. The tournament is not over yet, as there are 18 blitz games left, and Caruana is not strong in controlling the pace of the game. Magnus Carlsen withdrew from the tournament due to the sudden death of his mother, Sigurdur Ein. Caruana has been trying to match Carlsen's performance, winning three games in a row. He won against Anish Giri in the 8th round with a standard pawn break d6-d5. Caruana's rapid rating has increased by 39.1 points and he has moved up to second place after Carlsen. Gukesh Dommaraju, a contender for the world championship, had a big advantage in the 7th round, but Caruana not only held on but also won. Gukesh lost to Aronian in the next round. According to Garry Kasparov, the 13th world chess champion and the main organizer of the Grand Chess Tour, Gukesh still needs to learn to handle the pressure of playing at the highest level. Aronian replaced Carlsen at the last minute and is playing in his usual style. He won against Vidit Gujrathi, saying 'Not every day do the blacks allow the whites to put pawns on f6 and c6!' Nepomniachtchi did not realize his chances against Firouzja and Gukesh, but won against Gujrathi, who started an incorrect combination. Nepomniachtchi said, 'I've had so many good positions that I've never won that when the party finally comes to our street, it will be a celebration.'

**Gukesh's Quest for the World Championship Title**
The Superbet Rumania 2024 is the second event of the Grand Chess Tour, a series of five tournaments, two classical and three rapid. The first event, held in Warsaw in May, was won by Magnus Carlsen, who consistently demonstrates his superiority in all formats. The competition in Bucharest is played with a classical time control and features nine 'Supermasters' competing for the overall title. The defending champion is Fabiano Caruana, and notable absentees include world champion Ding Liren, Carlsen, and Nakamura. Gukesh, the challenger to Ding Liren, is the favorite to win the world championship, but his performance in this game suggests he may have problems. Deac, the top-ranked Romanian player, entered the tournament as a wildcard and played a Nimzo-Indian Defense. The game ended with a series of blunders, including a critical mistake on move 23, which led to a loss.
