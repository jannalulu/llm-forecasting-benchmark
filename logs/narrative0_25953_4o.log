*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, discussing yesterday's political developments in France.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Will the Prime Minister of France belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 42.75%. The strategic pact between the center and the left was strong, but not enough to secure a Together Prime Minister.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Even with Macron's dissolution of the National Assembly and the snap elections, the far-right's surge was significant. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The National Rally's momentum was underestimated. The turnout was unprecedented, but the tactical withdrawals couldn't fully counteract the far-right's gains.

**NATE SILVER:** A testament to how dynamic political landscapes can be, even with our accurate models.

*They exchange knowing looks, acknowledging the unpredictability of politics.*

**FADE OUT.**

**NATE SILVER**  
So, yesterday was quite the political whirlwind. Will the Prime Minister of France belong to the Together coalition? Yes or no?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.35%. The strategic pact between the center and left was impressive, but not enough to secure a Together Prime Minister.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The far-right's momentum post-European elections was stronger than anticipated. The snap elections reshaped the landscape, didn't they?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The unprecedented turnout and tactical voting created a complex scenario. Our models captured the nuances, but the outcome leaned slightly away from Together.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the unpredictability of politics, even with perfect models.

*They both nod, contemplating the ever-evolving political scene.*

Well, Philip, the dust has settled. Will the Prime Minister of France belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. The snap elections and strategic withdrawals were pivotal, but the far-right's momentum was stronger than anticipated.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the National Rally's success in the three-way runoffs was a game-changer. Emmanuel Macron's gamble didn't pay off this time.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. Despite the increased turnout, the Together coalition couldn't secure enough seats. The political landscape in France is shifting.
