To analyze this question, I'll break it down into several key components:

1. Historical data on world records broken at recent Olympics
2. Specific records likely to be broken at Paris 2024
3. Factors that could increase or decrease the likelihood of records being broken

1. Historical data:
Unfortunately, I don't have precise data on the number of world records broken at recent Olympics. However, it's generally understood that world records are broken less frequently now than in earlier decades, as many records have become increasingly difficult to surpass. That said, new technologies, training methods, and exceptional athletes still lead to records being broken at most Olympic Games.

2. Specific records likely to be broken:
Several articles mention specific events where world records might be broken:
- Men's pole vault (Armand Duplantis)
- Women's 400m hurdles (Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone)
- Men's shot put (Ryan Crouser)
- Women's 200m (Shericka Jackson)
- Swimming events (multiple possibilities)
- Speed climbing

3. Factors that could increase likelihood:
- Home crowd advantage for French athletes
- Technological advancements in equipment and training
- The "Olympic effect" where athletes peak for the Games
- Increased competition in certain events

Factors that could decrease likelihood:
- Many existing records are already extremely difficult to beat
- Potential for unfavorable weather conditions
- Pressure of the Olympics could lead to underperformance
- Doping controls may limit performance-enhancing methods

Considering these factors, I believe it's possible but not certain that 24 world records will be broken. The articles mention several strong possibilities, but reaching 24 would require a significant number of records to fall across multiple sports.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the relevant evidence:

1. Historical data:
- The articles don't provide specific numbers for world records broken at previous Olympics.
- However, they mention multiple records being targeted across various events.

2. Specific records likely to be broken:
- Swimming: Multiple records mentioned as targets, including in 50m, 100m, 200m, and 400m freestyle events.
- Athletics: Records in 100m women's, high jump, pole vault mentioned as likely to be broken.
- Other sports: Records in weightlifting and rock climbing also mentioned as potential targets.

3. Factors increasing likelihood:
- Technological advancements in equipment and training methods.
- Natural progression of human performance over time.
- Home advantage for French athletes may lead to peak performances.
- Increased competition and depth in many events.

4. Factors decreasing likelihood:
- Some current records are very strong and may be difficult to surpass.
- Pressure of the Olympics can sometimes lead to underperformance.
- Potential for unfavorable weather or conditions in outdoor events.

5. Recent trends:
- Multiple world records have been broken in the lead-up to the Olympics, suggesting athletes are in peak form.
- The articles mention several athletes who have been consistently improving and breaking records.

6. Expert opinions:
- Multiple coaches and athletes express confidence in breaking records.
- The Spanish Olympic Committee president predicts breaking their national medal record.

Balancing these factors, it seems likely that a significant number of world records will be broken, but 24 is a high bar. Recent Olympics have seen fewer than 24 world records broken, but the trend seems to be upward.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, with 72.50% being the most likely. Probability: 72.50%.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into several key components:

1. Historical data on world records broken at recent Olympics
2. Factors that could increase or decrease record-breaking in Paris 2024
3. Specific events/athletes likely to break records

1. Historical data:
Unfortunately, I don't have precise data on how many world records were broken at recent Olympics. This is a significant limitation. However, the articles suggest that breaking 24+ records would be exceptional.

2. Factors affecting record-breaking:

Increasing likelihood:
- Technological advancements in equipment and training
- Increased global participation in sports
- Multiple articles mentioning expectations of records being broken
- Pressure/motivation of competing on the Olympic stage

Decreasing likelihood:
- Many existing records are already at extremely high levels
- Increased anti-doping efforts
- Potential impacts of COVID-19 on training

3. Specific events/athletes mentioned as likely to break records:

Swimming:
- Léon Marchand (400m individual medley)
- Ariarne Titmus and Mollie O'Callaghan (200m freestyle)
- Kaylee McKeown (100m and 200m backstroke)

Athletics:
- Women's 100m 
- Yaroslava Mahuchikh (high jump)
- Armand Duplantis (pole vault)
- Noah Lyles (200m)

Other:
- Speed climbing

To forecast this question, I'll examine the key evidence and considerations:

1. Historical data: At the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, 17 world records were broken. This provides a baseline, suggesting 24+ records is ambitious but potentially achievable.

2. Home advantage: Paris 2024 is a home Olympics for France, which could boost performances of French athletes and create an atmosphere conducive to record-breaking.

3. Technological advancements: Improvements in training methods, nutrition, and equipment often lead to better performances over time.

4. Specific predictions: Several articles mention athletes expected to break records, including:
- Léon Marchand in 400m individual medley swimming
- Armand Duplantis in pole vault
- Yaroslava Mahuchikh in high jump
- Noah Lyles aiming for Usain Bolt's 200m record

5. New events: Breakdancing is making its Olympic debut, which guarantees at least one new Olympic record (though not a world record).

6. Swimming potential: Multiple swimming records are highlighted as vulnerable, including in freestyle events.

7. Athletics focus: Many predicted records are in athletics events, which tend to see more world records broken.

8. Post-pandemic factor: This will be the first summer Olympics fully clear of pandemic disruptions, potentially allowing for peak performances.

9. Timing: The Olympics occur late in the season when athletes are typically in peak form.

10. Conservative factors:
- Some world records (e.g., Florence Griffith-Joyner's 100m) have stood for decades.
- Anti-doping measures may limit extreme performances.
- The pressure of the Olympics can sometimes lead to underperformance.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a good chance of approaching 24 world records, but it's not guaranteed. The historical baseline from Tokyo suggests we might expect around 17-20 records. The specific predictions and favorable conditions could push this higher, but reaching 24 would require an exceptional Games.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

The articles suggest high expectations for record-breaking performances, but they don't provide enough concrete evidence to be highly confident in reaching such a specific number.

Given the information available, I would estimate a range that allows for the possibility of reaching 24 records, but also accounts for the uncertainty and difficulty of breaking so many world records.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the evidence:

1. Historical data:
- The articles don't provide specific numbers for world records broken at previous Olympics.
- We need to consider that world records are different from Olympic records.

2. Potential record-breaking events mentioned:
- Swimming: Multiple events including 400m individual medley, 200m freestyle, 50m and 100m freestyle
- Athletics: 100m women's, high jump, pole vault, 200m
- Weightlifting
- Rock climbing
- 400m hurdles

3. Specific athletes mentioned as potential record breakers:
- Léon Marchand (swimming)
- Ariarne Titmus and Mollie O'Callaghan (swimming)
- Yaroslava Mahuchikh (high jump)
- Armand Duplantis (pole vault)
- Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone (400m hurdles)
- Noah Lyles (100m and 200m)

4. Factors that could increase record-breaking:
- Home advantage for French athletes
- Improved training techniques and technology
- Motivation to perform at the Olympics

5. Factors that could decrease record-breaking:
- Many records are already very difficult to break
- Pressure of the Olympics can affect performance
- Weather conditions in Paris might not be ideal for all events

6. Recent trends:
- Sydney McLaughlin broke the 400m hurdles world record for the 5th time recently
- Multiple articles mention expectations of records being broken

7. Time factor:
- The Olympics haven't started yet, so there's still time for athletes to improve
