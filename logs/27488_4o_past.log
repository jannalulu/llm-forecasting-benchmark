To forecast the probability that the month-over-month (MoM) percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US for August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will systematically analyze the data and trends provided:

1. **Historical Data and Base Rate**: Recent core CPI figures have consistently shown increments, with July 2024 data showing a MoM increase of 0.2%. A decrease or a zero increase is quite rare in the current economic environment. Historical trends would suggest that non-negative changes are more typical.

2. **Current Economic Trends**: Inflation has been moderating, with consecutive months of easing, bringing inflation closer to the US Fed's 2% target. However, a 0% MoM change or a decrease in core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy prices) is typically uncommon without substantial deflationary pressures.

3. **Economic Indicators and Forecasts**: Articles indicate a belief that inflation is cooling, with some unwillingness by experts to anticipate a decrease below 0%. Forecasts for July mostly showed expectations of slight increases in core inflation, and there's no significant evidence suggesting that August will deviate dramatically downward from those trends.

4. **Market Expectations and Data from Reports**: Many articles suggest analysts expect the Federal Reserve might cut rates in September due to softer inflation. However, this expected rate cut often accompanies a scenario of persistent inflation moderating closer to target levels, not decreasing entirely. This positions the expectation towards a continued, though potentially slowing, MoM increase rather than zero growth.

5. **Adjusting Base Rate Assessment with Incoming Data**: Given July's 0.2% MoM increase in core CPI and an observed pattern of stable or gradually decreasing inflation from higher earlier peaks, it is still a notable jump to forecast a 0.0% or negative number for August without specific indicators. Recent inflation figures suggest retention of at least mild inflationary pressure, particularly given the Fed's concerns over housing and other cost sectors contributing to core CPI.

6. **Clashing Causal Forces**: While disinflationary pressures such as a cooling labor market and easing consumer prices might support the possibility of a smaller-than-usual inflation print, lingering economic recovery momentum and structural inflation, especially in shelter costs, tend to sustain positive changes.

Overall, given the absence of significant evidence suggesting deflationary pressures strong enough to flatten or negate inflation entirely in August 2024, it's reasonable to anticipate that inflation will continue to rise, albeit potentially at a reduced clip.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

In approaching the question of whether the month over month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, we first consider the historical context and recent trends. Historically, core CPI movements have rarely shown zero or negative growth in the absence of a significant economic downturn or deflationary pressures. The U.S. economy has been experiencing a period of moderating inflation, with recent monthly changes in core CPI generally trending around the 0.1% to 0.2% range.

Recent news articles indicate that in July 2024, the core CPI increased by 0.2% month-over-month, and year-over-year, it rose by 3.2%. Although there has been a downward trend in annual inflation rates, the monthly changes are still hovering around 0.2%, which suggests resilience in core inflation despite moderating overall inflation trends. The articles further highlight expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve due to the softening inflation and labor market data, which can have a cooling effect on future inflation but not necessarily immediately lowering August's core CPI to zero or negative territory.

Given this context, our reference class for core inflation includes mostly small positive monthly changes, and the articles do not suggest any extraordinarily deflationary forces specific to August 2024. The Cleveland Fed and other forecasting institutions have not predicted a negative movement. Therefore, the base rate for a month-over-month percentage decrease to 0.0% or less in such an environment might be relatively low.

Adjustments in prediction are made with caution, as market expectations and potential interest rate decrease announcements could influence futures rates, but these have not historically led to immediate deflationary monthly readings in core CPI. Hence, the probability that core CPI falls to 0.0% or less in August 2024 is considered low but not impossible.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I need to analyze the relevant data and context:

**1. Base Rate and Historical Analysis:**
Historically, core CPI decreases or remains 0.0% infrequently, as inflation tends to have a slow, sticky nature given persistent factors like housing and services. Recent trends show core CPI increases generally around 0.1% to 0.3% month-over-month.

**2. Recent Data and Trends:**
The most recent data shows a 0.2% month-over-month increase in core CPI for July 2024. The report on core CPI from John Kerschner notes a decrease of 0.2% in August, which matches the criteria for a "Yes" resolution. However, conflicting information (such as an earlier expectation of continued slight increases) casts some doubt.

**3. Market Expectations and Economic Indicators:**
Market consensus often shapes expectations and confidence levels about inflation. The anticipation of a 0.25% to 0.50% rate cut by the Fed suggests the markets believe inflation is easing, which supports the notion of either stable or slightly lower inflation figures. This shows sentiment towards a decrease in inflationary pressures.

**4. Clashing Forces and Economic Conditions:**
Factors like softening in the job market, decreasing demand compressions, and the reduction in price pressures (especially in sectors like automobiles and shelter) align with disinflationary trends. Conversely, persistent pressure from auto insurance and shelter could prevent a marked decrease.

**5. Balance and Error Avoidance:**
- **Inside vs. Outside View:** While specific predictions point to a decrease in August, using broader historical patterns still indicates less likelihood for absolute declines.
- **Reacting to Evidence:** John Kerschner's statement of a 0.2% decrease is significant corroborative evidence, yet weighing other sources creates a balance towards likely minimal change.

Given these analyses and the balance of conflicting but leaning evidentiary clashing causal forces, projecting a small probability window reflects caution amid mixed signals, with a slight tilt towards Kerschner's forecast as a slightly higher possibility.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, we need to carefully evaluate current data, historical trends, and potential future developments. 

**Reference Class and Base Rates:**
Core CPI inflation rarely records a 0.0% or negative month-over-month change. Historical data shows that core CPI typically experiences some degree of increase due to ongoing economic factors such as consumer demand and cost structures. Previous reports indicate fluctuations between -0.1% to +0.3% in recent years during periods of considerable economic adjustment.

**Current Situation:**
Recent articles report:
- A 0.2% month-over-month increase in both headline and core CPI for July 2024.
- A series of data points reflecting slight declines in both annual and monthly rates overall, but with continued pressure from specific categories like shelter costs.
- General expectations for ongoing easing of inflationary pressures, supporting potential interest rate cuts.

**Economic Indicators and External Influences:**
- The Federal Reserve is contemplating potential interest rate cuts, indicating a belief that inflation is sufficiently under control.
- Market expectations suggest a gradual decline in inflation rates, although risks of economic slowing have been highlighted.
- Key pressures such as shelter costs remain but do not appear substantial enough to counter the broader easing trend.

**Adjustments and Conclusion:**
Given the July data plus prevailing economic conditions, the probability of August's core CPI being 0.0% or less is relatively low. The overall disinflationary trend contributes to the expectation of another subdued reading, though not necessarily zero or negative, especially considering past base rate trends.

My prediction considers the likelihood of slight month-over-month increases continuing, influenced by residual economic pressures such as shelter and auto costs. Thus, I base my prediction range more on aligning with recent figures while also acknowledging uncertainties in ongoing economic shifts.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, but 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US for August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I begin by assessing historical trends and current conditions.

**Historical Base Rate:**
Typically, core CPI rarely decreases. The primary driver utilities, rents, and other service costs have a persistent upward bias. Over the recent year, month-over-month changes in core CPI have generally remained positive, fluctuating between 0.1% and 0.4%.

**Current Economic Conditions:**
The recent months have seen a consistent pattern of decreasing annual inflation, and the latest data point from the news articles states a 0.2% increase in the core CPI for July. The consistent easing of inflation is considered a positive sign by both market analysts and policymakers. However, the probability of a month-over-month core CPI being 0.0% or less historically remains low due to structural inflationary pressures like shelter and service costs mentioned in multiple articles. 

**Latest News and Speculation:**
Reports do predict cuts in Fed rates due to a slowdown and moderating inflation, which reflects cautious optimism. However, none suggest an outright negative or zero monthly change in CPI. The Fed’s interest rate cuts may also have a slightly inflationary impulse, adding upward pressure to the index indirectly as well.

**Balancing the Evidence:**
The probability of a 0.0% or less change is still relatively low. Even during significant swings in price levels, especially considering historical antecedents and current conditions, the likely scenario is a moderation rather than an elimination or reversal of inflationary pressures.

**Final Assessment:**
Combining all reference points and adjusting for the unique present scenario leads me to deduce that some inflation persists, albeit at moderate and possibly diminishing rates. Based on a balanced assessment of these variables, I conclude that the likelihood of the core CPI change being 0.0% or less is low, though not impossible.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 3.00%, but 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US for August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I begin by assessing historical trends and current conditions.

**Historical Base Rate:**
Typically, core CPI rarely decreases. The primary driver utilities, rents, and other service costs have a persistent upward bias. Over the recent year, month-over-month changes in core CPI have generally remained positive, fluctuating between 0.1% and 0.4%.

**Current Economic Conditions:**
The recent months have seen a consistent pattern of decreasing annual inflation, and the latest data point from the news articles states a 0.2% increase in the core CPI for July. The consistent easing of inflation is considered a positive sign by both market analysts and policymakers. However, the probability of a month-over-month core CPI being 0.0% or less historically remains low due to structural inflationary pressures like shelter and service costs mentioned in multiple articles. 

**Latest News and Speculation:**
Reports do predict cuts in Fed rates due to a slowdown and moderating inflation, which reflects cautious optimism. However, none suggest an outright negative or zero monthly change in CPI. The Fed’s interest rate cuts may also have a slightly inflationary impulse, adding upward pressure to the index indirectly as well.

**Balancing the Evidence:**
The probability of a 0.0% or less change is still relatively low. Even during significant swings in price levels, especially considering historical antecedents and current conditions, the likely scenario is a moderation rather than an elimination or reversal of inflationary pressures.

**Final Assessment:**
Combining all reference points and adjusting for the unique present scenario leads me to deduce that some inflation persists, albeit at moderate and possibly diminishing rates. Based on a balanced assessment of these variables, I conclude that the likelihood of the core CPI change being 0.0% or less is low, though not impossible.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 3.00%, but 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.
