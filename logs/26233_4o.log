To make a prediction regarding whether the domestic box office opening of "Deadpool & Wolverine" will surpass that of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" combined ($185,548,391), I will evaluate the information provided from various sources and apply the practice of superforecasting.

1. **Base Rates and Reference Class**: Historically, the Deadpool franchise has shown strong box office results. The original "Deadpool" (2016) had a domestic opening of $132.4 million. For comparable recent Marvel R-rated films, achieving high opening numbers is possible but not guaranteed.

2. **Current Predictions**: 
   - Recent tracking estimates for "Deadpool & Wolverine" are predominantly in the range of $160 million to $165 million, as mentioned consistently across several sources, including IMDb, Deadline, and Variety.
   - Quorum holds a more ambitious view with projections ranging as high as $200 million to $239 million. There is skepticism about Quorum's accuracy, given their history of overestimating.

3. **Challenges and Risks**:
   - Despite the R-rating and some concern about overestimates in predictions, "Deadpool & Wolverine" benefits from the MCU brand, the popularity of the characters, and the expectation surrounding this particular film.
   - The movie's execution, competition from other films, or market conditions could impact the opening numbers.

4. **Trend Analysis**: 
   - There's high anticipation and engagement noted, with presales already at $19 million.
   - If tracking projections are correct and trends continue, there is a strong chance the movie will do well, but crossing the specific $185.5 million bench remains a challenge.

5. **Balance Between Views**: 
   - Outside view: Analyze the generic success of similar Marvel movies. Despite some recent Marvel movies performing below expectations, this specific film seems to tap better into the audience interest.
   - Inside view: Evaluate unique properties – the pairing of Deadpool and Wolverine could boost box office performance significantly, beyond typical Marvel releases.

Considering these factors, I am leaning towards a cautious optimism. Many conservative estimates suggest a debut slightly under the target, making the "Yes" outcome not a certainty but plausible if late momentum builds. 

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast whether "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the domestic box office opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" combined, we must assess various factors influencing box office performance.

1. **Base Rate and Historical Comparisons:**
   - Reviewing similar films, "Deadpool" had an opening of $132.4 million, and "Deadpool 2" garnered about $125.5 million. "The Wolverine" opened with $53.1 million. The sum of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" is $185.5 million. 

2. **Current Box Office Trends:**
   - Recent articles specify projections ranging mostly from $160 million to $165 million, with some sources indicating the possibility of a $200+ million opening. However, these outlier projections are more speculative, driven by initial hype rather than realistic historical performance.

3. **Market Expectations and Bias in Projections:**
   - There's an acknowledgment of overestimating Marvel openings in recent projections and challenging market conditions for R-Rated films. Quorum's record of overestimating should anchor expectations toward conservative estimates.

4. **Potential Variables:**
   - The movie is leveraging significant star power with Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.
   - It's an R-Rated film with some inherent box office limitations.
   - The release date doesn't clash with similar genre blockbusters, but the box-office environment is fragile, as mentioned in articles regarding "Inside Out 2" and other big names in 2024.

5. **Internal and External View:**
   - The internal view (specific to "Deadpool & Wolverine") largely anticipates success due to Marvel's strategy and marketing. 
   - Historically, looking at both "Deadpool" films and other MCU ventures like "Doctor Strange" and "The Spider-Man" series, there's precedence for robust openings.

6. **Analytical Summary:**
   - Given the conservative $160-$165 million range reported repeatedly, balanced against speculative and probably inflated numbers of $200 million or more, the cautious evidence supports a forecast below the combination of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine." However, the probability of actual results exceeding given the soft target is still considerable due to superhero film tendencies to outperform.

My forecast aims for both calibration and resolution by weighing the provided projections, acknowledging potential overoptimism, and grounding on conservative figures. Therefore, in the context of maximizing forecasting accuracy:

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of "Deadpool & Wolverine" achieving a domestic box office opening higher than $185,548,391, I will follow superforecasting principles by considering historical data, comparing trends, and assessing current reports. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reference Class Forecasting**: Historically, superhero movies, especially in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), tend to perform well at the box office, with inflated expectations around sequels, crossovers, and franchise expansions. Notably, the "Deadpool" franchise itself has seen significant success, with the first "Deadpool" film setting a record for an R-rated opening at $132.4 million.

2. **Base Rates and Adjustments**: The box office forecast for the opening weekend of "Deadpool & Wolverine" has fluctuated between $160 million to potentially exceeding $200 million. This range suggests a strong performance history and considerable interest, markedly above the threshold required for a "Yes" resolution ($185,548,391).

3. **Current Trends and Market Conditions**: The movie is receiving considerable pre-release buzz, with record-breaking trailer views and significant presale ticket numbers that indicate high anticipation. While projections of $200 million or even $239 million have been tempered by some reports such as the more conservative $160-$165 million, changes in estimates are common and can reflect different degrees of promotional uptick or market adjustments.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**: On the supportive side, the combination of popular characters like Deadpool and Wolverine, the expansion of the MCU narrative, and post-pandemic box office resurgence are positives. Counterpoints include the competitiveness of the movie release window, potential viewer fatigue in superhero genres, and pressure from the R-rating limiting audiences.

5. **Calibrated Adjustments and Uncertainty Considerations**: Given the strong indicators of a high-grossing opening and broad range of expert predictions, balancing the probability of this occurring becomes essential. The high end represents optimistic scenarios, while early conservative tones translate to lower bounds.

Given these insights, the movie appears set to exceed the $185,548,391 threshold significantly, with potential surprises primarily on the higher side. Therefore, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, but 92.50% being the most likely. Probability: 92.50%.

To forecast whether the domestic box office opening of "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the combined opening of "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" ($185,548,391), I'll follow several structured steps:

### Reference Class of Events:
1. **Historical MCU and R-rated Openings**: 
   - "Deadpool" (2016) opened at approximately $132.4 million.
   - "Deadpool 2" (2018) opened at about $125.5 million.
   - Highest R-rated opening: "Joker" at $96 million.
   - Recent Marvel franchise releases, like "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness", have opened strong.

2. **Recent Tracking for the Film**:
   - Many reports indicate opening projections between $160 million and $165 million.
   - Occasional higher estimates upwards of $200 million to $239 million are mentioned, but these come with caution due to overestimation tendencies.

### Evidence and Arguments:
1. **Strong Indicators (For Exceeding)**:
   - Reports abound predicting a strong box office opening, frequently citing records for an R-rated film.
   - News articles highlight presales already ahead of significant titles like "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3".

2. **Counter Indicators (Against Exceeding)**:
   - Higher, more ambitious opening estimates (e.g., $200 million+) might be affected by overestimation or overhyped by optimists like Quorum, who have a record of overestimating.
   - Some more conservative reports fixate on $160-$165 million, suggesting a tight race to beat the combined $185.5 million benchmark.
  
3. **External and Market Factors**:
   - Marvel films' current trends and performances.
   - The potential impact of the R-rating, which might limit the audience slightly compared to PG-13 Marvel outings.
   - General economic and audience willingness to pay and attendance trends.

### Probability Assessment:
1. **Base Rate of Exceeding**:
   - Similar major franchise openings have often exceeded benchmarks on ambition but suffered slight slides (examples: earlier MCU films, recent sequels).
   - Given current projections aligning closely with the threshold, a balanced approach is to weigh forecasts with an additional skepticism of overly optimistic previews. 

2. **Adjustments for Contextual Factors**:
   - Frame the recent $160-$165M estimates as the conservative, "grounded in reality" basis compared to occasional outliers at the $200M+ mark.
   - Consider the impact of the R-rated barrier and recent Marvel fatigue on the upper limits being shrunk down compared to their initial aspirational figures.

Complementing my estimate with broader trends in the franchise and taking account of current market trends:

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To determine the likelihood of "Deadpool & Wolverine" having a domestic box office opening higher than the $185,548,391 combined opening of "Deadpool" (2016) and "The Wolverine" (2013), I will examine the provided information, including reference classes and base rates, while considering the current situational evidence and potential biases. I’ll include the elements of superforecasting to achieve a well-rounded prediction.

**Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
1. Historically, superhero movies, particularly those within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), tend to perform strongly at the box office.
2. "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" had strong individual box office performances, particularly as R-rated films.
3. The original "Deadpool" opened at $132.4 million, setting a high bar for R-rated films.

**Situational Analysis:**
1. The current articles predominantly forecast a domestic opening between $160 million and $165 million. However, some earlier projections mentioned a possible range up to $200-$239 million, hinting at exceptional expectation.
2. The movie features popular characters (Deadpool and Wolverine) with Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman reprising roles, increasing its potential draw.
3. Early ticket sales and presales indicators show strong performance, albeit with some variability.
4. It is noted that some forecasts, like those from Quorum, have a track record of over-predicting Marvel openings, and this should be considered a cautionary factor.

**Balancing Internal and External Views:**
- **Inside View:** The inside view details the specific potential of "Deadpool & Wolverine," which includes market trends, ticket presales, and the appeal of characters and actors.
- **Outside View:** Comparisons with past R-rated box office records and similar movie performances.

**Forecast Adjustments:**
1. Balance of modest projections ($160-$165 million) and higher speculative ones ($200-$239 million) suggests caution around above-$200 million claims.
2. A precise average or median would consider the heavier weight towards the sub-$185.5 million predictions, given that these come from closer-to-release analyses.

**Superforecasting Tenets:**
1. Market and expert predictions generally skew lower than the crucial threshold. Therefore, mid-range estimates require downward correction towards past achievements rather than optimistic speculations.
2. The reactionary mid-forecast adjustments involve risk management between potential overreacting to optimistic speculations and underreacting to cautionary signals, such as repeated lower estimates in recent articles.

**Conclusion & Probability Estimate:**
Considering all these factors, including the guidelines on risk management and probability estimation, I place the probability that the "Deadpool & Wolverine" opening will exceed the necessary $185,548,391 threshold as lower than the most aggressive estimates had expected, but still slightly above pure pessimism due to strong character interest and historical precedent.

To determine the likelihood of "Deadpool & Wolverine" having a domestic box office opening higher than the $185,548,391 combined opening of "Deadpool" (2016) and "The Wolverine" (2013), I will examine the provided information, including reference classes and base rates, while considering the current situational evidence and potential biases. I’ll include the elements of superforecasting to achieve a well-rounded prediction.

**Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
1. Historically, superhero movies, particularly those within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), tend to perform strongly at the box office.
2. "Deadpool" and "The Wolverine" had strong individual box office performances, particularly as R-rated films.
3. The original "Deadpool" opened at $132.4 million, setting a high bar for R-rated films.

**Situational Analysis:**
1. The current articles predominantly forecast a domestic opening between $160 million and $165 million. However, some earlier projections mentioned a possible range up to $200-$239 million, hinting at exceptional expectation.
2. The movie features popular characters (Deadpool and Wolverine) with Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman reprising roles, increasing its potential draw.
3. Early ticket sales and presales indicators show strong performance, albeit with some variability.
4. It is noted that some forecasts, like those from Quorum, have a track record of over-predicting Marvel openings, and this should be considered a cautionary factor.

**Balancing Internal and External Views:**
- **Inside View:** The inside view details the specific potential of "Deadpool & Wolverine," which includes market trends, ticket presales, and the appeal of characters and actors.
- **Outside View:** Comparisons with past R-rated box office records and similar movie performances.

**Forecast Adjustments:**
1. Balance of modest projections ($160-$165 million) and higher speculative ones ($200-$239 million) suggests caution around above-$200 million claims.
2. A precise average or median would consider the heavier weight towards the sub-$185.5 million predictions, given that these come from closer-to-release analyses.

**Superforecasting Tenets:**
1. Market and expert predictions generally skew lower than the crucial threshold. Therefore, mid-range estimates require downward correction towards past achievements rather than optimistic speculations.
2. The reactionary mid-forecast adjustments involve risk management between potential overreacting to optimistic speculations and underreacting to cautionary signals, such as repeated lower estimates in recent articles.

**Conclusion & Probability Estimate:**
Considering all these factors, including the guidelines on risk management and probability estimation, I place the probability that the "Deadpool & Wolverine" opening will exceed the necessary $185,548,391 threshold as lower than the most aggressive estimates had expected, but still slightly above pure pessimism due to strong character interest and historical precedent.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 54.00% being the most likely. Probability: 54.00%.
