Let me think about this step by step:

1. Pavel Durov is the founder of Telegram and is known to be somewhat nomadic, having moved between several countries over the years.

2. The timeframe is very short - only about 1 month from today until October 1, 2024.

3. As a high-net-worth individual and tech entrepreneur, Durov has the means and ability to travel freely.

4. Given his past patterns, he often travels for business meetings and conferences.

5. France, particularly areas like the French Riviera, is a popular base for wealthy individuals, but they typically travel frequently.

6. One month is a relatively short period, and there might not be major tech conferences or business reasons forcing travel during this specific window.

7. However, the resolution criteria is very broad - even a day trip would count as "Yes".

8. Given his resources and typical lifestyle, plus the broad criteria where any brief trip counts, there's a fairly high chance he would leave France at least once in a month.

Considering these factors, particularly the short timeframe but very broad resolution criteria:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 85.20%, with 75.30% being the most likely. Probability: 75.30%
