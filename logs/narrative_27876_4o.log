INT. WAR ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with tension as SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a digital display. The map shows Pokrovsk, a focal point in the ongoing conflict.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Given the steady Russian advances and the high personnel costs, it was almost inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The Ukrainian offensive in Kursk barely dented their momentum. It was a calculated push by Russia.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(skeptical)  
Yet, the human cost is staggering. The question is, at what price?

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(solemnly)  
For Ukraine, the loss of Pokrovsk means a tougher battle ahead in Donetsk. 

The room falls silent, the weight of the prediction settling in.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(resolute)  
Our models were never wrong. But the reality is harsh.

They watch the map, a testament to the relentless march of conflict.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, reviewing their final assessments.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s official. The ISW map confirms Pokrovsk remains under Ukrainian control.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.75%. The Russian advance was steady but costly. The Ukrainian defenses held firm, despite the pressure.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The Kursk offensive might have been a gamble, but it seems to have paid off in slowing their momentum.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Remarkable, given the dire predictions after Avdiivka. Yet, the resilience of the Ukrainian forces continues to surprise.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed, this will be a pivotal moment in the conflict. The stakes remain high in Donetsk.

They nod, acknowledging the weight of the events and the accuracy of their predictions.

FADE OUT.
