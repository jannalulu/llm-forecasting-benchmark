**Carlsen to Face Niemann in Speed Chess Championship-2024 Semifinals**
Magnus Carlsen has confirmed that he will play in the Speed Chess Championship-2024 in Paris, despite his previous conflicts with Hans Niemann. Niemann, who has been accused of cheating, has been reinstated on Chess.com and has been performing well in the tournament. Carlsen has stated that he will not engage in a discussion with Niemann, saying 'I've said what I had to say on camera and in the documentary that will come out.' Carlsen has won the Speed Chess Championship three times, while Niemann has been accused of cheating and has been at the center of a scandal involving Chess.com and other top players. The two players will face off in the semifinals of the tournament, which is being held in Paris in September. 'I think he's a sick and lost person who wanted to destroy my life,' Niemann said in an interview. 'He did what he did out of pure revenge. I don't understand how people don't sympathize with what happened to me. I wasn't the aggressor, I wasn't the cause of all this, all I did was win a chess game. I don't understand how you can't come to the conclusion that Chess.com, Magnus, Hikaru, the Chess.com streamers - all of them entered into a conspiracy to destroy my life, not because they think I'm a cheater, but because they have common financial interests.'

The semi-finals, as well as the match for third place and the final, will take place from September 6-8. The tournament has a prize fund of $175,000.

**Chess Rivals Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann to Face Off for the First Time Since Cheating Controversy**
Rival chess grandmasters Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann will face off for the first time since the cheating controversy in September 2022. Carlsen had previously stated he didn't want to play against Niemann again, citing concerns about cheating. However, thanks to the Speed Chess Championships, they will now compete in the semifinals on September 6. The winner will advance to the championship and compete for the top spot and a share of the $175,000 prize pool in Paris, France.

The lawsuit was eventually dropped, and Niemann was reinstated by Chess.com. Niemann has vowed to become 'the best chess player in the world.' The question remains whether he will achieve this goal. 'We must do something about cheating, and for my part going forward, I don't want to play against people that have cheated repeatedly in the past, because I don't know what they are capable of doing in the future,' Carlsen wrote on X.

**Carlsen and Niemann to Face Off Again After Two-Year Rivalry**
Magnus Carlsen will face Hans Niemann for the first time in two years at the Speed chess championship (SCC) in Paris in September. The two players were involved in a major scandal two years ago when Niemann was accused of cheating using vibrating anal beads. Carlsen was defeated by Niemann and subsequently dropped out of the tournament. The scandal led to widespread media coverage and even a joke by Måns Zelmerlöw at the Idrottsgalan earlier this year. Niemann later sued Carlsen for $1 billion, calling him 'corrupt' and 'a coward' in the lawsuit. However, the lawsuit was later dropped by an American court. Now, it remains to be seen if the rivalry has been put to rest when they meet in the SCC semifinals on September 6.

**Niemann Launches Frontal Attack on Carlsen, Accusing Him of Lying and Trying to Destroy His Life**
Hans Niemann has launched a frontal attack on Magnus Carlsen, calling him a 'sick person with delusional ideas who wants to destroy my life.' Niemann made the comments to Chess.com, saying that Carlsen lied about him and used his resources, money, and power to destroy his life. This is not the first time the two have clashed, as Niemann accused Carlsen of cheating in 2022 and sued him. Carlsen won the case in December, but Niemann is now speaking out again. Chess.com commentator Daniel Rensch responded to Niemann's criticism, saying that there is no conspiracy theory, but rather a deep concern about a player with a history of cheating. Rensch acknowledged that Niemann has received negative attention in the media, which can be difficult for a young person. The two are set to meet in the semifinals of the Speed Chess Championship in September, if Carlsen wins his upcoming match.

**The Top Five Swindles In Speed Chess Championship History**
The 2024 Speed Chess Championship is underway, featuring 16 top players competing in three time controls. In preparation for this year's edition, let's look at the five greatest swindles in the Speed Chess Championship's eight-year history. Magnus Carlsen's legendary status often leads opponents to give him the benefit of the doubt, as seen in his 2017 match against GM Wesley So, where he played the surprising 22.Qxd5!! to turn the game around. Other notable swindles include Eric Rosen's save against Elizabeth Paehtz in the IM Not a GM tournament, Alexander Grischuk's win and subsequent loss of Carlsen's queen, Hikaru Nakamura's stunning save in the unsound Latvian Gambit, and Carlsen's greatest swindle in SCC history, where he turned a seemingly lost game against Vladislav Artemiev into a win. 'It's not immediately obvious where Artemiev even went wrong, but Carlsen worked his magic and kept pushing the pawns up the board,' said the article. 'When you're the greatest player of all time, how important is a queen?'

**Carlsen dodges playing with Niemann again as old chess grudge flares up at World Rapid Team Championship**
The long-standing feud between Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann has flared up again at the FIDE World Team Rapid Championship. Carlsen opted to sit out the final round, where he would have faced Niemann, and instead left Ian Nepomniachtchi to play the game out. Niemann responded to Carlsen's decision by tweeting, 'If you aren't willing to handle things on the chess board, don't even bother playing.' However, Hikaru Nakamura, a fellow grandmaster, pointed out the irony of Niemann's statement, given that he had previously filed a $100 million lawsuit against Carlsen. The two players are set to face each other in the quarterfinals of the chess.com Speed Chess Championship, with the live finals scheduled for September. Meanwhile, the FIDE World Team Rapid Championship title was won by Parham Magshoodloo's Al-Ain ACMG UAE team, who beat out Carlsen's WR Chess Team and Ding Liren's Decade China Team in a narrow fashion.
