**Elon Musk Offers X Employees Chance to Earn Stock if They 'Deserve It'**
Elon Musk sent an email to X employees stating that they can opt for company stock if they demonstrate they deserve it, according to The Verge. To receive the stock, employees must submit a one-page summary of their contributions to the company. This comes after Musk previously assured employees that they could receive stock regularly, similar to SpaceX employees, but has yet to follow through on this promise. The last stock update for X employees occurred in October 2023, valuing the company at $19 billion. During this update, employees received retained stock at a price of $45 per share. Musk acquired Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion and subsequently laid off around 75% of its staff.

**Musk Posts Uncrewed SpaceX Starships Will Launch Mars Nov-Dec 2026**
Elon Musk has announced that SpaceX will launch uncrewed Starships to Mars in the Earth-Mars transfer window, which is expected to be in November-December 2026. The mission will test the reliability of landing intact on Mars, with the goal of establishing a self-sustaining city on the planet in about 20 years. Musk estimates that the cost of transporting payload to Mars needs to be reduced from $1 billion per ton to $100,000 per ton to make life multiplanetary. He believes that SpaceX's reusable rocket technology is a crucial step towards achieving this goal, and that the next step will be to launch crewed missions to Mars in 2028-2030. According to Musk, 'Being multiplanetary will vastly increase the probable lifespan of consciousness, as we will no longer have all our eggs, literally and metabolically, on one planet.'

**NASA Invites Media to View Launch of Jupiter Moon Mission - NASA**
NASA and SpaceX are targeting a launch period opening Thursday, Oct. 10, for the Europa Clipper mission, which aims to determine if Jupiter's icy moon Europa could support life. The mission will launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Europa Clipper spacecraft will carry nine instruments and a gravity science experiment to gather detailed measurements as it orbits Jupiter and conducts multiple close flybys of Europa. Research suggests an ocean twice the volume of all of Earth's oceans exists under Europa's icy crust. Media interested in covering the launch must apply for media accreditation by October 1. Accredited media will have the opportunity to participate in prelaunch briefings and interviews with key mission personnel. NASA will post updates on spacecraft launch preparations on the Europa Clipper blog.

**NASA Shuffles Crew-9 Lineup & New Antarctic Probes: Weekly Science Update**
NASA has made changes to the Crew-9 mission lineup, replacing Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson with Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on an upcoming SpaceX flight. This decision comes after issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule. The uncrewed Boeing Starliner is expected to undock by September 6 after a thorough review. NASA plans to bring its astronauts back to Earth in a SpaceX vehicle by early next year. Additionally, the SpaceX Falcon 9 may return to flight despite an ongoing investigation into a recent mission anomaly. The FAA has approved SpaceX's request to resume flights, pending other licensing requirements. NASA is also developing underwater robotic probes to study the rapid melting of Antarctic ice shelves, which could provide critical data on rising sea levels due to climate change. Furthermore, a new study recommends that women's cardiac risk assessments through blood tests should begin in their 30s, earlier than the current post-menopause evaluations.

**NASA makes adjustments to lineup for upcoming SpaceX Crew-9 mission**
NASA has made adjustments to the lineup for the upcoming SpaceX Crew-9 mission, removing astronauts Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson to accommodate others awaiting a return trip from the International Space Station (ISS). Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov will now join the mission, which is scheduled to launch no earlier than September 24. The changes are part of NASA's strategy to manage crew rotations efficiently, ensuring that all missions proceed smoothly. As a result, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who arrived at the ISS in June, are now scheduled to return to Earth with Hague and Gorbunov in February 2025. NASA has prioritized keeping the mission on track while also accommodating the astronauts waiting for their return from the ISS, reflecting the agency's commitment to maintaining a flexible and responsive approach to mission planning.

**NASA Makes Changes to SpaceX Crew to Rescue Stranded Astronauts**
NASA has made changes to the crew of SpaceX's upcoming mission to rescue two astronauts who have been stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) for weeks. The astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, were launched to the ISS on June 5 aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, but were left stranded after the spacecraft's propulsion systems failed and helium leaks were detected. NASA announced on Saturday that the two astronauts will return to Earth with SpaceX, and as a result, the space agency has had to change the crew of SpaceX's Crew-9 mission, which is scheduled to launch in February 2025. Reuters reports that Wilmore and Williams will be replaced by Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson, but Cardman and Wilson will retain their right to be assigned to future missions. The new crew will include NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, who will join the ISS in February 2025 and return with Wilmore and Williams. The Starliner spacecraft will return to Earth empty. The incident is a blow to Boeing, which has experienced a series of delays and increasing costs in its space program. Boeing officials have insisted that the Starliner spacecraft is safe, citing the results of recent propulsion tests. However, the spacecraft has experienced a number of problems, including software issues, parachute failures, and helium leaks. The incident is a reminder of the risks and challenges of space travel, and the importance of ensuring the safety of both the crew and the spacecraft.

**SpaceX to Rescue Stranded Astronauts on International Space Station**
SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, will assist NASA in rescuing two astronauts, Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Sunita 'Suni' Williams, who have been stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) since June. The astronauts were initially scheduled to return after an eight-day mission, but were unable to do so due to issues with their Boeing Starliner spacecraft. According to NASA, the two astronauts will return to Earth in February 2025 aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which has completed around a dozen crewed missions to space since 2020. Mark Nappi, head of Boeing's Starliner program, said, 'I know this is not the decision we were hoping for, but we are ready to take the necessary actions to support NASA's decision.' NASA's Steve Stich, Commercial Crew Program Manager, stated that there was 'only a small disagreement (between NASA and Boeing) on the level of risk.' The focus remains on ensuring the safety of the crew and the spacecraft, according to Nappi. This comes after NASA awarded SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract in October 2021 to use its Starship rocket to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in over 50 years. The announcement arrives amidst a federal investigation into SpaceX over allegations that the company forced employees to sign non-disclosure agreements. The investigation has been paused after SpaceX filed a lawsuit challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

**Blue Origin's New Glenn Rocket to Launch Probes to Mars**
Blue Origin has been chosen by NASA to launch two scientific probes to Mars using its heavy-lift rocket New Glenn, which will be making its inaugural flight. The mission, called ESCAPADE, is scheduled to launch before the end of the year and will measure the Martian atmosphere. This will be a complex first mission for the New Glenn rocket, which has never launched before. Blue Origin is racing against the clock to meet the launch window, which has been delayed several times but must occur by the end of October to avoid a two-year wait. The launch date is now set for October 13, 2024, pending final preparations and favorable weather. A successful launch would be a significant achievement for Blue Origin, which is competing with SpaceX in the space industry.

**Android 15 Update for Pixel Devices Postponed to October 2024**
Google has completed the beta testing of Android 15, version 4.2, and is now working on the QPR1 update. However, the expected update for Pixel devices will be delayed and will not be available before October 2024. The update may even arrive in mid-October, a decision made to ensure greater stability of the operating system before the final release. Google is also testing Android 15 QPR1, which is expected to be released in December this year. Android 15 introduces some interesting new features, such as Private Space, a new function that improves personal data security, and a new volume panel based on the Material You design, which makes the interface more intuitive and customizable. Additionally, changes have been made to the widget selector, making it easier to access and manage widgets on the home screen. It's worth noting that, even though the Android 15 source code will be available on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) next week, this does not mean that the update will arrive immediately on Pixel devices. In fact, there was a 15-day gap between the release of Android 12's source code and the update for Pixel devices last year, and this year the gap seems to be even longer. As stated by Google, 'the last planned update' was Beta 4.2, but further optimizations were needed to delay the final release. Google is now working on QPR1, which will be released in December.

**Android 15 Pixel update rumored to not launch until October**
A new report suggests that the Android 15 Pixel update may not be available until October, 'possibly even in the middle of the month.' According to Android Authority, the update is being withheld to improve its stability. This means that the Pixel 9 series and other phones may receive the September 2024 security patch with Android 14 next month. Android 15 Beta 4 was released in July, and Google has since moved on to testing QPR1, which is expected to be released in December. The delay is surprising, given that Android 15 is fairly stable, and the Pixel 9 series is shipping with Android 14, with some features from Android 15 backported. Android 15 will include features like Private space, a new Material You volume panel, and tweaks to the widgets picker.

**Blue Origin's New Glenn Rocket Set for First Test Flight in October**
Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket is set to make its first test flight in October, according to the company. The rocket will carry two small satellites, Photon, developed by Rocket Lab, to study the Martian magnetosphere. The satellites were delivered to the launch site on August 19 for integration with the rocket. The choice of mid-October for the launch is likely due to favorable conditions for Mars missions during this time. The New Glenn rocket is a larger version of the one used for suborbital tourist flights by Blue Origin. It was announced in 2016 and is expected to compete with heavy rockets from other companies, such as SpaceX's Falcon Heavy. As stated by an anonymous source, 'The launch of New Glenn is a significant step for Blue Origin, and we are excited to see the rocket in action.'

**Elon Musk Offers Stock Options to X Employees, But With a Catch**
Elon Musk sent an email to employees announcing that they can receive stock options if they demonstrate their worth. According to the email, employees will need to submit a one-page summary to the leadership explaining their contributions to the company in order to receive their stock options. This move adds to the tensions between X's leadership and employees following the recent delay in promotions without explanation. A source at X stated that the company is still behind in updating employees' annual stock, which was supposed to be distributed in April. Musk previously assured employees that they could receive stock regularly, similar to SpaceX employees, but this promise has not been fulfilled yet. The last stock update for X employees was in October 2023, when the company's value was $19 billion, which is much lower than the $44 billion that Musk paid for it. During this update, employees received restricted stock units priced at $45 per share.

**NASA will give a Boeing Starliner update on Aug. 27 and you can watch live**
NASA will hold a press conference on August 27 to provide an update on the Boeing Starliner's mission. The update will include a plan for returning the spacecraft's astronaut crew to Earth, which has been extended beyond its initial eight-day mission. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and other agency leaders will discuss the plan, which may involve landing the astronauts on Starliner as planned or returning it to Earth empty while the astronauts make their own landing on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. NASA officials have been studying several options for returning the crew, including using a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. The final decision must be made by the end of August to allow time for planning. 'NASA and Boeing have gathered data, both in space and on the ground, regarding the Starliner spacecraft's propulsion and helium systems to better understand the ongoing technical challenges,' NASA officials wrote in a statement. 'The review will include a mission status update, review of technical data and closeout actions, as well as certify flight rationale to proceed with undocking and return from the space station.'

**CoD HQ to Become More User-Friendly and Easier to Navigate**
The developers of Call of Duty (CoD) Black Ops 6 have announced that the CoD HQ will become more user-friendly and easier to navigate. Since the introduction of the horizontal panel style in MW2 2022, players have been requesting improvements to the user interface. Activision has confirmed that they will be making significant changes to the user interface and download sizes of CoD HQ. The planned updates include a new, optimized user interface, direct access to games, more control over downloads, including Call of Duty: Warzone content, and improved streaming technology to reduce file sizes. The updates will be rolled out in phases, starting with a new user interface for Call of Duty in mid-October, which will feature a landing page with the latest title and Warzone in focus, as well as a selection of 'top content' that can be accessed without scrolling. By the start of Black Ops 6, each title will have its own, individually designed user interface, making it easier for players to quickly access the desired modes and content. The first of these major updates will be released on August 21, along with MW3 Season 5 Reloaded, and will reorganize the game files and separate Warzone from the annual titles, allowing players to have more control over which game files are stored on their system. The use of texture streaming will also be expanded to reduce download sizes. As a result of these updates, future CoD downloads will be smaller, and existing files will require less storage space. Even Black Ops 6 will have a smaller download size than MW3 at launch. As an incentive, players who complete the downloads from August 21 to the end of MW3 Season 5 will receive 10x 1-hour double XP tokens, 10x 1-hour double weapon XP tokens, and 10x Battle Pass token tier skips.

**FAA Postpones Public Hearings on SpaceX's Starship Environmental Impact Assessment**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has postponed public hearings on the environmental impact assessment related to SpaceX's plans to increase the number of Starship launches from its facility in South Texas. The hearings, originally scheduled for August 13 and 15 in South Padre Island and Port Isabel, as well as an online meeting on August 20, have been postponed without a new date. The FAA announced the postponement after receiving additional information from SpaceX. The public hearings were intended to gather opinions on the environmental impact assessment project prepared for the FAA on increasing Starship launches from the Starbase facility. In July, the FAA published a revised 'multi-level' environmental impact assessment of Starship launches from Boca Chica, which is an update to the 2022 assessment that considered the impact of five Starship/Super Heavy launches and landings per year. The revised assessment considered an increase in the number of launches and landings to 25 per year, as well as other improvements, such as increased thrust. However, the report does not provide any recommendations for resolving the increase in launches or any necessary measures to mitigate the environmental impact. Previous studies did not reveal any significant consequences for the environment, but the 2022 assessment required SpaceX to implement dozens of relatively minor measures to mitigate the impact to allow launches. At the same time, it was reported that regulatory bodies have concluded that SpaceX is dumping industrial wastewater at Starbase without permission. These discharges were related to the irrigation system installed on the Starship launch pad after the first flight in April 2023 caused significant damage to it. According to the report, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a 'notice of violation' to SpaceX last week regarding the wastewater discharges. This occurred after the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its own notice of violation in March, just before the third test launch of Starship/Super Heavy. In response to these reports, SpaceX stated that TCEQ personnel observed the tests and that the system falls under the 'Texas Multi-Sector General Permit'. Recently, the company submitted a request for an individual permit for the drainage system after consulting with EPA after the notice of violation. It is unclear how this will affect SpaceX's plans for the next, fifth test launch of Starship/Super Heavy. On August 8, the company stated that the booster and the upper stage of Starship are 'ready to fly, waiting for regulatory approval'. Elon Musk stated in a social media comment on August 10 that the next Starship launch will take place 'approximately three weeks from now'.

**FAA Postpones Public Hearings on SpaceX's Starship Launches**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has postponed public hearings on the environmental review of SpaceX's Starship launches from the Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The hearings were scheduled to take place on August 13 and 15 in nearby communities, as well as an additional virtual meeting on August 20. According to the FAA, the hearings will be rescheduled, but no timeline was provided. Initially, the FAA did not explain the reason for the postponement, stating only that 'the agency is seeking additional information from SpaceX before rescheduling the public hearings.' The FAA had published a draft of a multi-level environmental assessment for Starship launches in July, which is an update to a 2022 assessment that examined the impacts of five annual launches and landings of the Starship/Super Heavy vehicle. The updated assessment considered increasing the number of launches and landings to 25 per year, as well as other upgrades to the vehicle, such as increased thrust. The report did not include any recommendations regarding allowing an increase in launches or any necessary environmental measures. Previous studies had not identified any significant environmental impacts, but the 2022 assessment required SpaceX to implement several minor modifications to allow for the launches. The postponement of the hearings coincided with a report published by CNBC on August 12, stating that regulatory agencies have found that SpaceX is discharging industrial wastewater at Starbase without a permit. According to the report, the discharges have been linked to a system installed on the launch pad after the first Starship flight in April 2023 caused significant damage to the pad. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a 'notice of noncompliance' to SpaceX last week regarding the discharges. This followed a notice of noncompliance issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March, prior to the third test flight of the Starship/Super Heavy vehicle. In response to the report, SpaceX stated on social media that the CNBC report was 'inaccurate in its facts.' The company explained that TCEQ officials had observed tests of the system and that the system was covered by a 'multi-state general permit in Texas.' SpaceX had recently submitted a request for a individual permit for the system after consulting with the EPA. The company stated that it had 'clearly requested if the system should be shut down and was informed that operations could continue.' It remains unclear what impact this will have on SpaceX's plans to test the fifth flight of the Starship/Super Heavy vehicle. The company stated on August 8 that both the booster and the upper stage of Starship are 'ready to fly, pending regulatory approval.' Elon Musk, SpaceX's CEO, stated on social media on August 10 that the next Starship launch will occur 'in about 3 weeks.' However, Musk stated on July 5 that the launch would occur 'within 4 weeks,' or early August.

**Starliner issues throw a wrench in NASA's crew rotation plans**
NASA's plans to return astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams from the ISS on Boeing's Starliner have been put on hold due to safety concerns. New test results suggest that valve issues caused thrusters to fail during docking. As a result, NASA is considering using SpaceX's Crew Dragon for a return flight, which would cause changes to both SpaceX's and NASA's launched schedules. If NASA decides not to return the astronauts on Starliner, they will launch on SpaceX's Crew-9 mission with only two crew members, while Starliner returns by itself. Boeing will need to update the mission parameters to allow for this. NASA has also delayed the launch of Crew-9 to September 24 to troubleshoot Boeing's problems. This means that Crew-8's departure from the station will be moved to late-September or early-October. SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission, which will attempt to achieve two milestones, is now scheduled for August 26.

**NASA Postpones SpaceX Mission to ISS Due to Starliner Issues**
NASA and SpaceX have postponed the Crew-9 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) due to issues with the Starliner spacecraft. The mission is now scheduled to launch no earlier than Tuesday, September 24. According to NASA, 'This adjustment provides more time for mission leaders to complete return planning. ... Ground teams for Starliner are not rushing to analyze the results of recent tests ... and confirm the system's reliability before returning Starliner to Earth.' NASA and Boeing are continuing to evaluate the readiness of the spacecraft, and no decision has been made on its return. The delay is due to the fact that the ISS has no available docking ports, with both ports currently occupied. Additionally, NASA has also postponed the launch of the 31st commercial SpaceX resupply mission to the ISS, which is now scheduled for no earlier than mid-October. The Starliner spacecraft experienced technical issues during its June 5 launch, including a failure of five engines and several helium leaks. Despite these issues, NASA maintains that the spacecraft is capable of returning the crew, but is also exploring alternative options, including replacing the Starliner with a Crew Dragon spacecraft.

**NASA and Space X Postpone Crew-9 Mission to International Space Station**
NASA and Space X have decided to postpone the launch of their Crew-9 mission to the International Space Station until September 24, initially scheduled for August 18. According to sources from the US space administration, the new 'adjustment' will give more time to the responsible parties to finalize the planning of the return of the previous flight test (Boeing Crew Flight Test), which traveled to the International Space Station and is currently docked to the orbital laboratory. The teams on the ground are still conducting numerous tests to check the integrated propulsion system of the spacecraft and confirm the reliability of the system before the return of the 'Starliner' to Earth. As stated in a press release, 'The NASA and Boeing are still evaluating the state of preparation of the spacecraft, and no decision has been made on the return of Starliner.' This delay also affects the next rotation of the US company SpaceX with the next delivery of Soyuz, scheduled not before mid-September. The teams are working to prepare the launch of the 'Crew-9' mission from the Space Launch Complex 40 of the Cape Canaveral Space Station in Florida, so that it does not coincide with the preparations of the Europa Clipper mission of the NASA, which will begin in September at the nearby Launch Complex 39A of the Kennedy Space Center. The NASA will also need to adjust the launch of the 31st commercial mission of SpaceX's services, which was scheduled for mid-October.

**NASA running out of time to bring Sunita Williams back as new SpaceX mission date set: Deadline for mid August**
NASA is facing a deadline to safely return astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore from the International Space Station (ISS) as a new SpaceX mission is set to launch on August 18. The Boeing Starliner, which launched the astronauts into space two months ago, has been experiencing technical issues and unexpected problems hindering their Earth return. NASA's ISS program manager Dana Weigel emphasized that only one spacecraft can stay onboard the ISS, and the Starliner must undock to make room for the Crew-9 mission. The Starliner's presence at the ISS is critical, as it has been conducting tests to resolve system malfunctions in space. NASA is working closely with SpaceX to ensure the crew's security and resolve any safety issues before the launch. 'We'll follow the same testing on our stage, so we'll get a check of that sensor in the second stage test,' said the manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 'We'll work through all the data, work through all the analysis and certification, and then we'll be ready to go fly.'

**SpaceX Crew-9 astronaut mission: Live updates**
SpaceX's Crew-2 mission successfully launched four astronauts to the International Space Station on April 23, 2024. The crew, consisting of NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet, lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A at 5:49 a.m. EDT (0949 GMT) aboard a Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon spacecraft. The mission marked the second operational launch of the Commercial Crew Program. The Crew Dragon spacecraft successfully docked at the International Space Station on April 24 at 5:08 a.m. EDT (0908 GMT), making history as the first used SpaceX capsule to ferry astronauts to the orbiting lab. The crew will spend the next six months on the station, conducting scientific research and experiments. 'It was a great day,' said NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough, commander of the Crew-2 mission, after the successful docking. The Crew-2 astronauts have now opened the final hatch between their spacecraft and the space station, and are preparing to enter the station. The mission is a significant milestone for SpaceX and NASA, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and the Falcon 9 rocket. The Crew-2 astronauts will spend the next six months on the International Space Station, conducting scientific research and experiments, and will return to Earth in October 2024. 'We are thrilled to have the Crew-2 astronauts on board the International Space Station,' said NASA Administrator, 'This mission is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the SpaceX and NASA teams.'

**Tesla Roadster with SpaceX Technologies to be Released in 2025**
Elon Musk announced that the next-generation Tesla Roadster will enter production and be available for sale in 2025. The prototype of the next-generation Tesla Roadster was first presented in 2017, and its production was initially scheduled to start in 2020, but has been delayed every year since then. Musk stated that Tesla will unveil an updated version of the next-generation Roadster later this year, as the original design is already 7 years old, and that the car will be released to the market in 2025. In Tesla's financial report for the second quarter of 2024, Musk shared that 'we've completed most of the design work' on the Roadster and that 'there are some additional improvements we want to make to it, but we expect the Roadster to be launched into production next year. It will be something special.' Musk also confirmed the delay of the Tesla Robotaxi announcement to October and added that the delay will allow Tesla to 'show something else'. Among the announcements may be a cheaper Tesla Model 2.

**Windows 11 Revolution: Updates to Get Smaller, Faster, and Smarter**
Microsoft has optimized the way Windows updates are received, making them smaller and faster. Starting with Windows 11 24H2, Microsoft will compare the code of the last feature update with the current update and only send the code that has changed. This approach will result in smaller, faster downloads and less storage space on the PC. The new updates will start with Windows 11 24H2 later this year. For Windows 10 and users of older Windows 11 versions, the update process will remain the same as before. Microsoft has not yet announced a specific release date for Windows 11 24H2, but it is expected to be available in September or October 2024.
