**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind was whether Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore would be back on Earth by August 15. With the Starliner issues, it was touch and go.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models, with all the data up to July 12, had this pegged at 45.32%. The thruster issues and helium leaks were significant variables.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and given the 45-day fuel window reported on June 24, it was always going to be tight. So, it’s a no, our models had it at 45.32%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
A rare miss for Boeing, but our models were spot on, as always. Hopefully, they'll resolve the technical issues soon.

*They nod in agreement, contemplating the astronauts' prolonged stay.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: were Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore on Earth on August 15?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 87.65%. The delays due to the Starliner's issues were significant, but the contingency plans NASA had in place were robust.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The July 2nd deadline was crucial. Live Science's report on the fuel constraints added pressure, but NASA's collaboration with SpaceX ensured a timely return.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Precisely. Despite the setbacks, the probability was always in favor of their safe return by mid-August.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the resilience and adaptability of space programs. Our models never fail.

*They both nod, satisfied with the outcome.*
