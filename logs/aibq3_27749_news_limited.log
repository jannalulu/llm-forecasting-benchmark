**SCC Quarterfinals: Nakamura Takes Off In Bullet, Sets Up Semifinal Match Vs. Firouzja In Paris**
GM Hikaru Nakamura has secured a spot in the Speed Chess Championship 2024 Finals by defeating GM Ian Nepomniachtchi in the Quarterfinals with a 14.5-9.5 score. Nakamura dominated the bullet games to win the match, despite Nepomniachtchi taking a three-point lead in the 5+1 segment. 'Ian Nepomniachtchi is just pouncing all over Hikaru Nakamura. He is not letting him escape,' said GM Robert Hess. However, Nakamura changed his game and strategy in the 3+1 segment, winning five out of the six games to even the score. He then took the lead in the bullet portion, winning six out of the seven games. Nakamura will face GM Alireza Firouzja in the Semifinals, which will be held in Paris in September. 'I think it'll be really exciting to play Alireza because, as I've probably said 10 times already, he is the one player who I think is at the same level as Magnus and myself in bullet,' said Nakamura.
