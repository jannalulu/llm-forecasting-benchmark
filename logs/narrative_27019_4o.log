INT. NEWSROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 5, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, analyzing data. The room buzzes with post-event analysis.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 0.01%. No formal debate occurred. Trump's August 2nd announcement was more of a publicity stunt than a genuine commitment.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right, Harris's camp never agreed. They stuck to the September 10th date with Biden. Without mutual agreement, a debate was impossible.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Fox News didn't confirm any event either. It was clear from the start; no infrastructure was in place for September 4th.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Even if Trump showed up, Harris's absence meant it wouldn't qualify as a debate. Our models predicted this scenario perfectly.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The political theater continues, but our probabilities remain rock solid.

They nod in agreement, turning back to their screens, ready for the next prediction challenge.

*Superforecasters gather around a table, laptops open. The air is thick with anticipation.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: So, did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Our models had it at 5.25%. Trump’s social media post was a curveball, but Harris's team was firm on the original date.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Right. No official confirmation from Fox News by August 6th. The logistics just didn’t add up.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Looks like the debate didn't materialize then.

SUPERFORECASTER 4: Exactly. The debate on September 4th was never formalized. Harris attended the September 10th event instead.

*They nod, acknowledging their model’s accuracy.*

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Another win for the models. The political theater is unpredictable, but our probabilities remain solid.

*They smile, confident in their foresight, as they close their laptops.*
