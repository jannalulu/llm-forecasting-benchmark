**5 Things We Must Do to Combat AI-Powered Cyberattacks**
Cybersecurity measures are no longer sufficient to protect consumers and businesses from AI-powered cyberattacks, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated and audacious. Large language models (LLMs) are being used to deceive victims and detect potential weaknesses. Research shows that 90% of threats involve social engineering, with a rise in deepfake audio and video generated using AI. OpenAI has admitted that its systems have been used by state-affiliated malicious actors to create content for phishing campaigns and malware. To combat AI-powered cyberattacks, it is essential to step up vigilance, verify the authenticity of digital communications, educate oneself on the latest tactics, and implement multifactor authentication. Additionally, zero-knowledge credentials, data verification, and a multi-pronged approach are key to mitigating the risks associated with AI-powered cyberattacks.

**Virus uses ChatGPT to write emails that appear to be written by humans**
Researchers have developed a virus that uses ChatGPT to write emails that appear to be written by humans. The virus, which was created by David Zollikofer and Ben Zimmerman, opens Outlook and begins writing responses to emails found, along with an attachment that appears to be harmless. The experiment shows how AI chatbots can be used for scams. The virus is designed to spread through email attachments and can evade antivirus scans. This is not the first time that ChatGPT has been used to create malware, and experts warn that the technology could be used for nefarious purposes. 'We asked ChatGPT to rewrite the file, maintaining the semantic structure, but changing the way variables are named and changing a bit of the logic,' said Zollikofer. The researchers believe that the use of AI chatbots could make it more difficult to detect viruses. 'Our research shows a minimum functional prototype that highlights the risks that LLMs represent for computer security and emphasizes the need for further research on intelligent malware,' they wrote in the article, which is still under peer review. The impact of artificial intelligence on cyberattacks is a growing concern, with experts warning that the technology could be used for malicious purposes. 'I think we should be worried,' said Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Surrey, who did not participate in the research. 'There are various ways we already know that LLMs can be abused, but the scary part is that the techniques can be improved. Personally, I think we're just starting to see the potential of LLMs as tools for nefarious purposes.' However, Zollikofer also believes that AI can be used for defense, saying, 'It's true we've seen how artificial intelligence can be used for attacks, but I think it's also true that it can be used for defense: if these technologies are integrated, it could improve all the protection barriers.'

**Using LLMs to Exploit Vulnerabilities**
Researchers have developed a system of LLM agents that can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. The agents, known as HPTSA, consist of a planning agent that can launch subagents to explore different vulnerabilities and determine which ones to use. The system was tested on a benchmark of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and showed a significant improvement over prior work, with a 4.5× increase in performance. The LLMs are not finding new vulnerabilities, but rather exploiting known ones in new ways. This development raises concerns about the potential for fully autonomous AI cyberattack agents. Clive Robinson, a cybersecurity expert, notes that the LLMs are not truly finding new vulnerabilities, but rather exploiting known ones by recognizing patterns and adding randomness. He also suggests that an LLM trained on physical world attacks could potentially be used to launch information world attacks.

**How cyber threats can be addressed in era of advanced AI**
The increasing use of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) in business processes brings new cyber vulnerabilities. According to the EY Ireland Tech Leaders Outlook Survey 2024, 61% of respondents identified elevated cyber risks and data protection as critical challenges. To address these concerns, organisations must secure LLMs, monitor emerging vulnerabilities, and fortify AI algorithms. AI in cybersecurity is a double-edged sword, empowering both organisations and cybercriminals. To restore the balance, organisations do not need to make significant new cybersecurity investments, but rather focus on what they already have.

**4 billion cyberattacks expected during Paris Olympics and Paralympics**
The 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics are just 8 days away, and it's not too late for businesses to prepare for the expected 4 billion cyberattacks during the 15-day competition. According to Paris 2024, these attacks can target institutions, organizations, and businesses. 'Essential sectors such as water, electricity, and transportation can be targeted,' says Julien Lopizzo, CEO of Semkel, a cybersecurity firm. 'All high-profile events are attack targets,' confirms Jerome Cameray, President of Kyndryl. 'Most companies are not prepared, but it's not too late.' To protect themselves, businesses should install antivirus software, back up their data, and consider hiring a Security Operating Partner. Julien Lopizzo also advises shutting down non-essential servers during the summer. New types of attacks, such as silent attacks and ransomware, are on the rise. Jerome Cameray warns about the use of deepfakes, which can make attackers impersonate company leaders. 'You receive a message from your CEO saying he has confidential information to share with you, and you're asked to connect to a link at 4 pm. It's a video of your CEO asking you to meet with the finance director to make some transfers... It's a fake video generated by AI.' To prevent these attacks, businesses must reduce the risk of attacks by 'avoiding having open windows and doors,' as Jerome Cameray puts it. 'It's about prevention among each employee in the company. It's in their daily routine: they're under stress, under pressure, and they receive a message saying their package couldn't be delivered, and they click on the link... It's a real evangelization work.'

**Common Cyber Threats To Be Aware of in 2024 For Businesses**
As 2024 has seen a surge in cyber threats targeting businesses, it's crucial to be aware of the most common threats to protect your online platform. Ransomware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and SQL injection are the most likely threats you may face in the second half of 2024. Ransomware is usually sent via phishing emails, while phishing attacks aim to get sensitive information. DoS and DDoS attacks overwhelm systems, networks, or websites, causing financial losses. MitM attacks intercept and change communication between parties, and SQL injection allows unauthorized access to databases. To protect your business, consider having strong firewalls, antivirus software, threat hunting software, and alert systems in place.

**Security Threats Targeting Large Language Models**
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, but they are also a new surface for hackers to attack. This article explores the different types of attacks that can target LLMs, including jailbreaking, prompt injection, and sleeper agent attacks. Jailbreaking involves exploiting loopholes to bypass safety measures, while prompt injection attacks manipulate the input provided to the LLM. Sleeper agent attacks involve embedding hidden triggers in the LLM's training data to manipulate its output. Researchers and developers are working to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities, exploring defense mechanisms such as adversarial training, input sanitization, and output monitoring. It is essential to be proactive about security to ensure the safe and responsible use of LLMs.

**Fujitsu Suffers Worm-Like Attack From Something That Wasn't Ransomware**
Fujitsu has concluded its investigation into a cyberattack that occurred in March and found that the malware was not ransomware, but a self-propagating worm that spread through its internal networks in Japan. The malware was difficult to detect and replicated onto 49 other PCs, but only affected Fujitsu's business computers and did not spread to customer networks. The attack resulted in data exfiltration, including files containing personal or business-related information about certain customers. Fujitsu has since enhanced its security measures to prevent similar attacks in the future.

**China Accuses US of Orchestrating Cyber Piracy Operation to Discredit It**
China accused the US of orchestrating a large-scale cyber piracy operation to discredit it and justify the extension of large-scale surveillance and an increase in the budget for US intelligence agencies. The report, published by China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, claims that the US agencies, particularly the NSA and CIA, fabricated evidence and manipulated reports to blame Beijing for a series of fictional cyberattacks. The analysis also highlights the involvement of US cybersecurity companies in the operation, which, according to Chinese authorities, acted under US government pressure to falsify evidence and support the false narrative. Chinese authorities claim that the plan, known as Volt Typhoon, was developed in several stages, starting in early 2023 with the creation of a supposed group. The report, which also involved the Chinese giant's Laboratory for Engineering Prevention and Control of Computer Virus Technology and the digital security group 360, emphasizes that the critical phase of the plan developed between June 2023 and January 2024, where the disinformation campaign intensified to intimidate the US Congress and ensure the approval of the extension. The report highlights supposed inconsistencies in the statements of US officials and involved cybersecurity companies, as well as the lack of solid evidence to support the accusations against China. 'There is a clear contradiction in the evidence. Before January 30, the US claimed to have dismantled the Volt Typhoon organization, but on April 18, they said these organizations were still active,' said CCTV's Du Zhenhua, an engineer at China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center.

**10 Billion Passwords Exposed in Massive Data Breach**
A hacker has released nearly 10 billion passwords, likely the largest data breach of its kind. The user 'ObamaCare' published the passwords in a file called 'RockYou2024' on an online piracy forum on July 4. According to Cybernews, this raises concerns that other cybercriminals may use the data for cyberattacks. The massive dataset adds 1.5 billion new plaintext passwords obtained from previous data breaches to a previous compilation published on the same forum in 2021, also titled 'RockYou2021'. Analysts from Cybernews stated, '[C]ombined with other leaked databases on piracy forums and dark markets, RockYou2024 may contribute to a cascade of data breaches, financial fraud, and identity theft.' Cyberattacks are multiplying. Data breaches reached a record high in 2023, according to MIT professor Stuart Madnick. In fact, ransomware attacks increased by 70% in the first nine months of last year. The use of cloud software and increasingly sophisticated ransomware has exacerbated the problem. Similarly, artificial intelligence has enabled malicious actors to create ransomware more easily, while also being used to help companies create better defenses against such threats.

**Hackers no se conforman con la virtualidad, ahora van por ti**
Cyberattacks have decreased this year due to large-scale police operations, leading cybercriminals to reorganize and even launch physical threats, according to experts. 2023 was a record year for the number of attacks and the amount extorted from victims. 'In the first four months of 2024, the number of publicly reported incidents related to ransomware has decreased compared to the first four months of 2023', said Allan Liska, cybersecurity expert at Recorded Future. WatchGuard's report on the first quarter of 2024 also notes a 23% decrease in ransomware attacks compared to the end of 2023. Ransomware software exploits security flaws in a company, public building, community, or individual, encrypting and blocking their computer systems, demanding a ransom to unlock them. This type of attack is particularly lucrative for pirates, but devastating for victims, even when they pay, as they may see their stolen data sold on the dark web. Start-up Cybelangel reported a 40% increase in attacks in 2023, while Chainalysis estimated that victims paid over $1.1 billion, a record level. Authorities are particularly concerned about ransomware. In February, the Russian group LockBit was dismantled after an international police operation. According to Allan Liska, this group represented up to 30% of ransomware attacks in recent years. By the end of May, a raid in several countries, called 'Endgame', took down over 100 servers crucial to the deployment of malicious software. 'All these operations have had a real impact on the ransomware ecosystem', says Allan Liska. 'There has been a kind of cleaning up in the ransomware scene', observes Nicolas Raiga-Clémenceau, cybersecurity expert for French consulting firm XMCO, 'which has allowed a certain number of new groups to appear and structure themselves' in recent months. Experts estimate that over a dozen new groups have emerged, including RansomHub or Hunters International, but it's too early to know if these groups will have the same level of threat as their predecessors. 'Physical consequences' 'Some of these new ransomware groups, like Scattered Spider, are now threatening to use 'new, more violent tactics', warns the Recorded Future expert. 'In the stolen data, the CEO's address or the head of security's address [of a company] sometimes appears, and when negotiations fail, the consequences could not be just digital, but also physical', added. For Luis Delabarre, the decline of ransomware also explains a greater investment by companies in more efficient defense systems. 'Today we see the results of a very delicate and difficult 2023 in terms of ransomware', says the Nomios cybersecurity expert. 'Decisions were made, and the Olympics were an accelerator'. While the Paris Olympics themselves are not a particularly sensitive target for these types of attacks, the 15 million expected visitors this summer in the French capital have sparked the appetite of cybercriminals, who have already launched illegal data collection campaigns, for example, in the form of fake online lotteries to win tickets. It's a way to deceive internet users to obtain personal data and identities, often a first step before launching a larger attack. But all experts interviewed by AFP are unanimous: ransomware attacks could quickly rebound, probably even before the end of the year. 'There's so much money at stake (for pirates) that they won't stop soon', comments Allan Liska.

**Researchers develop virus that leverages ChatGPT to spread through human-like emails**
Researchers David Zollikofer and Ben Zimmerman have developed a computer virus that uses ChatGPT to write human-like emails and spread through seemingly harmless files. The virus, called 'synthetic cancer,' can alter its code to evade antivirus scans and infiltrate a victim's system. The AI-generated emails are contextually relevant and can be used to spread malware efficiently and stealthily. The researchers have highlighted the potential risks posed by Language Learning Models (LLMs) in cybersecurity and emphasized the need for further research into intelligent malware. Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity researcher, expressed concern over these developments, stating that the techniques can be improved by asking the technology itself to help. Despite this, Zollikofer remains optimistic about potential defensive applications of these technologies.

**Sneaky Virus Uses ChatGPT to Send Human-Like Emails to Your Contacts to Spread Itself**
Researchers at ETH Zurich and Ohio State University have created a computer virus that uses ChatGPT to disguise itself and spread by attaching itself to AI-generated emails that sound like they were written by a human. The virus, called 'synthetic cancer,' can evade antivirus scans and write contextually relevant email replies, including itself as a harmless attachment. Experts warn that the tools themselves could aid bad actors in making malware harder to detect. The researchers demonstrated the virus' ability to spread by creating an email that seemed to be from a friend, inviting the recipient to a birthday celebration and attaching an executable file that would install the worm if opened. ChatGPT sometimes refused to comply with the virus' nefarious intentions, but experts believe that viruses like this are only the tip of the iceberg and that the potential for LLMs to be used for nefarious purposes is vast.

**Cybersicurezza, scatta la competizione sui deepfake detector**
The competition for deepfake detectors has started, with Intel providing an example. With four billion people expected to vote in 2024, limiting the influence of fake content on voters could be a challenge. The cybersecurity sector is facing a challenge, but also a great opportunity. Companies that adopt AI in the design of specialized digital defense systems will have strong growth prospects. However, the same AI-generated content can also be part of the solution, as the cybersecurity sector adapts large language models (LLM) to detect attacks and counter threats from dangerous code generated by other machines, representing a huge opportunity for both security and investors. Companies that prioritize investments in infrastructure or develop specialized security software and applications will have strong prospects. The protagonists of deepfakes are still one step ahead, as the amount of resources dedicated to developing new generative content is much higher than that invested in developing advanced detection techniques. Another limitation is that these tools are trained on Western data. Many deepfake detection tools today aim to identify small defects in audio and video to identify them as manipulated content. While one of the most effective techniques used adopts the opposite approach, extracting unique qualities from real films that deepfakes cannot capture. Intel's FakeCatcher, for example, is an advanced tool that identifies false images of people using photoplethysmography (PPG), a technique that measures changes in blood flow in the face. Another promising initiative is the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), which uses a digital signature to ensure more transparency in the creation of multimedia content and the tools used. However, ethical questions about privacy are lurking, with the fear that the imposed standard will reveal too much information about the image's origin, such as the location or time it was taken.

**Bing Adds Prompt Injection To Bing Webmaster Guidelines**
Bing has added a new guideline to its Bing Webmaster Guidelines, warning against prompt injection attacks on large language models (LLMs). Prompt injection is a type of cyberattack where hackers disguise malicious inputs as legitimate prompts, manipulating GenAI systems to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, or worse. The guideline states that attempting to perform prompt injection attacks can lead to demotion or delisting of a website from Bing's search results. IBM explains that there are direct and indirect prompt injection attacks, including direct injections where hackers control user input and indirect injections where hackers hide payloads in data consumed by LLMs.

**Using LLMs to Exploit Vulnerabilities**
Researchers have developed a system of LLM agents that can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. The agents, known as HPTSA, consist of a planning agent that can launch subagents to explore different vulnerabilities and determine which ones to use. The system was tested on a benchmark of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and showed a significant improvement over prior work, with a 4.5× increase in performance. The LLMs are not finding new vulnerabilities, but rather exploiting known ones in new ways. This development raises concerns about the potential for fully autonomous AI cyberattack agents. Clive Robinson, a cybersecurity expert, notes that the LLMs are not truly finding new vulnerabilities, but rather exploiting known ones by recognizing patterns and adding randomness. He also suggests that an LLM trained on physical world attacks could potentially be used to launch information world attacks.

**Over 20,000 Cyberattacks on Industrial Enterprises in Kuban Since 2024**
Over 20,000 cyberattacks have been committed against industrial enterprises in Kuban since the beginning of 2024. On average, employees encounter 160 such cases daily, with 24 being critical. Half of the cyberattacks occur on weekends or outside working hours, from 19:00 to 9:00. Experts note that the number of hacker attacks has increased during nighttime due to the absence of IT staff or reduced working hours during holidays, weekends, and nighttime. Hackers target any business, but medium and large enterprises are of particular interest due to their financial capabilities and higher risks of data breaches or service disruptions. According to Alexey Drozd, head of the information security department at SerchInform, hackers prefer to target large companies because it creates a 'buzz' and allows them to sell stolen data for a higher price. The most common method of cyberattack is social engineering, where hackers manipulate employees to send infected emails with spyware. Hackers often target data that can be sold, and there has been an increase in attempts to 'destroy' infrastructure or data for future use. Clients may also be affected, as stolen data is sold on the black market, providing access to personal information such as phone numbers, addresses, and passport data.

**LLM Agents Can Autonomously Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**
Researchers have developed a new framework, HPTSA, which allows teams of LLM agents to autonomously exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the real world. This is a significant improvement over previous studies, which showed that single agents could only exploit known vulnerabilities. The HPTSA framework uses a hierarchical planning agent to explore the system, identify vulnerabilities, and plan attacks. The agent can also launch specific sub-agents to exploit different types of vulnerabilities. The researchers tested HPTSA on a benchmark of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and found that it outperformed previous studies by up to 4.5 times. The study suggests that LLM agents can be used for both offensive and defensive cyber security purposes, but more research is needed to fully understand the implications of AI in cybersecurity.

**AI Hackers: A New Threat**
Researchers have successfully exploited unknown zero-day vulnerabilities using autonomous agents based on large language models (LLM) and hierarchical planning with task-specific agents (HPTSA). They were able to successfully breach over half of the tested websites using autonomous bot commands based on GPT-4. The bots coordinated their actions and created new bots as needed, using previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are already known, but patches have not been released yet. According to Vasily Matviyenko, head of the cybersecurity research laboratory at the analytical center of cybersecurity 'Gazinformservice', new threats related to the use of AI will undoubtedly increase, but at the same time, protection against them already exists. 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in many areas of human life, being a powerful tool for solving various tasks. Information security is also not left behind. Research confirms these predictions. AI is already being used by both black and white hackers. Therefore, it is important to be prepared to quickly respond to new threats. In this task, systems for anomaly detection based on machine learning, such as Ankey ASAP, help.'

The study found that GPT-4, a state-of-the-art AI model, was capable of exploiting 87% of vulnerabilities, while other LLMs were unable to do so. The researchers highlighted the importance of CVE descriptions in LLM success rates and emphasized the need for responsible training of LLMs to prevent their misuse in cybersecurity attacks.
