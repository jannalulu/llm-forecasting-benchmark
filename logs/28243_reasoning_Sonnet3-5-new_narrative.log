NATE: Well, Phil, looks like our models nailed it again regarding Trump's DWA shares.

PHILIP: Indeed. When Trump made that public statement about not being prepared to sell, it significantly shifted our probability calculations.

NATE: The lockup period ending on September 19th created a window of opportunity, but his financial needs were balanced against political optics.

PHILIP: Our models had it at 15.25%. The combination of his public statement, the volatile market conditions, and the political implications during election season made a sale unlikely.

NATE: The fact that no Form 4 appeared on their IR page by October 1st validated our prediction. Though he had 36 million shares to potentially liquidate, the political cost outweighed the financial benefit.

PHILIP: Another win for superforecasting methodology.

[Both nod in satisfaction]

SCENE: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.

NATE: (checking his computer) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Trump's shares.

PHILIP: Indeed. Despite the media frenzy when the lockup period ended in September, and Trump's public statement about not selling, our models had it at 12.45%.

NATE: (nodding) The combination of his legal bills and the volatile stock price made some sale probable, but his strong public stance against selling and the potential political optics worked against it.

PHILIP: And here we are - no Form 4 filing on Trump Media's IR page by October 1st. The prediction markets got a bit excited when he made that statement to reporters, but our models stayed steady.

NATE: (smirking) Sometimes the loudest signals aren't the most reliable ones.

[They both turn back to their screens, already analyzing their next prediction]

Nate Silver: *shuffling through papers* Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Trump's shares at Trump Media...

Philip Tetlock: *interrupting* Our models had it at 15.25%. The lockup period ending in September created a window of opportunity, but Trump's public statement about not selling was a strong signal.

Nate: The market reaction to his press conference statement was telling. Still, with his legal bills mounting, I'm surprised he held firm.

Philip: *nodding* The financial pressure was there, but the political optics of selling before the election would have been devastating. Our models weighted his campaign considerations heavily.

Nate: And looking back at the data we had by September 17th, the probability aligned perfectly with what actually transpired – no Form 4 filing showing any sales.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the most predictable outcome is simply taking a politician at their word.
