**Fed faces wave of data before deciding on end-of-summer rate cut**
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its July 30-31 meeting, but may change its policy statement to lay the groundwork for a rate cut in September. The Fed is waiting for data to accumulate before making a decision, with the next meeting scheduled for September 17-18. The data will include inflation and labor market reports, which will help the Fed determine if the economy is cooling down and if rate cuts are necessary. New York Fed President John Williams said, 'We're actually going to learn a lot between July and September.' The Fed has held its interest rate steady since last July, and is expected to start lowering rates if inflation continues to slow and the labor market remains in balance.

**US Federal Reserve may cut rates before inflation hits 2% target, Powell hints**
Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell hinted that the US interest rate may be cut before inflation reaches its 2% target. Powell stated that waiting until inflation reaches 2% may be too late, as the tightening of interest rates is still having an impact on inflation. Instead, policymakers are looking for 'greater confidence' that price inflation is trending towards the 2% target, which can be achieved with more good inflation data. Traders are betting on at least two rate cuts before the end of 2024, starting in September, which could result in a drop in the main federal funds rate from its current range of 5.25% to 5.50%.

**Fed Chairman Powell: Aiming to Lower Interest Rates Before the End of the Year**
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said during a speech at the Economic Club in Washington on Monday that the central bank is aiming to lower interest rates before the end of the year, based on recent economic data that has increased confidence. Powell praised the improvement in inflation readings, expressing increased confidence in the sustainability of the slowdown in inflation. He added that the Federal Reserve has not yet decided on the timing of the rate cut, but economists' forecasts indicate a cut in September, with additional cuts in November and December, according to CME data. Powell also emphasized that the labor market is slowing down, removing a major obstacle to monetary easing. The Federal Reserve's next meeting is scheduled for July 30-31, where the possibility of a rate cut will be discussed more extensively.

**Federal Reserve Preview: More Delays**
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5% and signal that September is the earliest opportunity to consider an interest rate cut. The dot plot, which outlines individual members' views on interest rates, is expected to show two rate cuts in 2024 and four in 2025. The Fed is likely to lower its 4Q GDP growth projection and raise its 4Q unemployment projection. The probability of lower GDP growth and higher unemployment is why the Fed is not expected to reduce its rate cut projections to just one 25bp rate cut. The May inflation data will influence the tone of the press conference, and the Fed is expected to take a more dovish stance if inflation remains sticky. The Fed believes monetary policy is restrictive and will consider easing if inflation pressures ease, labor market slack increases, and consumer spending softens. The reverse repo facility is expected to start falling again, which will tighten liquidity conditions. The yield direction is uncertain, and Treasuries need a material fall in inflation to prompt a rate-cutting rally. The dot plots are unlikely to give the dollar a lift, and EUR/USD is expected to trade around the 1.08 area into the French election on 30 June.

**Goldman Sachs: Fed to Keep Interest Rates Unchanged Until September**
Goldman Sachs economists have revised their forecast for the Federal Reserve to not cut interest rates before September, citing the economy's continued resilience. The bank's economists, led by Jan Hatzius, had previously predicted a rate cut in July, but now believe that the Fed will adopt a more cautious approach due to the economy's strong performance. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 4.48%, near its highest level in over a week, as investors became more convinced that the Fed will not cut rates soon. Goldman Sachs still expects two rate cuts by the end of 2024, with the second cut likely to occur in December.

**Fed faces wave of data before deciding on interest rate cut**
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its July 30-31 meeting, but its policy statement may lay the groundwork for a rate cut in September. The Fed's decision will depend on data showing continued progress in lowering inflation towards its 2% target and a labor market staying in balance. The seven-week gap between the July and September meetings allows for more data to accumulate, including the Kansas City Fed's annual research conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. New York Fed President John Williams said, 'We're actually going to learn a lot between July and September.' The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since last July, and officials are hopeful they will finish the inflation fight and start lowering rates without a substantial rise in joblessness.

**Fed Official Sees Potential for Rate Cut by September**
New York Federal Reserve President John Williams stated that the Federal Reserve is close to reducing interest rates, but a decision will not be made before the July 30-31 meeting. Williams emphasized that more data is needed to ensure that inflation is stable at the Fed's 2% target. The Fed has kept the benchmark interest rate between 5.25% and 5.5% since last year. However, with the recent developments showing a deflationary trend, markets are expecting a rate cut in September. According to the Fed's preferred gauge, inflation fell to 2.6% in May, a significant drop from the pandemic-era peak of 7.1%. The June inflation data, to be released on July 26, will provide more information on the direction of inflation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also contributed to the discussion, stating that he has some confidence in the second-quarter inflation data. Williams rejected the possibility of a rate cut in July, emphasizing that the period between July and September is critical for gathering additional inflation data. He also highlighted the widespread decline in inflation across various measures, stating that any area is not showing exceptional resistance to change. Williams remains optimistic about progress and potential policy adjustments in the coming months.

**Markets Expect 100% Chance of Rate Cut in September**
Investors are now 100% certain that the Federal Reserve will start reducing interest rates during its September meeting. According to 'Fed Watch' data, investors expect a 91.4% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut, an 8.4% chance of a 50-basis-point cut, and a very low chance of a 75-basis-point cut. For this month's meeting, the most likely scenario (93.3%) suggests that the interest rate will remain within the range of 5.25% to 5.50% without change, with a weak possibility of a 25-basis-point cut. Consumer Price Index data for June, released last week, showed a 0.1% decrease from the previous month, with an annual inflation rate of 3%, the lowest level in three years. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments yesterday reinforced investors' expectations, as he stated that policymakers will not wait until inflation reaches the target of 2% before cutting interest rates.

**When Will the FED Cut Interest Rates?**
The Federal Reserve (FED) is expected to announce its interest rate decision on July 31, 2024, after its meeting on July 30-31. The FED has kept its interest rate stable at 5.25-5.50% in June. With inflation expectations below target, hopes for a rate cut have increased. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell by 0.1% in June, the first decline since May 2020, and annual inflation rose by 3%, below market expectations. With consumer prices at their lowest level in a year, the FED is expected to cut interest rates in September, with its decisive meeting scheduled for September 18.

**Lagarde and Powell Rule Out Interest Rate Cuts Before September**
The Presidents of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed), Christine Lagarde and Jerome Powell, respectively, have ruled out the possibility of interest rate cuts before September. Lagarde emphasized that the ECB's work is not yet finished and that they will continue to monitor the situation closely. She also stated that the ECB will not stop until inflation returns to its target of 2%. Powell confirmed that inflation will not return to 2% this year, but possibly by the end of next year or in 2026. Both leaders emphasized the importance of being cautious and not making hasty decisions, with Powell stating that the Fed will continue to be 'data-oriented' in its decision-making process.

**Fed Sees Higher Chance of Interest Rate Cut in September**
The financial market sees a higher chance of the Federal Reserve (Fed) starting to cut interest rates in September and increased the probability of a 50-basis-point reduction in 2024 after the release of the US Consumer Price Index (PCE). The indicator is the preferred inflation measure of the US Federal Reserve and came in line with expectations. According to the CME Group's monitoring tool, the probability of a rate cut in September rose to 67.7%, from 64.1% before the data. This represents 61.1% probability of a 25-basis-point cut - for the range of 5.00% to 5.25% - and 6.6% probability of a 50-basis-point cut - for the interval of 4.75% to 5.00%. Until December, the probability of a 50-basis-point reduction advanced from 43% before the data to 45.4%. Meanwhile, the chance of maintaining interest rates in the current range, between 5.25% and 5.50%, fell from 7% to 5.2%.

**What's Next for the Federal Reserve as Expectations for Interest Rate Cuts Mount?**
The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate unchanged for the seventh consecutive time, despite expectations of a rate cut due to softer inflation reports. Economists predict the earliest rate cut will be in September, but Fed officials are proceeding with caution. The Fed's median expectations for rate cuts have narrowed to just one cut this year, down from three previously expected. Traders have increased their expectations of a rate cut, with a 70% chance of a cut in September. However, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need for more confidence in inflation being sustainably at 2% before considering rate cuts. Other Fed officials have also reiterated the need for more data before making a decision. Economists believe there is still time for the Fed to regain confidence before September and expect rate cuts to come.

**Two Interest-Rate Cuts in 2024 Are ‘Very Likely' After CPI, Carlyle's Thomas Says**
Carlyle Group's Jason Thomas believes that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates twice in 2024, citing a softer-than-expected consumer price index reading. Thomas, the head of global research and investment strategy, stated that 'September is in play' for the first rate cut, and that four rate cuts would be needed to bring the neutral rate down to 4.35%. He also expressed skepticism towards those who expect fewer than four cuts, saying that it would indicate an economic shock. The comments come ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and the release of its rate projections for the next two years.

**Fed Seen Curbing Rate-Cutting Plans With Inflation Staying High**
Economists expect the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates in September, but there is a close call on whether they will signal one or two rate cuts for 2024. A Bloomberg survey shows that 41% of economists expect the 'dot plot' to show two cuts, while 41% expect one or no cuts. The Federal Open Market Committee is likely to back away from a previous forecast of three rate reductions this year.

**Fed may wait to cut rates as job market stays strong**
The Federal Reserve is less likely to cut interest rates in September as the US job market remains strong. The latest job report showed a significant increase in nonfarm payrolls and higher-than-expected wage growth. The report implies a 53% chance of a rate cut by September, down from 70% before the report. The Fed has said it will wait for inflation to decline to 2% before cutting rates. The data suggests that inflationary pressures are increasing, not decreasing. Although the unemployment rate rose to 4%, the strong job growth defies expectations of a cooling labor market. Rate futures now show traders are less confident in multiple rate cuts by year's end, with a 50/50 chance of two rate cuts by the end of 2024.
