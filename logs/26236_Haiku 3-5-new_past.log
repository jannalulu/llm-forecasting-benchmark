Let me break this down systematically:

Base Rate Analysis:
1. Olympic Records Context:
- Typical Olympic Games see multiple world records broken
- Recent Olympics (Tokyo 2020/2021) saw significant record-breaking performances
- Multiple articles suggest high potential for record breaking in Paris 2024

Specific Evidence Supporting High Record Potential:
- Swimming: Multiple potential world record candidates
  * Léon Marchand (400m individual medley)
  * Potential records in 50m/100m/200m freestyle events
- Athletics: Several record possibilities
  * Women's 100m potentially breaking 1988 record
  * Pole vault (Armand Duplantis likely to break own record)
  * High jump (Yaroslava Mahuchikh expected to improve record)
- Emerging athletes in multiple disciplines showing exceptional potential

Constraining Factors:
- Rigorous anti-doping measures might limit some performances
- High performance standards make breaking world records increasingly difficult
- Not all potential record attempts will succeed

Quantitative Reasoning:
- Base rate suggests 15-30 world records likely
- Robust evidence points toward upper range
- Some uncertainty due to competitive dynamics

Risk Balancing:
- Overconfidence risk: Assuming too many records will fall
- Underconfidence risk: Underestimating athlete capabilities

My Prediction: Between 20.50% and 27.80%, but 24.30% being the most likely. Probability: 24.30%.

Let me systematically analyze this:

World Record Breaking Base Rate Analysis:
1. Track and Field Potential Records (Most Promising):
- Pole Vault (Duplantis likely)
- 400m Individual Medley (Marchand)
- High Jump (Mahuchikh)
- 100m Women's Sprint (Breaking 1988 record)
- 200m Freestyle Swimming
- 400m Freestyle Swimming

2. Specific Evidence Supporting High Record Count:
- Multiple articles directly predict 5-6 potential world records
- Swimming and Athletics seem most record-prone
- Technology, training improvements accelerating record potential
- Several athletes specifically targeting records

3. Limiting Factors:
- Anti-doping scrutiny increased
- Incremental improvements harder at elite levels
- Precise conditions matter for record-setting
- Not all potential record attempts will succeed

4. Quantitative Estimation:
- Base rate: Roughly 10-15 world records per Olympics historically
- Paris-specific factors suggest slightly higher potential
- Strong individual talent suggests upside

5. Calibration Considerations:
- Avoid over-excitement
- Balance optimism with realistic assessment
- Consider measurement precision

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Lower bound: Definitely more than 15 records seems unlikely
- Upper bound: Unlikely to exceed 35 records
- Most probable clustering: Around 24-30 range

Careful weighing of evidence suggests cautious optimism.

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 74.30%, but 67.20% being the most likely. Probability: 67.20%.

Let me methodically analyze this prediction:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Olympic records are a common occurrence
- World records are rarer but still happen regularly
- Multiple sources suggest 5-6 world records are highly likely in swimming and athletics alone

Key Evidence Supporting High Record Count:
