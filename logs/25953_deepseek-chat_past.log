To forecast whether the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, I will break the problem into sub-problems, analyze the current political landscape, and weigh the evidence carefully.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question. However, the news articles provide a clear picture of the political dynamics following the French parliamentary elections.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Political Landscape**: The parliamentary elections resulted in a fragmented National Assembly, with no party or coalition achieving an absolute majority. The left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182), followed by Macron's Together coalition (168), and the far-right National Rally (143).
2. **Formation of Government**: The President, Emmanuel Macron, has asked Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to remain in office temporarily to ensure stability. However, Attal has announced his resignation, effective July 8, 2024.
3. **Coalition Building**: The NFP, as the largest bloc, is expected to propose a candidate for Prime Minister. Macron's Together coalition is open to forming a coalition or a minority government but faces challenges due to ideological differences with the NFP.
4. **Timeline**: The new government must be formed before July 30, 2024. The National Assembly will convene on July 18, 2024, to begin the process of forming a government.

### Step 3: Analyze the Evidence
- **Fragmented Assembly**: The lack of a clear majority complicates the formation of a government. The Together coalition is the second-largest bloc but lacks the seats to form a government alone.
- **Coalition Prospects**: The Together coalition is open to forming a coalition with other centrist or moderate parties, but the NFP has expressed reluctance to collaborate with Macron's coalition. This reduces the likelihood of a Together-led government.
- **Prime Ministerial Candidates**: The NFP is likely to propose a candidate from their coalition, given their plurality of seats. Macron may have to appoint a Prime Minister from the NFP, leading to a cohabitation government.
- **Stability Concerns**: The Together coalition is focused on stability, especially with the Paris Olympics starting on July 26, 2024. However, the NFP's dominance in the Assembly makes it difficult for Macron to impose a Together-led government.

### Step 4: Weigh the Evidence
- **Base Rate**: In similar fragmented parliaments, the largest bloc typically forms the government, even if it requires coalition-building. The NFP's plurality of seats gives them a strong claim to the Prime Ministership.
- **Adjustments**: The Together coalition's openness to coalition-building is a positive factor, but the NFP's reluctance to collaborate reduces the likelihood of a Together-led government.
- **Trends**: The political momentum favors the NFP, as they have the most seats and are actively seeking to form a government. The Together coalition is in a defensive position.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Given the fragmented Assembly, the NFP's plurality of seats, and the Together coalition's challenges in forming a coalition, the most likely scenario is that the Prime Minister on July 30, 2024, will not belong to the Together coalition.

**My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.**

To forecast whether the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, weigh historical patterns against current evidence, and balance under- and overreaction to the latest developments.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus for this specific question. However, the political landscape in France is highly volatile, and the parliamentary elections have resulted in a fragmented National Assembly, making predictions challenging.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Political Landscape**: The Together coalition (Macron's centrist alliance) came in second place in the parliamentary elections with 168 seats, behind the left-wing New Popular Front (182 seats) and ahead of the far-right National Rally (143 seats). No party or coalition has an absolute majority (289 seats).
2. **Government Formation**: President Macron has asked Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to remain in office temporarily to ensure stability, especially with the Paris Olympics approaching. However, Attal has announced his resignation, effective July 8, and is willing to stay only until a new government is formed.
3. **Coalition Negotiations**: The left-wing New Popular Front is pushing to designate a prime minister from their coalition, excluding Macron's Together coalition. Macron has not yet made a decision on the new prime minister, but he is unlikely to appoint someone from the far-right or far-left.
4. **Historical Precedents**: In similar fragmented parliaments, France has experienced cohabitation (where the president and prime minister are from opposing parties) or technical governments. However, the current situation is unprecedented due to the three-way split and the lack of clear alliances.

### Step 3: Weigh Historical Patterns Against Current Evidence
- **Base Rate**: In fragmented parliaments, the incumbent coalition often struggles to retain power unless it can form a coalition with other parties. The Together coalition lacks the seats to govern alone and faces resistance from both the left and far-right.
- **Current Evidence**: The left-wing coalition is the largest bloc and is actively seeking to form a government. Macron's Together coalition is weakened and lacks the leverage to impose its candidate for prime minister. The far-right is unlikely to gain power due to its third-place finish and lack of alliances.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreaction to Evidence
- The Together coalition's second-place finish suggests it retains some influence, but the left-wing coalition's dominance and Macron's weakened position make it unlikely that the next prime minister will come from Together.
- The resignation of Gabriel Attal and the lack of a clear path for Together to form a government further reduce the likelihood of a Together-affiliated prime minister.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Favoring Together**: Macron's constitutional power to appoint the prime minister and the need for stability during the Olympics.
- **Forces Opposing Together**: The left-wing coalition's majority, the lack of alliances for Together, and the political deadlock.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
The current trend points toward a left-wing prime minister, as the New Popular Front is the largest bloc and is actively negotiating to form a government. Macron's Together coalition is unlikely to retain the prime ministership.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
There is significant uncertainty due to the unprecedented fragmentation of the National Assembly and the lack of clear alliances. However, the evidence strongly suggests that the prime minister will not come from the Together coalition.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
While the evidence points strongly against the Together coalition retaining the prime ministership, there is a small chance that Macron could appoint a neutral or technical prime minister to ensure stability during the Olympics. However, this scenario is unlikely given the left-wing coalition's dominance.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
The primary risk is overestimating Macron's ability to impose a Together-affiliated prime minister despite the coalition's weakened position. Historical precedents of cohabitation and technical governments suggest that the Together coalition is unlikely to retain power.

### Final Forecast
Based on the evidence, the probability that the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, is very low. The left-wing coalition's dominance and Macron's weakened position make it highly unlikely.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, balance historical patterns with current evidence, and weigh the clashing causal forces at work.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this exact question. However, the current political landscape in France, as described in the news articles, provides a strong basis for analysis.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Political Landscape**: The Together coalition (Macron's centrist alliance) came in second in the parliamentary elections with 168 seats, behind the left-wing New Popular Front (182 seats) and ahead of the far-right National Rally (143 seats). No party or coalition has an absolute majority (289 seats).
2. **Government Formation**: The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has asked Prime Minister Gabriel Attal (from the Together coalition) to remain in office temporarily to ensure stability, particularly with the Paris Olympics starting on July 26. However, Attal has announced his resignation, effective July 8, and the process of forming a new government is underway.
3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - **Scenario 1**: The Together coalition forms a coalition government with other centrist or moderate parties, allowing a Together-affiliated Prime Minister to remain in power.
   - **Scenario 2**: The left-wing New Popular Front forms a government, potentially with support from the Together coalition, leading to a Prime Minister from the left.
   - **Scenario 3**: A technical or caretaker government is formed, with a non-partisan Prime Minister, until a stable coalition can be negotiated.
   - **Scenario 4**: Political deadlock persists, and no government is formed by July 30, leading to no Prime Minister in office.

### Step 3: Balance Historical Patterns and Current Evidence
- **Historical Patterns**: In French politics, when no party has an absolute majority, coalition governments or technical governments are common. The Together coalition has been a key player in recent years, and Macron's influence as President could help maintain a Together-affiliated Prime Minister.
- **Current Evidence**: The Together coalition performed better than expected in the elections, securing 168 seats. However, the left-wing New Popular Front has more seats and is actively seeking to form a government. The far-right National Rally, while strong, is unlikely to form a government due to its third-place finish and lack of coalition partners.

### Step 4: Weigh the Clashing Causal Forces
- **Pro-Together Forces**:
  - Macron's influence as President.
  - The Together coalition's relatively strong performance in the elections.
  - The need for stability, especially with the Paris Olympics approaching.
- **Anti-Together Forces**:
  - The left-wing New Popular Front's larger number of seats.
  - The likelihood of the left forming a coalition with other parties.
  - The resignation of Prime Minister Attal, signaling a transition period.

### Step 5: Extrapolate Current Trends
The current trend suggests a fragmented parliament with no clear majority. The Together coalition is likely to play a key role in any coalition government, but the left-wing New Popular Front is in a stronger position to lead. The likelihood of a technical government or prolonged deadlock is also significant.

### Step 6: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
There is considerable uncertainty due to the fragmented parliament and ongoing negotiations. However, the Together coalition's strong performance and Macron's influence suggest a non-negligible chance of a Together-affiliated Prime Minister remaining in power.

### Step 7: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
While the Together coalition has a chance, the left-wing New Popular Front is in a stronger position. A technical government or deadlock is also possible. Therefore, the probability of a Together-affiliated Prime Minister is moderate but not high.

### Step 8: Final Forecast
Considering all factors, the probability that the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, is **35%**. This reflects the coalition's strong performance and Macron's influence, balanced against the left's stronger position and the possibility of a technical government or deadlock.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 40.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

The Together coalition is likely to play a key role in any coalition government, but the left-wing New Popular Front is in a stronger position to lead. The likelihood of a technical government or prolonged deadlock is also significant.

### Step 6: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
There is considerable uncertainty due to the fragmented parliament and ongoing negotiations. However, the Together coalition's strong performance and Macron's influence suggest a non-negligible chance of a Together-affiliated Prime Minister remaining in power.

### Step 7: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
While the Together coalition has a chance, the left-wing New Popular Front is in a stronger position. A technical government or deadlock is also possible. Therefore, the probability of a Together-affiliated Prime Minister is moderate but not high.

### Step 8: Final Forecast
Considering all factors, the probability that the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, is **35%**. This reflects the coalition's strong performance and Macron's influence, balanced against the left's stronger position and the possibility of a technical government or deadlock.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 40.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To forecast whether the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, balance historical patterns with current evidence, and weigh the clashing causal forces at work.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this exact question. However, the current political landscape in France, as described in the news articles, provides a strong basis for analysis.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Political Landscape**: The Together coalition (Macron's centrist alliance) came in second in the parliamentary elections with 168 seats, behind the left-wing New Popular Front (182 seats) and ahead of the far-right National Rally (143 seats). No party or coalition has an absolute majority (289 seats).
2. **Government Formation**: The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has asked Prime Minister Gabriel Attal (from the Together coalition) to remain in office temporarily to ensure stability, particularly with the Paris Olympics starting on July 26. However, Attal has announced his resignation, effective July 8, and the process of forming a new government is underway.
3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - **Scenario 1**: The Together coalition forms a coalition government with other centrist or moderate parties, allowing a Together-affiliated Prime Minister to remain in power.
   - **Scenario 2**: The left-wing New Popular Front forms a government, potentially with support from the Together coalition, leading to a Prime Minister from the left.
   - **Scenario 3**: A technical or caretaker government is formed, with a non-partisan Prime Minister, until a stable coalition can be negotiated.
   - **Scenario 4**: Political deadlock persists, and no government is formed by July 30, leading to no Prime Minister in office.

### Step 3: Balance Historical Patterns and Current Evidence
- **Historical Patterns**: In French politics, when no party has an absolute majority, coalition governments or technical governments are common. The Together coalition has been a key player in recent years, and Macron's influence as President could help maintain a Together-affiliated Prime Minister.
- **Current Evidence**: The Together coalition performed better than expected in the elections, securing 168 seats. However, the left-wing New Popular Front has more seats and is actively seeking to form a government. The far-right National Rally, while strong, is unlikely to form a government due to its third-place finish and lack of coalition partners.

### Step 4: Weigh the Clashing Causal Forces
- **Pro-Together Forces**:
  - Macron's influence as President.
  - The Together coalition's relatively strong performance in the elections.
  - The need for stability, especially with the Paris Olympics approaching.
- **Anti-Together Forces**:
  - The left-wing New Popular Front's larger number of seats.
  - The likelihood of the left forming a coalition with other parties.
  - The resignation of Prime Minister Attal, signaling a transition period.

### Step 5: Extrapolate Current Trends
The current trend suggests a fragmented parliament with no clear majority. The Together coalition is likely to play a key role in any coalition government, but the left-wing New Popular Front is in a stronger position to lead.
