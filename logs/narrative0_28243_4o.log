*The camera focuses on NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK seated at a round table.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did Trump sell any shares of Trump Media before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 20.00%. Given the end of the lockup period on September 19 and Trump's public refusal to sell, the probability was low.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The market reacted strongly to his statement, and our models never predicted a sale. The investor relations page didn’t post any new Form 4 filings.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Despite speculation, the lack of a Form 4 confirms our forecast. Trump's strategic hold on his shares continues to impact Truth Social's valuation.

*They nod in agreement, confident in their analysis.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, once again, the models proved accurate. Let's see how this unfolds in the coming months.
