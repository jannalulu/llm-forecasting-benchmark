Okay, let's break down this forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**

*   There are no relevant human predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket for this specific question about a ski resort opening. Metaculus currently does not have an active community forecast on this specific question.

**2. Break Down the Problem**

The question hinges on whether Alta will be listed as "Open" on On the Snow's Ski Report on November 22, 2024. To determine this, we need to assess:

*   **Historical Opening Dates:** What are Alta's typical opening dates in the past?
*   **Current Snow Conditions:** How much snow has Alta received, and what are the current base depths?
*   **Official Announcements:** What are the official stated opening plans and have there been any changes?
*   **Snowmaking Capacity:** Does Alta have snowmaking capabilities, and how are they being used?
*  **Uphill Policy**: How does the resort's uphill policy impact its overall readiness and willingness to open?
*   **Regional Trends:** What are the opening trends for other resorts in the region?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   Generally, ski resorts in Utah and the broader Western US typically aim to open in late November or early December.
    *   Based on historical trends, November 22 is within the usual window for Utah resorts to open. The articles confirm that Utah resorts target the week of November 22.
    *   We can look at the articles about how many other resorts are opening and when to form a base rate for a typical opening by this date.

*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Positive News:**
        *   Multiple news articles specifically state that Alta plans to open on November 22 (ksl.com articles from Nov 6 and Nov 7), and are preparing for this opening date.
        *   Alta received 8 inches of fresh powder from a recent storm (ksl.com article Nov 7).
        *   Alta has been getting some new snow (snowbrains.com articles Nov 4 and Nov 5) and is allowing uphill travel, indicating it is possible to get on the mountain.
        *   Alta is consistently skiable in November and has good lower coverage due to snowmaking (snowbrains.com article Nov 4).
        *   Alta has invested in new ski conveyors, which suggests they are preparing for visitors (deseret.com article Oct 18).
    *   **Potential Negative News (or mitigating factors):**
        *   Some articles note that terrain is early-season thin in other Colorado resorts (koaa.com article Nov 9), meaning thin cover is still a potential risk.
        *   Backcountry skiers are using the mountain and need to be aware of risks and the resorts equipment (kstlnewsradio.com article Nov 12), indicating a potential for hazard but also that there is snow to ski on.
        *   There is no specific mention of significant snowmaking at Alta beyond the reference to lower coverage due to snowmaking, so the natural snow is important.
        *   While backcountry skiers are skiing at Alta, the area is not "open" and ready for the general public (KSTU Nov 5), suggesting the snow might not be ideal everywhere.
        *    One article states that Alta plans to open on November 29, 2024, while all other articles confirm the 22nd (snowbrains.com Nov 4). This is clearly inconsistent and there must be an error in one of the dates or the article. The majority of articles indicate the 22nd.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence**

*   The planned opening date from multiple sources is November 22. This is strong evidence.
*   The fact that the resort is open to uphill traffic and that backcountry skiers are flocking to the area suggests that there is snow and that conditions are not completely dire.
*   The articles reporting that other resorts have opened early suggest that opening earlier is possible if conditions permit.
*  The one inconsistent date in the articles should be treated as a potential source of error, while the articles that say the 22nd should be favored.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Forces for Opening:**
    *   Strong demand for early season skiing.
    *   Good early snowfall and base depth to allow for opening.
    *   The majority of news reports confirm a November 22nd opening.
    *   Planned opening date from the resort.
    *   Recent investment in upgrades suggests they are working to open on time.
*   **Forces Against Opening:**
    *   Uncertainty about snow conditions in all areas of the resort.
    *   The potential for thin coverage on some parts of the mountain
    *   Potential for unforeseen operational delays or other circumstances.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**

*   The trend is for resorts in the region to open by the end of November, with many resorts opening early due to the recent snowfalls. Alta's stated opening date is consistent with the opening trends and is in the window of typical opening.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

*   Given the available information, there is a high probability that Alta will open on November 22nd, and it is explicitly stated that this is the plan. However, we must still have a degree of doubt and a range reflecting the slight possibility that there might be a delay due to unforeseen weather or operating issues.

**8. Under/Overconfidence**

*   I aim to balance the strong evidence for opening with a degree of caution due to potential for unforeseen circumstances. While the probability of opening is high, it is not 100%. It could be influenced by factors like staffing issues that are not covered in these articles.

**9. Look for Errors**

*   The main potential error lies in over-reliance on planned opening dates and not considering the potential for unforeseen events. I will try to avoid overconfidence by having a range that allows for the unexpected. I have adjusted the probability downward due to the existence of the potential for unexpected delays and the existence of some thin coverage.

**Conclusion**

Based on the strong indication from multiple news sources that Alta is planning to open on November 22, coupled with the recent snowfall, the presence of backcountry skiers, and the general trend of resorts opening around this time, I will give a high probability to Alta being open on November 22nd. However, I will temper that slightly due to the potential for operational issues or further snow deficits.

My Prediction: Between 87.00% and 97.00%, but 93.00% being the most likely. Probability: 93.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question and develop a forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time predictions from sites like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or the Metaculus community. However, I can use historical data and the provided news articles to form my own estimate.

**2. Break Seemingly Intractable Problems into Tractable Sub-problems:**

To determine if Alta will be open on November 22nd, I need to consider:
    *   **Historical Opening Dates:** When does Alta typically open?
    *   **Current Snow Conditions:** Has there been enough snowfall?
    *   **Snowmaking Capabilities:** Does Alta have snowmaking? How much can they make?
    *   **Announced Opening Dates:** What is Alta's official projected opening date? Are there any conflicting announcements?
    *   **Early Season Openings:** Is it common for ski resorts to open before or after announced dates, and why?
    *   **Operational Hurdles:** Are there other factors (beyond snow) that could cause delays (e.g., staffing, equipment issues)?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** Based on historical data, many ski resorts in the region tend to open in late November/early December. There is a clear seasonal pattern to consider. The articles provided mention Brian Head opening as early as November 8th, and many Colorado resorts opening in early to mid-November, which suggests that early openings are feasible given suitable conditions. 
*   **Inside View:** The specific details of Alta's snow conditions, planned opening date, and news reports about snow fall around Alta will be heavily weighed into my estimation.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I will strive to take into consideration the latest information, but not put too much weight on any single piece of evidence. News reports about significant snow falls are not enough to guarantee opening, and a lack of snowfall does not necessarily mean the resort will be closed. I'll be particularly wary of overreacting to early-season snowstorms or isolated reports of good conditions.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work in Each Problem:**

*   **Forces Favoring Opening:**
    *   **Announced Opening Date:** The news articles state that Alta is scheduled to open on November 22nd. This is a strong signal of intent and planning.
    *   **Early Season Snow:** Several news articles confirm that both Alta and the surrounding areas have received a good amount of snow, with multiple reports of 7 to 8 inches of fresh powder.
    *   **Operational Experience:** Alta is a well-established resort with extensive experience managing early-season openings.
*   **Forces Potentially Delaying Opening:**
    *   **Snow Coverage Variability:** Some articles note that early season snow coverage can be variable, with some sections of the mountain receiving more snow than others. While Alta itself is reported to have 7 to 8 inches of fresh powder, it's possible that more snow is required before the entire mountain can open safely.
    *   **Weather Uncertainty:** While early-season snow has arrived, future weather patterns are not entirely certain. A significant warm spell or lack of further snowfall could impact opening plans.
    *  **Opening Date Consistency:** The news articles mention different potential opening dates for Alta, November 22nd and 29th, which may be a point of confusion.

**6. Extrapolate the Current Trends Linearly:**

*   Given that it is now mid-November, and Alta's planned opening is set for November 22nd, which is in 10 days, it is very unlikely that it will push that opening date back significantly to after November 22nd. It is still possible that the opening may be delayed, but current evidence would indicate that if they were able to open the resort on the 22nd that they will, or at least announce opening for that date.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits but no More:**

*   I can distinguish between several probability ranges here. It's unlikely that the resort opens before the date that was stated in the article. It's possible that it will open right on that date, or a little later. It is unlikely it would be delayed by more than a week if it has the stated intent to open on the 22nd.
*   I'm not going to overcomplicate this by trying to assign minute differences in probability, but instead focus on the most probable outcomes.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence, Between Prudence and Decisiveness:**

*   I will not assume that because the resorts say they will open that they will. I will look to other sources of information, including other resorts in the region, to inform my prediction. I will not be overly confident based on the announced opening dates alone.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes but Beware of Rearview-Mirror Hindsight Biases:**

*   After the resolution date, I will examine whether my reasoning was flawed. For example, did I underestimate the impact of weather or overestimate the resorts' ability to prepare in time? I'll be careful not to fall prey to hindsight bias (that is, thinking that the correct outcome was obvious from the start).

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

The articles strongly suggest that Alta's *planned* opening date is November 22nd. The articles also report significant recent snowfall. The main uncertainty revolves around whether that will be enough to actually open on November 22nd, or whether unexpected weather or operational challenges might delay it. There is also a competing date mentioned of November 29th, which appears to be from a snowbrains article that could be incorrect or from an older press release. It is still possible the November 22nd date is an intended date, and they do not publicly announce a delay until closer to the date.

Given the current evidence:
*   The resort has announced they plan to open on November 22nd.
*   It has received a considerable amount of snowfall.
*   There are strong forces favouring the resort opening on the intended date
*   There is a possibility the resort will be delayed by some unexpected event.

The possibility of the resort being delayed by a week or less seems much more probable than it being delayed significantly past that intended date. I would therefore estimate that there is about a 75-80% chance they open on the 22nd as intended, with the possibility they delay to the 29th or some date between.

**My Prediction:** Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 78.00% being the most likely. Probability: 78.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question and form a probability forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There are currently no predictions on Metaculus for this specific question.
*   **Other Sources:** FiveThirtyEight and Polymarket do not offer relevant predictions on ski resort openings.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

To assess the probability, we need to consider the following:

*   **Historical Opening Dates:** When does Alta typically open? Is November 22nd typical or early/late?
*   **Current Snow Conditions:** How much snow has Alta received? Is there sufficient base depth?
*   **Snowmaking Capacity:** How much snow can Alta make? Are temperatures conducive?
*   **Official Statements:** What have Alta's management and local news sources said about opening plans?
*   **Comparison with Other Resorts:** What are the opening plans of other resorts in Utah and the region? Are they opening early, on time, or late?
*   **Risk Factors:** What factors could delay the opening (e.g. lack of snow, warm weather, equipment failure)?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**
    *   Based on historical trends, ski resorts usually aim for a target opening date and try to open on it or shortly after it. The news articles suggest that early or delayed openings are not unheard of due to snow. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Alta Circumstances):**
    *   **Planned Opening Date:** Multiple sources explicitly state that Alta plans to open on November 22nd.
    *   **Snowfall:** Alta has received at least 7-8 inches of recent snowfall. It's not clear what the base depth is, but some articles mention that lower elevation areas have better coverage because of snowmaking.
    *   **Snowmaking:** While some articles mention snowmaking upgrades, there is little indication if that snowmaking has actually happened and to what extent.
    *   **Backcountry Activity:** The fact that backcountry skiers are already using the mountain suggests there is some snow cover, even if not enough for normal resort operations. 
    *   **Uphill Travel:** Alta allows uphill travel, which indicates there is skiable snow although not officially open, but also that it might be riskier than normal. 
    * **No mention of delays:** All the news articles and reports mention the scheduled opening on November 22nd and there is no indication of a delay to this date.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:** It's important not to overreact to the fact that other resorts have opened early, since each resort has different conditions and plans. We should not assume Alta will necessarily open *before* the 22nd despite the positive signs.
*   **Underreacting:** We should take into account the fact that several resorts are opening in early or mid-November, indicating that snow conditions are at least good in certain areas. There is a real chance that if sufficient snow is not on the ground by the 22nd or immediately before, there may be a slight delay.
*   **Balancing:** The strong evidence for the planned opening date, coupled with evidence of snow and snowmaking, suggests a high probability of opening on November 22nd as planned. However, a slight chance of a delay due to unpredictable weather exists, despite there being no mention of a delay so far.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive forces:** Planned opening date, recent snow, general early season trend in Utah and Colorado, snowmaking capability, and no negative news articles suggesting any delays.
*   **Negative forces:** Possibility of insufficient snow, warm spell leading to snow melt, unforeseen maintenance or equipment issues.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   Based on the current trend, the momentum appears to be in favour of the opening being on schedule, and possibly before, though there is no evidence for a change in the current scheduled date of November 22nd.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The question is not asking if Alta will open *early* on November 22nd. It is asking if Alta will be open *at all* on the 22nd. The news articles point to an intention to open on the 22nd, which means it will be open if all goes to plan. However, the uncertainty of weather still remains. Thus, we shouldn't give 100% confidence, there is still a small chance that unforeseen circumstances might delay the opening.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   There is significant evidence that Alta is planning for a November 22nd opening and has received some snow and is making snow, so we should be relatively confident that it will open on that date. However, weather is an unpredictable force, so we should not be overly confident.

**9. Look for Errors and Avoid Hindsight Bias:**

*   The biggest potential errors in this prediction stem from weather unpredictability, as well as unforeseen technical issues. It's important not to look back in hindsight and overcorrect if the prediction is off due to the random nature of a weather event.

**Forecast:**

Based on all the analysis, the planned opening date of November 22nd, recent snowfall, and general trend in Utah, I am quite confident that Alta will be open on November 22nd, although the chance of a slight delay always exists.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 98.00%, but 93.00% being the most likely. Probability: 93.00%.

*   **Official Statements:** What have Alta's management and local news sources said about opening plans?
*   **Comparison with Other Resorts:** What are the opening plans of other resorts in Utah and the region? Are they opening early, on time, or late?
*   **Risk Factors:** What factors could delay the opening (e.g. lack of snow, warm weather, equipment failure)?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**
    *   Based on historical trends, ski resorts usually aim for a target opening date and try to open on it or shortly after it. The news articles suggest that early or delayed openings are not unheard of due to snow. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Alta Circumstances):**
    *   **Planned Opening Date:** Multiple sources explicitly state that Alta plans to open on November 22nd.
    *   **Snowfall:** Alta has received at least 7-8 inches of recent snowfall. It's not clear what the base depth is, but some articles mention that lower elevation areas have better coverage because of snowmaking.
    *   **Snowmaking:** While some articles mention snowmaking upgrades, there is little indication if that snowmaking has actually happened and to what extent.
    *   **Backcountry Activity:** The fact that backcountry skiers are already using the mountain suggests there is some snow cover, even if not enough for normal resort operations. 
    *   **Uphill Travel:** Alta allows uphill travel, which indicates there is skiable snow although not officially open, but also that it might be riskier than normal. 
    * **No mention of delays:** All the news articles and reports mention the scheduled opening on November 22nd and there is no indication of a delay to this date.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:** It's important not to overreact to the fact that other resorts have opened early, since each resort has different conditions and plans. We should not assume Alta will necessarily open *before* the 22nd despite the positive signs.
*   **Underreacting:** We should take into account the fact that several resorts are opening in early or mid-November, indicating that snow conditions are at least good in certain areas. There is a real chance that if sufficient snow is not on the ground by the 22nd or immediately before, there may be a slight delay.
*   **Balancing:** The strong evidence for the planned opening date, coupled with evidence of snow and snowmaking, suggests a high probability of opening on November 22nd as planned. However, a slight chance of a delay due to unpredictable weather exists, despite there being no mention of a delay so far.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive forces:** Planned opening date, recent snow, general early season trend in Utah and Colorado, snowmaking capability, and no negative news articles suggesting any delays.
*   **Negative forces:** Possibility of insufficient snow, warm spell leading to snow melt, unforeseen maintenance or equipment issues.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   Based on the current trend, the momentum appears to be in favour of the opening being on schedule, and possibly before, though there is no evidence for a change in the current scheduled date of November 22nd.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The question is not asking if Alta will open *early* on November 22nd. It is asking if Alta will be open *at all* on the 22nd. The news articles point to an intention to open on the 22nd, which means it will be open if all goes to plan. However, the uncertainty of weather still remains. Thus, we shouldn't give 100% confidence, there is still a small chance that unforeseen circumstances might delay the opening.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   There is significant evidence that Alta is planning for a November 22nd opening and has received some snow and is making snow, so we should be relatively confident that it will open on that date. However, weather is an unpredictable force, so we should not be overly confident.

**9. Look for Errors and Avoid Hindsight Bias:**

*   The biggest potential errors in this prediction stem from weather unpredictability, as well as unforeseen technical issues. It's important not to look back in hindsight and overcorrect if the prediction is off due to the random nature of a weather event.

**Forecast:**

Based on all the analysis, the planned opening date of November 22nd, recent snowfall, and general trend in Utah, I am quite confident that Alta will be open on November 22nd, although the chance of a slight delay always exists.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 98.00%, but 93.00% being the most likely. Probability: 93.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**

*   There are no directly relevant human predictions available on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific ski resort opening date. 
*   Metaculus does have other questions related to ski resort openings that give an idea of how this type of question might perform, but they are not directly relevant to this particular resort or date and are not good comparison classes.

**2. Break Down the Problem into Sub-Problems**

We can break this problem into a few key sub-questions:
    *   What is the typical opening date for Alta?
    *   What are the explicit statements for opening dates this year?
    *   What are the current snow conditions and how does that relate to a potential opening?
    *   What are the risks that can delay an opening?
    *   How reliable is the resolution source (On The Snow) expected to be?

**3. Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View:** In the absence of specific historical data for Alta, let's use a general base rate for ski resort openings. Typically, ski resorts aim to open around late November or early December, weather permitting. Given that Alta is in a region known for snowfall, we can start with an assumption that the base probability is about 50% that a resort in Utah is open by November 22nd given that they may be expected to open near the end of that month.
*   **Inside View:** Let's delve deeper into the provided news articles and focus on Alta and the surrounding region:

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**

*   **Strong Evidence for a YES (opening on November 22):**
    *   Multiple news sources, including ksl.com, explicitly state that Alta is scheduled to open on November 22. The most relevant articles are dated November 6th and 7th which state this clearly.
    *   There have been significant snowfalls in early November.
    *   Solitude has partially opened and Brian Head has opened, both in Utah, and they have received snow, indicating favorable conditions in the region.
    *   Alta has received 8 inches of fresh powder from recent storms.
    *   The resorts are clearly trying to open early, and Brian Head is opening earlier than ever before.
*   **Evidence for a NO (not opening on November 22):**
    *   The snowbrains.com article from Nov 4th says the resort is planning to open on November 29th (this seems to be a mistake or error in the reporting as other articles contradict this)
    *   The snow may not be enough for full operations.
    *   Resorts can be delayed by weather and unforeseen circumstances.
    *   The article noting backcountry skiers at Alta notes the risk associated with early season conditions.
    *   Some articles note some limited terrain when resorts open up, so that may be a limiting factor.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**
    *   **Positive Forces:** Early snow, scheduled opening dates, pressure to open for the season, snow making capabilities.
    *   **Negative Forces:** Unpredictable weather, limited terrain if snow is not abundant enough, unexpected issues in operations.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends**

*   Most Utah resorts are on track to open around their projected dates. Brian Head opened early, as did other Colorado resorts. Given the significant snowfall that has been reported, it is expected the trends will continue as resorts are generally attempting to open early when conditions permit.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**
    *   There is very strong evidence pointing to an opening on November 22nd, but there is still a chance that a weather event or unforeseen operational issue could prevent opening by November 22nd. The probability should not be 100% given these factors.

**8. Balancing Under- and Overconfidence**

*   The weight of evidence from multiple news sources mentioning the November 22nd opening date, combined with the observed early openings of other resorts and recent snowfalls, is very strong. This supports a high probability. The evidence against it is quite weak, based mostly on the chance that *something* could always happen to cause delay.

**9. Learn From Mistakes**

*   The most likely mistake would be overestimating the level of certainty and going too high a probability. It is unlikely that the dates are wrong, so it is very unlikely to be a very low probability. The challenge in this type of question is acknowledging that a small chance of some random event preventing opening still exists.

**Reasoning Synthesis:**

Based on all available information, the primary evidence is the several news sources explicitly stating Alta's opening date as November 22nd. Given the recent snowfall and the fact other resorts in the area are opening or have opened, the probability of this resort not opening on the 22nd should be relatively low. There is always the possibility that a snowstorm comes and closes it again (as happened in Spain), but given the stated resolution criteria only requires it to be listed as open, it would be surprising if the resort opened and was then closed by that date. It is much more likely that the On The Snow Ski Report would list it as open if it did indeed open, and it is likely the resort would indeed open. While there are no guarantees in real-world events, the evidence overwhelmingly points towards a "Yes" resolution. There is one article that says it is opening on Nov 29th, but that seems to be a misreporting error based on other articles. Given this, we can say that there is a good chance of opening, but acknowledging a slight chance of delay or something unexpected happening.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 89.00% and 98.00%, but 94.00% being the most likely. Probability: 94.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about Alta's opening date and generate a calibrated probability forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There isn't a directly comparable Metaculus question, but we can look for similar ski resort opening questions to get a sense of the community's accuracy in this domain. This is a new question so there are no current community predictions.
*  **Other Platforms:** No relevant predictions on FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket were found.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

This question hinges on a few sub-problems:

*   **Snowfall:** How much snow has fallen already, and what are the forecasts between now and November 22nd?
*   **Snowmaking Capacity:** How effective is Alta's snowmaking system and how much has it been used this year?
*   **Operational Readiness:** Are there any operational, staffing or equipment issues that could delay opening?
*   **Official Opening Date:** Is November 22nd the official targeted date, and is it likely to change?
*   **OnTheSnow Data Accuracy:** How reliable is OnTheSnow's data, and what factors influence it?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Historical data on ski resort openings can inform our base rate. Unfortunately we don't have specific data on Alta for opening on specific dates of a year. However, we know that ski resorts generally aim to open on their stated opening day but are sometimes delayed due to lack of snow or other issues.
*   **Inside View:** We have several news articles providing specific information on Alta's situation. This constitutes our "inside view".

**4. Balancing Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

We need to be careful to not overreact to a single positive or negative piece of news, while also recognizing relevant changes to past patterns. News of significant snowfall should increase the chance of opening, whereas lack of snowfall or operational issues would reduce it.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

There are several clashing forces at play:
*   **Positive:**
    *   Multiple articles stating the planned opening date is November 22nd.
    *   Some early season snow in the region.
    *  Snowmaking capability.
*   **Negative:**
    *   Early season conditions can be inconsistent, leading to delays.
    *  No mention in the articles of specific base depths needed to open.
    *  Weather forecasts can change quickly, affecting snow conditions.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

Current trends show that the region is receiving some early snow and resorts are opening. If these trends continue linearly, then it's more likely Alta will open on its targeted date. However, weather is not always linear.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

We will aim for moderate levels of uncertainty, without being too precise on the specific estimates. The question does not specify if 'Open' means 'fully open' or 'partially open' so a 'partially open' option will be considered as a positive resolution.

**8. Balance Under/Overconfidence:**

We should strive for calibrated probabilities, not being too certain of a 'yes' or a 'no', while also acknowledging the positive signals suggesting opening on time.

**9. Look for Errors, Avoid Hindsight Bias:**

After resolution, we will analyze what drove our errors, but at present, we should rely on the information available now.

**Reasoning and Adjustments:**

*   **Base Rate Adjustment:** Given historical data that ski resorts try to open on their official dates, but don't always succeed, we will start with a base rate of 70% chance of opening.

*   **Specific News Adjustments:**
    *   The KSL articles from November 6th and 7th, clearly state that Alta is scheduled to open on November 22nd. Other articles also mention the same date. This increases the probability, as resorts generally try to hit their stated targets.
    *   Several articles mention early snowfall, which is positive, but some sources also mention early season thin conditions, which reduces certainty to hit its opening day.
    *   The reports of backcountry skiers using the mountain despite its official closure and the report of "Alta feels operational" suggest that conditions are already good, meaning the snow is deep enough to consider being 'open', so increasing the probability of opening on the 22nd.
   *   Several resorts in Colorado and Utah have already opened, showing it is possible to do so with the early season snowfall, increasing the chances of Alta opening on the 22nd.

*   **Overall Adjustment:** Taking into account all of the above, I'm adjusting the probability upwards to 85%.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 92.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about Alta's opening date and generate a calibrated probability forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There isn't a directly comparable Metaculus question, but we can look for similar ski resort opening questions to get a sense of the community's accuracy in this domain. This is a new question so there are no current community predictions.
*  **Other Platforms:** No relevant predictions on FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket were found.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

This question hinges on a few sub-problems:

*   **Snowfall:** How much snow has fallen already, and what are the forecasts between now and November 22nd?
*   **Snowmaking Capacity:** How effective is Alta's snowmaking system and how much has it been used this year?
*   **Operational Readiness:** Are there any operational, staffing or equipment issues that could delay opening?
*   **Official Opening Date:** Is November 22nd the official targeted date, and is it likely to change?
*   **OnTheSnow Data Accuracy:** How reliable is OnTheSnow's data, and what factors influence it?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Historical data on ski resort openings can inform our base rate. Unfortunately we don't have specific data on Alta for opening on specific dates of a year. However, we know that ski resorts generally aim to open on their stated opening day but are sometimes delayed due to lack of snow or other issues.
*   **Inside View:** We have several news articles providing specific information on Alta's situation. This constitutes our "inside view".

**4. Balancing Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

We need to be careful to not overreact to a single positive or negative piece of news, while also recognizing relevant changes to past patterns. News of significant snowfall should increase the chance of opening, whereas lack of snowfall or operational issues would reduce it.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

There are several clashing forces at play:
*   **Positive:**
    *   Multiple articles stating the planned opening date is November 22nd.
    *   Some early season snow in the region.
    *  Snowmaking capability.
*   **Negative:**
    *   Early season conditions can be inconsistent, leading to delays.
    *  No mention in the articles of specific base depths needed to open.
    *  Weather forecasts can change quickly, affecting snow conditions.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

Current trends show that the region is receiving some early snow and resorts are opening. If these trends continue linearly, then it's more likely Alta will open on its targeted date. However, weather is not always linear.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**
