**US Elections 2024: When Could Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Have Their First Debate?**
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have not confirmed a date for their first debate in the 2024 US Elections. Harris accused Trump of 'backtracking' in a debate, and Trump's campaign said it won't commit to any future debates until the Democratic Party formally selects its candidate. The decision of President Joe Biden to withdraw from the Democratic primary has put the previous debate plans in doubt. Although Biden and Trump had agreed to a debate on September 10, it's unclear if it will take place. Harris remains ready for the debate and believes voters deserve to see a direct comparison between the two candidates. Trump's campaign director, Steven Cheung, said it would be inappropriate to schedule a debate with Harris due to uncertainty over the Democratic candidate. Harris responded quickly on social media, questioning Trump's stance. The Democratic delegates are expected to confirm Harris as the candidate before August 7, while Trump received the official Republican nomination last week.
