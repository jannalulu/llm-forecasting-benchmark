To approach this forecast, I'll start by considering relevant base rates and then adjust based on specific information available:

Base rates:
- OpenAI has a history of publishing information about their AI models and research, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4.
- However, they don't always publish details about rumored projects or early-stage research.

Adjusting factors:

Evidence for higher probability:
1. Multiple news articles from 2024 mention Q* as a known OpenAI project, suggesting its existence is not a secret.
2. The June 9, 2024 article from t3n Magazin mentions Q* as capable of solving mathematical problems with high accuracy, indicating some level of development.
3. OpenAI has a track record of eventually publishing information about significant AI developments.
4. The timeline (by September 30, 2024) allows several more months for development and potential publication.

Evidence for lower probability:
1. No official confirmation or publication about Q* from OpenAI as of the latest news articles.
2. The May 18, 2024 article mentions the dissolution of OpenAI's Superalignment team, which could potentially slow down work on advanced AI systems.
3. The reported security breach in 2023 might make OpenAI more cautious about sharing information on cutting-edge projects.
4. OpenAI seems to be focusing on other projects like GPT-4o, which could delay work on or publication about Q*.

Balancing these factors:
- The multiple mentions of Q* in 2024 news articles suggest it's a real project that OpenAI is working on.
- However, the lack of official confirmation and the focus on other projects indicate some uncertainty about whether OpenAI will publish information about Q* within the specified timeframe.
- The dissolution of the Superalignment team and the security breach may have impacted OpenAI's timeline for advanced AI projects.
- Given OpenAI's history of eventually publishing information about significant developments, there's a moderate chance they will do so for Q* by the deadline.

Considering these factors, I estimate a moderate probability that OpenAI will publish information describing Q* by September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll start by considering relevant reference classes and base rates, then adjust based on specific information available.

Reference classes and base rates:
1. Rate of major AI breakthroughs: Significant AI breakthroughs (like GPT-3, DALL-E, etc.) occur roughly every 1-2 years.
2. OpenAI's publication rate: OpenAI tends to publish information about major developments within 6-12 months of achieving them.
3. Frequency of leaks about AI progress: Leaks about major AI developments (like the initial Q* leak) occur every few months.

Specific information and adjustments:

Evidence for higher probability:
1. The initial leak about Q* occurred in November 2023, suggesting OpenAI has been working on it for some time.
2. OpenAI has a history of publishing information about their developments (e.g., GPT-3, DALL-E).
3. The competitive AI landscape may incentivize OpenAI to publish information to maintain their perceived lead.
4. Recent news (June 2024) mentions Q* as a potential breakthrough in mathematical problem-solving, indicating ongoing interest and development.

Evidence for lower probability:
1. No official confirmation or publication about Q* as of July 2024, despite nearly 8 months passing since the initial leak.
2. OpenAI may be cautious about publishing information on a potentially transformative technology due to safety concerns or competitive advantages.
3. The recent security breach (reported in July 2024) may have made OpenAI more cautious about sharing information.
4. OpenAI seems to be focusing on other developments (like GPT-4o) rather than Q*.

Balancing these factors:
The initial leak and ongoing mentions of Q* suggest it's a real project that OpenAI is working on. However, the lack of official confirmation or publication after 8 months is concerning. The recent security breach and focus on other projects may have delayed any potential publication.

Given that we're now in October 2024 and the deadline is September 30, 2024, we know that OpenAI did not publish information describing Q* by the specified date. Therefore, the probability must be 0%.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.10%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Timeline: The question asks about publication by September 30, 2024. Today is October 18, 2024, so the deadline has already passed.

2. OpenAI's actions: There's no clear evidence in the provided articles that OpenAI published information describing Q* by the deadline.

3. Q* mentions: While there are references to Q* in some articles, they don't indicate that OpenAI officially published information about it:

   - A June 9, 2024 article mentions Q* as a rumored model from November 2023, but states there's no published study or official confirmation.
   - A May 30, 2024 article also references Q* but doesn't indicate any official publication by OpenAI.

4. OpenAI's other activities: The articles show OpenAI was active in other areas:
   - Training a new AI model to succeed GPT-4 (May 28, 2024)
   - Releasing GPT-4o with new capabilities (May 14, 2024)
   - Dissolving its Superalignment team (May 18, 2024)

5. Security concerns: There are mentions of a security breach at OpenAI in 2023, which might have made the company more cautious about revealing information.

6. Competitive landscape: The articles show ongoing competition in AI development, which could incentivize secrecy around advanced projects like Q*.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the base rate and then adjust based on the specific information provided:

1. Base rate: Q* was first rumored in November 2023, so we have about 10 months of no public information. This suggests a relatively low base rate for disclosure.

2. OpenAI's track record: OpenAI has a history of publishing information about their AI models, but they also maintain secrecy around certain projects. This creates some uncertainty.

3. Recent developments: 
   - The May 2024 release of GPT-4o suggests OpenAI is focusing on improving existing models rather than introducing entirely new systems.
   - The dissolution of the Superalignment team in May 2024 could indicate a shift in priorities away from more speculative projects like Q*.

4. Security concerns: The reported security breach in 2023 and subsequent non-disclosure might make OpenAI more cautious about revealing information on advanced projects.

5. Competitive landscape: Pressure from competitors like Google and Apple in the AI space could incentivize OpenAI to reveal more about their advanced projects to maintain their perceived lead.

6. Regulatory environment: Increasing scrutiny from regulators might push OpenAI towards more transparency about their projects.

7. Time frame: We have about 5.5 months left until the September 30, 2024 deadline. This is a relatively short time frame for a major announcement, especially given no public hints so far.

8. Nature of Q*: The rumored capabilities of Q* in solving mathematical problems could represent a significant breakthrough, which OpenAI might be eager to announce if achieved.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is relatively low but not negligible. The recent focus on GPT-4o and the dissolution of the Superalignment team suggest Q* might not be a current priority. However, the competitive pressure and potential breakthrough nature of Q* provide some chance of disclosure.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

6. Lack of recent mentions: There have been no significant updates about Q* in the provided news articles from 2024, suggesting it may not be a current priority or may still be in early development.

7. Focus on other models: OpenAI seems to be focusing on GPT-4 and its variants, which could delay work on or announcements about Q*.

8. Regulatory environment: Increasing scrutiny of AI may make OpenAI more cautious about announcing potentially powerful new systems.

Balancing these factors:

- The lack of recent mentions and the security concerns slightly decrease the likelihood.
- OpenAI's history of publishing information and the competitive landscape slightly increase the likelihood.
- The timeline provides a reasonable window for publication if OpenAI chooses to do so.

Given these considerations, I estimate a moderate probability that OpenAI will publish information describing Q* by September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast whether OpenAI will publish information describing Q* (Q-Star) by September 30, 2024, I'll analyze the available evidence and consider key factors:

1. Reference class: OpenAI has a history of publishing information about its AI models and research, though often with some delay after initial development. However, Q* appears to be a more secretive project.

2. Recent trends: OpenAI has been increasingly open about its developments, as seen with the release of GPT-4 details and the recent announcement of GPT-4o.

3. Competitive landscape: With intense competition in AI, OpenAI may be incentivized to publish information to maintain its perceived lead and attract talent/investment.

4. Security concerns: The reported security breach in 2023 and the dissolution of the Superalignment team suggest potential caution around sharing sensitive information.

5. Timeline: We have about 11 months until the September 30, 2024 deadline, which seems like a reasonable timeframe for preparing and releasing information if OpenAI chooses to do so.
