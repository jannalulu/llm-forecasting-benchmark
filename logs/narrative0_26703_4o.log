NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK, renowned superforecasters, sit across from each other, a tense atmosphere in the air.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did it happen? Did Venezuela invade Guyana?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 22.35%. Despite the heated rhetoric, the referendum, and the US officials' visits, it seems cooler heads prevailed.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The historical context and recent tensions suggested a higher risk, but the credible sources up to July 2024 didn't indicate imminent action.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. The diplomatic efforts and international pressure likely played a key role in averting conflict.

**NATE SILVER**  
Let's hope for continued peace. The stakes were high, but the models were clearâ€”no invasion.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Agreed. The situation remains delicate, but for now, crisis averted.

**FADE OUT.**

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered before them. A large screen displays maps of Venezuela and Guyana.

NATE SILVER  
Well, here we are, the day after September 30, 2024. So, did Venezuela invade Guyana?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 12.34%. Despite the tensions, the likelihood of an actual invasion was always low.

NATE SILVER  
Right. The referendum and the American visits heightened the rhetoric, but not enough for military action.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The troop movements and diplomatic maneuvers were more about posturing. Our models factored in the global response, especially from the UN Security Council.

NATE SILVER  
And with credible sources indicating no troop entry, it's clear the models were spot-on.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Once again, the probabilities align with reality. A testament to the power of accurate forecasting.

They exchange a knowing nod, the screen fades to black.

Will Venezuela invade Guyana before September 30, 2024? Our models say no, with a probability of 22.34%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Despite the historical tensions and Venezuela's recent referendum, the likelihood of an actual invasion was low. The presence of American officials likely acted as a deterrent.

**NATE SILVER**  
Plus, the international community's focus on diplomacy over conflict played a significant role. The alarm sounded by NGOs seemed more precautionary than predictive.
