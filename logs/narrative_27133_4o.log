INT. A COZY LIVING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a coffee table, laptops open, discussing the recent political events.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the second debate never happened. Our models had it at 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yeah, once Biden dropped out, the probability plummeted. Trump's insistence on FoxNews didn't help.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True. The Democratic scramble for a new nominee left little time for organizing another debate.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The predictions were spot on. The first debate didn't count since Biden's no longer the nominee.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's fascinating how these dynamics play out. The models captured every nuance.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Agreed. The probability was never in favor of a second debate. 

They nod, satisfied with their precise forecasting, as they sip their coffee, the room buzzing with quiet confidence in their predictive prowess.

*The superforecasters gather around a table, analyzing the aftermath of the presidential debate scenario.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: So, the question was whether Trump would debate the Democratic nominee more than once before October 1, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Our models had it at 0.01%. With Biden dropping out and the second debate plans in chaos, it was nearly impossible.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Right. The first debate didn’t even count since Biden wasn't the nominee anymore.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: And with the Democrats scrambling for a new candidate, the likelihood of a second debate was practically nil.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Trump’s insistence on FoxNews instead of ABC sealed the deal.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Our models were spot on, as always.

*They nod, satisfied with their predictions.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Another testament to the power of accurate forecasting.

Our models had it at 5.67%. Given the chaos post-Biden's withdrawal, the likelihood of a second debate was slim. Trump's insistence on FoxNews and the Democrats' scramble for a new nominee were pivotal.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

So, it’s settled. Trump didn’t debate the Democratic nominee more than once. Our models had it at 5.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2, a younger analyst, nods, reviewing notes.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Biden’s dropout changed everything. The second debate never happened. Trump’s insistence on FoxNews instead of ABC only muddied the waters.
