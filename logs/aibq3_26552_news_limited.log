**Eliminating Senescent Cells May Treat Breast and Pancreatic Cancer**
Two studies from the University of Washington's School of Medicine have found that eliminating senescent cells can treat breast and pancreatic cancer. The studies suggest that certain types of senescent cells, which have stopped dividing and cause inflammation, play important roles in suppressing the immune system and allowing these cancers to grow. The research, led by Sheila A. Stuart, a professor of biology and physiology at Georgetown University, and David J. DeNardo, a professor of medicine, could lead to future treatments for breast and pancreatic cancer that target senescent cells. The study suggests that senolytic therapy, which targets senescent cells to eliminate them, can be added to cancer treatment regimens for breast and pancreatic cancer, making immunotherapy and chemotherapy more effective. Some senolytic drugs are already approved by the FDA for treating other types of cancer, and the different ways senescent cells affect the immune system in breast and pancreatic cancer highlight the importance of studying the disease-specific mechanisms.

**Senescent Cell Removal May Aid Breast, Pancreatic Cancer**
Two studies from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis suggest that eliminating senescent cells, which drive inflammation, could be a new treatment strategy for breast and pancreatic cancer. The studies found that eliminating specific senescent cells in the tumor's environment activated the immune system's natural killer cells and other anti-tumor immune functions, suppressing tumor growth. The research suggests that senolytic therapy, which targets senescent cells for elimination, could be added to breast and pancreatic cancer treatment regimens, helping to make immunotherapies and chemotherapies more effective. Some senolytic drugs are already FDA-approved to treat other cancers.

**Senolytic Medications Show Promise in Treating Healthy Older Women**
Researchers at the Mayo Clinic have discovered that medications that selectively kill senescent cells can benefit healthy older women, but only if they have a high number of these cells. Senescent cells, also known as 'zombie cells', are cells that have stopped functioning properly and can cause chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction related to aging and chronic diseases. The medications, known as senolytics, clean out tissues of senescent cells. In a 20-week phase 2 clinical trial, 60 healthy women after menopause received an intermittent senolytic combination of dasatinib and quercetin, a natural product approved by the FDA. The researchers found that this combination, known as D+Q, had beneficial effects on bone formation, but did not reduce bone resorption or degradation. Additionally, D+Q mainly benefited individuals with indications of a high number of senescent cells. Dr. Sundeep Khosla, the lead author, states that 'our findings argue against what many people are already doing, using commercial products like quercetin or related compounds that may exhibit some senolytic properties. People are using them as anti-aging agents without knowing if they have sufficient senescent cells to benefit from them, or what dosage or regimen is necessary for these products or dosages to be effective and safe.' More research is needed to identify better the people who can benefit from senolytic treatments and develop more specific and potent senolytic medications.

**US FDA Advises Vaccines to Focus on JN.1 Variant for Fall 2024 Campaign**
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised vaccine manufacturers to focus on the JN.1 variant for the fall 2024 vaccination campaign. This decision aligns with European and World Health Organization recommendations and follows a vote by FDA advisors on Wednesday, who overwhelmingly supported the selection of the JN.1 variant over the new KP.2 strain. Novavax, one of the vaccine manufacturers, said it can target the JN.1 variant with its vaccine. Moderna has submitted a request to the FDA for its JN.1 vaccine, while Pfizer and BioNTech expect to be ready to supply updated vaccines once approved. Novavax expects to start commercial distribution of its JN.1 vaccine in the US in September. The acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is a concern, with only around 22.5% of US adults having received a dose in the 2023-2024 vaccination season.

**US FDA Approves New Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease**
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the commercialization of a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, developed by Eli Lilly, which has shown to slow down the progression of the disease by up to 35% in patients treated in the early stages. The treatment, called Kisunla, is an antibody-based therapy that targets the amyloid plaques in the brain, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The FDA has also approved another treatment, Leqembi, which works on the same principle. The new treatment has been shown to reduce the amount of amyloid plaques in the brain by 61% at 6 months, 80% at 12 months, and 84% at 18 months. The FDA has recommended the treatment for patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, and it is expected to be available in the US market soon.

**Medications that Kill 'Zombie Cells' May Benefit Some Older Women**
Researchers at Mayo Clinic have discovered that medications that selectively kill senescent cells can benefit healthy older women, but only those with a high number of senescent cells. Senescent cells, also known as 'zombie cells', are dysfunctional cells that can cause chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction related to aging and chronic diseases. The senolytic medications clean the tissues of senescent cells. In a 20-week phase 2 clinical trial, 60 healthy women after menopause received a combination of dasatinib and quercetina, a natural product approved by the FDA, sporadically.

The D+Q mainly benefited individuals with indications of a high number of senescent cells. 'Our findings argue against what many people are already doing - using commercial products like quercetina or related compounds like fisetin that may exhibit some senolytic properties,' says Dr. Sundeep Khosla, endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. 'People are using them as anti-aging agents without knowing if they have enough senescent cells to benefit from them, or what dose or regimen is necessary for these products or doses to be effective and safe.' Dr. Khosla explains that more research is needed to better identify who can benefit from senolytic treatments and develop more specific and potent senolytic medications that can be effective in more people.

**FDA Approves Expanded Use of Sarepta's Gene Therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**
The US FDA has approved the expanded use of Sarepta Therapeutics' gene therapy, Elevidys, for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged four and over. The therapy was approved for patients who can walk and those who cannot. The FDA's decision comes after the therapy failed to meet its primary endpoint in a late-stage trial, but achieved all secondary endpoints without any new safety signals. Debra Miller, founder and CEO of CureDuchenne, said, 'I think, from a parent's perspective, you can look at your child deteriorating and hope for something better, or you can take advantage of something now.' The National Organization for Rare Disorders estimates that Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects about one boy in 3,500 worldwide. The FDA's accelerated approval is the first of its kind for patients aged four to five years who can walk. Sarepta's CEO, Douglas Ingram, said the company is well-positioned to manufacture the therapy. The expanded approval may require Sarepta to increase its capacity. The company has partnered with Roche to commercialize the therapy outside the US.

**FDA Panel Rejects MDMA-Assisted Therapy for PTSD**
The FDA panel has rejected the use of MDMA-assisted therapy for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The therapy, which was approved in Australia in 2023, was rejected due to concerns over the lack of evidence and potential risks. The panel also raised concerns over the lack of a placebo control group in the studies and the potential for bias in the results. The FDA will make a final decision on the therapy in August. The rejection is a setback for those who were hoping for a new treatment option for PTSD, which affects around 13 million people in the US.

**FDA Delays Decision for Dupixent in COPD**
The FDA has extended the review period for Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment for uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The original target action date was June 27, 2024, but has been delayed to September 27, 2024. If approved, Dupixent would be the sixth indication for the medication and the only biologic therapy for COPD. The medication is being developed by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and has shown promise in reducing annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by 30-34% and improving lung function compared to placebo.
