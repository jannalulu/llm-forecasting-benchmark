**Gas prices are plummeting. Experts explain why.**
Gas prices have plummeted about 13% from a 2024 peak in April, with the national average price of a gallon of gas standing at $3.20, according to AAA data. Experts forecast that the national average price will likely drop below $3 per gallon for the first time since May 2021. The drop in prices is due to sluggish demand for gas and a sharp decline in the price of crude oil. Patrick de Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said, 'Gas prices continue to crumble across the entire nation. The outlook is bright.' The decline in prices is expected to continue, with nearly every state east of the Rockies now having some retail outlets selling gas below $3 a gallon. However, experts warn that possible disruptions such as hurricane season or an economic surge could undo the anticipated price relief. By the early part of next year, demand for gasoline is expected to swell, turning seasonal fluctuations against consumers.

**Gas prices: New lows at the pumps to start the work week**
Gas prices in the US have continued to fall, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas dropping to $3.208, according to AAA. This is the lowest national average since January, and 17 states now have an average price under $3 per gallon. Despite recent decreases, gas prices have fluctuated throughout the year and vary significantly among states. Gas prices remain a vital topic heading into the 2024 presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, needing to address the issue and its impact on the economy and people's finances. In the Delmarva region, Delaware has the cheapest gas prices, with an average cost of $2.987 per gallon, while Washington, D.C. has the highest prices, at $3.426 per gallon.

**Gas Prices Continue to Drop Ahead of Fall**
The national average price for a gallon of gas has dropped to $3.24, down six cents from last week. The decrease is attributed to low demand and falling oil costs. According to Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson, 'There are an ever-increasing number of states east of the Rockies that have some retail gas locations selling regular for under $3 a gallon, so drivers will have more in their wallets with autumn approaching.' This trend is positive for fall travelers, and if the national average falls below $3, it will be the first time since May 2021.

**Map shows states with gasoline average under $3 per gallon**
As of Tuesday, the average national gas price was $2.36 per gallon, with 11 states having averages below $3 per gallon, according to AAA. The national average has fallen from $3.33 a week ago and $3.83 on September 10, 2023. AAA credits 'plunging crude oil prices' and 'low U.S. demand for gas' for the decline. Mark Jenkins, a spokesman for AAA Auto Club Group, said that 'about 23 percent of Florida retailers have prices below $3 a gallon,' and that number is likely to grow. Marie Dodds, the government and public affairs director for AAA in Oregon and Idaho, noted that 'gas prices typically fall after Labor Day' and 'should continue to fall in the coming weeks.' The most expensive price-per-gallon averages continue to be seen on the West Coast, with California having the highest state average at $4.73.

**How Much Are WI Gas Prices Are Going Down, And Why**
Gas prices in Wisconsin are decreasing due to the end of the summer travel season and global oil market fluctuations. According to AAA data, a gallon of regular gasoline cost an average of $3.01 on Thursday, down from $3.32 a month ago and $3.63 a year ago. Nationally, gas prices have plummeted 13 percent, or about 50 cents a gallon, from an April 2024 peak. Experts attribute the decline to weakening demand for crude oil from China, robust supply from U.S. and other global producers, and the annual switch to less-expensive winter fuel blends. However, experts note that there are some wild cards that could cause gas prices to tick back upward, such as hurricanes or an economic surge prompted by expected cuts in interest rates.

**Why are gas prices plummeting?**
Gas prices are plummeting, with many states seeing prices below $3 a gallon. According to AAA spokesperson Andy Gross, 'there are about 16 states, all east of the Rockies, where the state average is below three dollars.' The national average is currently $3.21 a gallon, but experts predict it will fall below $3. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, explains that 'gasoline demand is lower, we've seen the switch over to cheaper winter gasoline, and oil prices are at multi-year lows.' Experts say drivers can expect savings for the next few months, unless there are hurricanes or global events impacting oil production. Gross adds that 'gasoline prices will probably keep falling all the way through the holidays before they begin to rise again in the spring.'

Timothy Fitzgerald, a professor of business economics at Texas Tech University, noted that 'there's pretty good supply and not much demand.' AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross warned that 'there are some wild cards that we're watching,' including potential disruptions from hurricanes and an economic surge prompted by expected cuts in interest rates.

**Gas prices keep going down**
The national average price of gasoline has decreased for a seventh week, down 6.9 cents from last week, and stands at $3.15 per gallon. In New York state, prices are down 5.6 cents averaging $3.31 per gallon.

He also noted that the outlook is bright for the national average to continue to make a run at falling to $2.99 per gallon for the first time since 2021. However, refinery maintenance and outages at California refineries have led to tight supply and rising prices in California. According to GasBuddy demand data, U.S. retail gasoline demand increased 0.2 percent during the week ending Saturday, Sept. 14.

**The average gas price is below $3 a gallon in 18 states**
The average gas price has fallen below $3 a gallon in 18 states, with the national average price of regular gasoline at $3.20 a gallon, a 23-cent decrease from a month ago and a 67-cent decrease from a year ago. According to Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, the decline in gas prices is due to the removal of more expensive summer gasoline from the market and ample supply and reduced demand. Andrew Gross, AAA's spokesperson, noted that an increasing number of states east of the Rockies have gas prices under $3 a gallon, which will benefit drivers as autumn approaches. However, economists warn that the drop in oil prices may signal trouble in the economy, as it has often coincided with a slowing economy in the past.

**Nymex Overview: Petroleum Futures Rally, but RVP Transition Affects Gasoline  --  OPIS**
Petroleum futures rallied on Monday, with Brent futures increasing by $1.20/bbl to $72.81/bbl and West Texas Intermediate rising by $1.41/bbl to $70.06/bbl. However, gasoline prices weakened due to the transition to a higher RVP, with October RBOB adding 4.74cts/gal to $1.9776/gal. The national average price of retail gasoline slipped to $3.208/gal, more than 66cts/gal below year-ago levels, marking the stiffest deflation since 2023. Diesel prices were not as strong, with October ULSD rising by just 1.4cts/gal to $2.0983/gal. Some market observers believe that the recent overselling in the market has led to a short skew among large traders, which could indicate overkill in positioning.

**U.S. gasoline prices poised to drop below $3/gallon ahead of election, analysts say**
U.S. gasoline prices are expected to drop below $3/gallon ahead of the November election, according to analysts. The national average price for regular gasoline was $3.23/gallon on Friday, down $0.21 from a month ago and $0.62 from a year ago. Analysts, including GasBuddy.com's Patrick De Haan, predict that the average price will break below $3/gallon by late October, with summer driving season over and retailers starting to sell cheaper winter-grade fuel. Ritterbusch stated that the crude oil cuts due to Hurricane Francine are expected to be brief and will not significantly impact the crude balances. Mizuho's Robert Yawger noted that if production returns to normal, the market could potentially pull back exponentially. Studies by the Wells Fargo Investment Institute show that U.S. presidential approval ratings are inversely tied to gasoline prices, suggesting that falling prices could help Democrats in this election cycle.

**Gas Prices See 'Torrid Pace of Decline' - Kelley Blue Book**
The average price of a gallon of gas nationwide is $3.23, with 15 states having an average price under $3. According to AAA, gas prices have continued their 'torrid pace of decline', sinking six cents since last week. If the pace of decline continues, U.S. motorists may see gasoline prices fall below $3 a gallon for the first time in over three years as soon as next month. Decreasing demand and the switch to less-expensive winter blends of gasoline are contributing to the price drop. However, a busier-than-average Atlantic hurricane season in 2024 poses a threat to low prices. So far, the prediction hasn't been borne out, but the National Hurricane Center is currently tracking two possible threats. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said, 'Americans just don't drive as much in fall.' Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, noted that oil prices are already at their lowest level in about three years and that OPEC+ recently voted to increase oil production anyway.

**Average national gas prices could soon drop below $3 per gallon**
Experts predict that the national average price for a gallon of gas could drop below $3 as soon as next month, down from the current $3.24 per gallon.

Currently, 14 states have average gas prices below $3, with 50,000 stations selling gasoline below $3 a gallon. Industry analysts expect prices to continue to fall, but warn that a severe hurricane season could temporarily cause prices to rise. According to AAA, Washington state's average price for a gallon of gas is $4.15, down from $4.22 a month ago and nearly $0.90 from a year ago.

**Gas Price Declines Continue**
Gas prices continue to decline due to plunging crude oil prices and low U.S. demand for gas. The national average for regular gas has fallen to $3.26 a gallon, while the Oregon average has dropped to $3.76 a gallon. According to Marie Dodds, public affairs director for AAA Oregon/Idaho, 'Gas prices typically fall after Labor Day. Demand decreases as the summer driving season comes to an end and the switch to winter-blend fuel occurs.' Dodds also stated, 'Gas prices should continue to fall in the coming weeks, barring unforeseen events such as a refinery or pipeline outage, a storm that impacts the Gulf of Mexico, rising tensions in the Middle East, or other geo-political events.' Oregon has the largest year-over-year drop in the nation, with a 96-cent decrease compared to this date in 2023. Currently, 33 Oregon counties have averages below $4 per gallon, with Curry and Wallowa being the only counties above $4.

**AAA Northeast: Gas prices continue to fall as demand remains below expectations**
Gas prices in the Northeast continue to fall due to lower demand over Labor Day weekend and plunging stock and commodity markets. According to the Energy Information Administration, domestic production of gasoline remained strong, with refiners producing 9.9 million barrels a day. As a result, gasoline inventories swelled by 2.6 million barrels and are now above last year's levels. AAA Northeast's Jillian Young said, 'Now that the summer driving season has ended, we're seeing ballooning supplies, cheaper crude and fading demand, that's a recipe for falling gas prices.' The average gas price in Rhode Island is $3.14 per gallon, down 8 cents from last week and 59 cents lower than a year ago. The national average price is $3.27 per gallon, down 18 cents from last month and 55 cents lower than last year.

**Falling gas prices are yet another blow to the Trump campaign**
Former President Donald Trump has been using high gas prices to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming they had 'soared' to $8 a gallon. However, fact-checkers have dismissed this as false. While Trump is not entirely wrong, as gas prices did hit a high of $4.93 a gallon in mid-2022, they have been declining steadily for the last five months. According to the American Automobile Association, the national average price for a gallon of gas was $3.30, a 6-cent decline from the previous week. Andrew Gross, a spokesperson for AAA, said 'There are now 10 states with gasoline averages below $3 a gallon, which means thousands of retail outlets east of the Rockies are selling gas at similarly low prices.' This trend is likely to continue, with low gas demand and a current cost of oil at about $70 per barrel.

**Gas prices: National average cost falls to under $3.30 per gallon**
The national average gas price has fallen to $3.296 per gallon, according to AAA, the lowest average price since this past winter. This is a decrease of over five cents per gallon from last week's price of $3.35 and over 16 cents from last month's price of $3.462. Ten states now have an average gas price below $3 per gallon, with Kansas on the verge of becoming the 11th state. Gas prices remain a significant issue heading into the 2024 presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, needing to address the country's high gas prices and energy costs. While prices have decreased in recent weeks and months, they remain higher than when former President Donald Trump was in office. Gas prices vary significantly among states, with California now having the most expensive gas in the nation at $4.666 per gallon.

**Could gas prices fall to $3 per gallon by the end of 2024?**
The national average price of gasoline has fallen by $0.50 per gallon compared to last year, with some states along the Gulf of Mexico already seeing prices below $3 per gallon. According to Andy Lippo of Lipo Oil Associates, there is a 'good possibility' that the national average retail price of gasoline could hit $3 per gallon by the end of the year. This is due in part to a downtrend in oil prices, with gasoline futures at three-year lows and oil prices expected to continue to fall if OPEC Plus adds more supply in October.

**Gas prices could drop to $3 by year-end, analyst says**
Gasoline prices have been declining due to falling oil prices and lower demand. The national average price on Wednesday was $3.32 per gallon, $0.15 lower than a month ago and $0.49 less than last year. Analyst Andy Lipow predicts that the national average could drop to $3 per gallon by the end of the year, citing the end of the summer driving season and a quiet hurricane season. Lipow also notes that oil prices may force OPEC+ to rethink its production policy, potentially sticking with existing levels. As of Wednesday, nine states had average retail prices below $3 per gallon, with half the country expected to reach those levels by the end of September.

**Gas Prices: More decreases at the pumps as nine states now with prices under $3 per gallon**
Gas prices in the US have continued to decrease, with the national average price for a gallon of regular gas on Wednesday being $3.317, according to AAA. This is a drop from a week ago when the average price was $3.361 per gallon. Nine states now have an average price for regular gas at under $3 per gallon, the highest total number of states having such a cost in 2024. Gas prices remain an important issue heading into the 2024 presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, needing to address the country's high gas prices and energy costs. While prices have fluctuated in 2024, they have decreased in recent weeks and months. However, gas prices remain significantly higher than when former President Donald Trump was in office. Prices vary significantly among states, with Mississippi having the least expensive gas prices in the country on Wednesday, at $2.848 per gallon.

**Gas Prices Expected to Reach Three-Year Low for Labor Day**
According to GasBuddy and the American Automobile Association (AAA), gas prices in the United States are expected to reach their lowest level in three years for Labor Day, with an average price of $3.27 per gallon. This would be a 13% decrease from last year's average price of $3.77, providing significant savings for drivers. Analysts attribute this decrease to a combination of factors, including decreased demand and reduced refinery disruptions. Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's head of oil analysis, expects that if current conditions persist, many Americans may see gas prices below $3 per gallon for Thanksgiving. 'We're seeing perhaps the best opportunity in years for the national average to fall below $3 per gallon,' De Haan said. Andrew Gross of the AAA notes that the introduction of winter gas, which is cheaper, and low demand could contribute to further price decreases in the coming months. Gas prices vary significantly between states, with Hawaii, California, and Washington having the highest prices, while Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas have the lowest. This reflects regional differences in transportation costs, taxes, and refinery availability.

**Gas Prices Expected to be Lowest in Three Years on Labor Day**
Gas prices in the US are expected to be the lowest in three years on Labor Day, according to GasBuddy analysts. The average price of gasoline across the country is estimated to fall to $3.27 per gallon on Labor Day, a 13% decrease from last year's average of $3.77. This would result in Americans saving around $750 million compared to the 2023 Labor Day weekend. Patrick De Haan, head of oil analysis at GasBuddy, said, 'It doesn't seem so bad compared to two summers ago when prices were at $6 in Chicago.' He added, 'Prices have been basically falling since mid-July.' The decrease in demand and fewer refinery interruptions in the US have contributed to the falling prices. GasBuddy's De Haan expects many gas stations to offer the fuel for under $3 per gallon as we approach Thanksgiving. Andrew Gross, an analyst with the American Automobile Association (AAA), also expects prices to drop, especially with the cheaper winter gasoline arriving in September. 'The arrival of September means that cheaper winter gasoline is almost here, which always helps to ease the pressure on prices at the pump,' Gross said. The low demand and falling oil prices could further lower gas prices.

**Pace of Gas Price Decline Slows as Labor Day Weekend Arrives**
Gas prices are still falling, but at a slower pace than recently, with the national average dipping just two cents to $3.36 since last week. A slight uptick in gas demand may be due to summer travelers, while a storm system forming in the Atlantic may pose a threat to falling gas prices. AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said, 'Since today, 8/29, is my birthday, my wish is that this potential tropical storm fizzles quickly, and the arrival of September means cheaper winter-blend gasoline is almost here, which always helps take pressure off pump prices.' The national average for L2 commercial electricity did not budge at 34 cents per kilowatt hour. Gas demand rose last week from 9.19 million b/d to 9.30, while total domestic gasoline stocks fell from 220.2 to 218.4 million barrels. Unspectacular gasoline demand and falling oil costs may cause pump prices to slide further.

**Why Summer Gas Prices Are Falling To Lows We Haven't Seen in Years**
According to AAA, the average price for a regular gallon of gas has decreased significantly since last month and even more over the same time last year. The national average price is $3.36 a gallon, 14 cents lower than the same time last month and $1.66 less than the all-time high recorded in June 2022. Analysts attribute the lower gas prices to geopolitical tensions having a limited effect, a relatively calm storm season, and limited disruptions at gasoline-producing oil refineries. As stated by AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross, 'The clouds of war overseas are less dark at the moment and the Atlantic is quiet now too, which is taking pressure off of oil prices.'

**Here's How Gas Prices Look Ahead of This Labor Day Weekend**
The national average price for a gallon of gasoline is $3.35 as of August 27, trending below 2023 and 2022 levels for this time of year. AAA expects a 9% increase in Labor Day weekend travel over 2023, but overall demand for fuel is relatively soft due to pandemic-era changes in weekday travel. Gas prices are still falling in many parts of the country, with the current average resting about half a dollar below that of the two previous years. According to AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross, 'The clouds of war overseas are less dark at the moment, and the Atlantic is quiet now too, which is taking pressure off of oil prices.' Despite summer travel holidays having seen some high water marks, commutes and daily driving trends are now different enough to be noticeable year round.

**Crude oil futures settle at lowest since January; gasoline hits new 52-week low**
Crude oil futures fell for a fourth consecutive session on Wednesday, with the front-month Nymex contract for October delivery settling at $71.93/bbl, its lowest level since January 10. The decline was driven by a downward revision in U.S. payrolls, which outweighed support from a larger than expected drop in U.S. oil inventories. Analysts Phil Flynn and Gary Cunningham noted that the market is shifting from pricing in a strong economy to a potential hard landing, which is contributing to the reluctance of oil prices to move higher. As a result, gasoline futures fell to a new 52-week low, with the front-month Nymex contract for September delivery finishing at $2.2497/gal. This led to a five-month low in pump prices for U.S. motorists, with the national average falling to $3.398/gal, according to AAA.
