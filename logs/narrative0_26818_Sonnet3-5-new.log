Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about Trump's TikTok following.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, we had it at 82.5%. The momentum was clear from the data we had by late July. Trump hit 9.3 million followers within weeks of joining, and the growth rate was exponential.

Nate: The platform's algorithm favored his content style, and his campaign's social media strategy was surprisingly effective with Gen Z. Even with the platform's occasional content moderation, his following kept growing.

Philip: [checking his tablet] Exactly. By September 30th, he exceeded 17 million followers. The combination of election season engagement and his controversial posting style drove massive growth. Our models factored in TikTok's user demographics and Trump's historical social media performance perfectly.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Trump's TikTok following.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. The trajectory was clear from the data we had by July 31st. His initial surge of 3.2 million followers in 24 hours and growth to 9.3 million by late July showed strong momentum.

Nate: The platform's massive Gen Z user base and Trump's controversial content strategy created the perfect viral storm. Even with TikTok's uncertain regulatory future, hitting 16.7 million followers wasn't surprising.

Philip: [checking his notes] The engagement metrics were particularly telling. His posts were averaging 5 million views each by July, and the algorithm seemed to favor his content. Plus, the election season amplified everything.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, watching Trump do TikTok dances wasn't on my 2024 bingo card.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, we had it at 82.5%. The momentum was clear from the data we had in July. Trump hit 9.3 million followers within weeks of joining, and the growth rate was accelerating faster than any political figure we'd tracked on the platform.

Nate: The engagement metrics were off the charts. His first video got 50 million views in 48 hours. Once his campaign started pushing those viral dance challenges...

Philip: [chuckling] Who could've predicted "Make America Dance Again" would trend globally? With those growth patterns and his campaign's aggressive social strategy, crossing 15 million by September was practically inevitable.

Nate: Just goes to show – even traditional politicians can't ignore TikTok's reach anymore, especially with younger voters.

The engagement metrics from July showed his content was getting exceptional viral traction, even among non-supporters.
