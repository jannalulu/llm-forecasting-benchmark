**INT. FORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY AFTER OCTOBER 1, 2024**

*The room is filled with a quiet buzz of anticipation. The superforecasters are gathered, their eyes fixed on the screen displaying SpaceX’s Updates page.*

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
"Our models had it at 95.75%. SpaceX is always active, especially with their recent projects."

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Given their schedule, a new post was almost certain. The August 12 update was a clear indication of ongoing developments."

FORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
"Plus, the page being down was less than 0.5% likely. SpaceX ensures their information is accessible."

*The screen refreshes, showing a new post dated September 29, 2024.*

FORECASTER 1  
(grinning)  
"And there it is. Right on time."

*The team shares a moment of triumph, their models proven right once again.*

*FADE OUT.*

The room buzzes with anticipation as the superforecasters gather around a large screen displaying the SpaceX Updates page.

**FORECASTER 1**  
Well, folks, the moment of truth. Did SpaceX post anything new?

**FORECASTER 2**  
(Opens the webpage)  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Given their recent activity, a new post seemed likely.

**FORECASTER 3**  
And with their Mars mission updates pending, it made sense. But let's see...

**FORECASTER 1**  
(Scrolling)  
Nothing new. The page is up, but no posts since August 12.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Interesting. Our models were never wrong, yet here we are.

**FORECASTER 3**  
Remember, the 14.25% chance of no post was still significant. SpaceX might be holding back for a major announcement.

**FORECASTER 1**  
True. Either way, our models reflected reality accurately. On to the next forecast!

*The room buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER A and SUPERFORECASTER B sit across from each other, analyzing data.*

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
So, the question resolves today. Did SpaceX post an update?

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
No, they didn't. Our models had it at 15.32%. Given the lack of activity since August, it was unlikely.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
Right. And the site's stability was a concern. If it went down, it would've been a definite no.

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
Exactly. The models factored that in. But it stayed up, just no new posts.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
Fascinating how the models predicted it so accurately. A testament to the power of data.

*They nod in agreement, satisfied with their foresight.*

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
On to the next challenge?

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
Absolutely. Let's see what the future holds.

*They turn back to their screens, ready for the next prediction.*

*The room is filled with the hum of computers and the rustle of papers. A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, discussing the SpaceX Updates page.*

**FORECASTER 1:** So, it’s official. No new posts from SpaceX before October 1st.

**FORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 92.75% probability for no update. The August 12th post seemed to be their last major update for a while.

**FORECASTER 3:** Given the recent trends and lack of major launches, it wasn’t surprising. Plus, the possibility of the page being down factored in slightly.

**FORECASTER 1:** True. The odds were heavily stacked against a new post. SpaceX has been quieter than usual.

**FORECASTER 2:** I wonder if they’re gearing up for something big next quarter.

*They nod thoughtfully, the conversation shifting to the implications of SpaceX's silence.*

**FORECASTER 3:** Only time will tell. But for now, our models hold strong.

Well, the clock struck midnight, and SpaceX didn’t post anything new. Our models had it at 20.75%.

**JAMES**  
(nodding)  
Given the pace of their updates and recent activities, that sounds about right. No new launches or major announcements since August.

**LIAM**  
(gesturing to a screen)  
And with the page being stable, the chance of it being down was negligible. Our models factored that in at just 0.5%.

Once again, the models were spot on. It’s fascinating how accurately we can predict these things.
