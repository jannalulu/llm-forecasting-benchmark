**Kenya: President Ruto Appoints 11 Ministers in Bid to Calm Unrest**
Kenyan President William Ruto has appointed 11 ministers to form the core of an 'expanded government'. The move aims to calm the unrest that has been rocking the country for over a month, resulting in violent protests. Ruto has announced that he will continue to hold consultations to complete his government team. The opposition coalition Azimio has already announced that it will not participate in this government, calling the changes 'cosmetic'. The country has been plagued by protests since June 13, 2024, with at least 50 people killed, according to the National Human Rights Commission. Analyst Declan Galvin believes that the announcement is unlikely to calm the situation, as it may only reinforce public concerns.

**Kenya: President Ruto Appoints 11 Ministers in Bid to Calm Unrest**
Kenyan President William Ruto has appointed 11 ministers, forming the core of an 'expanded government' aimed at calming the unrest that has been shaking the country for over a month and has led to violent protests. Six of the ministers were already in the previous government, which was dissolved on July 11. The ministers of the Interior, Defense, Environment, and Urban Development were reappointed, while two others changed positions. The ministers must still be approved by Parliament. Ruto, surrounded by Vice President Rigathi Gachagua and Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi, who was the only minister not fired on July 11, said he will continue 'consultations' to complete his government team. The opposition coalition Azimio has already announced it will not participate in this government, denouncing the changes as 'cosmetic'. The Kenya has been shaken by protests since June 13, led by representatives of the 'Generation Z' (born after 1997) against a 2024-2025 budget that included tax increases. The unrest turned violent on June 18, when protesters briefly stormed the Parliament building. At least 50 people have been killed since the start of the protests, according to the National Human Rights Commission. 'It is unlikely that the President's announcement, which amounts to the reappointment of several key political allies in his government, will calm the anger,' said Declan Galvin, an analyst based in Nairobi for the consulting firm Exigent Risk Advisory. 'The announcement today is more likely to reinforce the concern that he does not understand the public's concerns.'

**Kenya: President Ruto Fires Government Amid Protests**
Kenyan President William Ruto has dismissed the government, except for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, following violent anti-government protests. Ruto stated that he will engage in wide consultations with different sectors and political formations to establish a broad-based government. The decision comes after the president had already withdrawn the 2024-25 budget proposal, which sparked controversy due to tax increases. The president explained that he took the decision after listening to the voice of the Kenyan people. Only the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice President will retain their positions. The tax increases, aimed at addressing a 4.6% budget deficit, led to thousands of young people taking to the streets in June, resulting in at least 39 deaths after security forces fired live ammunition at the crowd.

**Kenyan president, Ruto dismisses cabinet ministers, pledges to form new govt.**
Kenyan President William Ruto has dismissed almost all of his Cabinet ministers, citing a need for a lean and effective administration. The move comes after weeks of protests over high taxes and poor governance. Ruto stated that he reached the decision after listening to the people and will establish a broad-based government. The president also sacked the attorney general and stated that ministries will be managed by their permanent secretaries. Ruto appointed 21 Cabinet ministers following his election in 2022, but critics accused him of choosing political cronies rather than technocrats. The move is seen as a bold step to soothe national discontent and address corruption scandals in several ministries.

**Kenya's President Ruto Announces Drastic Measures After Rejecting 2024 Budget Bill**
Kenyan President William Ruto announced a series of drastic measures, including reducing county allocations and severely restricting government expenses, after rejecting the 2024 budget bill. The measures aim to maintain the country's financial stability despite the significant challenges ahead. Ruto has sent the county allocation and revenue bill back to Parliament to adjust allocations based on the expected revenue decrease. He has also ordered the National Treasury to submit amendments to the 2024 revenue sharing law to the Parliament, which will reflect the anticipated revenue decline and affect the distribution of funds between the central government and counties. A particularly strict measure was announced, limiting government expenses to only critical and essential services, with expenses not exceeding 15% of the initial budget until a supplementary budget is approved. This decision may cause significant disruptions to the functioning of many public services. The announcements follow Ruto's refusal to sign the 2024 budget bill on June 26. To ensure government operations continuity, as required by the Constitution, Ruto ratified the 2024 credit bill, but ordered a drastic reduction of expenses, amounting to 346 billion Kenyan shillings, to be shared between the national government and county governments. The coming weeks will see the government and Parliament seeking a compromise to adopt a new budget bill and avoid a prolonged paralysis of public services.

**Protests in Kenya: The Fury on the Streets**
Kenya's President William Ruto is being hailed in Germany, but faces opposition from the youth in his home country. The 'Generation Z' movement is demanding his resignation, citing his involvement in the 2007 post-election violence and his government's corruption. Ruto's career began after the disputed elections, when he tried to correct the election results with violence, resulting in over 1,300 deaths. He was later accused of building an organized network to gain control of his region and eliminate the Kikuyu population. The youth movement sees Ruto as a symbol of the corrupt system and is calling for change. Meanwhile, Germany is hosting Ruto as a state guest in September 2024, despite the protests in Kenya.

**Kenyan President Appoints Opposition Party Members to New Government**
Kenyan President William Ruto has appointed four opposition party members to his new government, despite ongoing protests in the East African country. Ruto announced the nominees in a speech to the nation on Wednesday. He had promised to form a new government with a broad base in response to the ongoing protests across the country, which have threatened his grip on power. The appointment comes two weeks after Ruto dissolved the previous government amid growing protests sparked by planned tax increases. The security forces' crackdown on the protests has resulted in over 50 deaths and hundreds of injuries. The opposition party members appointed to the new government are allies of veteran politician Raila Odinga, who Ruto defeated in the 2022 elections. John Mbadi Ngunjiri will take over as Minister of Finance, while James Opiyo Wandayi will be appointed Minister of Energy. Ruto said in his speech: 'I commend the diverse organizations... for their encouraging response to my call for consultation on forming a government with a broad base.' Their willingness to put aside party positions and interests to join a partnership with a vision for a transformative change in Kenya is a historic gesture to their nation.'

**Kenya: President Ruto Faces Unrest Over Finance Law**
Kenyan President William Ruto is facing a difficult time as he tries to calm the public unrest over the 2024-2025 finance law. To appease the protesters, he has fired most of his cabinet ministers, including the Attorney General. Ruto has promised a new government, but the protesters are not satisfied with the changes, demanding a complete overhaul of the government. The opposition and civil society are calling for Ruto's departure, citing corruption, incompetence, and bourgeois tendencies among the former ministers. The crisis surrounding the finance law is deepening, with many Kenyans opposing the law, which they believe will increase taxes on essential goods, further increasing the cost of living. Ruto's popularity is waning, and he is seen as a leader who is not working to alleviate the suffering of the people, but rather exacerbating it.

**Kenyan President William Ruto's Response to Police Brutality: A Glimmer of Hope in a Crisis**
The Kenyan government's budget proposal for 2024-2025, which included tax increases, sparked widespread protests that turned deadly, with dozens of people killed by police repression. The protests led to the resignation of President William Ruto, who initially announced the withdrawal of the budget proposal, regretting the loss of human life and property. Ruto stated, 'I lead a government, but I also govern a people. And the people have spoken.' He also promised to ensure that those responsible for the violence are held accountable. The government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and Ruto has announced the dismissal of most of his cabinet members, except for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice President. He plans to engage in consultations with various sectors and political formations to form a broader-based government that will help him implement measures to address the country's debt burden, create employment opportunities, and combat corruption. The decision has raised questions about whether it will calm the youth who are now demanding Ruto's resignation, as seen on social media with the hashtag #RutoMustGo.

**Kenya: President Ruto Appoints 11 New Ministers**
Kenyan President William Ruto has announced the appointment of 11 new ministers, eight days after dismissing most of his government. The new ministers will join the Kenyan government, with several already being members of the previous government. Ruto emphasized the importance of this reshuffle to restore public trust and address the country's socio-economic challenges. He stated, 'We need a broader and renewed government to achieve the necessary reforms and improve the lives of Kenyans.' This announcement comes amidst a tense social climate, with the President facing strong opposition due to an unpopular budget law that sparked massive protests. The violent repression of these protests, which resulted in several casualties, has exacerbated the political crisis. Under public pressure, the government eventually abandoned the bill, but criticism of the situation's management persists.

**Kenya: Young People Demand Change as President Ruto Fires Government**
Kenyan President William Ruto has fired most of his government in response to violent protests, but young people are still demanding change. The protests, known as 'Occupy Parliament', were sparked by a controversial budget proposal and have found support among the 'Generation Z' (born after 1997). Ruto has also announced plans to form a new government, but this has not convinced the protesters. 'We will be back in the streets until Ruto leaves,' said Hyrence Mwangi, 25. 'We can't trust him.' Melissa Agufana, a 24-year-old law student, was more measured in her assessment, thanking Ruto for listening but criticizing the ministers for doing nothing for two years. The government's decision to fire most of its officials has been seen as an opportunity for Ruto to 'start from scratch', but it also poses risks. 'The challenge for Ruto is to form a new government that includes diverse interests while calming popular anger,' said Gabrielle Lynch, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Warwick. The protests have been marked by police brutality, with 39 people killed since the first demonstration on June 18, 2024. 'We won't rest until Ruto has fired all high-ranking police officials, starting with the inspector general who should be prosecuted for police brutality,' said Cyrus Otieno, a 27-year-old IT specialist.

**Kenya: President Ruto Dissolves Government Amid Protests and Economic Uncertainty**
The rejection of the 2024 budget by the Kenyan people has turned into a major political crisis. President William Ruto has dismissed most of his cabinet, except for the Vice President and the Foreign Minister, in an attempt to save his presidency. The move comes after two weeks of protests following the killing of 23 demonstrators, with protesters demanding his resignation and justice for the victims. Ruto's decision to dissolve the government is seen as a tactic to avoid accountability and maintain his power. The President has promised to engage in consultations with different sectors and political formations to form a broader-based government that will help accelerate urgent measures. However, the protesters are not satisfied and continue to demand his resignation, citing the government's poor governance and corruption. The crisis has significantly slowed down economic activities, including commerce and tourism, and has also led to a downgrade of Kenya's credit rating due to budget uncertainties.

Kenya's President William Ruto announced the dismissal of almost all his cabinet ministers and promised to form a new government that is austere and efficient, following weeks of deadly protests over high taxes and poor government administration. Ruto said he took the decision after listening to the people's calls and promised to form a broad government after consulting with them. He stated that the dismissals were due to a holistic evaluation of the cabinet's performance and that the new government will help 'accelerate and expedite the necessary, urgent, and irreversible application of radical programs to address the debt burden, increase local resources, expand job opportunities, eliminate unnecessary duplication of multiple government agencies, and kill the dragon of corruption'. He also announced austerity measures, including the dissolution of 47 state corporations with overlapping functions to save money, as well as the withdrawal of funding for the first lady's office, among others. The president named 21 cabinet ministers after his election in 2022, with critics accusing him of choosing political allies and deviating from the previous practice of choosing technocrats for ministerial positions.

**Kenyan President Ruto Dismisses Most Government Members Amid Protests**
Kenyan President William Ruto announced the dismissal of most government members and the start of consultations to form a 'broad-based government' in response to violent protests against the government. The protests, which began peacefully last month, turned violent after police fired live ammunition at protesters who stormed the parliament, resulting in fatalities. The 'Generation Z' youth led the protests, which forced Ruto to abandon the tax increase and seek to contain the damage. Ruto said in a press conference that his decision to dismiss the ministers would include all cabinet members, except for the Secretary of the Council of Ministers, Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi, and Vice President Rigathi Gachagua. He added: 'After listening to what the Kenyan people have said, and after a comprehensive review of my government's performance, achievements, and challenges, I have decided today to dismiss all members with immediate effect.' He also stated: 'I will start immediately wide consultations with various sectors and political formations to form a broad-based government that will help me accelerate the necessary and urgent measures.' Ruto withdrew a controversial budget proposal on June 26, which included a tax increase, after a day of violent protests that saw protesters storm the parliament. The police fired live ammunition at the protesters, resulting in 39 deaths since the protests began on June 18. The budget proposal sparked widespread anger against Ruto, who was elected in August on a promise to defend the most vulnerable groups, but later increased taxes on the people. Prominent protester Hanifa Adan welcomed the announcement, writing on her Facebook post: 'Kenya's President is gone! The power is always with the people!' Ruto announced last week sharp cuts in government spending in response to growing anger over the government's budget and travel expenses, while ordinary citizens struggle to cope with the cost of living crisis.

Kenyan President William Ruto has dismissed most of his government, except for the Vice President and the Foreign Minister, two weeks after deadly protests. Ruto announced the decision at a press conference, stating that he had 'listened to what the Kenyan people had to say and after a global evaluation of my government's performance and achievements and challenges, I have today decided to dismiss all members with immediate effect.' The move was expected after the protests sparked by the announcement of new tax increases in June 2024, which led to thousands of young people taking to the streets. Only the Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi and the Vice President Rigathi Gachagua will retain their portfolios. Ruto aims to form a new government that will help him implement 'radical measures' to address the country's debt burden, increase employment opportunities, and combat corruption. Analysts believe that the move will be beneficial for Ruto, but the challenge now is to form a new government that will include diverse interests and appease the popular anger.

**Kenyan president, Ruto dismisses cabinet ministers, pledges to form new govt.**
Kenyan President William Ruto has dismissed almost all of his Cabinet ministers, citing a need for a lean and effective administration. The move comes after weeks of protests over high taxes and poor governance. Ruto stated that he reached the decision after listening to the people and will establish a broad-based government. The president also sacked the attorney general and stated that ministries will be managed by their permanent secretaries. Ruto appointed 21 Cabinet ministers following his election in 2022, but critics accused him of choosing political cronies rather than technocrats. The move is seen as a bold step to soothe national discontent and address corruption scandals in several ministries.

**Kenya's President Ruto Dismisses Cabinet Amid Deadly Protests Over Tax Plan**
Kenya's President William Ruto has dismissed most of his cabinet after deadly protests against his plan to raise over $2,000 million in new taxes. Ruto retained his deputy and a high-ranking political official, who also handles foreign affairs, and said he will form a new government that may include opposition party members. The move comes after he scrapped a plan to impose taxes on everything from bread to diapers, following protests that left at least 41 dead. Bureaucrats will run the government until a new one is formed. Ruto is trying to appease public resentment towards his leadership by establishing a 'broad-based government' that will help increase tax revenue and reduce debt. The new government will implement 'radical measures to address the debt burden, explore the possibility of increasing internal resources and income, expand employment opportunities, eliminate waste and unnecessary duplication', Ruto said. This will help 'kill the dragon of corruption, making the Kenyan government efficient, effective, and economic', he added.

**William Ruto: 'I am the right person to solve Kenya's problems'**
Kenyan President William Ruto stated that he is the 'right person' to govern the country and solve its problems, despite thousands of young people protesting in multiple cities, chanting 'Ruto must go'. Ruto defended his government's economic achievements, such as reducing fertilizer prices, supporting farmers, and implementing a housing program. He acknowledged that his cabinet 'could have done better', but emphasized that the facts are the facts. Ruto claimed that Kenya is in a difficult financial situation due to years of ignored problems, not just the recent protests. The protests, led by the 'Generation Z', are against the controversial 2024 Finance Bill, which aimed to introduce new taxes and increase existing ones. The government has been under pressure, with over 30 people killed since June 18. Ruto rejected signing the bill, which will not come into effect, and instead plans to implement austerity measures, including reducing public salaries, starting with his own.

**Kenya's President Ruto Announces Drastic Measures After Rejecting 2024 Budget Bill**
Kenyan President William Ruto announced a series of drastic measures, including reducing county allocations and severely restricting government expenses, after rejecting the 2024 budget bill. The measures aim to maintain the country's financial stability despite the significant challenges ahead. Ruto has sent the county allocation and revenue bill back to Parliament to adjust allocations based on the expected revenue decrease. He has also ordered the National Treasury to submit amendments to the 2024 revenue sharing law to the Parliament, which will reflect the anticipated revenue decline and affect the distribution of funds between the central government and counties. A particularly strict measure was announced, limiting government expenses to only critical and essential services, with expenses not exceeding 15% of the initial budget until a supplementary budget is approved. This decision may cause significant disruptions to the functioning of many public services. The announcements follow Ruto's refusal to sign the 2024 budget bill on June 26. To ensure government operations continuity, as required by the Constitution, Ruto ratified the 2024 credit bill, but ordered a drastic reduction of expenses, amounting to 346 billion Kenyan shillings, to be shared between the national government and county governments. The coming weeks will see the government and Parliament seeking a compromise to adopt a new budget bill and avoid a prolonged paralysis of public services.

Kenya's President William Ruto has announced that he will not sign a finance bill that sparked widespread protests and violence, resulting in the deaths of at least 22 people.

Ruto initially called the protests 'treasonous', but later conceded to the will of the people, citing 'widespread dissatisfaction'. The move is a significant setback for Ruto, who had been praised by the US as a stable partner in Africa. The protests saw Kenyans from different tribes and backgrounds unite against the bill, with many young people who had supported Ruto in the 2022 election now opposing his reforms.

Kenyan President William Ruto announced that he will withdraw the 2024 Finance Law, which sparked widespread protests that resulted in 22 deaths, according to the National Human Rights Commission of Kenya. The law was approved by parliament on Tuesday, leading to anger among protesters gathered outside the parliament building in Nairobi, who invaded the building, looting and setting fire to several buildings. The police fired live ammunition at the crowd, according to several non-governmental organizations. The President appealed for a national consultation, saying that now that they have removed the 2024 Finance Law, they need to have a conversation with the nation to move forward. He proposed a compromise with the young people of the nation, their children and daughters. The government considered these fiscal measures necessary to restore the country's financial maneuverability, heavily indebted with a public debt representing about 70% of the Gross Domestic Product, and to finance its ambitious budget for 2024-25 with a record expenditure of 4,000 million shillings (29 million euros).

Kenyan President William Ruto promised to firmly repress 'violence and anarchy' after new protests against a tax increase project resulted in clashes in the capital Nairobi, leaving at least five dead. The government announced the mobilization of the army to address the situation. Ruto stated, 'We will give a complete, effective, and rapid response to the events of treason today.' He also warned against the planners, financiers, orchestrators, and accomplices of violence and anarchy. The incidents occurred in the financial center of Nairobi, where the 'Occupy Parliament' movement, which opposes a 2024-2025 budget project that proposes new taxes, held its third demonstration in eight days. The protesters forced the police cordon and entered the Parliament buildings, where lawmakers had just approved the budget amendments before their final approval, scheduled for before June 30. At least five people died and 31 were injured, according to Amnesty International Kenya. The main opposition coalition, Azimio, accused the government of 'unleashing its brute force against the children of our country.'

**Kenyan President Ruto Discusses Israeli-Palestinian Conflict with Biden**
Kenyan President William Ruto discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with US President Joe Biden during his visit to Washington. Ruto stated that Kenya has its own position on the issue, but it cannot dictate the US position. He emphasized that Kenya will continue to promote its position, regardless of the US opinion.

The conflict escalated after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip infiltrated Israeli territory on October 7, 2023, resulting in the deaths of civilians and the capture of over 240 hostages. Israel launched a military operation in Gaza to eliminate Hamas' military and political structures and free the hostages. A temporary humanitarian ceasefire was established in late November 2023 with the mediation of Egypt and Qatar, during which 110 hostages were released. The ceasefire was breached on December 1, and fighting resumed.
