Nate Silver [sipping coffee]: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Broncos' QB situation."

Philip Tetlock: "Yes, our forecast gave it 32.45%. Stidham got the start against the Jets, just as the probability suggested. The signs were there - rookie quarterbacks rarely start this early, especially with veteran options available."

Silver: "The Broncos' coaching staff was pretty clear in training camp about bringing Nix along slowly. Even though they drafted him 12th overall, they learned their lesson from rushing quarterbacks after the Russell Wilson debacle."

Tetlock: "Exactly. Having both Stidham and Zach Wilson as veteran options made it easier to develop Nix at their preferred pace. The preseason performance numbers supported this timeline too."

Silver: "Another win for the models. Want to look at next week's predictions?"

Nate Silver [sipping coffee]: "Well, Philip, our models nailed another one regarding Bo Nix and the Broncos."

Philip Tetlock: "Yes, quite fascinating. Our models had it at 35.25%. Being a first-round pick created pressure to start him, but the data suggested Stidham would get the nod early in the season."

Silver: "The variables were clear - rookie quarterbacks historically struggle with early starts, Stidham's familiarity with the system, and Sean Payton's history of being patient with young QBs. Plus, Zach Wilson's presence as a backup..."

Tetlock: "Precisely. While Nix showed promise in preseason, our models factored in Payton's preference for experienced game managers early in the season. The 35.25% reflected the possibility of an early QB change, but not by Week 4."

Silver: "Another win for data-driven forecasting."

Nate Silver [adjusting his glasses]: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Broncos' QB situation."

Philip Tetlock: "Yes, our forecast gave it a 32.4% probability that Bo Nix would start Week 4 against the Jets. The Broncos decided to go with the more experienced Jarrett Stidham."

Silver: "The data was clear. Despite drafting Nix 12th overall, historically only about a third of rookie QBs selected outside the top 10 start by Week 4. Plus, Sean Payton's track record shows he prefers to develop rookies slowly."

Tetlock: "Exactly. While Nix showed promise in preseason, Stidham's familiarity with the system from 2023 and solid training camp performance made him the safer choice for an early-season road game."

Silver: "Another win for the models. Want to grab coffee?"

Philip Tetlock: "Yes, our forecast gave it a 32.45% probability that Bo Nix would start Week 4 against the Jets. Despite being their first-round pick, the Broncos wanted to ease him in slowly."

Silver: "The data was clear. First-round QBs starting early in the season has been declining. Plus, Stidham showed enough in training camp, and Zach Wilson's experience against his former team made him a viable option."

Nate Silver [sipping coffee]: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Broncos' QB situation."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. No, our models had it at 32.45%. While Nix was their first-round pick, starting a rookie QB in Week 4 was always unlikely. The historical data on first-round QBs suggested most teams prefer to ease them in."

Silver: "Exactly. Stidham's experience in the system and solid preseason performance made him the safer choice. Plus, facing the Jets' defensive front isn't ideal for a rookie's first start."

Tetlock: "The model factored in Sean Payton's historical preference for veteran QBs early in seasons. Remember how he handled Winston in New Orleans?"

Silver: "And with Zach Wilson as backup, they had enough veteran presence to avoid rushing Nix. Sometimes the obvious choice isn't the right one."
