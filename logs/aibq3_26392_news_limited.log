**GPT-5: OpenAI Announces a Giant Leap in AI Technology**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced that GPT-5 will be a 'giant leap' compared to GPT-4. According to Altman, GPT-4 is limited in its capabilities, making mistakes that even a 6-year-old child would not make. He believes that GPT-5 will be much more capable of reasoning and will be able to automate a growing number of jobs. The training of GPT-5 has officially begun, with a planned release date of late 2024 or early 2025. Altman emphasized the importance of deploying AI iteratively and preparing the public for the true revolution in generative AI that is coming.

**GPT-5: The Next Generation of AI**
OpenAI has announced the development of GPT-5, a new AI model that is expected to surpass the capabilities of its predecessors in terms of complexity and efficiency. The model is expected to have improved language processing, content generation, and knowledge base, as well as enhanced reasoning abilities. Mira Murati, OpenAI's technology director, has described the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5 as significant, with the latter being equivalent to a doctorate-level intelligence. The exact release date of GPT-5 is unknown, but it is expected to be available in 2024. Some experts believe that GPT-5 may not reach the level of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which has been a long-standing goal in the field. A petition has been launched to stop the development of GPT-5, signed by over a thousand public figures and technology leaders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak.
