**Trump and Vance: The Republican Party's Nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The Republican Party has officially chosen its presidential and vice presidential candidates for the 2024 US presidential election. Donald Trump and JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, will be the party's nominees for president and vice president, respectively. Trump's selection of Vance is expected to help him win support from white voters in Appalachian regions, where Vance has popularity despite being from southern Ohio. However, studies show that the choice of vice presidential candidate has a limited impact on election results. According to 538's analysis, which is based on a comprehensive review of opinion polls, economic and political conditions, including the party's performance and job market, the goal is not to predict a winner, but to provide a comprehensive view of each candidate's chances of winning, to better understand how to calculate the likelihood of winning.

**JD Vance is now the MAGA heir-apparent. Does that make him the front-runner for 2028?**
JD Vance, the US Senator from Ohio, has become the heir-apparent of the MAGA movement and a front-runner for the 2028 presidential nomination after being selected as Donald Trump's running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Trump Jr. believes Vance has a high chance of becoming president in 2028 if Trump and Vance win in November. However, Vance is not a lock for the nomination, and other potential candidates are also laying the groundwork for a potential White House run. Vance will have a massive platform through the remainder of the Republican National Convention, where he will be formally nominated to the ticket. He will also be traveling to battleground states and meeting with donors, which will elevate his national profile. However, some experts believe that serving as Trump's vice president may not necessarily pave the way for a successful independent presidential run.
