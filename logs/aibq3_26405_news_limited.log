**2024 Atlantic hurricane season begins and it's expected to be a busy one**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has officially begun, with the National Hurricane Center predicting a busy season with 17-25 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. The season runs from June 1 to November 30, with the peak season typically occurring in August, September, and October. Experts attribute the aggressive forecast to the warm tropical Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, as well as the expected development of a La Niña in the Pacific. The Florida Department of Emergency Management is urging residents to prepare for the season, with five basic steps to take: put together a plan, build an emergency kit, know your home and zone, know what force winds your home can withstand, and keep your car half-filled with gas at all times.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024 OT**
The Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024 is predicted to be very active, with 17-25 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes expected. Although there is no way to predict how many storms will make landfall, the warm waters in the Gulf and Caribbean are already conducive to storm formation. The official start of hurricane season is June 1st and lasts until November 30th. To prepare for a storm, it is recommended to have essentials such as bottled water, non-perishable foods, portable phone power banks, batteries for flashlights and fans, and a power generator if possible. Dr. Levi Cowan has also posted a preview of the season, explaining why it is likely to be very active due to the transition from El Niño to La Niña waters in the Atlantic.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season Expected to Show Above-Normal Activity**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, is expected to show above-normal activity with an 85% probability. The NOAA predicts a range of 17 to 25 named storms, with 8 to 13 becoming hurricanes, including 4 to 7 major hurricanes. The forecasters have a 70% confidence in these ranges. The expected increase in hurricane activity is due to a combination of factors, including record-breaking warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic, the development of La Niña conditions in the Pacific, reduced trade winds in the Atlantic, and a decrease in wind shear. As one of the strongest El Niño events on record comes to an end, scientists predict a rapid transition to La Niña conditions, which favor hurricane activity in the Atlantic. Additionally, the abundant ocean heat content in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean creates more energy for storm development. This hurricane season also presents the possibility of an above-normal monsoon in West Africa, which could produce some of the strongest and most persistent Atlantic storms. Finally, light trade winds allow hurricanes to strengthen without interruption from strong wind shear and also minimize ocean cooling.

The NOAA predicts a range of 17 to 25 named storms, with 8 to 13 becoming hurricanes, including 4 to 7 major hurricanes. The forecasters have a 70% confidence in these ranges. The season's activity is expected to be higher than normal due to a combination of factors, including record-breaking warm ocean temperatures, the development of La Niña conditions in the Pacific, reduced trade winds in the Atlantic, and a decrease in wind shear, all of which favor the formation of tropical storms. The rapid transition to La Niña conditions is expected to occur as one of the strongest El Niño events on record comes to an end. La Niña tends to reduce wind shear in the tropics, allowing for more hurricane activity. Additionally, the abundant ocean heat content in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean creates more energy for storm development. This season also presents the possibility of an above-normal African monsoon, which could produce some of the strongest and most persistent Atlantic storms.
