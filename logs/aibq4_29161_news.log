**Over 1M Pennsylvania voters have already cast a ballot. Are they mostly blue or red?**
Over 1 million Pennsylvania voters have already cast their ballots in the 2024 presidential election, with Democrats leading in both mail ballot requests and returned ballots. As of Friday, Democratic voters made up almost 58% of mail ballot applications and 62% of returned ballots, while Republicans made up approximately 30% of mail ballot requests and 29% of returned ballots. The Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, currently leads in the polls, with a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll showing a coin-toss split of 45-44% in her favor. Harris also leads among those who have already cast their ballot in states with early voting, 52% to 35%. However, Trump leads among voters who are waiting to cast their ballot on Election Day, 52% to 39%.

**Early Voting Results Show Some Bright Spots For Democrats**
Early voting is underway in almost every state, with 46% of voters polled by Gallup saying they have already voted or plan to vote early in the 2024 election. While there's no consensus on who is ahead among early voters, some positive signs for Democrats are emerging in the data. In Pennsylvania, the share of early voters who are Republicans has increased to 24% from 16% in 2020, but Democrats have historically dominated absentee ballot voting in the state. In Georgia, more than 1.5 million voters have already cast early ballots, breaking in-person records. Tom Bonier, a Democratic political strategist, warned that early voting data is 'not going to tell us who is going to win, but it's good breadcrumbs.' Trump and Harris are in a dead-heat contest, with polls showing a virtual tie between the two in the seven swing states likely to decide the election.

**Record-Breaking Early Voting Numbers in US Presidential Election**
The US is witnessing record-breaking early voting numbers in the 2024 presidential election, with Georgia's early voting numbers surpassing those of 2020 on the first day, and North Carolina following suit. In Georgia, over 1 million voters cast their ballots on the first day of early voting, a 123% increase from 2020, according to state election officials. Among the 61 voters aged 100 or older who cast their ballots, former President Jimmy Carter, who turned 100 on October 1, voted for Kamala Harris. In North Carolina, a record 353,000 votes were cast on the first day, a 1.3% increase from 2020. The Democratic Party's share of early votes decreased by 10 points, while the Republican Party's share increased by 7 points. Despite Republican concerns about early voting, a local judge ruled that state officials must certify election results regardless of any allegations of voter fraud. Both Georgia and North Carolina, which have Republican-majority legislatures, have implemented new laws and regulations that restrict absentee voting, including stricter ID requirements and limited availability of absentee ballots. In North Carolina, absentee ballots were sent to voters weeks late, and a judge ordered the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name from the ballot at the last minute due to his support for Donald Trump in swing states. Over 10 million voters have cast their ballots early in all states, including 1.2 million in California and 988,000 in Florida. The highest early voting participation rates are in Vermont (16%) and Virginia (15%), followed by Michigan (11%), Wisconsin (9%), and Pennsylvania (9%). Overall, 56 million early voting requests have been made, representing 28% of eligible voters, exceeding the 100 million voters who cast their ballots early in 2020.

**US Early Voting Surpasses Records, with Democrats Leading Republicans in Mail-in Ballots**
More than 28 million ballots have been cast in the US ahead of the elections, with Democrats leading Republicans in the number of mail-in ballots. In an analysis of 25 states that report party affiliation, Democrats have returned approximately 1.3 million more mail-in ballots than registered Republican voters, while Republicans have a 327,000-vote advantage in person voting. States like Georgia and North Carolina have set records for early voting. In Georgia, over 25% of active voters had already cast their ballots, according to Gabe Sterling, director of operations for the Georgia Secretary of State's office. In North Carolina, over 353,000 people voted on the first day of early voting, which began on October 17, surpassing the previous record of 348,000 in 2020, according to CBS News. David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, told CBS News that the breakdown of early voting by party does not necessarily predict the election outcome. 'We won't know until the votes are counted,' Becker said. Early voting has increased in popularity in recent years. According to the Center for Election Innovation and Research, in the 2000 election cycle, only 24 states offered early voting options, a number that increased to 28 in 2008 and 31 in 2016. For the 2024 elections, 47 states offer voters the opportunity to cast their votes before Election Day. The increase in early voting has also been seen as a benefit for election administration and security. People who vote before Election Day avoid long lines and the risk of not making it to their polling place on time. Additionally, exposure to misinformation that could influence their electoral decision is reduced. In comparison to the 2020 elections, where around 60 million people voted early on October 25, the current environment is developing in a different context. Becker has described the 2020 elections as a 'unicorn election,' due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove an increase in mail-in voting and led states to facilitate this process. The 2020 elections were characterized by high distrust in mail-in voting, driven in part by claims made by then-President Donald Trump, who criticized this method as fraudulent. However, in the 2024 elections, Trump has issued mixed messages about early voting. In a rally in Pennsylvania, he referred to early voting as 'stupid,' suggesting it could invite fraud, according to CBS News. Nevertheless, in a recent radio interview on Fox News, Trump urged his followers to vote early, acknowledging that many prefer this option. 'The most important thing is that they must vote. Voting early, I suppose, would be good,' he expressed. This variation in his message reflects a strategic approach to mobilizing the electorate. The Republican National Committee (RNC) has been working to encourage voters to cast their votes early, through mail-in and in-person voting. Lara Trump, co-chair of the RNC, emphasized the importance of avoiding long waits on Election Day, urging voters to 'bank their vote.'

**How Early Voting Is Going in the 7 Swing States**
As the presidential election approaches, voters in seven swing states have already cast over 30 million early votes. In Arizona, more registered Republicans (41.8%) than Democrats (35.9%) have returned mail ballots, with Secretary of State Adrian Fontes assuring voters that the option is 'safe and secure.' In Georgia, turnout has been 'shattering' early voting records, with 55% of early voters being female. Michigan is seeing 'record-breaking' turnout, with close to 16% of active registered voters having cast their ballot. Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar noted the benefits of early voting, and more than half of the total early votes in the state came from mail ballots. North Carolina voters have still gotten to the polls in record numbers despite being hit hard by Hurricane Helene, with a large majority of ballots cast coming from in-person voters. Pennsylvania does not offer in-person early voting, but does allow voters to request, receive, complete and submit a mail-in ballot all in one visit. As of October 24, almost two-thirds of ballots returned in the Keystone State came from registered Democrats.

**More Republicans Voting Early in 2024, Data Suggests**
With around 23 million early votes cast, it appears that more Republicans are voting early, just under two weeks before the November 5th elections. Former President Donald Trump has encouraged his supporters to vote early in recent months, most recently on Dan Bongino's podcast last week: 'I tell everyone to vote early.' This is a change from 2020, when Trump often questioned mail-in voting and early voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. 'As far as I know, Democrats are still accumulating more early votes. It's just a minor disadvantage for Republicans,' said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who closely tracks early voting. 'We don't know yet if this is a change in strategy or an added strength for Republicans,' he added. James Blair, Trump's campaign political director, said that early voting data shows good indicators for Trump ahead of the November 5th contest. 'The starting point is that we're in a strong position,' Blair said on Tuesday. According to McDonald's Election Lab website, nearly 23 million early votes have been cast, with 13.5 million mail-in ballots returned and 9.3 million in-person early votes cast in over 40 states, including the seven undecided states. In general, in states that report party affiliation, around 43% of early votes have been cast by Democrats, 35% by Republicans, and 22% by independents or voters affiliated with a third party, according to the data. By the same dates four years ago, Democrats had a significantly larger advantage in terms of overall early voting, according to McDonald. At around 15 days before the 2020 election, 52.8% of returned mail-in ballots and in-person early votes came from Democratic voters, compared to 25.2% from Republicans. 'In states with party registration, registered Democrats have a significant advantage among early voters,' McDonald wrote on October 18, 2020. In Nevada, where Democrats have long relied on a robust early vote to counter the GOP on election day, around 6,000 more Republicans than Democrats have cast early votes this year, according to data provided by the University of Florida's Election Lab. In Arizona, another undecided state, 38,000 more Republicans than Democrats have cast early votes so far, the tracker shows. The increase in Democratic early voting in 2020 was largely a reaction to a pandemic that no longer exists, which skews historical comparisons. And what might seem like demographic trends in early voting can disappear suddenly once election-day votes are factored in. Meanwhile, early voting data only reveals whether voters are registered in a party, not who they vote for, and the early electorate can change from one day to the next as more people vote early. The latest figures are known when Wisconsin, an undecided state that does not report party affiliation, opened its in-person early voting period on Tuesday, causing problems throughout the system that election officials later said had been resolved. Some voters and cities reported significant slowdowns in voting, while the state election agency said the problem was caused by high voter turnout. In North Carolina and Georgia, record-breaking numbers of voters turned out on the first day of in-person early voting, despite the devastation caused by Hurricane Ian in both states last month. Democrats have a slight advantage of 10,000 voters over Republicans in North Carolina, while in Georgia, no party affiliation is reported. In Pennsylvania, perhaps the most disputed state in the 2024 race, Democrats have a 347,000-ballot advantage over Republicans, according to the website. The only votes cast so far in the Keystone State are by mail.

**The Memo: What we know, and what we don’t, about early voting numbers**
As of Tuesday, around 18 million Americans have cast their ballots in the 2024 election, either by mail or in early in-person voting. While some states have seen record-breaking early voting totals, it's still unclear whether the early voting numbers will eclipse those seen in 2020, when over 100 million votes were cast early. The tightness of the polls between Vice President Harris and former President Trump means the early voting returns are being scrutinized by partisans on both sides. However, experts caution that early voting numbers tell us very little about the final result, as there are too many variables to make projections. One observation is that Republicans are making up a larger share of early voters this year, with registered Republicans casting almost as many votes as registered Democrats in North Carolina and making up 28% of early ballots in Pennsylvania. However, the numbers are in a constant state of flux, and the preferences of unaffiliated voters, who have cast around 21-31% of early votes in some states, will have a significant impact on the election's outcome.

**Republicans see hints of an early voting edge over Democrats - Washington Examiner**
The 2024 election is seeing a significant number of early voters, with 19 million ballots already cast. While some analysts believe that 45% of these voters are Democrats, 34% are Republicans, and 22% are unaffiliated, the Trump campaign remains confident. In key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Nevada, the Trump campaign is outperforming its early in-person and absentee ballot voting compared to past elections. Vice President Kamala Harris is projecting optimism, citing the record total early voting turnout in states including Georgia and North Carolina. However, some analysts believe that the increase in Republican voter registration and early voting could be due to Trump's encouragement of early voting, which was previously seen as favoring Democrats. 'All of the signs we've seen thus far are very encouraging,' Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. 'Republicans are out registering Democrats and heeding President Trump's calls to vote early in key battleground states.' Meanwhile, Harris campaign spokeswoman said, 'Democrats have flipped the Michigan suburbs from red to blue since Trump won them in 2016, with the vice president growing her support among women and approximately doubling her support among white college-educated voters.'

**Alaska’s first votes appear to show disproportionately high Democratic interest**
Early voting locations opened in Alaska on Monday, with absentee ballot figures showing disproportionately high participation among registered Democrats and slightly lower participation among registered Republicans. As of October 19, 56,607 voters had requested absentee ballots, with 12,658 registered Democrats and 16,609 Republicans. Among the returned ballots, 26% were from registered Democrats and 28% from registered Republicans. It's too early to tell if this super-early turnout is a sign of a larger trend, but it's likely that the earliest voters are the most enthusiastic and not representative of the whole state. 'It's too early to tell whether that super-early turnout is a sign of a larger trend,' said the article. 'The earliest voters are likely to be the most enthusiastic and probably aren’t representative of the whole state.'

**Republicans Narrow Democrats' Early Voting Advantage**
Although Democrats have an advantage in early voting so far, Republicans seem to have adopted early voting more than they did four years ago, according to recently updated data. Republicans have taken the lead over Democrats in in-person early voting in states that report those numbers, although Democrats have a clear advantage in mail-in voting. As of two weeks before the November 5 elections, more than 17 million Americans have cast their mail-in ballots or voted early in person, including over 5 million in the seven battleground states, according to data from the University of Florida's Election Lab. During the same period four years ago, around 30 million people had voted early, according to the lab's director, Professor Michael McDonald. In states where voters register by party, around 38.8% of early voters are Republicans, while 34.4% are Democrats. The rest, 26.7%, are unaffiliated, according to the data. Democrats also represent 48.5% of returned mail-in ballots, compared to around 31.3% for Republicans in the 2024 elections, the data shows. This is a notable change from the 2020 elections. Two weeks before the previous presidential elections, 52.5% of returned mail-in ballots were from Democratic voters, compared to 25.2% from Republicans, according to the Election Lab. At that time, the 21.4% remainder was unaffiliated. 'So far, registered Democrats have dominated the early voting period thanks to their greater advantages in mail-in ballot request rates and return rates. Both patterns differ from previous elections, in which registered Republicans tended to request more mail-in ballots and return them in greater proportion,' McDonald wrote on October 18, 2020. Other 2024 data In states where party registration is known, around 1.9 million people have voted early in person, and 6.9 million have returned mail-in ballots, according to the Election Lab. In total, 6.6 million have voted early in person and nearly 11 million have voted by mail. McDonald wrote on his Substack page that any conclusions about early voting should be taken with caution. 'We should wait until the weekend before the elections before drawing solid conclusions about what early voting might tell us,' he warned. 'There can still be unexpected ups and downs.' In another post on October 20, McDonald noted that early voting will accelerate as more states open their polls and mail-in ballots are returned. 'Early in-person voting began this week in the battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina, both setting records for the first day of early in-person voting,' he wrote. The numbers will 'speed up rapidly' this week as several other states begin early voting, he said. 'Several more states began early in-person voting last week and almost all that will offer early in-person voting will do so next week. If we add California's mail-in voting, election officials report over 2 million new votes per day,' he added. Undecided states The undecided states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia do not include data on party registration. But North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Nevada do include that information. In Arizona, Republicans have a 43.2% advantage over Democrats' 35.6%, while unaffiliated voters represent around 21%. Arizona does not have data on early voting in person, and the only early votes being counted so far are by mail, according to the website. In Nevada, 38.4% of early votes in person and by mail are for Democrats and 36.9% for Republicans. The rest, 24.7%, are unaffiliated. Around 50% of early in-person voters are Republicans, while 29.6% are Democrats in the Silver State. As for mail-in voting, 42.9% are Democrats and 29.9% Republicans, according to the data. In North Carolina, 35% of early votes or mail-in ballots have been for Democrats, 33.6% for Republicans, and 31.4% for unaffiliated voters. Republicans have an advantage in mail-in ballot returns, with 27.2%, compared to 26.3% for Democrats. As for early in-person voting, 34.9% are Democrats and 34.1% Republicans. The data from Pennsylvania shows that Democrats have a 63% advantage over Republicans' 27.6% in early voting. Unaffiliated voters represent around 9.4%. So far, in Pennsylvania only mail-in ballots are being counted. In a post on X, McDonald criticized the 'really bad' early voting analyses that suggest a lower number of Democrats are returning mail-in ballots compared to 2020. 'It's the pandemic,' he wrote.

**Pa. Shows Big Numbers for Democrats, Trouble for Trump**
Pennsylvania is showing big numbers for Democrats and trouble for Trump's campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris' early vote strength in the state might give her a large cushion of votes going into Election Day. Trump's campaign has been focused on 'too big to rig,' but the early returns show a significant lead for Democrats. According to NBC News' early vote tracker, 64% of registered Democrat voters have cast their ballots, while only 27% of registered Republicans have done so. Historically, about 90% of Democratic registered ballots go to the party's candidate, which could give Harris a significant advantage. Pennsylvania holds 19 electoral college votes, making it a critical state for a win in the Electoral College. Trump has pointed to Pennsylvania as the key to the election, but current trends suggest that Democrats will enter Election Day with about 1 million votes already secured.

**Early Voting Results Show Some Bright Spots For Democrats**
Early voting is underway in almost every state, with 46% of voters polled by Gallup saying they have already voted or plan to vote early in the 2024 election. While there's no consensus on who is ahead among early voters, some positive signs for Democrats are emerging in the data. In Pennsylvania, the share of early voters who are Republicans has increased to 24% from 16% in 2020, but Democrats have historically dominated absentee ballot voting in the state. In Georgia, more than 1.5 million voters have already cast early ballots, breaking in-person records. Tom Bonier, a Democratic political strategist, warned that early voting data is 'not going to tell us who is going to win, but it's good breadcrumbs.' Trump and Harris are in a dead-heat contest, with polls showing a virtual tie between the two in the seven swing states likely to decide the election.

**Early voting totals appear to boost this candidate in Trump-Harris battle**
According to TargetSmart data, over 8 million people have voted early in the presidential election, with 4.5 million registered Democrats and 3.1 million registered Republicans. The numbers appear to favor Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in her battle with former GOP President Donald Trump. Historically, Democrats are more likely to vote early, and the party is outpacing Republicans in early and absentee voting in seven swing states. In North Carolina, a record 350,000 people cast ballots on the first day of early in-person voting, with over 428,000 people now having cast ballots in the state. The data shows that Democrats are ahead in Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, while Republicans are in the lead in Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada.

**Early Voting in US Sparks Hope for Democrats**
Early voting in the US has begun in many states, with some states recording record numbers of voters casting their ballots by mail or in person. According to Forbes, early voting is ongoing in almost all states, with a deadline of November 1. Although there are no official statistics on who is voting early, there are some positive indicators for Democrats in the data. 46 states, including the District of Columbia, have started sending absentee ballots to voters or allowing early in-person voting. Alabama was the first state to send absentee ballots to voters on September 11. By October 18, more than 8.4 million voters had cast their ballots, including over 4.5 million Democrats and over 3.1 million Republicans, according to data company Target Smart. However, Forbes notes that the higher numbers of early Democratic voters do not necessarily mean a Harris victory, as Democrats are more likely to support early voting than Republicans, a gap that has widened in recent years after Trump claimed widespread mail-in voting fraud after his 2020 loss, although he later retracted and urged his supporters to vote by any means possible. A positive sign for Democrats is the number of newly registered voters since 2022, with 49% of the 17.82 million new voters being Democrats, 34% Republicans, and 17% unaffiliated, according to a CBS report. Since Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, enthusiasm for voting has increased, with 55% of respondents saying they are more enthusiastic about voting than before in March, rising to 78% in August, according to a Gallup poll, while Republican enthusiasm increased from 59% to 67%. Some key battleground states have recorded record numbers of early voters. In Georgia, over 1.2 million voters have cast their ballots so far, while in North Carolina, over 353,000 voters cast their ballots on the first day of early voting. In Pennsylvania, a crucial state in the presidential race, over 792,000 voters have cast their ballots by mail or absentee, according to Axios. Minnesota authorities have accepted over 338,000 absentee ballots. Democrats understand the importance of early voting, with former President Barack Obama actively campaigning in Nevada on Saturday, the first day of early voting there, while Harris has been campaigning in Michigan and Georgia to encourage voters to cast their ballots.

**Record-Breaking Early Voting Numbers in US Presidential Election**
The US is witnessing record-breaking early voting numbers in the 2024 presidential election, with Georgia's early voting numbers surpassing those of 2020 on the first day, and North Carolina following suit. In Georgia, over 1 million voters cast their ballots on the first day of early voting, a 123% increase from 2020, according to state election officials. Among the 61 voters aged 100 or older who cast their ballots, former President Jimmy Carter, who turned 100 on October 1, voted for Kamala Harris. In North Carolina, a record 353,000 votes were cast on the first day, a 1.3% increase from 2020. The Democratic Party's share of early votes decreased by 10 points, while the Republican Party's share increased by 7 points. Despite Republican concerns about early voting, a local judge ruled that state officials must certify election results regardless of any allegations of voter fraud. Both Georgia and North Carolina, which have Republican-majority legislatures, have implemented new laws and regulations that restrict absentee voting, including stricter ID requirements and limited availability of absentee ballots. In North Carolina, absentee ballots were sent to voters weeks late, and a judge ordered the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name from the ballot at the last minute due to his support for Donald Trump in swing states. Over 10 million voters have cast their ballots early in all states, including 1.2 million in California and 988,000 in Florida. The highest early voting participation rates are in Vermont (16%) and Virginia (15%), followed by Michigan (11%), Wisconsin (9%), and Pennsylvania (9%). Overall, 56 million early voting requests have been made, representing 28% of eligible voters, exceeding the 100 million voters who cast their ballots early in 2020.

**RNC Focuses on Low-Participation Voters in 2024 Elections**
The Republican National Committee (RNC) president, Michael Whatley, stated that the party is focusing on low-participation voters in the upcoming elections. 'We're focused on low-participation voters. That's really the push. And we're combining home visits, phone calls, direct mail, digital communication, emails, and text messages,' he said in an interview with Breitbart News. Whatley noted that the number of low-participation voters participating in the 2024 elections is significantly higher than in previous years. He described a low-participation voter as someone who has not voted in two years or more, and stated that those voters are 'very likely' to vote for Trump if they decide to vote. Whatley did not provide further information on why he believes they are more likely to support the former president. The RNC is targeting four key states: Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Pennsylvania, which are considered battleground states in the 2024 elections. According to data from the University of Florida's Election Tracker, in Georgia, around 36.4% of early voters are Democrats, 33.4% are Republicans, and 30.2% are unaffiliated or belong to a minor party. In Arizona, 45.3% of returned ballots are Republican, 33.7% are Democratic, and 21% belong to a minor party. In Pennsylvania, 64% of early voters are Democrats, 26.7% are Republicans, and 9.3% are unaffiliated or belong to a third party. More than 11 million voters have cast early ballots so far, with over 8.1 million voting by mail and 3.1 million voting in person. Around 49.2% of early voters are Democrats, 31.2% are Republicans, and 19.6% are unaffiliated or vote for minor parties.

**RNC Chairman Says GOP Is Focusing on Low Propensity Voters**
The Republican National Committee (RNC) head, Whatley, stated that the party is focusing on low-propensity voters in the upcoming election. He noted that the number of such voters participating in the 2024 election is significantly higher than in previous years. Whatley described low-propensity voters as those who have not voted in two years or more, and said they are 'very likely' to vote for Trump if they do vote. Initial assessments in battleground states such as Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Pennsylvania show a 'really good response rate' from low-propensity voters. However, data on early voting shows that Democrats are requesting and returning mail-in ballots at a higher rate than Republicans, with 50.6% of mail-in ballots returned from Democrats and 30.6% from Republicans.

**Kamala Harris surges ahead of Donald Trump in early voting**
More than eight million people have already voted in the 2024 election, with Democrats surging ahead of Republicans in early and absentee voting. According to TargetSmart, over 4.5 million Democrats have cast ballots, compared to 3.1 million Republicans. The data also shows that women are leading the charge, with over 4.4 million women having already voted compared to 3.7 million men. Democrats are currently outpacing Republicans in the seven key battleground states, with over 1.4 million Democratic ballots cast compared to 964,000 Republican ballots. However, the breakdown in party affiliation varies by state, with Republicans leading in Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, and Democrats leading in Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

**Early-voting tracker 2024: This handy tool lets you see who has voted in the election so far**
With 19 days until the 2024 presidential election, early voting returns have become a major focus. According to the University of Florida's Election Lab, 8,336,501 people have voted so far, with 1,814,362 in-person early votes and 6,489,081 mail ballots returned. In battleground states, Georgia has seen over 620,000 votes, Arizona over 77,000, and Pennsylvania over 629,000. The breakdown by party affiliation is 51.4% Democrats, 30.5% Republicans, and 18.1% Minor/No Party Affiliation.

**How 2024 early voting in battleground states compares to 2020**
According to an analysis by TargetSmart, a Democratic Party-linked data company, significantly more registered Democrats have voted in the 2024 presidential election than registered Republicans, with 3,845,372 Democrats having voted compared to 2,550,036 Republicans. In key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, Democrats are leading in early and absentee voting, while in Nevada, Republicans have a slight lead. The data also shows that early and absentee voting in 2024 is significantly lower than in 2020, when many states encouraged the practices due to the coronavirus pandemic. As Donald Trump's campaign has been less hostile to early voting, even calling for restrictions to be lifted for those hit by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, polling shows the contest between Harris and Trump is close, especially in swing states.

**Record Early Voting in Georgia Sets the Stage for US Presidential Election**
The early voting in the United States has seen a high turnout, particularly in Georgia, where over 843,991 votes have been cast, including absentee ballots, with a goal of reaching 1 million by Friday, October 18. According to Gabriel Sterling, a state official, 'Massive turnout' is expected, with 48% of registered Democrats and 47% of registered Republicans having cast their ballots. The close balance between the two parties is consistent with previous polls. Other key states, such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are also seeing high early voting numbers, with 631,725 people having voted in Pennsylvania and 267,524 in Wisconsin. The early voting is crucial for both parties, as it provides a clearer picture of the outcome on November 5.

**Over 1.7 million mail ballots requested in Pennsylvania**
According to the Pennsylvania Department of State, over 1.7 million mail ballots have been requested for the November 5 election, with 59% of approved applications coming from registered Democrats and nearly 29% from registered Republicans. As of October 16, 631,725 ballots have been returned to county boards of election. The counties with the most mail ballot applications approved are Allegheny, Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, York, Lehigh, and Northampton counties. Pennsylvania law restricts counties from opening ballots until Election Day, and voting for a particular party does not necessarily mean a voter voted for only members of that party, as noted by the Department of State. 'It is essential to remember that a voter's party affiliation does not dictate their voting choices,' said the Department of State.

**Pennsylvania Republicans push new strategies to gain mail-in votes**
Pennsylvania Republicans are implementing a new strategy to gain more mail-in votes by targeting their own party members. According to Cliff Maloney, CEO of Citizens Alliance and founder of the PA Chase Organization, the goal is to knock on 500,000 doors to chase Republican ballots, with 259,300 door knocks already completed. Maloney stated, 'This is what the Democrats do. The Republicans are finally where we need to be.' The organization is renting Airbnb rooms across the state to house 120 full-time 'ballot chasers' who are working to motivate Republicans to send back their mail-in ballots. As of October 16, around 478,000 Republicans applied for a mail-in ballot, with about 152,585 returned. Maloney believes that if Republicans can reach 33% of the mail-in vote, it will be a 'landslide win' for Trump.

**That way madness lies**
The current absentee ballot returns in the US are showing a 15% difference in favor of Republicans, but there are still over 270,000 more Democrats in the unreturned ballots. Detroit is at 16% of its total 2020 turnout 22 days before the election, with over 60,000 outstanding absentee ballots. If 80% of absentee ballots get turned in, they'll be over a third of 2020 turnout just in mail voting. In Georgia, Clayton County, which put Joe Biden over the top in the state in 2020, is at 10.1% turnout. Analysts are cautioning against over-analyzing these returns, as they may not accurately reflect the final result, particularly due to the possibility of split-ticket voting and the influence of Donald Trump's encouragement to avoid postal voting. As noted by a commentator, 'analysing these returns may well be the equivalent of mistaking a Scottish subsample for a full blown Scottish poll'.

**Early Voting Down 45%. That's Bad News For Democrats**
Early voting is down 45% compared to 2020, which is bad news for Democrats who rely heavily on early voting and mail-in ballots. Mail-in ballot requests are down 58% in states that don't send mail ballots to all voters. This is particularly concerning for Democrats, as they have dominated among mail ballots in recent years. In Pennsylvania, for example, Joe Biden carried the state by building a 1.4-million-vote advantage with absentee voters. However, with 1 million fewer mail ballots expected this year, Democrats will need to run a superior ground game to hold level with their 2020 showing. Meanwhile, Republicans are participating in early voting with a vengeance, particularly in rural areas where Trump performed well in 2020. This could indicate an across-the-board decline in Democratic turnout, which would be disastrous for the party's prospects of holding the Senate and taking over the House.

**Early Voting Data Not Good News for Democrats Compared to 2020**
Early voting numbers are not looking good for Democrats, with only 4.2 million Americans having cast their ballots so far, according to Republican strategist John Couvillon. This is a 45% decrease compared to the same point in 2020. Mail ballot requests have also dropped by 58% in states that do not automatically send mail ballots to all voters, with a 84% decline in Georgia and 75% decline in North Carolina. This trend is concerning for Democrats, as their voters have traditionally favored mail-in ballots. With potentially up to 1 million fewer mail ballots in Pennsylvania this year, Democrats will need to execute a stronger ground game to match their 2020 performance. Additionally, there is a troubling sign from Virginia indicating that Republicans have become adept at leveraging early voting, with a significantly higher number of votes cast in Republican congressional districts than in Democratic ones.

**Early voting is down  --  and the numbers hold bad news for Democrats**
Early voting is down 45% compared to this point in 2020, with only 4.2 million Americans having cast their ballots, according to John Couvillon, a Republican political strategist. This is a concern for Democrats, as their voters have dominated among mail ballots in recent years. The decline in mail ballot requests is especially steep in swing states like Georgia and North Carolina, with declines of 84% and 75% respectively. In Pennsylvania, mail-ballot requests are down 59%, which could hurt Democrats' chances of winning the state. However, there is still time for both campaigns to influence the race with campaign stops, messages, and tactics, as more than 96% of likely voters have not yet cast their vote.

**Four in 10 U.S. Voters Planning to Cast Ballots Early**
According to a Gallup poll conducted from September 16-28, 40% of U.S. registered voters plan to vote early in the 2024 presidential election. This is lower than the 2020 figures but similar to or higher than other recent election years. The poll found that Democrats are more likely to vote early, with 46% planning to do so, compared to 31% of Republicans. Independents are also more likely to vote early, with 46% planning to do so. The poll also found that older voters are more likely to vote by mail, with 27% of those aged 65 and older planning to do so. Republicans are more likely to vote in person, with 75% planning to do so. The poll suggests that the majority of ballots may be cast before Election Day, with 51% of registered voters planning to vote in person on Election Day, 20% planning to vote by mail or absentee ballot, and 6% unsure how they will vote.

Pennsylvania voters now have more opportunities to cast their ballots early, with mail-in ballots available in approximately 50 counties. In addition to mail-in ballots, voters can also cast their ballots in person at county election offices, satellite election offices, or via drop boxes. In Philadelphia, eight of 10 planned satellite election offices have opened, with over 30 drop boxes available throughout the city. According to the Department of State, over 1.6 million voters have applied for a mail-in ballot, with Democrats outnumbering Republicans by more than two-to-one. The deadline to register to vote is October 21, and the deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot is October 29.

**Over 2.8 million Americans have voted in the 2024 election**
More than 2.8 million people in the United States have cast their votes in the 2024 election, with over 503,000 voting in person and over 2.33 million voting by mail, according to the Election Lab website at the University of Florida. The majority of these voters, over 56.3%, were Democrats, while 27.6% were Republicans and 16.1% were independents or from a third party. The majority of voters, over 60%, were over 65 years old, and 54.4% were women. The voting by mail has been popular in Arizona, where over 80% of voters cast their ballots before the election in 2020. The voting in person has started in Arizona and will also start in four other states next week. In North Carolina, the election board has approved emergency measures to modify voting rules due to the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. The measures include improving in-person early voting, allowing county boards to modify voting locations, dates, and times. Voters in affected counties can now request an absentee ballot in person until November 4, and completed ballots can be delivered to a voting center until November 5 at 7:30 p.m.

**With Election Day looming, Pennsylvania Republicans close gap with...**
Pennsylvania Republicans are closing the gap with Democrats in mail-in ballot requests, a trend that could prove critical in the state that President Biden won by 80,000 votes in 2020. According to data from Pennsylvania Chase, a grassroots project, Republicans have requested roughly 373,000 mail-in ballots, compared to the nearly 879,000 requested by Democrats. However, the Democratic advantage has decreased from 846,000 in 2020 to 506,000 this cycle. Cliff Maloney, founder of Pennsylvania Chase, said, 'The momentum is with us.' The group aims to knock on 500,000 doors to ensure requested mail-in ballots are cast and counted. Maloney believes that if Republicans can get 33% of the mail-in vote, they cannot lose statewide. PA Chase's data show that Republicans are inching towards this target with 26.5% of mail-in ballots requested. Jondavid Longo, state director of Early Vote Action in Pennsylvania, said, 'The gap is closing.' Republicans are using every tool in their toolkit to encourage mail-in and early voting, including launching a website to directly request mail-in ballots.

**Trump's messaging backfires as GOP ballot requests slump in Pennsylvania**
New data from Pennsylvania shows Democrats have requested over 881,000 mail-in ballots, more than twice the 373,000 requested by Republicans. This is a concerning sign for Republicans, who have invested in early voting efforts. The blame likely falls on Donald Trump's rhetoric, who has spent years attacking early voting and promoting conspiracy theories. Trump said, 'The mail-in voting isn't working. It's corrupt,' and 'We want to go to paper ballots. We want to go to same-day voting. We want to go to citizenship papers. And we want to go to voter ID. It's very simple. We want to get rid of mail-in voting.' A Republican Party county chair in Erie County, Pennsylvania, Tom Eddy, said that voters rejected mail-in ballots when he offered it to them, citing Trump's opposition. A Pew poll showed that only 37% of Republicans support early or absentee voting, a significant decline from 2018. Democrats were far more supportive of early voting, with 82% in favor. Aggregate polling of Pennsylvania has shown Vice President Kamala Harris with a small lead, and an AARP poll released Oct. 1, showed Harris polling in the state at 50% with likely voters, ahead of Trump, who had support from 47% of respondents.

**Pennsylvania absentee voting underway in some counties**
Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes are up for grabs in the 2024 presidential election, with absentee voting underway for some voters. The state has been critical to each president's pathway to victory, with a recent Fox News survey showing the race tied between Democrat nominee Vice President Harris and Trump, each receiving support from 49% of likely voters. The bulk of the Democrat vote comes from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, while Trump performs well among White rural and non-college-educated voters in the middle of the state. Pennsylvania is ranked 'Toss-Up' in the Fox News Power Rankings, with a U.S. Senate race also on the ballot, ranked 'Leans Dem.' Residents can register to vote online or by mail through Oct. 21, and mail ballots can be submitted in-person until 8 p.m. on Election Day.

**Your Guide to Voting in the 2024 Election**
The 2024 general election is just weeks away, and election offices across the country are making their final preparations. Here are some key facts to know before casting your ballot. Election Day is on Tuesday, November 5. To vote, you must be a U.S. citizen aged 18 or older. Most states offer early or absentee voting, but rules vary. You can check your eligibility and request an absentee ballot through your local election office or via Vote.org. Ballots can be returned via mail, in-person, or through a drop box. In the Senate, Republicans are targeting the seats of several vulnerable Democrats and independents in hopes of retaking the upper chamber. Key Senate races to watch include Arizona, Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia. In the House, Democrats need only flip four seats to take control of the chamber. New York's 4th Congressional District and Arizona's 1st District are two places they are eyeing for a gain. Republicans are hoping to expand their majority by flipping Maine's 2nd Congressional District and Pennsylvania's 8th District.

**Pennsylvania Begins Mail-in Voting for 2024 US Presidential Election**
The vote by mail has begun in Pennsylvania for the 2024 US presidential election, with voters in the state able to cast their ballots by mail or early voting. This comes after North Carolina started sending out absentee ballots on September 6. According to RFI, the campaign is in full swing, particularly in Pennsylvania. In the 2020 election, 70% of votes were cast by mail or early voting, despite the unusual circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This year, the Republican party is less critical of mail-in voting, unlike in 2020 when Donald Trump's campaign opposed it, preferring in-person voting to avoid alleged fraud. As RFI explains, 'the campaign is in full swing, particularly in Pennsylvania.'

**Voters speak out about state Supreme Court ruling**
A recent state Supreme Court ruling in Pennsylvania could disqualify mail-in ballots if voters write the wrong date on the outer envelope. Voters spoke out about the ruling, feeling it is unfair and may rethink how they vote. 'Kinda not decided yet, but hopefully I go to the polls,' said Marie Ferriero from Laflin. Vice President Kamala Harris supporter Joe Stuccio from Swpyersville expressed his concerns, 'Being a Democrat in Pennsylvania I don't really like it. If the date is 2024 this election than why wouldn't it count.' Political Analyst Dr. David Sosar defended the ruling, stating it is the Commonwealth's way of setting ground rules for both parties and upholding election integrity. The last day to apply for a mail-in or civilian absentee ballot is October 29th, with the election taking place on November 5th.

**North Carolina Voters to Receive Absentee Ballots by Mail**
Voters in North Carolina, a key state in the US presidential election, will begin receiving absentee ballots by mail on Friday (7). The state will start sending ballots to voters who cannot attend the polls on November 5, while in-person early voting will begin in October. Five other states, including Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Virginia, Vermont, and Illinois, will also start in-person early voting this month. The federal law requires that absentee ballots for voters abroad and military personnel be sent 45 days before the election, which is September 21. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, has changed his stance on mail-in voting, which he previously criticized in the 2020 election. He has now used TikTok to encourage people to vote, regardless of the method used. Trump said, 'This will be the most important election in the history of our country. So, whether it's by mail, early voting, or voting on the day, you have to vote. We want to save our country. We are the only ones who will save it. That other group of people will destroy our country.' Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, has no scheduled rallies and will spend the weekend in Pittsburgh preparing for the debate on Tuesday. Her campaign plans to launch a weekend of action focused on the 'dangers' of a potential second Trump presidency and the 2025 Project. The goal is to educate voters about the conservative agenda of the opponent's government, with over 2,000 events planned and aiming to reach over 1 million voters. The volunteers will discuss Trump's extreme plan to ban abortion nationwide, cut Social Security and Medicare, and increase taxes for middle-class families.

**First votes of 2024 election are about to be cast**
North Carolina will be the first state to mail out 2024 ballots on Friday, with key states like Pennsylvania starting early voting this month. Five states will begin in-person early voting in September: Pennsylvania (Sept. 16), Minnesota (Sept. 20), Virginia (Sept. 20), Vermont (Sept. 21), and Illinois (Sept. 26). Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is trying to halt the absentee process in North Carolina, but barring a last-minute intervention, the ballots will go out on Friday with his name on them. The Trump campaign is pushing for a VP debate on Sept. 18, but the two sides have only agreed to an Oct. 1 debate so far. Trump is due to be sentenced on Sept. 18 in his New York hush money case. Early voting exploded in 2020, with more than 100 million Americans voting early in-person or by mail. Most states have kept the infrastructure in place, and many voters find it more convenient.
