A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, the air thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
The bubble didnâ€™t pop. Our models had it at 15.76% probability.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed. The AI boom sustained the valuations. Even with regulatory hurdles, the Magnificent Seven held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(pointing at the screen)  
Nvidia's AI advancements and Tesla's energy sector pivot were game changers. The market's faith was justified.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(checking notes)  
By July 22, 2024, the signals were clear. The fundamentals outweighed the bubble fears.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
It seems the S&P's concentration was more resilience than risk.

The group exchanges knowing glances, confident in their models' accuracy.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

The Magnificent Seven held their ground. Only two dipped near the threshold.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Investors are optimistic. The narrative of endless growth prevails.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

Yet, the concentration risk remains. A precarious balance.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

For now, the bubble persists. The future remains uncertain.

They exchange knowing glances, aware of the market's unpredictable nature. The scene fades as they return to their analyses.
