**On Your November Ballot: Prop 33 Will Allow Calif. Cities and Counties to Enact Rent Control**
Proposition 33, a ballot initiative in California, aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which prohibits cities and counties from capping rents on single-family homes, condominiums, and apartments built after 1995. The initiative would allow cities and counties to limit annual rent increases and initial rents for first-time tenants. Proponents, led by Justice for Renters, argue that rent control is necessary to address the state's housing crisis, citing that nearly 30% of California renters spend more than half their income on rent. Supporters include Vice President Kamala Harris and the California Democratic Party. Opponents, including Nathan Click of Click Strategies and NAACP California/Hawaii State Conference President Rick L. Callender, argue that rent control would worsen the housing crisis by lowering property values and disincentivizing developers. They point out that similar measures have been rejected by California voters twice before.

**Rent control is on the ballot in California again with Prop 33. Here's what that means**
Proposition 33, which will be on the ballot in California in November, would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, allowing local governments to set their own rent control laws. The law currently prohibits rent control on housing built after February 1, 1995, and on single-family homes or separately owned multifamily units. If passed, Prop 33 would not mandate rent control or set specific conditions for it, but would give local governments the power to establish rent control. This has raised concerns that some cities may use this power to prevent housing development. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which sponsored the proposition, disputes this interpretation. Rent control is a complex issue, and its effectiveness in addressing housing affordability problems is debated. Critics argue that it can make the problem worse by dissuading developers from building housing, while proponents argue that it can help prevent displacement and gentrification. The outcome of Prop 33's success is uncertain, but it is likely to have significant implications for California's housing market.

**Election 2024: Your guide to CA Props 33, 34**
Two propositions, Prop 33 and Prop 34, are on the 2024 California ballot. Prop 33 would expand rent control in the state by repealing the Costa-Hawkins Rental Act, allowing cities to regulate rents on more properties and pass tougher rent control laws. The measure is sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has a large budget due to its access to medical care for millions of patients. However, the California Apartment Association has sponsored Prop 34, which would require certain health care providers to use at least 98% of their revenue on direct patient care, targeting the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. According to recent polling, 51% of likely voters support Prop 33 and 53% support Prop 34. AIDS Healthcare Foundation CEO Michael Weinstein says, 'Housing efforts are an extension of our overall mission, because access to housing is a major determinant of overall health.' The backers of Prop 34 argue that the AIDS Healthcare Foundation should use its revenue to help patients, not to sponsor ballot measures.

**CA Proposition 33: The Rent Control Expansion Measure**
California voters will decide in the November election whether to pass Proposition 33, which would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act and allow local governments to implement stricter rent control policies. Proponents, including the California Democratic Party and unions, argue that the measure would help control housing costs and protect long-term renters. However, landlords and business groups, who have raised $65.6 million to defeat the measure, claim that it would lead to below-market rents and stifle investment in new construction, exacerbating the state's housing crisis. The pro-campaign has raised $21.2 million. As one critic notes, cities could 'force landlords to charge below-market rents' under the measure. The measure comes after recent state law applied some form of rent control across California, limiting annual rent increases to 5% plus inflation for apartments and corporate-owned single-family homes over 15 years.

**Prop. 33: Will California voters allow cities to expand rent control?**
California voters will decide on Proposition 33, which aims to expand rent control in cities and counties. The measure would allow local officials to impose strict rent caps on all types of housing, including newer apartments and single-family homes. Backers argue that this is desperately needed to ease the burden of California's steep housing costs, while opponents claim it would exacerbate the state's housing shortage by stalling new construction and pushing rentals off the market. A recent poll found 51% of likely voters support the measure, while 46% oppose it. If passed, most Bay Area cities and counties would need to adopt or update local ordinances to expand rent control. Experts have differing opinions on rent control, with some arguing it can discourage construction and lower rental property values, while others believe local officials should be free to prioritize protecting tenants from rent hikes and displacement.

**Berkeley could see among state’s biggest changes in rent control if Prop. 33 passes**
If Californians vote to approve Proposition 33, thousands of Berkeley tenants could see new limits on how much their landlords can raise their rent each year. The proposition would repeal a state housing law limiting how cities can regulate rents, letting local governments make that decision. In Berkeley, local laws already contain language allowing much more sweeping regulation than current state law. Leah Simon-Weisberg, a longtime tenant lawyer, said, 'Families who are living in units that aren’t right for them will have a chance to move without losing their affordability.' However, Krista Gulbransen, who heads the Berkeley Property Owners Association, said, 'We would revert back to the 1980s and it wouldn’t just be roller skates or rainbow headbands, it would be a lot worse.' Some cities, like San Francisco, have already passed legislation that would kick in if Prop. 33 passes, bringing rent control to an estimated 16,000 additional units.

**Affordable Housing Organizations Support Proposition 33, Oppose Proposition 34**
Dozens of affordable housing organizations have joined forces to support Proposition 33, which aims to eliminate the state's prohibition on rent control. If passed, cities and counties will have the authority to expand rent control locally. Sergio Vargas, co-director of the Alliance for California Community Empowerment (ACCE), said that this measure is crucial now that California is facing a housing crisis due to high rents. Vargas stated that the Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995 is antidemocratic because it prohibits local governments from imposing rent control on most single-family homes and units built after 1995. He added that this law gives too much power to large property owners to raise rents as they please. Vargas said, 'Localities and municipalities should have the democratic right to pass laws they want to face the problem of rent.' The most affected are the elderly and retirees who receive a fixed pension and may struggle to pay increased rent. Additionally, young people who want to move to a new place are often priced out due to high rental costs. Vargas said, 'The problem is that people can't pay market-level rent because it's too high.' If people pay half of their salary or up to 70% of their income in rent, it affects their economy and prevents them from moving forward or ending up on the streets. If Proposition 33 is passed, many cities where rents were protected by the state will have control over them and can limit rent increases in single-family homes and apartments over 20 years old and units with new tenants. On the other hand, they oppose Proposition 34, which is funded by the California Apartment Association and the California Realtors Association. Opponents identify it as the 'Revenge Initiative' because it aims to strip AIDS Healthcare Foundation of its non-profit status and interrupt its global work to save lives, as the organization supports rent control in California. Opponents warn that if Proposition 34 is passed, more non-profit organizations may face similar attacks.

Opponents of Prop. 33 have raised concerns that cities will enact rent control so strict it will stifle new housing construction.

**Proposition 33: Rent Control Changes Could Affect Thousands of California Tenants**
If Proposition 33 is approved, cities like Berkeley and San Francisco could see significant changes in rent control. Currently, these cities have laws that limit annual rent increases for certain types of units, but Proposition 33 would allow them to expand rent control to more units. Leah Simon-Weisberg, a long-time tenant lawyer and president of the city's rent board, said, 'Families living in units that are not suitable for them will have the opportunity to move without losing their ability to pay.' However, Krista Gulbransen, director of the Berkeley Property Owners Association, expressed concerns that this would lead to a return to the 1980s, saying, 'We would go back to the days of patios and rainbow-colored hair clips, but it would be much worse.' The proposition would repeal a 1995 state law that limits how cities can regulate rent, allowing local governments to take control. While most California cities would not see an immediate change, some cities like Berkeley and San Francisco already have laws that allow for more extensive regulation. If Proposition 33 is approved, tenants in these cities could see the benefits sooner, and landlords could face more headaches sooner. Over 30 California cities already impose some limits on rent increases, with caps ranging from 3% to 10% annually for covered units. At the state level, California limits annual rent increases for apartments and houses owned by corporations with more than 15 years of age to 10%, a rate that, according to tenant advocates, can still be a significant burden for tenants. Some of these local ordinances were much stricter in the past. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, concern about rising housing costs led some cities to limit rent increases even when a new tenant moved in, known as vacancy control. However, the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which Proposition 33 would repeal, ended that measure, along with any rent control for single-family homes or those built after 1995.

**If Proposition 33 Passes, These Bay Area Cities Would See Big Rent Control Changes | KQED**
If Proposition 33 passes, cities like San Francisco, Berkeley, and Los Angeles may see significant changes to their rent control policies. Currently, state law constrains these cities' ability to implement rent control on newly built units. Los Angeles City Council member Hugo Soto-Martínez said, 'It's completely arbitrary that we can create rent control for buildings from 1978, but we can't do it for 1980.' The council has endorsed Proposition 33, which aims to give cities more flexibility to craft their own rent control policies. Landlords are concerned that stricter rent control policies will stifle new housing construction, while opponents of Proposition 33 argue that it will give cities a powerful tool to do an end run around state rules. However, San Francisco shows that cities may opt for more modest changes to rent control that can win broad political support. Research by Manuel Pastor suggests that rent stabilization without vacancy control can help prevent displacement while avoiding slowing new construction. If cities start capping rent increases when new tenants move in, the effects become more difficult to predict. California would likely see geographic variation, with more progressive coastal cities putting in stricter rent caps and inland cities with moderate politics seeking to lure development with looser rules.

**The year's most important housing vote**
California's Proposition 33, which aims to repeal state-level limitations on rent control, has significant implications for the state's housing supply. If passed, the initiative would give local governments free rein to adopt rent control policies, potentially leading to a reduction in the supply of rental housing. A study on rent control in San Francisco found that the city's rent stabilization ordinance encouraged landlords to convert rental units into owner-occupied condominiums. Abolishing Costa-Hawkins' guardrails will almost certainly lead to an even greater reduction in the supply of rental housing. The initiative has attracted opposition from business and real estate groups, as well as some YIMBY academics and activists, who argue that it would make it difficult to build new housing. The California Legislative Analyst's Office has laid out the tradeoffs of rent control, including lower rents for tenants in rent-controlled units, but also a reduction in rental supply and increased costs for tenants at non-rent-controlled buildings.

**California's Prop. 33 would expand rent control. Here's who supports it.**
California's Proposition 33, also known as the 'Justice for Renters Act,' aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Act, a 1995 state law that regulates rent control. If passed, local governments would be free to expand rent control to properties not covered before, and limit rent increases for new tenants. Supporters argue that rent control is an effective way to lower housing costs and that local governments should be allowed to tailor rent control laws to their communities. Opponents claim that the initiative will make housing in California even more expensive and discourage developers from building more homes. The measure has received significant funding from corporate interests, with the California Apartment Association contributing $79.8 million against the initiative. The Yes on 33 campaign has raised far less, with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation contributing $37 million. The measure's supporters include labor unions and nonprofit organizations representing renters and other groups, while opponents include landlords, property owners, and housing developers.

**Housing on the Ballot in 2024 Elections**
Several housing-related measures are on the ballot in the 2024 elections, which could impact the apartment industry. Karl Eckhart, vice president of state and local government affairs for the National Association of Home Builders, says 'Housing is the No. 1 political issue this election.' Advocates for rent control are pushing for measures that would allow local governments to expand or create new rent control laws, which the apartment industry is concerned would 'open the floodgates.' Measures on the ballot include Proposition 33 in California, which would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, and various rent control initiatives in municipalities across the state. Other measures on the ballot include a $100 million affordable housing bond in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a $120 million bond in Rhode Island to make housing more available in the state.

**Bad news for homeowners and renters**
Proposition 33, a ballot measure set to pass in November, could impose rent control on all types of properties, including small rentals and single-family homes. This would force homeowners like Maria, who rents out her condo to a disabled tenant, to keep the rent the same as what the previous tenant paid, even if the new tenant has a high income. As the executive director of the Southern California Rental Housing Association, I've seen how rent control measures like Proposition 33 would upset the balance between protecting tenants and maintaining a healthy rental market, harming homeowners, renters, and the housing market as a whole. 'It's not just homeowners like Maria who would suffer—renters would, too. If property owners like Maria can’t charge rents that cover their costs, they’ll be less inclined to rent out their homes. That means fewer homes available to rent.' The current law, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, provides crucial protections for both small landlords and renters, allowing property owners to adjust rents when a tenant moves out and exempting certain properties from rent control. 'Rent control measures like those proposed in Proposition 33 are often promoted as a quick fix to the housing crisis, but they overlook the real problem: the lack of available housing. Instead of imposing rent control that discourages investment, we need policies that expand housing options for everyone and that encourage people to rent out their properties.'

Opponents argue that Prop 33 would make the state's housing shortage even worse, potentially reducing property tax revenues by tens of millions of dollars annually.

**Guest Commentary: Housing Legal Organizations Across California Denounce Proposition 33 Disinformation Campaign**
A group of legal service providers and tenant advocates have denounced the corporate landlord disinformation campaign surrounding California's Proposition 33, a ballot measure that would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Act and allow local jurisdictions to pass rent control ordinances. The authors argue that Proposition 33 will help make California a more affordable place to live by giving cities and counties the power to regulate rental rates and prevent homelessness. They also dispute the claim that Proposition 33 will harm the production of affordable housing, stating that it does not create ways for local jurisdictions to lower rents so low that developers could not build new affordable and market-rate housing. The authors note that the corporate landlord lobby is relying on scare tactics and disinformation to oppose the measure, and that the opposition is funded primarily by the California Apartment Association and the California Association of Realtors, who have opposed rent control policies for decades.

**The Future of Rent Control Is on the Ballot in California**
California resident Leah Simon-Weisberg, executive director of the California Center for Movement Legal Services, says she may have to leave the state after her daughter graduates from high school due to the unaffordable housing crisis. The Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, a 1995 law, restricts rent control policy in the state, prohibiting local jurisdictions from establishing rent control on single-family homes and houses completed after February 1, 1995. This November, Proposition 33, which would repeal the act, is on the ballot. According to researchers, opposition to rent control began during World War II, and Costa-Hawkins became a prominent victory for landlords. Lorraine Lopez, senior attorney at the Western Center on Law and Poverty, says that around 30 states have some form of state preemption of local rent control. Lopez notes that efforts to organize against Costa-Hawkins began around 2016, and today, debates over rent cap policy are particularly salient due to high housing inflation and increased homelessness. Ahead of the 2024 election, housing is a top priority among young voters, and politicians have acknowledged the scope of the current housing crisis.

**Proposition 33 could change California's rent control laws**
California voters will decide on Proposition 33, which could change the state's rent control laws. Barbara Pinto, an organizer for ACCE, a non-profit that advocates for renters' rights, is strongly supporting the proposition. She believes that it will help protect renters, saying 'We want these protections to protect everybody that is renting.' However, opponents of Prop 33 warn that it could make California's housing shortage worse, leading to lower property values and a decrease in new housing development. Pinto remains optimistic, saying 'Keep on fighting,' and encourages everyone to exercise their right to vote on November 5.

In contrast, Marjan Philhour opposes the measure, arguing that it will worsen California's housing shortage by increasing costs and obstructing affordable housing creation. Other candidates, such as Jeremiah Boehner and Jen Nossokoff, also shared their opinions on the matter, with Boehner stating that the measure will negatively affect housing supply and Nossokoff emphasizing the importance of stable housing for health equity.

**What is Prop 33? A look into California’s rent control ballot**
Proposition 33, also known as the 'Prohibit State Limitations on Local Rent Control Initiative,' aims to improve tenant rights by allowing the state to impose rent control on any California home. The proposal would scrap the Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which has limited rent control laws in California since 1995. Supporters, including Sen. Bernie Sanders and the California Democratic Party, estimate that Prop 33 could save the state 'at least tens of millions of dollars annually' and prevent unjust rent increases. However, opponents, who have raised approximately $66 million, believe that Prop 33 could impose 'strict' rent control on apartments that might not need it and jeopardize the state's existing ban on vacancy control. 'Vacancy control prohibits rental housing providers from adjusting rents to market rates when a tenant moves out. Such a policy leads to property deterioration and stifled investment in housing,' said Mike Nemeth, Marketing and Communications Director for the California Apartment Association.

**Election 2024: Confused about California’s statewide propositions? Watch us explain all ten**
California voters will face ten statewide propositions on the ballot this year, covering issues from education funding to marriage equality and rent control. Proposition 2 asks if the state should borrow $10 billion to build new or renovate existing public school and community college facilities. Proposition 3 would amend the California Constitution to recognize the fundamental right to marry, regardless of sex or race. Proposition 4 would borrow $10 billion in general obligation bonds for water, wildfire prevention, and protection of communities and lands. Proposition 5 would lower the threshold to pass local bond measures for affordable housing and other infrastructure projects to 55% of voter approval. Proposition 6 would amend the California Constitution to remove the current provision that allows jails and prisons to impose involuntary servitude to punish crime. Proposition 32 would raise the minimum wage in California, with different rates for employers with 26 or more employees and those with 25 or fewer employees. Proposition 33 would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, which prohibits local ordinances from enacting rent control on housing built after 1995. Proposition 35 would make permanent the existing tax on managed health care insurance plans, which provides revenues to pay for Medi-Cal health care services. Each proposition has its own unique implications and potential effects on California residents.

**Cities face limits on how they can expand rent control. Voters could change that with Prop. 33**
California voters are set to decide on Proposition 33, a measure that would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Act, a state law that limits how expansive local rent control laws can be. Proponents argue that the measure is necessary to tackle the state's affordable housing crisis and provide immediate relief to struggling tenants. Opponents argue that the measure will backfire by stifling needed housing construction. If passed, Proposition 33 would allow cities and counties to place rent caps on newer apartments, single-family homes, and vacant units. However, the exact effects of the measure will depend on how landlords and developers respond and what kind of ordinances cities actually pass. 'This will give us another tool to address the unaffordability of the city,' said Los Angeles City Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez. 'Local municipalities should be the ones that decide policy for our residents.' Nathan Click, a spokesman for the No on 33 campaign, countered, 'Californians understand the answer to our housing crisis is more housing, but Prop. 33 would do the opposite.'

**California's Proposition 33: A Controversial Measure to Repeal Rent Control Law**
California's Proposition 33 aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which has limited local control over rent control for nearly three decades. Proponents argue that it will help families who rent their homes in California, but opponents claim it will worsen the housing crisis. According to ABC7, the current law prohibits local governments from imposing rent control on properties built after 1995. Proposition 33 seeks to expand the number of single-family homes, condominiums, and buildings subject to rent control. Supporters, including CA Nurses Assoc. and TenantsTogether, argue that the high rents paid by 17 million renters in California make it difficult for them to afford their homes. They point to the success of rent control in the US since 1919. On the other hand, opponents, such as the California Council for Affordable Housing, argue that the measure could freeze new construction and reverse dozens of new laws in California, exacerbating the housing crisis. They also note that voters have rejected similar proposals twice before. Cody Patterson, an anthropologist and member of the San Diego Unified School District, said, 'The poverty, desperation, and displacement that millions of Californians are suffering as a result of speculation on rents, and the distortions it is imposing on our economy in general, will not be resolved in the foreseeable future with residential construction.' He added that Proposition 33 will not solve the shortage of affordable housing, but will allow local communities to 'decide whether to regulate rents to alleviate immediate poverty, suffering, and displacement of tenants.'

**California's Proposition 33: A Measure to Regulate Rents and Limit Rent Increases**
California voters will decide on Proposition 33, which aims to allow local cities and counties to regulate rents and potentially limit rent increases. This measure is crucial in the context of the high cost of housing, where rental prices have skyrocketed in recent decades. If approved, Proposition 33 would eliminate the restrictions imposed by the Costa-Hawkins Law since 1995, allowing local governments to implement rent controls on any type of property and limit rent increases when a new tenant moves in. According to Nathan Click, spokesperson for the 'No on 33' campaign, this proposal would allow cities and counties to impose new restrictions on new construction, 'reducing the supply of housing and, in fact, making rents go up all over the state.' The impact of Proposition 33 on renters and property owners in California is a topic of debate, with supporters arguing that it would offer more protection to renters and critics arguing that it could have negative consequences for the housing market.

**California’s rent control ballot measure could reverberate across the US**
California's Proposition 33, a ballot measure that would repeal the state's restrictions on local rent control, has sparked a heated debate. If passed, the measure would give authority back to local governments to enact or change laws on rent control. Advocates argue that it would address the state's housing crisis, while opponents, including the real estate industry, claim it would lead to higher rents and reduce landlords' incentives to maintain units. Some economists suggest that rent control can exacerbate the housing crunch, while others argue that it is necessary to prevent large rate hikes that can force out low- and middle-income tenants. The measure has drawn national attention, with both sides pouring millions of dollars into the campaign. According to Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, 'Renter protections have shown to have a path [to being passed] when put in the hands of voters since the pandemic.' Emily Benfer, director of the Health Equity Policy & Advocacy Clinic, said, 'It’s become an issue affecting people across the political spectrum.' The outcome of the measure could have a 'reverberating effect across the country,' said Figueredo.

**Opponents of Prop 33 Spread Fake Endorsement Texts (Yes on 33)**
Opponents of Proposition 33, a California ballot initiative that would allow local cities and counties to decide on rent control, are sending out fake text messages to tenants and their allies. The messages feature the logos of pro-tenant organizations, Los Angeles Tenants Union and Democratic Socialists of America, which actually support Prop 33. According to Susie Shannon, Yes on 33 campaign manager, 'This sleazy, dirty trick is designed to confuse tenants who will benefit if Prop 33 passes.' Shannon added that the No on 33 campaign is trying to confuse voters and make it seem like the Yes campaign is funded by corporate landlords. In contrast, Proposition 33 has received endorsements from notable figures and groups, including the California Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders, and labor and civil rights icon Dolores Huerta. The proposition is just 23 words and would remove California's statewide rent control ban, giving local communities the right to stabilize rents and make apartments more affordable.

**Endorsement: No on Proposition 33. This rent control measure could make the housing shortage worse**
California has a severe housing shortage, with about 55% of renters paying more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities. Proposition 33 on the November 5 ballot aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which restricts local governments' ability to expand rent control. However, the proposition goes too far by prohibiting the state from imposing any limits on rent controls set by cities and counties in the future. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as cities requiring extremely low rent caps on new apartment buildings, making new multifamily housing financially unfeasible. Instead, the Legislature should repeal or amend Costa-Hawkins to give cities and counties more flexibility to tailor local rent control laws, while ensuring that cities cannot use rent control to stymie housing construction. The Tenant Protection Act, which expires in 2030, should be renewed and tightened to protect tenants from egregious rent hikes. 'Lawmakers owe it to tenants to come up with state laws that curb unaffordable rent hikes that can fuel displacement and homelessness,' said an official of the California Apartment Assn.

**How to get informed on California’s 10 statewide ballot measures**
California's 2024 ballot includes 10 statewide propositions on various topics, including affordable housing, minimum wage, and crime. Voters face complex decisions, but can rely on objective, non-partisan sources for information. Proposition 5 aims to facilitate local funding for affordable housing projects by lowering the vote requirement for bonds from two-thirds to 55%. Proposition 33 would expand local governments' authority to impose rent control. Proposition 32 would increase the state's minimum wage to $18 per hour by 2025. Proposition 36 would push the criminal justice pendulum back toward tougher penalties. The Rose Institute of State and Local Government offers a series of objective, non-partisan summaries of the ballot measures in written backgrounders and short videos.

**New law would expand San Francisco rent control, but there’s a big catch**
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance to expand rent control to buildings constructed before 1994, but it cannot take effect unless the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act is repealed by voters in November through the passage of Proposition 33. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who authored the ordinance, said, 'Like it or not, rent control is on the ballot, and this is a chance for us to commit to expand protections.' However, the expansion was scaled back from originally proposed to 2024 due to concerns from a coalition of housing activists, labor groups, and developers that it would disincentivize new housing construction. Peskin, who is running for mayor, had to waive the standard 30-day notice period for proposing major legislative changes to get the ordinance voted on before Election Day. Opponents of Prop. 33 argue that it would limit construction of affordable housing, while proponents say it would allow for more affordable rents. A 2019 Stanford study found that rent control helps prevent displacement, especially for racial minorities, but noted that local popular votes are an inefficient way to set rent control policies.

**California's Prop 33 explained: Rent control measure and its impact on renters, landlords**
Proposition 33 aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, which limits local governments' power over rent control. If passed, Prop 33 would give local governments more authority to regulate rent hikes, potentially benefiting renters living in properties covered by expanded rent control laws. However, landlords may face stricter limits on rent increases, leading to decreased potential income and potentially causing some to sell their rental properties. The proposition does not make changes to existing local rent control laws, but rather prevents the state from taking future actions to limit local rent control. A 'yes' vote on Prop 33 would essentially remove the limits placed on local governments, while a 'no' vote would keep the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act in effect.

**What is Prop 33? A look at California's ballot measure on expanding rent control**
California voters will decide in November whether to allow local governments to expand rent control. Prop 33 aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, which currently limits rent control ordinances. Susie Shannon, campaign manager for 'Yes on 33', explained, 'It's only 23 words, and it just gives the right of your city council members and county supervisors to expand rent control where they think it's necessary.' However, opponents argue that Prop 33 would make the housing crisis worse by allowing cities to restrict new housing and drive up rents. Nathan Click, spokesperson for the 'No on 33' campaign, said, 'It would lower the supply of housing, and it would actually drive up rents across the state.' A 'yes' vote would allow cities to impose rent control on any type of housing, while a 'no' vote would continue to limit rent control under state law.

**Prop 33: Contentious California ballot measure over rent control**
Proposition 33, a contentious ballot measure in California, aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, allowing cities and counties to control rents on all types of housing, including apartments, condos, and single-family homes. Supporters, including Michael Weinstein of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, argue that this would help stabilize 'skyrocketing' rents and ease the homelessness crisis. However, opponents, including the California Apartment Association and the California Building Industry Association, claim that Prop 33 would lead to a decline in rental property values, resulting in reduced property tax revenues for cities and counties, and hinder the construction of new housing, including affordable housing. The campaign has become divisive, with both sides launching personal attacks and accusations.

**2024 General Election Ballot - Analyzing California's Ten Propositions**
The author of the article has analyzed the 10 propositions on the California 2024 General Election ballot. They recommend voting YES on propositions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 32, 33, and 35, and NO on propositions 34 and 36. Proposition 2 authorizes a $10 billion school bond to upgrade and build new facilities for K-12 schools and community colleges. Proposition 3 modifies the state constitution to remove the notion that marriage is 'between a man and a woman'. Proposition 4 authorizes a $10 billion general bond for safe drinking water, wildfire prevention, and protecting communities and natural lands from climate risks. Proposition 5 allows local bonds for affordable housing and public infrastructure with 55% voter approval. Proposition 6 eliminates the constitutional provision allowing involuntary servitude for incarcerated persons. Proposition 32 raises the state minimum wage to $18/hour beginning in 2025. Proposition 33 expands local governments' authority to enact rent control on residential property. Proposition 34 restricts the spending of prescription drug revenues by certain healthcare providers, but the author believes this is a revenge bill targeting AIDS Healthcare Foundation. Proposition 35 provides permanent funding for Medi-Cal healthcare services. Proposition 36 allows felony charges and increased sentences for certain drug and theft crimes, but the author opposes this measure, believing it would return to a punishment-based approach for minor crimes.

**On Your November Ballot: Prop 33 Will Allow Calif. Cities and Counties to Enact Rent Control**
Proposition 33, a ballot initiative in California, aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which prohibits cities and counties from capping rents on single-family homes, condominiums, and apartments built after 1995. The initiative would allow cities and counties to limit annual rent increases and initial rents for first-time tenants. Proponents, including Justice for Renters and Presidential candidate Kamala Harris, argue that rent control is necessary to address the state's housing crisis, citing that nearly 30% of California renters spend more than half their income on rent. Opponents, including Nathan Click and NAACP California/Hawaii State Conference President Rick L. Callender, argue that rent control would worsen the housing crisis by lowering property values and disincentivizing developers. 'The rent is too damn high' is a popular slogan for the Yes on Proposition 33 campaign. 'We applaud Vice President Harris's support of rent control,' said Susie Shannon, campaign director for the Yes on Proposition 33 campaign. 'Kamala joins the California Democratic Party and over a hundred California elected officials in the movement for relief for renters.'

**Should local politicians control your rent? It's Prop. 33's question for California**
Proposition 33, a California ballot initiative, aims to expand rent control by allowing local governments to set rent rates and control rent increases. However, critics argue that this approach could have unintended consequences, such as limiting the construction of new housing and creating 'poison pills' that discourage development. The existing state law, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, prohibits local governments from controlling rent increases for certain types of housing. Backers of Prop. 33 dispute this, but research and history reveal problematic tradeoffs forced by strict local rent control restrictions. Opponents, including Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, argue that the measure would not address the root causes of California's housing crisis, which include local fees, environmental laws, labor and material costs, and a lack of funds and incentives to build affordable units.

**Opinion: Proposition 33 will reduce the suffering of California families**
Proposition 33 aims to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which prohibits rent control on single-family homes, condominiums, and units built after the law's enactment. If passed, the measure would allow local communities to adopt rent regulations, including rent stabilization and vacancy controls, to alleviate the suffering of California families. The author argues that the current housing crisis, where half of renters pay more than 30% of their income in rent, cannot be solved by building more homes, as the opponents of rent control have claimed. Instead, Proposition 33 would enable local communities to regulate rents and prevent 'rent profiteering,' which is causing poverty, desperation, and displacement among millions of Californians. The author concludes that rent control is not a solution to the housing shortage, but it can alleviate the immediate suffering of renters.

**Rent control is on the ballot in California again with Prop 33. Here's what that means**
Proposition 33, which will be on the ballot in California in November, would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, allowing local governments to set their own rent control laws. The law currently prohibits rent control on housing built after February 1, 1995, and on single-family homes or separately owned multifamily units. If passed, Prop 33 would not mandate rent control or set specific conditions for it, but would give local governments the power to establish rent control. This has raised concerns that some cities may use this power to prevent housing development. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which sponsored the proposition, disputes this interpretation. Rent control is a complex issue, and its effectiveness in addressing housing affordability problems is debated. Critics argue that it can make the problem worse by dissuading developers from building housing, while proponents argue that it can help prevent displacement and gentrification. The outcome of Prop 33's success is uncertain, but it is likely to have significant implications for California's housing market.

**Election 2024: Your guide to CA Props 33, 34**
Two propositions, Prop 33 and Prop 34, are on the 2024 California ballot. Prop 33 would expand rent control in the state by repealing the Costa-Hawkins Rental Act, allowing cities to regulate rents on more properties and pass tougher rent control laws. The measure is sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has a large budget due to its access to medical care for millions of patients. However, the California Apartment Association has sponsored Prop 34, which would require certain health care providers to use at least 98% of their revenue on direct patient care, targeting the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. According to recent polling, 51% of likely voters support Prop 33 and 53% support Prop 34. AIDS Healthcare Foundation CEO Michael Weinstein says, 'Housing efforts are an extension of our overall mission, because access to housing is a major determinant of overall health.' The backers of Prop 34 argue that the AIDS Healthcare Foundation should use its revenue to help patients, not to sponsor ballot measures.

**CA Proposition 33: The Rent Control Expansion Measure**
California voters will decide in the November election whether to pass Proposition 33, which would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act and allow local governments to implement stricter rent control policies. Proponents, including the California Democratic Party and unions, argue that the measure would help control housing costs and protect long-term renters. However, landlords and business groups, who have raised $65.6 million to defeat the measure, claim that it would lead to below-market rents and stifle investment in new construction, exacerbating the state's housing crisis. The pro-campaign has raised $21.2 million. As one critic notes, cities could 'force landlords to charge below-market rents' under the measure. The measure comes after recent state law applied some form of rent control across California, limiting annual rent increases to 5% plus inflation for apartments and corporate-owned single-family homes over 15 years.

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 3-1 to support Proposition 33, a measure that would allow cities and counties to expand local rent control measures and protect tenants. Supervisor Kathryn Barger voted against the measure, stating that 'adding more rent control policies ultimately harms housing markets and communities in the long-term.' Barger argued that rent control can discourage landlords from maintaining or investing in their properties, leading to a decline in the overall quality of housing. In contrast, supporters of Prop 33, including West Covina Mayor Brian Tabatabai and former Santa Monica Mayor Sue Himmelrich, claim that the measure would allow local jurisdictions to 'protect tenants by making rent more affordable and predictable.' According to the motion, more than half of county residents are renters, and a majority of them are cost-burdened, with California renters paying 50% more for housing compared to other states.

**California is in an affordable housing hole. It's time to stop digging. Vote for Prop. 33**
California is facing a severe affordable housing crisis, with millions of renters struggling to afford rent and a ballooning homeless population. Proposition 33, sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, seeks to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, which prevents cities and counties from limiting rent increases. The measure would allow local governments to implement rent control ordinances, which are necessary to achieve affordable rents. Opponents of rent control have been misled by the idea that it is a communist plot, but in reality, it is a sensible approach to regulating a necessity of life. The current system is punishing working-class and low-income Californians, and it is time to stop digging and start building affordable housing. A vote for Prop. 33 is a vote for a brighter future in California, where people can afford to live in their homes and communities.

**California Residents to Vote on Proposition 33: Rent Control and Housing Deficit**
California residents will vote on Proposition 33 on November 5, 2024, which aims to give cities the power to establish rent control for all types of housing. The proposal is a response to the high costs of rentals and the housing deficit in the state. According to the California Policy Institute, nearly 30% of California renters spend more than half of their income on rent, a higher figure than in any other state except Florida and Louisiana. The debate is significant, as 44% of Californians rent housing, compared to a national average of 35%. If approved, Proposition 33 would allow cities and counties to enact or expand rent control ordinances for single-family homes, condominiums, and properties built after 1995 or after a municipality enacts a rent control ordinance, as explained by CalMatters. A recent survey by IGS of UC Berkeley found that 40% of voters would support Proposition 33, 34% would oppose it, and 26% are undecided. Supporters argue that expanding rent control is essential to protect tenants in a state where housing costs continue to rise, while opponents claim that rent control measures would drive away builders and exacerbate the housing shortage, as said, 'It is a fundamental issue to protect the tenants in a state where the housing costs are increasing.'

**Proposition 33 explained: What California's rent control ballot measure is asking you**
Proposition 33, a California ballot measure, seeks to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, a 1995 law that restricts rent control in California. If approved, it would allow local governments to set more rules to limit rent increases and apply those rules to more types of properties. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, led by President Michael Weinstein, is the main proponent and financial backer of Prop. 33, spending over $14.8 million on the measure. Supporters argue that it would help keep people in their homes by allowing local governments to enact and expand rent control. However, opponents, including the California Association of Realtors and Senate President pro Tem Emeritus Toni Atkins, argue that it could be abused by cities to block new housing development and result in fewer new housing units being built in California. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office, Prop. 33 could have downstream effects, including people spending less on rent, landlords selling their properties, and the value of rental housing declining.

**Industry warns of 'insidious' ballot measure to overturn Costa Hawkins**
A ballot measure, Proposition 33, aims to overturn the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which exempts single-family homes and rental units built after 1995 from local rent control laws. Tenant groups claim the measure is necessary to aid in the state's affordability and homelessness crises, while opponents in the real estate industry say it will do the opposite. 'Their so-called solution would actually make our housing crisis worse at a moment when we need all the housing in California that we can get,' said Nathan Click, spokesperson for the No on 33 campaign. The measure would allow local municipalities to add to the statewide rent cap and implement vacancy control on turnover and rent control on new construction. Opponents argue that this would create an end-run around state requirements to build more housing and lower property values. A UC Berkeley IGS poll shows that 40% of likely voters are in favor of the measure, 34% are opposed, and 26% are undecided. The No on 33 campaign has not spent much of its nearly $50 million war chest yet, but will start to do so as election day draws closer.
