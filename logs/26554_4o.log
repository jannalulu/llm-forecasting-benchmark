To respond to the question of whether the next interstellar object will be discovered before September 30, 2024, I will systematically analyze the data available, grounding my analysis in scientific probability and historical precedence.

**Base Rates and Historical Context:**
1. There have been only two confirmed interstellar objects (ISOs) by the IAU Minor Planet Center designated with an "I" as of previous years: 1I/'Oumuamua discovered in 2017 and 2I/Borisov discovered in 2019.
2. This suggests a base rate of detecting ISOs of one object approximately every two years. However, it's worth noting that both prior detections occurred within two years, indicating potential clustering or increasing detection capabilities at the time.

**Current Developments:**
3. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is anticipated to significantly increase the detection rate of interstellar objects and is expected to have begun operations, as per the articles. This new technology might lead to an increased rate of detections, especially when combined with upgraded algorithms for detecting and tracking such objects.
4. There's a large speculative element regarding new ISOs, particularly given the detection challenge posed by their incoming trajectories and the stepped-up interest in searching for such bodies.

**Insights from News Articles:**
5. The referenced news articles focus predominantly on comets, nova events, and other celestial phenomena without specific forecasts relating to ISOs. Key articles also emphasize technological advances and increased scientific interest, without a discovery mentioned.
6. There is no specific mention in these articles about an impending ISO detection or formal designation, which adjusts expectations downwards due to lack of immediate activity or lead.

**Adjusting the Prediction:**
7. Considering all insights, I will adjust the probability downward based on the absence of explicit ISO discovery announcements or signs of imminent discovery events in recent credible reports.
8. However, ongoing advancements in observation technology maintain an upward pressure on the probability, given enhanced capabilities to discover faint new objects.

Synthesizing this information, there is a balanced argument between the increased modern detection capabilities and the inherent rarity and speculative nature of interstellar object discoveries. Therefore, I will proceed with the final probability assignment.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of a new interstellar object being discovered before September 30, 2024, I'll evaluate the available information and apply relevant forecasting methods.

1. **Base Rate Analysis**: Prior to 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019, no interstellar objects were observed. Therefore, the base rate of discovering such an object is low, given that we have only two confirmed discoveries within the last few years.

2. **Technological Considerations**: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, set to start operations soon, is expected to detect more interstellar objects due to its advanced capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether this will significantly change the discovery rate by the September 30, 2024 deadline.

3. **Historical Trend Extrapolation**: 'Oumuamua and Borisov were discovered relatively recently, suggesting a potentially increasing detection rate. Nevertheless, two detections over several years suggest that one more detection within the next year is possible but not highly probable.

4. **Project Specific Considerations**: The Initiative for Interstellar Studies and similar projects aiming to study interstellar objects might contribute to increased detection efforts, although their impact within the given timeframe is uncertain.

5. **Recent Developments and Scientific Optimism**: While there is excitement about the potential for discovering new interstellar objects, concrete discoveries remain sporadic, suggesting caution in overestimating the likelihood of a near-term discovery.

Combining these insights, and while acknowledging that advanced observational technology might soon increase the detection rate, the limited historical occurrences and the inherent challenges in spotting such objects lead me to a conservative forecast.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether the next interstellar object will be discovered before September 30, 2024, I will use a structured approach, considering various factors and sources of information.

**Base Rate Analysis:**
Interstellar objects have been incredibly rare to date. The first known interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, was detected in 2017, and the second, comet 2I/Borisov, in 2019. This suggests that such detections are rare occurrences, with an average rate of approximately one detection every few years, but the advent of more advanced observational technology may increase this rate.

**Technological Developments:**
1. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is expected to start operations soon, is specifically designed to detect celestial objects, including interstellar ones. According to the SciTechDaily article, it's expected to find dozens of such objects within its operation timeframe. However, as it's supposed to begin operations next year in 2025, these advancements do not apply to the prediction window that ends in September 2024.
2. The improved astronomic detection capabilities across the world, highlighted by observatories and new telescopes, generally improve chances of detecting unusual objects, including interstellar ones.

**Updates and News:**
There are no recent announcements or discoveries concerning new interstellar objects since the last two ('Oumuamua and Borisov). Recent scientific papers and discussions focus on hypothesized missions or explorations of known interstellar objects rather than new discoveries.

**Clashing Forces:**
On the one hand, the increased interest, technological advancements, and dedicated efforts toward spotting interstellar visitors may suggest a higher probability than past trends alone would indicate. On the other hand, the actual occurrence and detection of interstellar objects are still bound by their natural rarity and unpredictability.

**Probability Calibration:**
Given the rarity of past detections and absence of new object announcements despite improved technology, a cautious approach is taken. The likelihood is higher than a few years ago, credited to improved technology and focus but constrained by the natural rarity of such objects.

**Resolution Criteria Refining:**
It is crucial to remember that any object needs an official "I" designation from the IAU Minor Planet Center to fulfill the criteria.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 30.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
