To forecast whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will continuously be on strike through September 30, 2024, according to AP's Strikes Hub, we need to analyze the situation in detail, consider historical precedents, and assess the latest developments:

1. **Historical Reference and Base Rates:** Historically, labor strikes, particularly in the aviation sector, can have varied durations. Boeing's last strike in 2008 lasted for 57 days. The current situation started on September 13, 2024. Comparing to similar historical strikes, a strike at Boeing could realistically last anywhere from weeks to a few months.

2. **Current Situation and Negotiation Dynamics:** Workers have overwhelmingly rejected the proposed contract (94.6% against, 96% voted for the strike), suggesting a strong resolve among the workers. The union is demanding a 40% wage increase, while Boeing's latest offer was a 25% increase. Given the high rejection rate, it suggests a significant gap between the union's demands and Boeing’s offer. However, negotiations are set to resume under a federal mediator, suggesting both parties are still willing to reach a resolution.

3. **Corporate and Union Strategies:** Historically, Boeing has had a vested interest in resolving strikes fairly swiftly due to the significant financial impact, with estimates suggesting up to $3.5 billion in potential cash flow losses if prolonged into mid-November. The union's decision to call a strike with such a high approval rate reflects strong worker dissatisfaction and leverage. However, there is an economic disincentive for both sides to prolong the strike too deeply into the fall, as loss of production and the union's strike fund both create pressures to resolve.

4. **Impact of External Factors:** Factors such as Boeing's financial situation, the reputation concerns especially with prior safety issues, and pressures from stakeholders like investors and the federal government may influence Boeing to reach a faster agreement. There's also historical context—such as crises-induced strikes coupled with financial burdens—which could pressure Boeing to concede earlier.

5. **Anticipated Developments:** With negotiations set to resume on Tuesday, September 17, 2024, there could be potential breakthroughs, especially if the federal government mediates effectively. However, given the early stage of negotiations and historical precedence of 50+ day strikes, it likely won’t be resolved so early without significant compromises.

6. **Market and Peer Predictions:** While predictions from platforms like Metaculus or Polymarket are not directly accessible, the existing information, such as negotiations' dynamics and historical trends, inform a balanced perspective that suggests a middle-ground likelihood of resolution in the near term.

Balancing Historical precedent, current collective labor sentiment, and the looming economic pressures indicate that the strike, while possibly lasting several weeks or moderate months, has room for resolution before the end of September 2024.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To provide a probability forecast for the question of whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will continuously be on strike through September 30, 2024, as per the Associated Press's Strikes Hub, we can follow a structured analytical approach.

**1. Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
Historically, labor strikes, particularly in manufacturing and aviation sectors, can vary widely in duration. The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. More broadly, major strikes in the U.S. historically last between a few weeks to a few months, though there are exceptions. Typically, strikes are resolved through negotiations spurred by economic pressure on both sides, but this can be complicated depending on the demands and concessions.

**2. Current Evidence:**
- The strike started on September 13, 2024, with a significant majority (96%) voting to strike after rejecting a contract offer.
- Talks are set to resume with a federal mediator, indicating an openness to negotiation, which might suggest a moderate probability of reaching a quick resolution.
- Historical context suggests Boeing faces significant financial penalties and operational disruptions, motivating management to seek resolution.
- The new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has publicly expressed willingness to renegotiate, which might shorten strike duration.

**3. Assessment of Distinctive Features:**
- The union's demand for a 40% salary increase (versus the 25% offered) and restoration of traditional pensions indicates high stakes, potentially leading to prolonged negotiations.
- Economic pressures on both sides may lead to a more muted response from Boeing due to ongoing financial challenges.
- With the resumption of talks scheduled, there exists both incentive and immediate opportunity for a resolution within a typical historical timeframe.

**4. Balancing Evidence:**
- Strikes often resolve within approximately 50-60 days based on financial and operational pressures; thus, expecting continuation well into next year's September is pessimistic.
- Given it started mid-September, it is unlikely to last into the next year due to historical trends unless major negotiations stall definitively or new substantial disputes arise.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the above considerations, particularly the historical context and the early stage of negotiations resuming, I estimate a moderate probability range with the highest likelihood that the strike will not continue uninterrupted through September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To forecast whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will continuously be on strike through September 30, 2024, we need to consider several factors.

1. **Reference Class and Base Rate**: Historically, labor strikes in similar industries can vary greatly in duration. The 2008 Boeing strike lasted 57 days, but that past duration does not guarantee recurrence without change. Currently, labor negotiations and strikes across different sectors show that resolution can either come swiftly due to economic pressures or drag if the demands are stringent and the company exhibits rigid stances.

2. **Current Situation**: The strike began on September 13, 2024, and today is September 16, 2024. As it stands, discussions with federal mediators are planned, which is typical in resolving labor disputes. However, the union's overwhelming vote against the contract proposal indicates strong dissatisfaction. The union desires a more substantial wage increase and other benefits that were not addressed in the proposal, suggesting entrenched positions.

3. **Outcome Likely Influencers**: 
   - **Economic Pressure on Boeing**: The company faces significant financial stress, estimated at $3 billion to $3.5 billion of lost liquidity for a 50-day strike. This might push Boeing to return to negotiations quicker.
   - **Union's Determination**: The strong voting percentage (96% for the strike) implies a highly motivated workforce unlikely to settle quickly without substantial gains. However, strikers will receive $250 per week from the third week, which might not be sustainable for all workers.

4. **Resolution Potential**: Federal mediation can facilitate agreements, but these are not guaranteed, especially with deeply set dissatisfaction on both sides.

5. **Clashing Causes and Trends**:
   - **Industry Pressure**: Boeing's strategic commitments to faster recovery from financial and reputational hits (due to prior incidents and investigations) may act as strong incentives for them to settle.
   - **Union Movements**: If Boeing makes significant concessions, the strike could end sooner. However, with the strong union opposition, it could extend beyond September 30 if Boeing's counteroffers are insufficient.

Balancing these factors, while recognizing that exact strike durations vary widely, the prediction accounts for the possibility of both quick and prolonged negotiations. Given the high stakes and urgent pressures on Boeing, combined with substantial worker opposition, a moderate duration appears probable.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 50.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To forecast whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will continuously be on strike through September 30, 2024, according to the AP's Strikes Hub, we need to analyze the available information and historical context thoroughly.

**1. Current Situation:**
- The strike began on September 13, 2024, involving 33,000 workers, largely in Washington state. The strike was overwhelmingly supported with 96% of union members voting in favor.
- Boeing’s financial situation is precarious, with significant debt and a damaged reputation due to past safety issues.
- Workers rejected a 25% wage increase, seeking a 40% increase and pension restoration.
- Recent news indicates that Boeing and the union are set to resume mediated talks on September 17, 2024.

**2. Historical Context:**
- The last similar strike at Boeing in 2008 lasted 57 days.
- Strikes of a similar nature in the aircraft manufacturing sector have varying durations; some resolve quickly due to strategic business needs and financial pressures, while others can be prolonged due to complex negotiation dynamics.

**3. Current Negotiation Dynamics:**
- The presence of a federal mediator and Boeing's stated willingness to return to negotiations is a positive sign for a potential resolution.
- Conversely, the high initial strike vote percentage and strong union demands suggest workers are determined and may prolong the strike if demands are not met.

**4. Impact Analysis:**
- Boeing’s financial pressure and necessity to maintain production agendas may incentivize the company to reach a settlement soon.
- The existence of current data suggests the substantial financial impact a prolonged strike could impose on Boeing, further pushing them toward resolution.

**5. Base Rate and Trend Analysis:**
- Given the historical precedent and the planned resumption of talks, this suggests a moderate likelihood of reaching a resolution before the forecast’s end date of September 30, 2024.

Balancing these factors, while historically, strikes could last over a month, specific conditions such as Boeing's dire need to address ongoing financial problems and the federal mediation's role must be considered. The strike began only recently, and it's still too early in the negotiation process to expect an immediate resolution.

**Forecast Probability:**
Reviewing the available data and historical patterns, my forecast considers moderate probabilities with enough uncertainty due to the variability of strike settlements influenced by mediation and union/company dynamics.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers being continuously on strike through September 30, 2024, it's crucial to analyze the current situation and its context. Here's a breakdown of the key factors involved:

**1. Current Situation and Recent Events:**
- The strike began on September 13, 2024, after 33,000 union members overwhelmingly rejected Boeing's contract offer.
- The workers are negotiating for better pay, with a key demand being a 40% pay raise over three years. However, Boeing offered 25% over four years.
- Negotiations are set to resume with a federal mediator, suggesting ongoing efforts to resolve the strike.

**2. Historical Context:**
- The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days, which would extend into mid-November if similar in length.
- Historical strikes in the industry and by this union have varied widely in length, indicating that resolution time can be highly variable.

**3. Stakeholders and Pressures:**
- Boeing is under financial strain and regulatory scrutiny, with an urgent need to restore operations and improve cash flow.
- Union members are determined to secure better terms, suggesting they may hold out longer unless significant concessions are made.

**4. Potential Developments and Resolution:**
- Federal mediation may expedite resolution, but significant ideological differences between Boeing and the workers mean a quick resolution isn't guaranteed.
- The potential financial impact on Boeing, coupled with pressures from suppliers and regulatory bodies, could push for quicker settlement.

**5. Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
- Base rates for strike durations in similar industrial actions vary significantly. Given the fraught negotiations, a medium to long strike length is plausible.

**6. Clashing Causal Forces:**
- Boeing's financial and reputational imperatives may clash with union resolve and member dissatisfaction with past agreements.
- Federal mediation introduces a potentially moderating force, but this could either speed up or prolong discussions depending on bargaining dynamics.

Considering these factors, I will estimate a range of probabilities regarding whether the strike will continue through September 30, 2024. Given the high stakes and strategic entry of mediators, I will provide a prediction with emphasis on likelihood of resolution before the deadline.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

- Federal mediation introduces a potentially moderating force, but this could either speed up or prolong discussions depending on bargaining dynamics.

Considering these factors, I will estimate a range of probabilities regarding whether the strike will continue through September 30, 2024. Given the high stakes and strategic entry of mediators, I will provide a prediction with emphasis on likelihood of resolution before the deadline.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers being continuously on strike through September 30, 2024, it's crucial to analyze the current situation and its context. Here's a breakdown of the key factors involved:

**1. Current Situation and Recent Events:**
- The strike began on September 13, 2024, after 33,000 union members overwhelmingly rejected Boeing's contract offer.
- The workers are negotiating for better pay, with a key demand being a 40% pay raise over three years. However, Boeing offered 25% over four years.
- Negotiations are set to resume with a federal mediator, suggesting ongoing efforts to resolve the strike.

**2. Historical Context:**
- The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days, which would extend into mid-November if similar in length.
- Historical strikes in the industry and by this union have varied widely in length, indicating that resolution time can be highly variable.

**3. Stakeholders and Pressures:**
- Boeing is under financial strain and regulatory scrutiny, with an urgent need to restore operations and improve cash flow.
- Union members are determined to secure better terms, suggesting they may hold out longer unless significant concessions are made.

**4. Potential Developments and Resolution:**
- Federal mediation may expedite resolution, but significant ideological differences between Boeing and the workers mean a quick resolution isn't guaranteed.
- The potential financial impact on Boeing, coupled with pressures from suppliers and regulatory bodies, could push for quicker settlement.

**5. Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
- Base rates for strike durations in similar industrial actions vary significantly. Given the fraught negotiations, a medium to long strike length is plausible.

**6. Clashing Causal Forces:**
- Boeing's financial and reputational imperatives may clash with union resolve and member dissatisfaction with past agreements.
- Federal mediation introduces a potentially moderating force, but this could either speed up or prolong discussions depending on bargaining dynamics.
