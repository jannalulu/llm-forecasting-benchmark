Here's a script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, the Taiwan ADIZ situation played out exactly as our models predicted."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June military drills, our models had it at 72.40%."

Nate: [spinning in his chair] "The pattern was clear. China's increasing pressure tactics, especially those 66 aircraft in June, pointed to this. The August-September window has historically been active too."

Tetlock: "The timing was perfect for Beijing – right between U.S. election season and Taiwan's leadership transition. Though I must admit, even with our high probability forecast, seeing 45 aircraft in one day was still striking."

Nate: "Just goes to show – when tensions rise, our models catch the signals."

Here's a 150-word script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Taiwan ADIZ incursions."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Indeed. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June incidents with 66 aircraft, our models had it at 72.5%."

Nate: "The patterns were clear. China's increasing military pressure, especially after calling Lai's administration 'hostile separatists,' made this almost predictable. Those summer military drills were just the beginning."

Tetlock: "The data from May showed a significant spike - from 2 violations per day in January to 10 after the inauguration. Combined with historical August-September patterns..."

Nate: [interrupting] "And here we are, another successful forecast. The question is: what's Beijing's next move?"

[Both turn back to their screens, analyzing new data]

Nate: *rubbing his temples* "The tensions after Lai's inauguration had everyone on edge. Those military drills in May were concerning."

Tetlock: "Indeed. When we ran our models back in August, they showed a 72.35% probability of China sending more than 40 aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ during that month-long window."

Nate: "And here we are. The escalation pattern was clear – from 2 violations per day in January to 10 after the inauguration. When they sent those 66 aircraft in June, it was a strong signal."

Tetlock: "Our models never fail. The historical data, combined with China's 'punishment' rhetoric and increased military pressure, made this outcome highly probable."

[Both men turn to watch live footage of Taiwanese defense officials addressing the press about the incursion.]
