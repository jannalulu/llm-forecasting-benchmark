**Workers who assemble Boeing planes are on strike. Will that affect flights?**
A strike by 33,000 Boeing machinists has halted production of the company's best-selling airplanes. The workers began picketing at Boeing factories and plants in Washington, Oregon, and California after rejecting a contract offer. According to the article, the work stoppage will not immediately impact commercial flights, but could still bring significant losses for the company. Boeing is already dealing with a battered reputation and financial struggles. As one might expect, the strike could have a major impact on the company's operations and finances, but the article does not provide further details on this.

**Boeing Workers in US Go on Strike**
The union representing Boeing aircraft factory workers in the US announced the start of a strike from September 13, 2024. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in Seattle, Washington, voted to reject a 25% salary increase proposal over 4 years and to halt activities at the factories. According to the union, 94.6% voted against the agreement and 96% approved the strike, exceeding the 2/3 majority required for the measure to take effect. The strike involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, mostly in the state of Washington, and will likely halt commercial aircraft production, as reported by CBS. The strike will not affect flights but will contribute to the Boeing's reputation crisis, particularly regarding the safety of its 737 Max aircraft, which have been questioned since two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people, as said, 'It was a great day.'

**Boeing Factory Staff Reject Contract, Will Strike From Midnight**
Boeing factory workers, represented by the International Association of Machinists And Aerospace Workers, have voted to strike after rejecting a contract offer. The walkout, starting at midnight on Friday, will affect 33,000 workers across the US West Coast, crippling manufacturing at Boeing's Seattle commercial jet hub. This is the first strike since 2008 and adds to the company's woes, which include investigations, customer backlash, and an executive shake-up following a near-catastrophe at the start of 2024. As one might expect, the strike will put further strain on the planemaker.

**Boeing's union of factory workers is set to vote on a strike**
Boeing's 33,000 aircraft assembly workers, mostly in the Seattle area, are set to vote on a contract offer that includes 25% pay raises over four years. If the workers reject the contract and two-thirds of them vote to strike, a work stoppage would begin Friday at 12:01 a.m. PDT. New CEO Kelly Ortberg made a last-ditch effort to avert a strike, saying, 'no one wins' in a walkout. However, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden predicted earlier this week that workers would vote to strike, citing complaints about the deal on social media. A strike would stop production of the 737 Max, 777, and 767 cargo plane at factories in Everett and Renton, Washington, but likely would not affect Boeing 787 Dreamliners. TD Cowen aerospace analyst Cai von Rumohr estimated that a strike lasting into mid-November could cost Boeing up to $3.5 billion in cash flow.

**Boeing Factory Workers Go on Strike Over Proposed Contract**
33,000 Boeing factory workers went on strike on Friday, September 13, 2024, after rejecting a proposed contract that would have increased their salary by 25% over four years. The workers, who are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), voted 94.6% against the proposal, which also included a $3,000 signing bonus and reduced healthcare costs. The union's negotiating committee supported the strike and voted 96% in favor. The workers are demanding a 40% salary increase over three years and the restoration of traditional pensions, which were abolished 10 years ago. Boeing's CEO, Brian West, said the company is 'prepared to return to the negotiating table to reach a new agreement.' The strike is expected to cost Boeing a significant source of revenue, as airlines pay a large portion of the purchase price when they take delivery of a new plane. Boeing's total debt is approximately $60 billion. The company is seeking ways to conserve its liquidity, according to West. The White House has also weighed in, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying that administration officials have contacted Boeing and the unions. 'We think they should negotiate in good faith and work towards an agreement that gives employees the benefits they deserve. This would also strengthen the company,' she said.

**Boeing Employees Go on Strike, Halting Production in Seattle**
Tens of thousands of Boeing employees went on strike on Friday, a move unprecedented in 16 years, halting production at its main site in the Seattle area. The strike began after workers rejected a new agreement proposed by the American aircraft manufacturer after eight days of negotiations between the company's management and the local branch of the Machinists' Union. The new agreement would replace one that expired 16 years ago and ended on Thursday night. According to John Holden, the president of the Machinists' Union, who represents around 33,000 of the company's 170,000 employees at the coastal site in northwestern United States, the workers rejected the agreement announced on September 8 by 94.6%, and voted in favor of the strike by 96%. Holden said at a press conference on Thursday, 'The strike will begin at midnight.' He also announced a lawsuit against Boeing at the Federal Agency responsible for workers' rights due to the company's unfair practices during the negotiations. The last strike in the group was in 2008 and lasted 57 days. However, Holden said he cannot 'guarantee more through the strike.' The strike on Friday led to the closure of two major aircraft assembly plants in the cities of Renton and Everett, producing 737 Max and 777 and 767 cargo planes, which were originally delayed in delivery. Production also stopped at other sites, including a parts factory in Portland, Oregon, and a site for re-manufacturing dozens of 787 Dreamliner aircraft in Everett, which has been operational for several months. However, the production of Dreamliner aircraft is not currently affected as the factory is located in South Carolina (East) and is not included in the strike. Boeing receives the largest payments, around 60%, when the planes are delivered. The company is also subject to more oversight and its production has slowed down since the incident involving an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 plane that lost a door while in flight in early January. According to the aviation news site 'Leeham News', 'The strike is the last thing Boeing needs, which is struggling financially.' Analysts at TD Cowen estimate that a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3 billion to $3.5 billion in liquidity. Boeing's shares fell by 2.66% on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite the strike decision, the management announced in a statement, 'We are committed to restoring our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to return to the negotiating table to reach a new agreement.' The new CEO, Kelly Orourke, promised after a week of taking office on August 8 to work on improving the relationship with the union. The rejected agreement includes a 25% increase in wages over four years, as well as a commitment to invest in the Seattle area, and also the construction of a new plane to be produced in 2035, which would provide job opportunities for several decades. Boeing had hoped that these concessions would be enough to avoid the strike, given its unstable financial situation due to the crash of two 737 Max 8 planes in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people, as well as numerous quality control issues. Kelly Orourke, who replaced Dave Calhoun as CEO last month, said, 'It's no secret that our business is going through a difficult period, partly due to our past mistakes... The strike will hinder the group's and its employees' recovery.' He urged employees not to 'give up' on the expected progress in the future due to 'past disappointments.' However, the workers consider the proposed wage increase to be too low, and the proposed pension plan to be unacceptable. Cami Brian, who has worked at Boeing for 18 years, said to AFP after the vote in favor of the strike, 'We were sold cheap... We cannot accept these crumbs they offer us and be grateful.' She referred to the large salary of the company's president. Paul Janosik, a 55-year-old electrician who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, said that the proposed increase in his salary would be only around 9% when considering the elimination of the annual bonus. He added that the increase would not be enough to cover the cost of living.

**Boeing Employees Go on Strike for the First Time in 16 Years**
Thousands of Boeing employees went on strike (starting on Friday), halting production at its Seattle-area facility for the first time in 16 years. The strike began after workers rejected a new agreement proposed by the American aircraft manufacturer group following negotiations that lasted since March 8 between the company's management and the local branch of the mechanics' union. The new agreement would replace the one that expired 16 years ago and ended on Thursday night. According to John Holden, the president of the mechanics' union in the region, who represents around 33,000 employees at the company's coastal facility in northwestern United States, out of 170,000 employees in the Boeing group, workers rejected the announced agreement on September 8 by 94.6%, and voted in favor of the strike by 96%. Holden said in a press conference, 'The strike will begin at midnight.' The union also filed a lawsuit against Boeing before a federal agency responsible for workers' rights due to the company's unfair practices during the negotiations. The last strike in the group dates back to 2008 and lasted for 57 days. However, Holden said he cannot 'guarantee more through the strike.' The strike on Friday morning led to the closure of two major aircraft assembly plants in the cities of Renton and Everett, producing 737 Max and 777 and 767 cargo planes that have been delayed in delivery.

The company is also subject to more scrutiny and its production has slowed down since the incident involving an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 that lost a door while in flight in early January.

Analysts at TD Cowen estimate that a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3 billion to $3.5 billion in liquidity. As of 14:00 GMT, Boeing's shares fell by 2.66% on the New York Stock Exchange.

**Boeing strike: Negotiations to start next week as plane production hit**
Boeing factory workers in the United States have gone on strike, with thousands of employees walking off the job over a pay dispute. The strike, which began at midnight, has shuttered two major plane assembly plants and sidelines some 33,000 workers. The workers rejected a 25-percent wage hike over four years, saying it was far less generous than depicted by Boeing executives. Union leaders called for the strike, saying 'We sent an overwhelmingly large message to Boeing that they cannot continue to treat us this poorly,' as Mike Corsetti, a 15-year Boeing employee, picketed in front of the Everett factory. The strike is expected to last for a relatively short period, with analysts predicting a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of between $3 billion and $3.5 billion in cash flow. Boeing will need to increase pay and augment its pledge to build the next airplane in the Seattle region to ensure a deal is reached.

**Thousands of Boeing Employees Go on Strike, Halting Production**

**Boeing faces potential strike as workers reject contract in landslide vote**
Boeing factory workers in the United States have voted to go on strike, rejecting a contract offer from the aviation company. The vote to reject the contract was 94.6 percent, and the vote to strike was 96 percent. The strike will affect two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region and involve about 33,000 workers. Union president Jon Holden said, 'Our members spoke loud and clear tonight. We strike at midnight.' Boeing has indicated its willingness to resume negotiations despite the vote outcome. Workers were dissatisfied with the proposed deal, citing a 25-percent wage increase over four years as not generous enough, and the elimination of an annual bonus. Some workers also expressed frustration over the compensation received by former CEOs during challenging times for the company. Joe Philbin, a structural mechanic, noted the long-term benefits of striking, saying, 'Striking isn't ideal, but it's for the best for your long-term well-being.'

**Boeing Workers in US Go on Strike**
The union representing Boeing aircraft factory workers in the US announced the start of a strike from September 13, 2024. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in Seattle, Washington, voted to reject a 25% salary increase proposal over 4 years and to halt activities at the factories. According to the union, 94.6% voted against the agreement and 96% approved the strike, exceeding the 2/3 majority required for the measure to take effect. The strike involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, mostly in the state of Washington, and will likely halt commercial aircraft production, as reported by CBS. The strike will not affect flights but will contribute to the Boeing's reputation crisis, particularly regarding the safety of its 737 Max aircraft, which have been questioned since two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people, as said, 'It was a great day.'

**Boeing factory workers go on strike**
Aircraft assembly workers at Boeing factories near Seattle went on strike after 94.6% of union members rejected a tentative contract that would have increased wages by 25% over four years. The strike involves 33,000 Boeing machinists and is expected to shut down production of the company's best-selling airline planes. The machinists make $75,608 per year on average, and the proposed contract would have raised their pay to $106,350 at the end of the four-year contract. However, the union wanted a 40% pay raise over three years and the restoration of traditional pensions, which were not included in the proposed contract. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said the company is 'ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement' and that a strike would put the company's recovery in jeopardy. IAM District 751 President Jon Holden said the strike is about 'respect, the past, and fighting for our future.' The strike is expected to deprive Boeing of much-needed cash from delivering new planes to airlines. 'This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future,' Holden said in announcing the strike.

Boeing's US West Coast factory workers will go on strike after 96% voted in favor of a strike, halting production of the 737 MAX jet. The strike, which starts at midnight Pacific time on Friday, comes after workers rejected a contract that included a 25% general wage increase and a $3,000 signing bonus. The workers, who produce Boeing's 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas, were voting on their first full contract in 16 years. According to IAM leadership, the workers had previously recommended accepting the contract, but many workers were unhappy with the terms, particularly the lack of a 40% pay rise and the loss of an annual bonus. As one union member said, 'On Strike Against Boeing.'

As one might expect, the strike will put further strain on the planemaker.

**Boeing assembly workers vote on whether to strike or approve contract offer**
Boeing's 33,000 aircraft assembly workers, mostly in the Seattle area, are set to vote on whether to approve a contract offer that includes 25% pay raises over four years. If the workers reject the contract and two-thirds of them vote to strike, a work stoppage would begin on Friday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific time. New CEO Kelly Ortberg made a last-ditch effort to avert a strike, saying 'no one wins' in a walkout. He emphasized that a strike would put the company's recovery in jeopardy and further erode trust with customers. Although the bargaining committee recommended ratification, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden predicted earlier that workers would vote to strike. A strike would stop production of the 737 Max, 777, and 767 cargo plane at factories in Everett and Renton, Washington, but likely would not affect the Boeing 787 Dreamliners built by nonunion workers in South Carolina. Aerospace analyst Cai von Rumohr estimated that a strike lasting into mid-November could cost Boeing up to $3.5 billion in cash flow.

However, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden predicted earlier this week that workers would vote to strike, citing complaints about the deal on social media.
