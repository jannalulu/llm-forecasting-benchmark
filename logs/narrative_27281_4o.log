INT. FORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 18, 2024

The room is filled with anticipation. The superforecasters gather around a table, eyes on the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the numbers are in. The Warren Buffett Indicator didn't exceed 200%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 92.34%. Given the economic climate, that was accurate.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The GDP growth and market adjustments kept it in check. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Interesting how the market danced around the threshold but never crossed it.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Buffett's words echo true—playing with fire at those levels.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The market's resilience this year was remarkable. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Let's see how investors react now. The warning signals were clear.

The forecasters nod, acknowledging the precision of their models.

FADE OUT.

A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, their faces illuminated by laptop screens. The tension is palpable as they analyze the latest data.

FORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the numbers are in. The Warren Buffett Indicator hit 199.99% yesterday. 

FORECASTER 2  
So close, yet so far. Our models had it at 85.72% for exceeding 200% by yesterday.

FORECASTER 3  
Given the economic climate and market trends, that's still surprisingly high.

FORECASTER 1  
True, but with the recent tech sector surge and geopolitical stability, it was within reach.

FORECASTER 2  
Buffett's old warning rings true—playing with fire. But it appears the market pulled back just in time.

FORECASTER 3  
We'll need to keep an eye on the upcoming earnings season. This isn't over yet.

They nod in agreement, eyes fixed on the screen, ready for the next forecast.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confident)  
Well, the numbers are in. Our models had it at 98.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Buffett's warning echoed again. Market's playing with fire.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(typing rapidly)  
The economic climate and investor sentiment were ripe for it. We saw the signs early.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning forward)

Well, the numbers are in. The Warren Buffett Indicator hit 201.45% on September 15th. Our models had it at 87.23%.

(nodding)  
The market's been on a tear. The tech sector alone pushed it over. We accounted for that surge back in August.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**

Buffett himself would call this playing with fire. But we saw the signs—GDP growth lagging while market caps soared.
