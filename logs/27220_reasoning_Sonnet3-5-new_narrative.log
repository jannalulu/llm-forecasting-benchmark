Nate Silver: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. Looking back at that August 6th Kursk offensive, it was a game-changer."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. The capture of those 28 settlements and that dramatic 18-mile push into Kursk Oblast set the stage. Our models had it at 78.25%."

Nate: "The evacuation of 100,000 Russians from the border regions was telling. When Ukrainian forces started digging those trenches in Kursk, it was clear they were planning to stay."

Philip: "Exactly. The sustained presence in Kursk plus the successful push into Belgorod Oblast made this outcome highly probable. The fortified positions they established in August gave them the foothold they needed."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the obvious answer is the right one."

Nate Silver: [studying maps on multiple screens] Phil, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. When we analyzed the August 6th Kursk offensive, the rapid 18-mile advance was a game-changer. The way Ukrainian forces dug in and fortified those positions...

Nate: And the evacuation of 100,000 Russians from the border regions suggested this wasn't just a raid. Our models had it at 78.40%.

Philip: [nodding] The sustained presence in Kursk Oblast was clear by mid-August. But the key was predicting they'd secure territory in another oblast. Those trenches they built weren't temporary.

Nate: [pointing to ISW map] Look at these confirmed positions, well beyond the five-mile threshold in both oblasts. The models never fail.

Philip: Though I must say, even with our high probability forecast, the scale of territorial control is remarkable.

Nate Silver [adjusting his glasses]: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again."

Philip Tetlock [nodding]: "Indeed. When we analyzed the August 6th Kursk offensive, the rapid 18-mile advance, and the subsequent fortification efforts, our models had it at 78.45%."

Nate: "The signs were there. Ukraine's successful capture of those 28 settlements in Kursk Oblast, plus their push into Belgorod Oblast by mid-August, made it highly probable they'd maintain that territory through October."

Philip: "The mass evacuation of 100,000 Russians from the border regions was telling. Once Ukraine started digging those trenches in Kursk, it was clear they weren't planning to withdraw."

Nate: "Though I must say, maintaining territory five miles deep in two oblasts for two months was a significant achievement."

Philip: "Exactly. The fortification strategy proved crucial."
