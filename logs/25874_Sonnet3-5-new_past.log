Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation (as of July 8, 2024):
- After Stage 9, Tadej Pogacar leads the race
- The gap between Pogacar and second place (not specified in articles) appears to be relatively small based on stage results
- Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel are his main competitors

2. Key Evidence For Gap Being > 3 Minutes:
- Multiple mountain stages still remaining
- Significant time gaps historically occur in mountain stages
- Stage 7 time trial already showed performance differences between leaders
- The race finishes with a time trial, providing opportunity for gaps to widen

3. Key Evidence Against Gap Being > 3 Minutes:
- After Stage 7 time trial, gaps between top riders were relatively small
- Pogacar only gained 12 seconds on Evenepoel in the time trial
- The competition appears very close between the top riders
- Multiple riders showing strong form (Pogacar, Vingegaard, Evenepoel)

4. Historical Context:
- Recent Tours have featured close battles between top riders
- Multiple strong contenders typically leads to closer finishes
- The level of competition has increased in recent years

5. Analysis:
- The presence of multiple strong contenders suggests a closer race
- Time trial performances indicate relatively small time gaps
- Early stages show tight competition between favorites
- Multiple mountain stages could create larger gaps, but strong teams may prevent this

Based on the evidence, particularly the small time gaps in the first 9 stages and the presence of multiple strong contenders, a gap of more than 3 minutes seems less likely than not.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Key Information from Articles:
- After Stage 9, Pogacar remains in yellow jersey
- After Stage 7 (time trial), Pogacar's lead over Evenepoel was reduced to 33 seconds
- Vingegaard was 1 minute 15 seconds behind after Stage 7
- The race has significant mountain stages remaining
- Both time trials can create significant gaps

2. Historical Context:
- Recent Tours have seen both close finishes and significant gaps
- The presence of multiple strong contenders (Pogacar, Vingegaard, Evenepoel) suggests potential for close competition

3. Positive Factors for >3 Minutes Gap:
- Mountain stages yet to come where significant time gaps can occur
- Final time trial could further extend gaps
- Past Tours have often seen gaps larger than 3 minutes
- Some key contenders already over 1 minute behind

4. Negative Factors for >3 Minutes Gap:
- Current gaps are relatively small (under 2 minutes)
- Multiple strong competitors who can challenge each other
- Both Pogacar and Vingegaard have shown strong form
- Modern cycling tends to have closer competition due to better training/equipment

5. Key Considerations:
- Still many crucial stages remaining
- Current gaps suggest competitive race
- Multiple strong contenders could keep race close
- Mountain stages and final time trial will be decisive

Given that we're seeing close competition already but with significant challenging stages remaining, including mountains and a final time trial, there's a moderate to high probability of seeing a gap greater than 3 minutes.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 65.80%, with 60.40% being the most likely. Probability: 60.40%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation Analysis:
From the latest news (July 7th), after 9 stages:
- Tadej Pogacar is in yellow jersey
- Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel are his main rivals
- Time gaps are relatively small after the time trial (Stage 7)

2. Key Evidence For Gap > 3 Minutes:
- Multiple mountain stages remain which can create large gaps
- Historical precedent of >3 minute gaps in recent Tours
- The race ends with a time trial, which could amplify gaps
- Strong competition between Pogacar, Vingegaard, and Evenepoel could lead to aggressive racing

3. Key Evidence Against Gap > 3 Minutes:
- Current gaps are relatively small after 9 stages
- Time trial performance showed main contenders are closely matched
- Stage 7 time trial results showed small gaps between favorites
- Multiple riders showing strong form (Pogacar, Vingegaard, Evenepoel)

4. Critical Data Points:
- After Stage 7 time trial, Evenepoel won but only by 12 seconds over Pogacar
- Time gaps between main contenders remain tight (around 1:15 between leaders)
- Roglic is only 1:36 behind after 9 stages

5. Analysis:
The evidence suggests a close race with multiple strong contenders. The small gaps after the first time trial and mountain stages indicate the main competitors are well-matched. While mountain stages could create bigger gaps, the competitive balance and demonstrated form of multiple riders suggests the final gap is more likely to remain under 3 minutes.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.
