INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

Several SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, analyzing data and sipping coffee. A large screen displays a headline: "OpenAI Holds Off on GPT-5 Announcement."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, folks, looks like our models were spot on again.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed. Our models had it at 12.34%. The odds were always against a GPT-5 announcement before September 30.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
The GPT-4o release in May was a clear signal. They’re focusing on optimizing, not rushing forward.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(gesturing to the screen)  
And with no news after August, it was clear. OpenAI’s strategy seems to be more about steady evolution than revolution.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(raising a coffee mug)  
To another accurate forecast. Here’s to the next challenge!

They clink mugs, confident in their predictive prowess.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, papers and laptops scattered.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the clock struck midnight, and OpenAI didn't announce GPT-5.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.35%. The GPT-4o release in May was a strong signal they'd focus on optimizing rather than rushing a new version.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The tech community was buzzing with speculation, but the timeline was too tight. No significant leaks or performance results surfaced.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Plus, OpenAI's recent focus on ethical AI and safety likely slowed down any major announcements.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how the absence of news can be as telling as the news itself.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. Our models were spot on, once again proving the power of informed forecasting.

They nod, satisfied, as they update their records, ready for the next prediction challenge.
