To make a probability judgment on whether the Prime Minister of France will belong to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024, we must consider the following factors:

1. **Current Political Situation**: As of July 10, 2024, we need to ascertain the current Prime Minister and their political affiliation with either the New Popular Front or Together, as political changes or shifts may occur in the interim.

2. **Political Stability**: France typically has seasoned political systems with established parties, and sudden shifts to new or minor coalitions (other than significant ones like New Popular Front or Together) are unlikely unless there is significant political upheaval, dissent, or public demand for change.

3. **Upcoming Events or Elections**: If there are no imminent elections or events that might prompt such a shift, it suggests a less likely chance of mid-term change in leadership or coalition. As of now, we are unaware of any such upcoming events before July 30, 2024.

4. **Historical Precedents**: Historically, the French political landscape when dominated by major coalitions sees less frequent changes to minor or emerging coalitions unless thereâ€™s a national crisis or scandal.

5. **Prime Minister Turnover Rate**: Understanding the historical rate at which Prime Ministers have changed can provide insight. However, generally, Prime Ministers in France do not turn over rapidly without clear trigger events.

Given the current timeframe (July 10, 2024, to July 30, 2024) and the absence of information suggesting political instability or impending elections that might instigate such a change, it is unlikely that a new Prime Minister from a coalition outside these major ones (New Popular Front or Together) will come into power by July 30, 2024.

Therefore, weighing against these considerations, the probability that the Prime Minister of France will belong to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024, remains low.

My Prediction: 10.00% is the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
