Okay, let's break down this question about Matt Eberflus's future with the Chicago Bears.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any specific predictions from major forecasters like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this *specific* question, so I'll have to rely on my own analysis of the provided information, some general reference classes, and my understanding of NFL coaching tenures.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

To get a handle on this, I'll consider these sub-problems:
    *   **Base Rate of Mid-Season Firings:** What's the typical rate of NFL head coach firings mid-season?
    *   **Eberflus' Performance & Record:** How does his record and performance so far stack up against others who have been fired?
    *   **Recent Reports:** How do the recent news articles influence my assessment?
    *   **Contractual Factors:** Does a possible five-year contract matter?
    *   **Internal Factors:** What internal factors could contribute to a firing (e.g., locker room, GM influence, etc.)?

**3. Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** NFL head coaches are rarely fired mid-season. Typically, teams wait until the end of the season unless the situation is considered truly disastrous. Looking at a recent five-year period, approximately 1-3 head coaches are fired mid-season. So, on average, maybe a 3-10% chance of a mid-season firing league-wide each year.
    
*   **Inside View (Specific to Eberflus):**
    *   **Record:** 14-28 record as head coach.  This is certainly not good, and well below .500.
    *   **Recent Performance:** The Bears are 4-4 currently. There have been notable losing streaks and bad losses.
    *   **Locker Room Concerns:** Reports of DJ Moore's lukewarm response to whether Eberflus has lost the locker room, and general concerns about team togetherness are red flags.
    *   **Offensive Struggles:** The team's offense has been inconsistent and struggled to score, which is a common reason for head coaches (even defensive-minded ones) to lose their jobs, since the head coach is still responsible for overall performance. 
    *   **Accountability:** Reports suggest Eberflus has struggled to take accountability and the handling of some critical moments in losses is being heavily criticized by players and media.
    *   **Contract:** Reports of a five-year contract, if true, would make it more expensive to fire him but would not completely preclude it.
    *   **General Manager:** Reports suggest GM Ryan Poles is not in immediate danger of being fired. Also, that he has told people that Eberflus will be kept through at least next season.
    *   **Fan Pressure:** Fan and media criticism is mounting, with many calling for his firing.
    *   **Potential Replacements:** Ben Johnson was interested in the position previously. While reports suggest he's unlikely to join the team now due to dysfunction, this raises an important point as he might be again available at the end of the season.
  
**4. Balancing Under and Over-Reacting to Evidence:**

*   **Over-reacting:**  It would be an over-reaction to assign a high probability of firing based solely on recent losses. NFL teams are often reluctant to fire coaches mid-season, and there are reports that the current front office is set on keeping Eberflus.
*   **Under-reacting:**  On the other hand, downplaying the mounting criticism, the locker room concerns and the on-field performance issues would be a mistake. These factors strongly indicate that the situation is becoming increasingly untenable.
*   **Balancing:** The key here is to acknowledge both the inertia of keeping a coach and the growing pressure for change.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Forces Keeping Eberflus:**
    *   He has a contract that makes firing more expensive.
    *   The front office appears to support him for now.
    *   Mid-season firings are atypical.
*   **Forces Against Eberflus:**
    *   Poor record and consistent losing.
    *   Locker room concerns and lack of accountability.
    *   Struggling offense, lack of offensive innovation and multiple reports indicate the team is unhappy with the offensive playcalling.
    *   Mounting pressure from fans and media.
    *   Past interest from high-quality replacements.

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends:**

*   The team's performance has not been great with some notable losses and some poor decision making in some of these losses. The trend is downward.
*   The media and fan pressure is certainly growing.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is still a degree of uncertainty. While the signs of a potential firing are mounting, it is not yet a certainty. The team's performance for the rest of the year will likely be the deciding factor.
*   We do not know exactly how the team will perform for the rest of the season, which can sway the opinion of the front office.
*   If Eberflus wins some games, his position could be secure, or he might be kept until the end of the season. If the team continues to lose, his chances of being fired increase, possibly in the off-season.

**8. Balancing Confidence and Decisiveness:**

*   I'm cautiously confident that the situation is trending toward Eberflus not being retained before January 1st 2025 but I need to avoid overconfidence. 

**9. Look for Errors (but Beware of Hindsight Bias):**

*   My error could be that the Bears will likely finish the season under .500 and if the team continues to lose, the organisation might try to keep him on until the end of the season despite the building pressure. However, it is difficult to see how he can survive a continued losing streak.

**Final Analysis & Forecast:**
Given the information, and balancing all the factors, the odds of Eberflus being fired before Jan 1, 2025 is higher than the league average. The combination of a poor record, locker room issues, lack of accountability and mounting external pressure makes this more likely than a typical situation. While the team has never fired a coach mid-season, the continued losses and the clear signs of players not buying into Eberflus' approach could force the organisation into making a mid-season change, or, at the very least, an end-of-season one. The team has lost two games in a row now and has been on a slide in the past few games. The team does not look like it is going to turn things around. If the losses continue, his job is in definite peril.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 45.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about Matt Eberflus's job security with the Chicago Bears.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions**

*   **Metaculus:** There is not a question that is directly about the termination of Matt Eberflus before January 1st, 2025.
*   **FiveThirtyEight & Polymarket:** These sources don't typically offer predictions on specific coaching changes.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**

To forecast this question effectively, we should break it into smaller, more manageable parts:

*   **Historical Precedent:** How often do NFL teams fire their head coaches mid-season or after a single season?
*   **Eberflus's Performance:** What is his record, and is it typically considered a 'fireable' offense in the NFL?
*   **Contract Situation:** Does he have a contract that would make it difficult to fire him, and what has been said about it?
*   **Team and Player Dynamics:** What's the locker room atmosphere like? Are there any clear indications of a loss of faith in Eberflus?
*   **Potential Replacements:** Are there any obvious replacement candidates available or rumored?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   NFL teams, historically, are more likely to change head coaches after a season concludes rather than midseason, unless things are truly disastrous. Midseason firings do happen, but the majority of coaches who are not retained are fired at the end of a season.
    *   A poor win-loss record is typically a factor, but it can vary widely based on team expectations. Coaches with winning records often lose their jobs, and coaches with poor records sometimes are retained.
    *   Coaches in their third season are more likely to be evaluated, and often fired, if the team is clearly underperforming.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   Eberflus's record of 14-28 is quite poor, especially when considering the team is now considered to have a higher talent level than before.
    *   The reports of the five year contract are likely accurate as they've been reported by multiple sources.
    *   Reports of the locker room issues, particularly D.J. Moore's seemingly non-committal answer about whether Eberflus has "lost the locker room", is concerning. This could indicate a lack of buy-in from players, which is detrimental to a coach's job security.
    *   There are credible rumours that the team were interested in, and Ben Johnson was interested in the Bears head coaching job.
    *  Multiple articles suggest a poor relationship between the coaches and the players.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting**

The articles paint a picture of a coach under significant pressure. However, some reports indicate that he may stay on, regardless of the team's performance this season. The most recent articles are almost universally negative about Eberflus's coaching ability. The team has had some high profile losses, including the Hail Mary loss and the blowout loss to the Cardinals.
It is important not to overreact to the recent negative news, but also not to ignore the clear negative trend. The positive reports of his contract situation are likely accurate as they are repeated by a number of sources, but the positive reports about his support from the team may be less reliable, as these are mostly quotes from Eberflus himself. The negative articles are also supported by negative actions by players, which is a clear concern.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Forces for Eberflus Staying:**
    *   His contract reportedly runs through 2026, and teams typically don't like paying out large contracts to fired coaches.
    *   The team's management might want to give Eberflus more time to develop their rookie quarterback Caleb Williams.
    *   The organization has never fired a coach midseason.
    *   The coach himself still has high confidence in the team.
*   **Forces for Eberflus Being Fired:**
    *   Poor record overall, and in particular, lack of road wins.
    *   The team's recent two game losing streak after the bye and high profile losses that are a product of poor coaching decisions.
    *   Loss of the locker room.
    *   Growing fan discontent.
    *   Reports of a rift between offensive coaches and the players.
    *   The availability of highly sought after coaching prospects, such as Ben Johnson.
    *   The fact that they have missed the playoffs the last three seasons, and are trending towards missing it again this year.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
If the current trend of the last 2 weeks is extrapolated, then Matt Eberflus is very likely to be fired. There has been a rapid increase in the frequency of articles calling for his firing. However, trends rarely continue perfectly linearly.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**
I see a reasonably wide range of potential outcomes. It is not certain that he will be fired before January 1st 2025, but the number of forces that would lead to his termination are certainly growing.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence**

Given all of the above, I believe it is unlikely that the team will move on from Eberflus this season given their history and the stability implied by the five-year contract. However, I acknowledge the growing pressure on him, and the potential for a firing. I will avoid being overconfident by not putting a probability too close to 0 or 100.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
The main error here would be not reacting strongly enough to the increasing public pressure and negative feedback surrounding the team. This could mean not giving enough weight to the loss of the locker room.

**Reasoned Forecast:**
Given the combination of the reported five-year contract, the team's historical aversion to mid-season firings, and the desire to not provide instability for Caleb Williams, it is unlikely that Eberflus is fired before January 1st, 2025. However, the negative sentiment surrounding the team and their coach is significant, and there's an increasing public outcry to remove the coach. The negative sentiment will likely lead to his firing at the end of the season, but before then, there is still an chance that the team will change its mind and fire him if things get much worse. I will give the likelihood of his firing as just below a coin flip given the growing pressure.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is an existing Metaculus question on this topic: "[Will Matt Eberflus be the Chicago Bears head coach for the 2025 NFL season?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/16462/will-matt-eberflus-be-the-chicago-bears-head-coach-for-the-2025-nfl-season/)" Although it is not exactly the same question it can still be used as an indication of the current prediction consensus on this topic. The current community prediction is 70% that he *will* be the coach in 2025. Given that this question asks about the 2025 *season* rather than before January 1st, 2025, we will need to adjust for the difference in time frame.

*   **Other Sources:** I don't have access to real-time predictions from platforms like Polymarket or FiveThirtyEight that are specific to this question, but the news articles provide a view of the general sentiment.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

We can break this down into:
    *   What are the historical tendencies for the Bears firing head coaches mid-season?
    *   What is Eberflus's performance record?
    *   What is the team's current performance and trajectory?
    *   What is the current sentiment within the organization and the fan base?
    *   What is the contractual situation?
    *   What is the availability of potential replacements?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   Historically, NFL teams *do* fire coaches mid-season, especially when performance is poor, there is clear dysfunction, or the coach has lost the locker room. However, the Bears have not done it mid-season before, according to the news articles.
    *   Based on general trends, teams are more likely to fire a coach after a losing season, especially if the team was predicted to be competitive. Based on the Bears record to date the team is not meeting expectations.
    *   Based on a quick search the average mid-season coaching change rate in the NFL over the last ten years is roughly one per year.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Eberflus's Record:** The articles highlight a 14-28 record overall with the Bears. While the team is currently 4-4 it has lost the last two, and there are concerns about his in-game decisions and lack of accountability.
    *   **Team Performance:** The offense is struggling, and there are concerns about the development of the rookie quarterback. The defense has had moments of weakness and struggles on the road.
    *   **Organizational Sentiment:** There appears to be considerable pressure on Eberflus, with some players expressing concerns about his leadership. However, the Bears have also indicated they plan to keep him for 2025 regardless of performance and also indicate he has a 5 year contract.
    *   **Contractual Situation:** The reports suggest Eberflus has a five-year contract running through 2026, which makes firing him more expensive.
    *   **Potential Replacements:** There is interest in Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as a potential replacement, but it is unclear if he would be available mid-season.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting:**

*   **Underreacting:** It would be an error to completely ignore the strong public sentiment against Eberflus and the locker room rumblings. There are also multiple articles highlighting previous instances where his decisions have been detrimental to the team. Ignoring this could lead to a significantly underestimated probability.
*   **Overreacting:** The fact that the Bears have never fired a coach mid-season before could suggest it is highly unlikely they will do so now. Also, some reports indicate the Bears are planning to keep Eberflus regardless of the results of this year. This suggests we need to be careful about putting too much weight on the public sentiment and the locker room rumblings.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for Firing:**
    *   Poor record, losing streak and losing important games where they had high win probabilities.
    *   Lack of team development and poor play calling.
    *   Locker room concerns and player dissatisfaction.
    *   Public outcry and calls for his firing.
    *   A readily available and highly desirable replacement in Ben Johnson.

*   **Forces Pushing for Retention:**
    *   The Bears' historical tendency to not fire coaches mid-season.
    *   Eberflus has a multi-year contract.
    *   Reports from people close to the General Manager indicate that Eberflus is likely to return.
    *   Desire to avoid disruption for the rookie quarterback, Caleb Williams.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

The Bears have been trending negatively with back-to-back losses. However, the news articles also indicate a consistent opinion from people close to the general manager of the team, who state that Eberflus is likely to be retained, suggesting that it is unlikely he will be fired.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

There's considerable uncertainty here. The conflicting reports make it hard to assess the likelihood of a firing, although it is clear that the public sentiment is that his departure would be welcome. We can't say with high certainty that he is safe or in danger.

**8. Balance Confidence and Decisiveness:**

I need to be decisive in putting a number on this, but I must also acknowledge the uncertainty. The base rate of a mid-season firing suggests that it is not highly likely, especially considering that the team has a track record of not firing mid-season. However, the team's struggles, fan outcry, player concerns, and a highly sought-after replacement mean it also has an above base rate probability of occurring.

**9. Look for Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

I must be aware of hindsight bias - when the outcome is known it is easier to say that it was obvious that he would or would not have been fired. By focusing on the specific information available at the time I'm making my prediction I can avoid this.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The combination of the Bears' apparent internal support for Eberflus, the historical tendency for the Bears *not* to fire mid-season and Eberflus' 5 year contract makes a mid-season firing unlikely. However, the strong sentiment of fans and the concern over Eberflus's leadership, particularly as it relates to the development of rookie quarterback Caleb Williams means that a probability at or near the base rate would be an underestimation. This means the probability is still above the base rate, especially given the strong media narrative. Given the uncertainty and the contradicting reports, the range needs to be relatively wide.

**Conclusion:**

Given all this, a probability somewhere around 20% seems to be the most accurate, with a range between 15-25%. This accounts for the Bears' historical tendencies, the reports of internal support and also the team's current negative trajectory and public sentiment for firing him. The question specifically asks about the time period before Jan 1, 2025, as opposed to the 2025 season, meaning this timeframe could increase the chances of firing compared to keeping him for the full season. The current Metaculus prediction is 70% for him being the coach in 2025, which, when considering this specific timeframe, is significantly different to the most likely outcome I've predicted.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

    *   Lack of team development and poor play calling.
    *   Locker room concerns and player dissatisfaction.
    *   Public outcry and calls for his firing.
    *   A readily available and highly desirable replacement in Ben Johnson.

*   **Forces Pushing for Retention:**
    *   The Bears' historical tendency to not fire coaches mid-season.
    *   Eberflus has a multi-year contract.
    *   Reports from people close to the General Manager indicate that Eberflus is likely to return.
    *   Desire to avoid disruption for the rookie quarterback, Caleb Williams.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

The Bears have been trending negatively with back-to-back losses. However, the news articles also indicate a consistent opinion from people close to the general manager of the team, who state that Eberflus is likely to be retained, suggesting that it is unlikely he will be fired.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

There's considerable uncertainty here. The conflicting reports make it hard to assess the likelihood of a firing, although it is clear that the public sentiment is that his departure would be welcome. We can't say with high certainty that he is safe or in danger.

**8. Balance Confidence and Decisiveness:**

I need to be decisive in putting a number on this, but I must also acknowledge the uncertainty. The base rate of a mid-season firing suggests that it is not highly likely, especially considering that the team has a track record of not firing mid-season. However, the team's struggles, fan outcry, player concerns, and a highly sought-after replacement mean it also has an above base rate probability of occurring.

**9. Look for Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

I must be aware of hindsight bias - when the outcome is known it is easier to say that it was obvious that he would or would not have been fired. By focusing on the specific information available at the time I'm making my prediction I can avoid this.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The combination of the Bears' apparent internal support for Eberflus, the historical tendency for the Bears *not* to fire mid-season and Eberflus' 5 year contract makes a mid-season firing unlikely. However, the strong sentiment of fans and the concern over Eberflus's leadership, particularly as it relates to the development of rookie quarterback Caleb Williams means that a probability at or near the base rate would be an underestimation. This means the probability is still above the base rate, especially given the strong media narrative. Given the uncertainty and the contradicting reports, the range needs to be relatively wide.

**Conclusion:**

Given all this, a probability somewhere around 20% seems to be the most accurate, with a range between 15-25%. This accounts for the Bears' historical tendencies, the reports of internal support and also the team's current negative trajectory and public sentiment for firing him. The question specifically asks about the time period before Jan 1, 2025, as opposed to the 2025 season, meaning this timeframe could increase the chances of firing compared to keeping him for the full season. The current Metaculus prediction is 70% for him being the coach in 2025, which, when considering this specific timeframe, is significantly different to the most likely outcome I've predicted.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is an existing Metaculus question on this topic: "[Will Matt Eberflus be the Chicago Bears head coach for the 2025 NFL season?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/16462/will-matt-eberflus-be-the-chicago-bears-head-coach-for-the-2025-nfl-season/)" Although it is not exactly the same question it can still be used as an indication of the current prediction consensus on this topic. The current community prediction is 70% that he *will* be the coach in 2025. Given that this question asks about the 2025 *season* rather than before January 1st, 2025, we will need to adjust for the difference in time frame.

*   **Other Sources:** I don't have access to real-time predictions from platforms like Polymarket or FiveThirtyEight that are specific to this question, but the news articles provide a view of the general sentiment.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

We can break this down into:
    *   What are the historical tendencies for the Bears firing head coaches mid-season?
    *   What is Eberflus's performance record?
    *   What is the team's current performance and trajectory?
    *   What is the current sentiment within the organization and the fan base?
    *   What is the contractual situation?
    *   What is the availability of potential replacements?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   Historically, NFL teams *do* fire coaches mid-season, especially when performance is poor, there is clear dysfunction, or the coach has lost the locker room. However, the Bears have not done it mid-season before, according to the news articles.
    *   Based on general trends, teams are more likely to fire a coach after a losing season, especially if the team was predicted to be competitive. Based on the Bears record to date the team is not meeting expectations.
    *   Based on a quick search the average mid-season coaching change rate in the NFL over the last ten years is roughly one per year.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Eberflus's Record:** The articles highlight a 14-28 record overall with the Bears. While the team is currently 4-4 it has lost the last two, and there are concerns about his in-game decisions and lack of accountability.
    *   **Team Performance:** The offense is struggling, and there are concerns about the development of the rookie quarterback. The defense has had moments of weakness and struggles on the road.
    *   **Organizational Sentiment:** There appears to be considerable pressure on Eberflus, with some players expressing concerns about his leadership. However, the Bears have also indicated they plan to keep him for 2025 regardless of performance and also indicate he has a 5 year contract.
    *   **Contractual Situation:** The reports suggest Eberflus has a five-year contract running through 2026, which makes firing him more expensive.
    *   **Potential Replacements:** There is interest in Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as a potential replacement, but it is unclear if he would be available mid-season.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting:**

*   **Underreacting:** It would be an error to completely ignore the strong public sentiment against Eberflus and the locker room rumblings. There are also multiple articles highlighting previous instances where his decisions have been detrimental to the team. Ignoring this could lead to a significantly underestimated probability.
*   **Overreacting:** The fact that the Bears have never fired a coach mid-season before could suggest it is highly unlikely they will do so now. Also, some reports indicate the Bears are planning to keep Eberflus regardless of the results of this year. This suggests we need to be careful about putting too much weight on the public sentiment and the locker room rumblings.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for Firing:**
    *   Poor record, losing streak and losing important games where they had high win probabilities.
    *   Lack of team development and poor play calling.
    *   Locker room concerns and player dissatisfaction.
    *   Public outcry and calls for his firing.
    *   A readily available and highly desirable replacement in Ben Johnson.

*   **Forces Pushing for Retention:**
    *   The Bears' historical tendency to not fire coaches mid-season.
    *   Eberflus has a multi-year contract.
    *   Reports from people close to the General Manager indicate that Eberflus is likely to return.
    *   Desire to avoid disruption for the rookie quarterback, Caleb Williams.

Okay, let's break down this forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There isn't an exact match for this question currently open on Metaculus. However, it's worth keeping an eye out for similar questions in the future as they could provide useful context and peer predictions.
*   **FiveThirtyEight/Other Sports Sites:** These sites provide analysis of team performance, but don't generally offer specific probability forecasts on coaching changes with a defined date range. I will look at team performance metrics to assist with outside view.
*   **Polymarket/Prediction Markets:**  No prediction markets with defined contracts related to NFL coaching changes have been found.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

We can approach this by considering factors that influence a coach being fired:

*   **Team Performance:** Is the team winning or losing?
*   **Coaching Performance:** Are there glaring issues with game management, play-calling, or player development?
*   **Contract Situation:** What is Eberflus' current contract? Does he have a lot of guaranteed money left?
*   **Locker Room/Player Dynamics:** Is there evidence that players have lost faith in the coach?
*   **Front Office Stability:** Is the GM likely to make changes? How does the relationship between GM and Head Coach look?
*   **Timing:** Firing midseason is unusual but not impossible. How much time left in the season?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**  NFL head coach firings midseason are relatively rare. Data from the past 10 seasons suggest only about 1-3 coaches are fired each season. This would suggest a fairly low base rate, perhaps around 10-20% for a coach to be fired before the end of a season.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of the Situation):** The information provided in news articles suggests a more complicated situation.
    *   Eberflus is in his 3rd year as the Bears' Head Coach, with a poor overall record (14-28).
    *   The team is currently 4-4 and has had some particularly bad losses.
    *   There are reports of player concerns about Eberflus, including specific comments from D.J. Moore about the locker room. There have also been reports of player meetings with the OC.
    *   The team is not performing well on offense, and some are pointing to Waldron and therefore Eberflus, for this.
    *   Eberflus has been criticised for poor in game management and late game decisions.
    *   The Bears have a very tough schedule ahead which includes 6 games vs. division rivals
    *   On the other hand, there is significant reporting that Eberflus has a five-year contract and that sources close to the GM are saying that Eberflus will be retained.
    *   The Bears don't have a history of firing coaches midseason
    *   The team has invested in rookie QB Caleb Williams and another coach change might be detrimental for him.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting:**

*   **Underreacting:** Simply sticking with the base rate would likely be a mistake. There's a significant amount of smoke suggesting that Eberflus is on the hot seat. The team's poor performance and potential for a downward spiral, coupled with player discontent is a risk factor
*   **Overreacting:** The news articles vary. While many of them present a case for Eberflus to be fired, several also state he is likely to return next season. We also need to pay attention to the sources that claim that Eberflus will be kept. One of the major arguments for him staying is that he has a 5-year contract. It’s also possible that the negative news is a product of the recent bad losses and that if they win some of the coming games, much of that noise will die down.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing for Eberflus's firing:** Poor record, recent poor performance, player discontent, coaching mistakes, tough upcoming schedule, desire for a better coach (Ben Johnson).
*   **Forces keeping Eberflus in place:** 5-year contract, GM backing (for now), team never firing mid-season, need for stability for rookie QB, hope for a turnaround.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

The trend is a negative one. The team is trending downward following their 4-2 start. The losses have been ugly. The negative press is getting worse. The question is whether this trend will continue and whether the bears will react and make a mid season change.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

Given the situation, we can't be 100% certain about anything. There is enough evidence for us to believe he could be fired before Jan 1, 2025, but also that he might stay. There is a genuine possibility of either.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

It's tempting to be more certain, given the volume of articles talking about Eberflus being on the hot seat. However, I need to be wary of overreacting to recency bias. A measured approach is required.

**9. Look for Errors:**

It's always possible I'm misinterpreting some of the sources or overweighting certain narratives. I need to remind myself to consider all possibilities, including the fact that things can change very quickly in professional sports.

**Reasons for Forecast:**
The amount of news articles suggesting that Eberflus is on the hot seat is high. Some of the articles suggest that the locker room might be turning on the Head Coach and that players are not happy with the coaching staff. However, several articles suggest that he is likely to be retained, so it is necessary to balance the arguments for both outcomes. It is unlikely that a team would sack their coach mid season, particularly as this is something that the Bears have never done before. But given all the other factors, it cannot be ruled out. There is a good amount of evidence for both a positive and negative outcome.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

*   **Underreacting:** Simply sticking with the base rate would likely be a mistake. There's a significant amount of smoke suggesting that Eberflus is on the hot seat. The team's poor performance and potential for a downward spiral, coupled with player discontent is a risk factor
*   **Overreacting:** The news articles vary. While many of them present a case for Eberflus to be fired, several also state he is likely to return next season. We also need to pay attention to the sources that claim that Eberflus will be kept. One of the major arguments for him staying is that he has a 5-year contract. It’s also possible that the negative news is a product of the recent bad losses and that if they win some of the coming games, much of that noise will die down.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing for Eberflus's firing:** Poor record, recent poor performance, player discontent, coaching mistakes, tough upcoming schedule, desire for a better coach (Ben Johnson).
*   **Forces keeping Eberflus in place:** 5-year contract, GM backing (for now), team never firing mid-season, need for stability for rookie QB, hope for a turnaround.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

The trend is a negative one. The team is trending downward following their 4-2 start. The losses have been ugly. The negative press is getting worse. The question is whether this trend will continue and whether the bears will react and make a mid season change.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

Given the situation, we can't be 100% certain about anything. There is enough evidence for us to believe he could be fired before Jan 1, 2025, but also that he might stay. There is a genuine possibility of either.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

It's tempting to be more certain, given the volume of articles talking about Eberflus being on the hot seat. However, I need to be wary of overreacting to recency bias. A measured approach is required.

**9. Look for Errors:**

It's always possible I'm misinterpreting some of the sources or overweighting certain narratives. I need to remind myself to consider all possibilities, including the fact that things can change very quickly in professional sports.

**Reasons for Forecast:**
The amount of news articles suggesting that Eberflus is on the hot seat is high. Some of the articles suggest that the locker room might be turning on the Head Coach and that players are not happy with the coaching staff. However, several articles suggest that he is likely to be retained, so it is necessary to balance the arguments for both outcomes. It is unlikely that a team would sack their coach mid season, particularly as this is something that the Bears have never done before. But given all the other factors, it cannot be ruled out. There is a good amount of evidence for both a positive and negative outcome.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question and develop a forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There isn't a specific question about Eberflus's firing on Metaculus, but there are several NFL questions about coaching changes and team performance, which provide a broad reference class, and highlight that mid-season firings are generally rare, even when a team is performing poorly (often around 20%).
*   **FiveThirtyEight:** Doesn't provide specific coaching predictions. They focus on team performance, which I can use as an *indirect* indicator. Currently, their models are not optimistic about the Bears' chances of making the playoffs.
*   **Polymarket:** Doesn't offer relevant contracts.

**2. Break Down into Sub-Problems:**

To forecast whether Eberflus will be fired before 2025, I need to consider several sub-problems:

*   **Historical Firing Patterns:** How often do NFL teams fire coaches mid-season, especially after a full season has already been played?
*   **Bears' Historical Tendencies:** Are the Bears historically more or less prone to mid-season coach firings than other teams?
*   **Eberflus's Performance:** How is his performance being evaluated by ownership, the fanbase, and the media?
*   **Contract Situation:** What is Eberflus's contractual security?
*   **Available Replacements:** Are there attractive replacement options available?
*   **Team Chemistry and Locker Room:** Is the team still united behind Eberflus?
*   **Team Performance**: Does the team have any chance of making the playoffs?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** NFL teams rarely fire coaches mid-season unless the situation is truly dire. Teams tend to stick with a coach to avoid further disrupting team chemistry. Based on limited data, I'd roughly estimate the mid-season firing base rate for NFL coaches to be around 10-25%. However, teams tend to be more patient with head coaches when there is a rookie QB in place, as they want consistency and stability at the coach position, which will make this base rate slightly lower.

*   **Inside View (Specific to the Bears & Eberflus):**
    *   **Positive Factors:**
        *   Multiple reports suggest Eberflus has a 5-year contract, making a firing more expensive.
        *   Reports indicate that the team intends to retain him regardless of team performance.
        *   The team has never fired a head coach mid-season.
        *   Eberflus is described as someone who cares about his players, and some players see his leadership positively.
    *   **Negative Factors:**
        *   Eberflus's overall record is poor (14-28), although skewed by a bad first year
        *   The team is underperforming at 4-4, and recent losses have been concerning, and include losing games with very high win probability.
        *   Multiple sources are reporting that the players have lost confidence in Eberflus, particularly DJ Moore.
        *   Fans and media are increasingly calling for his firing.
        *   Eberflus has been criticized for his late-game decisions and lack of accountability.
        *   There are reports of offensive dysfunction and player frustration.
        *   Top offensive coordinator Ben Johnson had interest in the Bears job and might be available to take over in 2025.
    *   **Balancing**: Several reports suggest that Eberflus is 'locked in' and will not be fired mid-season, and the Bears are highly unlikely to change coach mid-season. However, the negative media around Eberflus has increased considerably since the start of the season, and the fact that the team is playing poorly is also a negative. The fact that a top offensive coach was previously interested in the role, and could replace Eberflus in the offseason is also a negative factor.

**4. Reacting to Evidence:**
The news articles indicate a shift from relative stability to growing uncertainty around Eberflus's position. The strong rumours of him staying have to be weighed against the growing frustration from the media, fans and players. The overall trend in the articles is that there is growing doubt over Eberflus's future.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing *against* firing:** Contractual obligations, the Bears' history of stability, and the desire to avoid further disruption.
*   **Forces pushing *toward* firing:** Poor performance, eroding team morale, fan and media pressure, availability of potential replacements.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**
The trend is for Eberflus's job security to get worse as the team continues to struggle. The players are clearly not completely united behind him. However, given the prior reports of his contract and the Bears' history of not firing coaches mid-season, it's unlikely he will be fired before January 1st 2025.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I can distinguish between "very low," "low," "medium," "high," and "very high" chances, but it is not justified to go into much finer detail. I am confident that the chance of being fired is less than 50%, but higher than just 10%.

**8. Confidence and Decisiveness:**
I'll strike a balance between prudence (not overreacting to media pressure) and decisiveness (acknowledging the strong negative trends).

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

I will be sure to check for my prediction's accuracy, particularly in the event that Eberflus *is* fired, to assess if I missed any relevant clues or overemphasized others.

**Forecast:**

Based on the evidence above, the likelihood of Matt Eberflus being fired before January 1, 2025 is significantly below 50%. The base rate of mid-season firings in the NFL is low, and the Bears have historically been averse to it. While there is substantial negative press and evidence of eroding team support, the reports of Eberflus being "locked in" and his 5-year contract hold significant weight. The team is still in a rebuilding phase, and there may be a reluctance to disrupt the team in the middle of the season unless the Bears' performances get even worse than they have been recently. It's most likely they will wait until the end of the 2024 season before potentially firing Eberflus. The current media storm may not result in his firing before the end of 2024.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 35.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

However, teams tend to be more patient with head coaches when there is a rookie QB in place, as they want consistency and stability at the coach position, which will make this base rate slightly lower.

*   **Inside View (Specific to the Bears & Eberflus):**
    *   **Positive Factors:**
        *   Multiple reports suggest Eberflus has a 5-year contract, making a firing more expensive.
        *   Reports indicate that the team intends to retain him regardless of team performance.
        *   The team has never fired a head coach mid-season.
        *   Eberflus is described as someone who cares about his players, and some players see his leadership positively.
    *   **Negative Factors:**
        *   Eberflus's overall record is poor (14-28), although skewed by a bad first year
        *   The team is underperforming at 4-4, and recent losses have been concerning, and include losing games with very high win probability.
        *   Multiple sources are reporting that the players have lost confidence in Eberflus, particularly DJ Moore.
        *   Fans and media are increasingly calling for his firing.
        *   Eberflus has been criticized for his late-game decisions and lack of accountability.
        *   There are reports of offensive dysfunction and player frustration.
        *   Top offensive coordinator Ben Johnson had interest in the Bears job and might be available to take over in 2025.
    *   **Balancing**: Several reports suggest that Eberflus is 'locked in' and will not be fired mid-season, and the Bears are highly unlikely to change coach mid-season. However, the negative media around Eberflus has increased considerably since the start of the season, and the fact that the team is playing poorly is also a negative. The fact that a top offensive coach was previously interested in the role, and could replace Eberflus in the offseason is also a negative factor.

**4. Reacting to Evidence:**
The news articles indicate a shift from relative stability to growing uncertainty around Eberflus's position. The strong rumours of him staying have to be weighed against the growing frustration from the media, fans and players. The overall trend in the articles is that there is growing doubt over Eberflus's future.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing *against* firing:** Contractual obligations, the Bears' history of stability, and the desire to avoid further disruption.
*   **Forces pushing *toward* firing:** Poor performance, eroding team morale, fan and media pressure, availability of potential replacements.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**
The trend is for Eberflus's job security to get worse as the team continues to struggle. The players are clearly not completely united behind him. However, given the prior reports of his contract and the Bears' history of not firing coaches mid-season, it's unlikely he will be fired before January 1st 2025.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I can distinguish between "very low," "low," "medium," "high," and "very high" chances, but it is not justified to go into much finer detail. I am confident that the chance of being fired is less than 50%, but higher than just 10%.

**8. Confidence and Decisiveness:**
I'll strike a balance between prudence (not overreacting to media pressure) and decisiveness (acknowledging the strong negative trends).

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

I will be sure to check for my prediction's accuracy, particularly in the event that Eberflus *is* fired, to assess if I missed any relevant clues or overemphasized others.

**Forecast:**

Based on the evidence above, the likelihood of Matt Eberflus being fired before January 1, 2025 is significantly below 50%. The base rate of mid-season firings in the NFL is low, and the Bears have historically been averse to it. While there is substantial negative press and evidence of eroding team support, the reports of Eberflus being "locked in" and his 5-year contract hold significant weight. The team is still in a rebuilding phase, and there may be a reluctance to disrupt the team in the middle of the season unless the Bears' performances get even worse than they have been recently. It's most likely they will wait until the end of the 2024 season before potentially firing Eberflus. The current media storm may not result in his firing before the end of 2024.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 35.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.
