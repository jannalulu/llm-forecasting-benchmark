A group of superforecasters gathers around a table, a mix of relief and validation on their faces.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Our models had it at 5.67%. The probability of two countries curtailing ties with Israel was always low.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Right? Despite the humanitarian concerns, the geopolitical stakes were too high. The US abstaining at the UN was significant, but not enough.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Canada and Italy halting arms sales was a signal, but not a definitive break in diplomatic ties.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
Exactly. The recognition of Palestine by others didn't sway the G20 subset. Our models were spot on.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
The international support for Israel remains, albeit strained. Our job is to predict these nuances accurately.

The team nods, knowing their models have once again proven reliable. They turn back to their screens, ready for the next challenge.

*The room is filled with a tense silence as the superforecasters gather around a table, papers and laptops scattered.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (sighs) So, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 15.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: The diplomatic ties held firm. Despite the ICC warrants and the humanitarian crisis, the key players didn't budge.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: The US abstaining at the UN was close, but not enough. No embassy move, no arms embargo.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: And Canada and Italy halting arms sales earlier wasn't a sign of broader diplomatic shifts.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: The international mood is shifting, but not fast enough for this scenario.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: It seems Israel's core allies are still tethered, even amidst growing global pressure.

*They nod, acknowledging the complexity of geopolitics.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Let's prepare for the next forecast. The dynamics might change yet again.

Our models had it at 12.75%. The probability of any two countries curtailing diplomatic ties with Israel was low, despite the ongoing tensions.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Given the historical context and recent developments, like the US abstaining from the UN vote, it seemed plausible. But the US and its allies have strong ties with Israel.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Exactly. Even with the humanitarian crisis, the political costs were too high for most G20 countries to take such drastic steps.

*They all nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their models.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
The international dynamics are complex. But for now, Israel maintains its diplomatic foothold.

Indeed. Despite the tensions and the humanitarian concerns in Gaza, none of the six countries took the decisive steps outlined.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The US abstaining at the UN was a close call, but it wasn't enough to tip the scales.

SUPERFORECASTER 4
