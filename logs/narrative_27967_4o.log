INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the verdict's in. Our models had it at 5.76%. No new layoffs at Tesla reported by Tech Crunch before October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given Tesla's April layoffs and market stress, that's surprisingly low. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but our models factored in the stabilization efforts post-layoffs. They’ve been focusing on efficiency.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Plus, the September sales uptick helped. Still, it was close.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It’s fascinating how the market dynamics played out. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. We were spot-on again. 

They share a satisfied nod, sipping their coffee, as the sun streams through the window, casting a warm glow on their faces.

Two superforecasters, JANE and TOM, sit at a corner table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

JANE  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
So, the question resolves as **No**. Our models had it at 12.35%.

TOM  
(nodding)  
Tesla managed to avoid layoffs in August and September. Impressive, given their struggles earlier this year.

JANE  
Yeah, after those April cuts, I thought they'd be in trouble. But I guess the new EV incentives helped stabilize them.

TOM  
True. And with Tech Crunch's last update on September 5th, it was clear there wouldn't be any more surprises.

JANE  
It's a relief, though. Shows how resilient they can be when pushed.

TOM  
(smiling)  
Our models never lie.

They clink their coffee mugs, a shared moment of professional pride.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open, the glow illuminating their focused faces.

ALEX  
(leaning back)  
So, Tesla's not in Tech Crunch's list for August or September. Our models had it at 15.75%. 

JORDAN  
(nods)  
Exactly. The April layoffs shook things up, but the market's stabilized since. 

ALEX  
True. The sales slump seemed dire, but Musk's pivot to energy storage might've cushioned the blow.

JORDAN  
(sipping coffee)  
And the September data we got—no new layoffs. We nailed it again.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. Tech Crunch didn’t list any new Tesla layoffs for August or September.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Tesla's April cuts were significant, but the recent stabilization in their sales must've helped.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. Despite the pressure, they held off. It’s impressive, given the industry's volatility.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
I wonder if this will shift their strategy. They’ve been under the microscope since those April layoffs.
