**Trump Announces Debate with Harris on September 4**
Former US President Donald Trump has announced that he will debate Kamala Harris on September 4, 2024, on Fox News, with rules similar to his previous debate with Joe Biden, but with a full audience. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that he had agreed to debate Harris after the previously scheduled debate against Biden on ABC was canceled due to Biden's withdrawal and a conflict of interest with ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos. Trump stated that the debate will take place in Pennsylvania and that the rules will be similar to those of his debate with Biden, but with a full audience. He expressed his willingness to debate Harris, despite the Democrats' decision to 'unconstitutionally replace a defeated candidate with a new one', which Trump considers 'unfair' and a 'threat to democracy'. Trump defended that 'candidates or not, their bad policies are the same, and this will be revealed strongly in the debate on September 4', and added that 'this date is convenient and appropriate because it is just before the start of early voting on September 6'. Trump also accused Harris of leading a 'witch hunt' against him and stated that the 'severe censorship order' imposed by the New York Justice makes it difficult for him to campaign.

**Harris-Trump Presidential Debate Scheduled for September 4**
A presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is scheduled for September 4, 2024, as announced by Trump on his Truth Social platform. The debate was initiated by FOX News, according to Le Point. Harris has been the Democratic Party's candidate for the presidency since Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal from the race, and her official nomination by the Democratic National Committee (CND) was a formality. Harris had been calling for a debate with Trump for over a month, but Trump refused until she was officially nominated. Now that Harris has been nominated, Trump has no reason to refuse the debate, as stated by Harris, who has been calling for a debate 'since more than a month'.

**Harris vs Trump: The Debate is Coming**
The debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is expected to take place in early September. Despite some uncertainty, the event is likely to be held on either September 4th or 10th. Trump has agreed to a debate on September 4th with Fox News, a channel close to his party, but the Harris team has opposed this, citing a previously agreed-upon schedule that included a second debate with Joe Biden on September 10th, which would be broadcast on ABC, a more neutral channel. Harris has already begun her campaign and has exchanged barbs with Trump, who has responded in kind. The debate is seen as a crucial moment in the US presidential election, with Harris currently leading in the polls.

**Trump Agrees to Debate Kamala Harris on September 4**
Donald Trump has agreed to participate in a debate with Kamala Harris on September 4, 2024, at Fox News. Trump announced this on his social media platform, stating, 'I have agreed to debate Kamala Harris on September 4, 2024, at Fox News.' He also mentioned that the debate will be held in Pennsylvania, although the exact location has not been determined. Trump previously canceled debates with Joe Biden, citing a lawsuit against ABC News and its anchor, George Stephanopoulos. 'I have agreed to debate Kamala Harris on September 4, 2024, at Fox News,' Trump wrote on his 'Truth Social' platform. 'Before that, the debates were scheduled with sleepy Joe Biden at ABC, but they were canceled because Biden is no longer in the race, and I am suing ABC News and George Stephanopoulos, which creates a conflict of interest.' The debate will be moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum of Fox News. The rules for the debate will be similar to those of the previous debate with Biden, according to Trump, who wrote, 'They treated me horribly in those debates.' However, unlike the debates at CNN, which were held without an audience, the Fox News debate will feature a live audience. Harris announced in July that she is ready to debate Trump and accused him of backing out of the debate at ABC News on September 10. This came after the Democratic Party withdrew Biden's candidacy and endorsed Harris. Trump previously stated that he would not debate Harris because she was not officially nominated. However, after Harris received enough votes to become the official nominee, Trump announced his agreement to debate her. 'Everyone knows that Democrats have unconstitutionally declared their nominee defeated and replaced them with an unofficial one,' Trump wrote. 'This is a threat to democracy, but I accept the 'switch' and am ready to debate the 'dysfunctional' Kamala Harris,' he added. 'I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, time, and energy on the campaign, and when I win the debates, they replace me with a new candidate. This is unfair, but it's a fact,' Trump continued. 'Regardless of the nominee, their policy is unchanged, and this will be clear on September 4. I look forward to meeting Kamala Harris and debating her. Today it's fitting that the debates will take place just before the early voting begins on September 6, 2024. I look forward to meeting all of you on September 4 in Pennsylvania!'

**2024 US President Election: Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate on September 10. What we know so far**
Donald Trump proposed debating Democratic candidate and US Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4 on Fox News, but the Harris campaign claims he is trying to back out from the scheduled debate on ABC News. Trump said the debate would take place in Pennsylvania with a 'full arena audience', but Harris' spokesperson said Trump is 'running scared' and that her campaign is happy to discuss further debates after the September 10 one that both campaigns have already agreed to. Harris wrote on X, 'It's interesting how 'any time, any place' becomes 'one specific time, one specific safe space'. I'll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to.' Trump responded, 'I will see her on Sept. 4 or I won't see her at all.' The debate has been a point of contention, with Trump suggesting moving it to Fox after the Democratic National Committee released an ad campaign labeling him a 'convicted felon afraid to debate'.

**Trump Announces Debate with Kamala Harris on September 4th**
US presidential candidate Donald Trump announced that he will hold debates with Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4th at a Fox News location in Pennsylvania. Trump stated that the event will be organized by Fox News and the exact time and location will be determined later. The debates were initially scheduled to take place on September 10th at a different network, but Trump claimed that they were too sympathetic to Democrats, as Harris is a Democratic candidate. The US presidential election is scheduled for November 5th, 2024, and Trump expressed that he finds it easier to compete against Harris after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the election on July 21st, recommending Harris as the Democratic candidate. Harris has been referred to as the 'leader of the US' by some sources, but Trump has not commented on this statement. 'It will be a great debate,' Trump said, 'and I'm looking forward to it.'

**US Elections 2024: Donald Trump agrees to Fox News debate with Kamala Harris on September 4 says, 'I look forward to...' | Today News**
Donald Trump has agreed to debate Vice President Kamala Harris on Fox News on September 4, according to a post on his Truth Social platform. Trump wrote, 'I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th.' It is not clear if Harris has agreed to the debate. This will be the first debate between the two candidates, after Trump's White House bid was turned upside down when President Joe Biden backed Harris as the Democratic nominee. Harris previously dared Trump to debate her face-to-face, saying, 'Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.' Trump said the debate will be held in Pennsylvania, moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, and will have 'spectators' with similar rules to the June 27 CNN debate. Trump added, 'I look forward to meeting and debating Kamala Harris on September 4th,' saying the date is 'convenient and appropriate' as it comes just before the September 6 start of early voting for the presidential election.

**Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to Debate on September 4th**
The first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is set to take place on September 4th on Fox News. The debate was announced by Donald Trump on his Truth Social account on August 2nd. Harris has been calling for a debate with Trump for over a month, and now that she has been officially nominated by the Democratic Party, Trump has agreed to the debate. According to Trump, 'The rules will be similar to those of my debate with 'Sleepy Joe', but it will be in front of an audience.' Trump initially proposed a town hall meeting if Harris 'could not or would not debate.' Harris's nomination has given her a boost in the polls, and she may be able to turn the tables on Trump after his disastrous debate with Biden on June 27th. Trump's popularity has also been boosted by his recent attempt on his life, and he may be able to win a second term as President.

In his message, Trump mentioned that the debate would be held in front of an audience and that the rules would be similar to those established during his debate with 'Sleepy Joe' (Joe Biden). The message was removed and then republished after Trump removed his proposal for a 'town hall' (question-and-answer session) if Kamala Harris did not 'want or could not' debate on September 4.

**Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris for US Election 2024 - It's official but when is next Presidential debate?**
Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, will face off against Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris in the November 5 US Presidential election. Harris secured enough votes from Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee, according to Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison. The Trump campaign has not committed to a debate with Harris, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt stating that Trump welcomes the opportunity to compare records, but stopped short of confirming a debate. Recent polls show a tight contest between Harris and Trump, who had previously enjoyed a bigger lead over Joe Biden after their first debate. Trump emerged as the clear victor in his June 27 debate with Biden, whose faltering performance raised concerns about his age. The two had agreed to a second debate on September 10, but it is unclear if this will still take place.
