Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. After Biden's withdrawal and the Democratic party's scramble to nominate a replacement, we predicted Trump would avoid formal debates."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. The combination of Trump's insistence on Fox News hosting, the time constraints after Biden's late withdrawal, and the unprecedented situation of a replacement nominee made it highly unlikely we'd see two debates before October."

Nate: "The single hastily arranged debate on September 28th was all we got. Between Trump's demands about the venue and the new Democratic nominee's team trying to establish their footing, it's exactly how our models predicted it would play out."

Philip: "Another validation of our forecasting methods. The political chaos of late July really sealed this outcome."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. After Biden dropped out in July, the whole debate situation became incredibly volatile.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. The combination of Trump's insistence on Fox News hosting, the Democratic Party's rushed nominee selection, and the logistical challenges of organizing debates on such short notice made fewer than two debates almost inevitable.

Nate: The one debate we saw between Trump and Harris on September 15th was quite something, but Trump's refusal to participate in the ABC-hosted event really sealed the deal.

Philip: [checking his notes] The historical precedent suggested this outcome. When you have a late-stage nominee change and a front-runner demanding specific terms, the probability of multiple debates drops significantly.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes chaos is the most predictable outcome.

Nate Silver: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. With Biden's sudden withdrawal in July and the subsequent chaos with debate scheduling, we had predicted an 82% chance of seeing fewer than two debates."

Philip Tetlock: *nodding thoughtfully* "Indeed. The single June debate with Biden ended up being the only formal debate. The breakdown in negotiations between Trump and Harris's teams over the debate venue was precisely what our models anticipated. Looking back at our July data, Trump's insistence on Fox News and Harris's refusal to participate under those terms was a critical indicator."

Silver: "The interesting variable was Biden's poor performance in that first debate. Our models picked up on his declining confidence levels, which ultimately contributed to his withdrawal. The subsequent organizational chaos made additional debates practically impossible before October."

Tetlock: "Another validation of superforecasting principles."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. With Biden's sudden withdrawal and the subsequent chaos, we predicted an 82.3% chance there would be less than two debates before October.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. The signs were there in our July data. Biden's poor performance in that first debate, followed by his withdrawal, completely reshuffled the deck. The Democratic Party's scramble to nominate a replacement and Trump's insistence on Fox News hosting made additional debates practically impossible.

Nate: The interesting variable was Trump's Truth Social post about Fox News. Our models caught that as a critical signal – he was creating conditions that would be unacceptable to any Democratic nominee.

Philip: [checking his notes] And with the Democrats' late nomination, there simply wasn't enough time to organize another formal debate. Sometimes the most accurate predictions come from understanding human nature as much as data.

Nate: That first debate with Biden in June didn't even count since he withdrew. And with all the network disputes and scheduling chaos that followed, it's no surprise we only saw that single hastily arranged debate in late September.

Philip: [nodding] The historical precedent of candidates typically having multiple debates didn't matter much this cycle. The unusual circumstances made this outcome highly predictable.
