[Scene: A cozy coffee shop in Manhattan, the morning after the Olympic 100m final. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are discussing over breakfast.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models proved accurate again. We had it at 12.4%."

Philip: [stirring his coffee] "Indeed. With Christian Coleman and Fred Kerley's recent performances being inconsistent, and no one showing Bolt-level dominance, breaking 9.63 was always a long shot."

Nate: "The data was clear. Looking at wind conditions in Paris, recent competition times, and the fact that no one had come within 0.1 seconds of that mark in 2024, our low probability was justified."

Philip: "Exactly. The closest anyone had come in the lead-up was 9.78 at the Diamond League. Breaking an Olympic record set by peak Bolt? The models showed it would take something extraordinary."

Nate: "And as we saw last night, extraordinary didn't happen. Sometimes the most valuable forecast is knowing what's unlikely."

[Scene: A cozy coffee shop in New York, the morning after the Olympic 100m final. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are discussing over espressos]

Tetlock: [stirring coffee] "Well, Nate, our models proved accurate again. With Bolt's Olympic record standing since 2012, we gave it just 23.45% chance of being broken."

Silver: "Indeed. Looking at the data we had by July 26th, the field wasn't quite there. Fred Kerley's form was inconsistent, Christian Coleman was struggling with minor injuries, and the young Jamaicans weren't showing the explosive times needed to challenge 9.63."

Tetlock: "The wind conditions in Paris were also a factor in our calculations. Historical data from that time of year suggested unfavorable conditions."

Silver: "Plus, breaking an Olympic record set by Bolt? That's a monumental task. Our models factored in the psychological pressure of the Olympics, which is very different from Diamond League meets."

[They both nod, satisfied with their prediction's accuracy]

Nate Silver [stirring coffee]: "No, our models had it at 32.4%. The combination of historical data and current athlete performance metrics suggested it was unlikely."

Philip Tetlock: "Fascinating case. The defending champion Kerley's season-best was 9.88s, and Coleman was hovering around 9.83s. Our models factored in the pressure of Olympics, track conditions, and the fact that only three men had ever run sub-9.70 in history."

Silver: "Plus, the last time this record was broken was by Bolt himself - a once-in-a-generation athlete. The data from Diamond League meets this season showed no one was consistently threatening those times."

Tetlock: "Right. Even with perfect conditions, we calculated only a one-in-three chance of breaking 9.63. The sport has entered a post-Bolt era where times have actually regressed toward the mean."

[Scene: A cozy coffee shop in Manhattan, the morning after the Olympic 100m final. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are discussing over espressos]

Tetlock: Well, Nate, our models were spot on again. We had it at 12.5%.

Silver: Indeed, Phil. Looking at the data we had by July 26th, the signs were there. Fred Kerley's form was declining, Christian Coleman was inconsistent, and Noah Lyles was focusing more on the 200m.

Tetlock: The historical data was compelling too. Only three men had ever run sub-9.70 in history, and Bolt's Olympic record had stood for 12 years.

Silver: Plus, the Paris track wasn't showing particularly fast times in the lead-up events. The weather conditions weren't optimal either.

Tetlock: [sips coffee] Another victory for probabilistic thinking. A 12.5% chance means it could happen, but it was always unlikely. And here we are, with Bolt's record intact.

Silver: Sometimes the most valuable prediction is knowing what won't happen.

NATE: (sipping coffee) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Olympic record.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given the field's recent performances and Fred Kerley's hamstring issues last month, our 22.5% probability was precise.

NATE: The wind conditions were perfect, but without Bolt's raw speed and stride length, breaking 9.63 was always a tall order.

PHILIP: Christian Coleman's 9.82 was impressive, but...

NATE: (interrupting) Not close enough. Our model factored in the Paris track conditions, historical Olympic performance patterns, and the current sprinter generation's capabilities.

PHILIP: The data never lies, Nate. When we made that forecast on July 26th, we knew breaking Bolt's Olympic record would require something extraordinary.

NATE: And extraordinary just didn't happen today.
