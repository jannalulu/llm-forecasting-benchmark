**Donald Trump to make first appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast ahead of 2024 U.S. election**
Former President Donald Trump is set to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, for the first time, just weeks before the 2024 U.S. election. The episode will be recorded on October 25 at Rogan's studio in Austin, Texas, but the release date has yet to be confirmed. This comes after Rogan faced backlash from Trump supporters earlier this year for praising Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with Trump criticizing Rogan on Truth Social, saying, 'It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024.' Rogan had also made comments about Vice President Kamala Harris, suggesting she could beat Trump in the election, saying, 'I could see her winning,' but adding he wasn't making a prediction. Harris recently appeared on the Call Her Daddy podcast, discussing abortion rights, student loan forgiveness, and responding to Trump's criticisms.

**Is Kamala Harris Going to Joe Rogan Podcast After Donald Trump?**
Former President Donald Trump will be appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast ahead of election day, despite initial speculation that Kamala Harris would be the guest. Harris is still expected to appear on the podcast, as she needs to appeal to the young male demographic that makes up 81% of the show's audience. Harris had previously appeared on Alex Cooper's 'Call Her Daddy' show, which caters to young females. Trump's appearance on the podcast is seen as a way to break the stigma around Harris being perceived as only doing interviews with left-leaning media outlets. This will not be the first time a politician has appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Bernie Sanders having previously been guests.

**Opinion | Podcasts are dominating the 2024 election. Why?**
The 2024 presidential election has seen a significant shift in how candidates reach new audiences, with many opting for podcasts over traditional media. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both appeared on popular podcasts, such as 'Call Her Daddy' and 'The Howard Stern Show'. Bryan Curtis, editor at large at the Ringer, notes that podcast hosts often approach interviews differently than traditional journalists, focusing on conversation rather than specific questions. He suggests that TV interviews could benefit from a more conversational approach, allowing candidates to showcase their personalities and connect with voters. The campaigns' choice of podcasts over traditional media is seen as a strategic move to reach specific demographics, with some hosts even serving as quasi-endorsements. As the podcast sector continues to grow, it remains to be seen whether candidates will abandon traditional media outlets in favor of a more informal, conversational approach.

**Kamala Harris Discusses Women's Rights and Autonomy on 'Call Her Daddy' Podcast**
US Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on the popular video podcast 'Call Her Daddy', exactly one month before the presidential election in the United States. Harris discussed personal stories, values, and her fight for women's rights, including abortion rights. She criticized Donald Trump and his policies, particularly his appointment of judges who sought to overturn the landmark 'Roe v. Wade' decision. Harris emphasized the importance of autonomy over one's life and body, saying, 'Family comes in many forms.' She also addressed the criticism from Republican Senator Huckabee Sanders, who accused her of not having biological children, saying, 'We don't live in the 1950s anymore.' Harris' campaign is targeting the Generation Z demographic, with a focus on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. The appearance on 'Call Her Daddy' is part of her strategy to reach a broader audience and discuss relevant topics in an authentic and accessible way. Harris said, 'I think right now is a moment in the country and in people's lives where they really want to feel seen and heard and know that they're part of a community that's not alone.' The podcast host, Alex Cooper, has announced that she will invite Donald Trump to discuss women's rights if he is willing to have a 'meaningful and in-depth conversation'.

**Harris and Trump focus on closing messages with rallies in Georgia, Nevada, Arizona**
In a shift from traditional journalism, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are focusing on podcasts and targeted rallies to reach specific audiences. Harris has appeared on 'Call Her Daddy' and 'All the Smoke', while Trump has appeared on 'Bussin' With the Boys' and 'Flagrant'. Despite this, Harris has also spoken to NBC News and held a CNN town hall. Trump was asked on 'The Hugh Hewitt Show' whether he would pardon himself or terminate his lawyer, Smith, to remove the legal cloud over him, and responded that he would 'fire him within two seconds'. Harris is set to appear at a rally in Houston with Beyoncé, who has become a key figure in Harris' campaign, with Harris' campaign using Beyoncé's song 'Freedom' as its anthem. Harris is focusing on reproductive care in her campaign, and has headed to the reliably Republican state of Georgia just 10 days before Election Day.

**Harris and Trump turn away from legacy media to reach voters**
In the 2024 general election campaign, candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have been turning away from traditional legacy media outlets to reach voters through alternative platforms such as podcasts. Harris has appeared on 'Call Her Daddy' and 'All the Smoke,' while Trump has been featured on 'Bussin' With the Boys' and 'Flagrant.' This shift is driven by the growing popularity of podcasts, which allow candidates to target specific audiences and avoid potentially damaging interviews. According to Sara Just, senior executive producer of the PBS 'NewsHour,' 'The campaigns have their structures and their media plans are very carefully thought through, even if we don't agree with them.' However, some legacy news organizations, such as ABC News and CNN, are still reaching a significant audience, and experts caution against drawing conclusions based on this campaign's unique circumstances. 'I don't think journalists should worry too much about access journalism,' said Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of the Hofstra University School of Communication. 'We should do journalism.'

**Trump, Harris turn to podcasts, and maybe Joe Rogan, for US election boost**
US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are turning to podcasts to reach young voters. Trump has appeared on several podcasts, including episodes with pranksters The Nelk Boys, comedian Theo Von, and influencer Logan Paul, and is set to interview with Joe Rogan on Friday. Harris has joined the popular podcast 'Call Her Daddy' and has spoken with Rogan's crew about a possible podcast appearance. Rogan's audience skews conservative, but is predominantly young and male, which could offer Harris a unique chance to shift the narrative. However, a recent YouGov poll found that over half of respondents believe a possible Harris-Rogan episode would make 'no difference' in how they view the candidate. Analysts say that podcast appearances are a reflection of the media's evolving landscape and weaker pull of traditional TV advertisements.

Harris is scheduled to appear on another podcast, 'Call Her Daddy,' earlier this month and will also be in Texas on Friday for a rally in Houston.

**Opinion: Why are Harris and Trump on so many podcasts? Because they want to win.**
In the 2024 presidential election, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are using podcasts as a key part of their media outreach efforts. Harris appeared on popular podcasts 'Call Her Daddy' and 'The Breakfast Club,' while Trump appeared on 'The PBD Podcast.' These shows offer a chance to connect with huge audiences, particularly among young people and people of color, and can be a more effective way to reach voters than traditional media. According to Spotify, 'Call Her Daddy' is the second most popular podcast on the platform, behind only 'The Joe Rogan Experience.' Both Harris and Trump are rumored to be eyeing appearances on 'The Joe Rogan Experience,' which has a massive following. As the election nears, the goal for both campaigns is clear: maximize voter contacts by going to where voters already are, including podcasts and radio shows with huge followings that appeal to specific demographics.

**The podcast election: How they have taken on a larger role in 2024**
The 2024 presidential election is the first to feature both candidates making multiple podcast appearances to promote their campaigns. Former President Donald Trump has made appearances on several popular podcasts, including ImPaulsive, This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von, Lex Fridman, FLAGRANT, Bussin' with the Boys, and PBD Podcast, discussing topics such as artificial intelligence, abortion, and border security. Trump has also claimed he will appear on The Joe Rogan Experience, despite Rogan's previous opposition. Vice President Kamala Harris has appeared on Call Her Daddy, All the Smoke, and has met with Rogan's team, but has yet to confirm an appearance on his podcast.

**Call Her Daddy to Theo Von: how podcasts became a vital election tool**
In a shift in campaign strategy, both Harris and Trump have been giving long interviews on a range of podcasts. Harris appeared on Call Her Daddy, a relationships and advice podcast, where she discussed her views on abortion rights and mental wellbeing. She also appeared on All The Smoke, a sports talk podcast, where she discussed her personal life. Trump, on the other hand, appeared on Bussin' With The Boys, a sports talk podcast, where he discussed his views on various issues and tried to appeal to a younger audience. The strategy is seen as a way to reach undecided or undermotivated voters, but critics argue that it can also make candidates appear more approachable and less serious. Harris is also considering an appearance on Joe Rogan's show, which has a large and male audience. However, this could also lead to a 'podcast quagmire' where candidates are turned into harmless morning-zoo personalities.

**Candidates' podcast blitz, postpartum psychosis, and Trump's views on guns**
The 2024 presidential election is seeing a surge in podcast appearances by candidates, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump leading the way. Harris has already appeared on the 'Call Her Daddy' podcast, while Trump has appeared on numerous male-oriented podcasts. This trend is transforming the election, with podcasts offering candidates a more affable and jovial platform to reach voters. Harris' appearance on 'Call Her Daddy' was not a hard-hitting interview, but it did contain a substantive policy discussion on issues like abortion rights and housing costs. The podcast campaign reflects the shift in media consumption, with hit podcasts over-indexing with audiences that public figures want to reach. Despite the campaigns' heavy spending on traditional media, podcasts are steering the conversation as never before, said media columnist Margaret Sullivan. 'As journalists,' she said, 'we have to realize we are not the gatekeepers of information as we once were.'

**With reports Kamala might join Joe Rogan for a chat, the US election is showing the power of podcasting**
US Vice-President Kamala Harris has been making waves in the podcasting world with her recent interview on Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy. This move has sparked debate about whether it's a strategic decision to reach new audiences or a softer approach to media scrutiny. Harris' appearance on the podcast, which focuses on sex and female empowerment, has been criticized by some as the 'soft option'. However, Cooper has also invited former president Donald Trump onto her show, and has been praised for her interviewing skills. The same commentators who criticized Harris for her podcast appearance have overlooked Trump's own podcast appearances, which have been seen as more 'friendly' and 'bro-ey'. Harris' decision to appear on a podcast aimed at young women has been seen as a timely reminder of the centrality of reproductive freedom to women's lives and the election. The risks of the interview were more Cooper's, who hinted at the prospect of losing listeners by interviewing a politician. The question remains: is appearing on extremely popular podcasts with young audiences a good political strategy for Harris?

**Could Kamala Harris Beat Trump at Podcast Bookings?**
In a bid to reach young voters, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are seeking to appear on popular podcasts, particularly The Joe Rogan Experience. Trump has already made several appearances on various podcasts, including Logan Paul's show, Theo Von's podcast, and Barstool Sports' Bussin' With the Boys. Harris has appeared on Call Her Daddy, a show spun out of the Barstool Sports universe, but has not yet confirmed an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. Trump has expressed interest in appearing on the show, which could be a departure for host Joe Rogan, who has previously hosted presidential candidates but never a major-party candidate who won a primary. An appearance on the show could be a win for both candidates, but it could also be awkward given Rogan's history of clowning on both Harris and Trump.

**Trump and Harris Use Podcasts to Reach Wider Audience**
In the United States, podcasts have become a crucial platform for politicians to reach a wider audience. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the two candidates for the 2024 presidential election, are using podcasts to their advantage. Trump has appeared on several popular podcasts, including 'Impaulsive' with Logan Paul and 'Flagrant' with Andrew Schulz, while Harris has appeared on 'All the smoke' and 'Call her Daddy'. Harris's appearance on 'Call her Daddy' was particularly notable, as she spent over 45 minutes discussing topics with host Alex Cooper, who has 5 million listeners on Spotify. Experts say that podcasts are becoming a normal part of the political landscape, and that politicians are starting to realize their importance. 'It's no longer just about Donald Trump,' says Richard Hargy, a specialist in American politics at Queen's University Belfast. 'More and more politicians are using podcasts to reach a wider audience.' Trump's use of podcasts is seen as an advantage, as he is comfortable with the format and can have spontaneous conversations. Harris, on the other hand, may struggle with the format, but her appearance on 'Call her Daddy' was well-received by experts. 'It's a way for politicians to reach a specific audience,' says René Lindstädt, a specialist in American politics at the University of Birmingham. 'And in a close election, being able to reach a specific audience can be decisive.'

**Why Kamala Harris chose to appear on the 'Call Her Daddy' podcast**
Vice-president Kamala Harris has gone on a media blitz in the final stretch of the US election, appearing on various platforms, including CBS's 60 Minutes, ABC's The View, and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. However, her decision to appear on the popular podcast Call Her Daddy, with 5mn downloads a week, caught some by surprise. The podcast's host, Alex Cooper, acknowledged that some of her audience, the 'Daddy Gang', may not be happy with her having Harris on the show. Cooper focused her questions on women and abortion, topics she feels most qualified to discuss. Harris's appearance on the podcast was seen as a strategic move to reach young women across the political spectrum, with 48 per cent of Call Her Daddy's audience identifying as Democrats. Cooper has pivoted in recent years, focusing more on women's issues and mental health, mirroring the wider shift among young US women. Harris's media blitz speaks to the fragmented landscape of the US election, with her opponent, Donald Trump, appearing everywhere for months. Harris has been more selective, but the breadth of her appearances is similar, reaching specific and unique audiences that Democrats need to engage with.

**How Podcasts Are Transforming the Presidential Election**
The 2024 Presidential election is seeing a shift in how candidates interact with the public, with conversation podcasts becoming a key platform. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have both appeared on podcasts, with Trump sitting down with comedian Theo Von and Harris appearing on 'Call Her Daddy' and 'All the Smoke'. These podcasts offer a more casual and intimate setting, allowing candidates to connect with voters in a way that traditional media cannot. Trump has used podcasts to reach a young, online male audience, while Harris has targeted young adults, women, and Black Americans. By going on these shows, candidates can appeal to demographics that are crucial to their election chances. As one observer noted, 'This is why we love podcasts: they are the internet for our ears. Now we can be on the internet all the time.'

**Kamala Harris' Podcast Strategy: Reaching Young Voters and Women**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has been making appearances in various podcasts to reach a wider audience, particularly young voters and women. Her recent appearance on the popular podcast 'Call Her Daddy' has sparked controversy, with some fans expressing their disappointment and frustration with her participation. Harris discussed various women's issues, including abortion and sexual assault, and also criticized her opponents, including Donald Trump and Sarah Huckabee Sanders. According to commentator Sigrid Rege Gårdsvoll, Harris' strategy is to reach voters who may not be the most informed or likely to vote, and this podcast appearance is a smart move. Harris has also appeared on other podcasts, including 'All The Smoke' and '60 Minutes', and will be on TV shows 'The View' and 'The Late Show' this week. Trump has also been making appearances on various platforms, including Fox News and Lex Fridman's podcast. Both Harris and Trump are being strategic in their appearances, avoiding difficult questions and strong opposition. The outcome of the election remains to be seen, with the winner to be determined on November 5th.

**Trump and Harris Engage in Heated Exchange Ahead of US Presidential Election**
One month before the US presidential election, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are engaging in a back-and-forth exchange. In a recent episode of the popular podcast 'Call Her Daddy', Harris reiterated her criticism of violence against women and defended the right to abortion. She also accused Trump of spreading 'lies' about her, saying, 'It's scandalously inaccurate and insulting to suggest that women do this. This man is full of lies.' Harris also pointed out that Trump has previously suggested that women who have abortions should be punished. Trump, on the other hand, has tried to position himself as a 'protector' of women, but Harris reminded listeners that he has also said that women who have abortions should be punished. The abortion issue is a major topic in the campaign, and Democrats are hoping to capitalize on it, while Trump is trying to avoid taking a clear stance, saying that it's up to the states to decide. Trump has also called Harris 'grossly incompetent' and accused her of wanting to implement a 'communist' policy. Harris is set to appear on various TV and radio shows throughout the week, including 'The Howard Stern Show' and 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert', which are generally seen as favorable to her campaign.

**Podcasts, TikToks and YouTube channels: Harris and Trump find new messengers for their campaigns**
Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are using non-traditional media platforms, such as podcasts and social media influencers, to reach voters in the 2024 election. Harris appeared on the popular Call Her Daddy podcast, which has a weekly audience of 5 million listeners, mostly women, and will also appear on other shows like 60 Minutes and The View. Trump has given multiple interviews to influencers and podcasters, including Lex Fridman's podcast, which has 3.6 million subscribers, mostly men. The campaigns are trying to reach voters in 'small bubbles of ideology, demographics and interests' and to 'change the electorate' by targeting young men who are less likely to vote. However, there are also risks to this strategy, including backlash from listeners and negative headlines.

**"Call Her Daddy" appearance by Kamala Harris shows candidates looking for votes in nontraditional places**
Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris appeared on the popular podcast 'Call Her Daddy,' which has millions of listeners, mostly GenZ and millennial women. The conversation centered around women's issues, and the move has been seen as a way for Harris to target young female potential voters. Political analysts say that candidates are looking for unconventional spaces to find voters, and Harris' appearance on the podcast is a prime example. 'A podcast is about your opinion,' said BU student Fiona Holton. 'It's just somebody talking.' Harris also appeared on 'All The Smoke,' a podcast hosted by former NBA players. In contrast, Trump has taken a more traditional approach, focusing on rallies and 'friendlier' interview locations like Fox News. 'Politicians go where the voters are,' said St. Anselm College Political Science Professor Chris Galdieri. 'That was the same thing that was said about Bill Clinton when he went on Arsenio Hall and played the saxophone in 1992.'

**Trump, Harris Embrace Podcasts in Fight for Tuned-Out Voters**
In a bid to reach voters who may be tuning out traditional media, presidential contenders Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are embracing podcasts. Harris recently appeared on the popular show 'Call Her Daddy' with host Alex Cooper, discussing women's empowerment and abortion rights, while Trump sat with personal-finance guru Dave Ramsey to talk about inflation. Martha McKenna, a Democratic media strategist, said podcasts offer candidates a chance to share their personalities in informal settings, reaching voters who may not seek out political information. Republican digital strategist Tyler Brown noted that voters are drawn to the type of person beyond policy issues, making podcasts a valuable platform for candidates. Harris' campaign sees podcasts as an ideal way to discuss abortion access, a key issue for Democrats, while Trump's team aims to humanize the former president through podcast appearances.

**Harris ramps up media appearances with friendly hosts as Election Day approaches**
Vice President Kamala Harris is increasing her media appearances ahead of Election Day, reversing her previous strategy of limiting interviews. Harris will appear on the Call Her Daddy podcast, 60 Minutes, and Howard Stern's radio show, answering questions on policy and her personal life. In a 60 Minutes interview, Harris stated, 'It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations.' Harris's media appearances come after criticism from Republicans, including Sen. J.D. Vance, for not sitting down with journalists for an interview for over a month. Since facing off with Donald Trump in a debate last month, Harris has slowly ramped up her media appearances.

**Trump and Harris Trade Accusations of Inefficiency and Lying**
In a heated exchange, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris accused each other of 'inefficiency' and 'lying' just a month before the presidential election. During her appearance on the popular podcast 'Call Her Daddy', Harris reiterated her opposition to violence against women and defended the right to abortion, calling Trump's accusations that she supports 'killing babies' in the eighth or ninth month of pregnancy 'lies'. Harris said, 'It's a clear and humiliating inaccuracy to suggest that this happens and that women do this.' She emphasized that Trump's statements are 'full of lies'. Meanwhile, Trump has tried to portray himself as a 'protector' of women during his campaign, but Harris pointed out that 'this is the same man who said women should be punished for having abortions.' Abortion is a key issue in the election, with Democrats hoping to capitalize on it, while Trump is trying to avoid taking a clear stance, arguing that it should be left to the states to decide. This podcast marks the first stage of Harris's media marathon, which will see her appear on various TV and radio programs throughout the week, including 'The Howard Stern Show' and 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.' Trump, on the other hand, has headed to Wisconsin (North) for the fourth time, where he will hold a rally in the small town of Janesville, touching on his usual campaign issues, from immigration control to inflation, and accusing his opponent of following a 'socialist' policy. However, Trump went further, describing Harris as 'extremely incompetent', citing the federal government's failure, in his view, to provide aid to residents of the southeastern United States who were severely affected by Hurricane Helen. Trump said Harris 'wants to steal your wealth and abandon you and your families.' In front of hundreds of people, the Republican candidate reminded voters that early voting is open in Wisconsin, saying 'I ask you for one thing only, get out and vote.'
