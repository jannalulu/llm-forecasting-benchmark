Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

1. Reference Class and Base Rate:
- Solar cycle 25 is currently peaking, increasing geomagnetic storm likelihood
- Historical patterns show increased solar activity in 2024
- Recent months (July-August 2024) have shown multiple geomagnetic storms

2. Recent Evidence:
- August 17-18, 2024: Strong G3 geomagnetic storm reached Kp 6.67
- Multiple articles report ongoing solar activity and potential storms
- The solar flare on August 14 specifically predicted continued disturbances

3. Specific Period Analysis (Aug 21 - Sept 11, 2024):
- High solar activity predicted for this exact timeframe
- One article specifically mentions August 21-22 as a potential intense period
- Previous storms this month reached/exceeded Kp 6

4. Probability Calibration:
- Base rate suggests moderate likelihood
- Recent evidence suggests higher probability
- Need to distinguish between Kp > 6 and Kp ≤ 8

5. Balancing Considerations:
- Avoid overconfidence
- Recognize unpredictability of solar events
- Consider potential measurement variations

Weighing all factors carefully, accounting for solar cycle peak and recent activity patterns:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 84.30%, but 75.40% being the most likely. Probability: 75.40%.

Let me carefully analyze this forecast step by step:

Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent Solar Activity Context
- Multiple strong geomagnetic storms in August 2024 already observed
- Aug 17-18: Strong G3 level storm with Kp exceeding 6
- Aug 12: Strong G3 level storm with Kp reaching 6-7
- Aug 2: Moderate magnetic storm with Kp of 6
- July had multiple storms in the 5-6 Kp range

2. Seasonal Trends
- July/August seem peak months for solar storm activity in 2024

- Some predictions suggest continued high solar activity through August/early September

3. Scientific Context
- Solar cycle 25 is currently in an active phase
- Increased probability of geomagnetic disturbances

Probability Calculation Reasoning:
- Base rate of Kp >6 and ≤8: Moderate
- Recent trend suggests high probability
- Specific timeframe is continuation of current active period

Adjustments:
- Reduce pure extrapolation risk
- Account for potential variability
- Consider scientific uncertainty

Calibration:
- Not overly confident
- Recognize complex solar dynamics
