**France: From the Cord to the Bolillo Lace**
The New Popular Front (NFP) coalition of socialists, communists, ecologists, and independents won the French Assembly elections, defeating Marine Le Pen's Reagrupamiento Nacional (RN) party. The coalition, along with the Macronists, blocked Le Pen's party from gaining power. The results led to the resignation of Gabriel Attal, the designated prime minister for 2024. The election has created a complex situation for governance, with the need for a coalition government between the center, right, and left. Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of the radical left, has called for the new prime minister to come from the updated Popular Front. However, the president will have the final say in the nomination, and the negotiations will be difficult to reconcile the winner of the left with their allies from the right and center. The extraordinary mobilization of voters has prevented the rise of Le Pen's party and has alleviated concerns for European institutions. The French society's malaise and fragmentation require now, after emergency alliances, solvent responses to the latent and expressed problems.

**New Popular Front to Designate Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, will designate a prime minister candidate this week to govern without Macron. Olivier Faure, the Socialist Party's first secretary, emphasized that Macron must recognize his defeat in the June 30 and July 7 legislative elections. Faure excluded Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insumisa, from the running and stressed that the new prime minister must be able to dialogue with the outside world. The coalition, which includes La France Insumisa, the Socialist Party, the Ecologists, and the French Communist Party, won 182 seats in the legislative elections, far from the 289 needed for an absolute majority. The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, will present his resignation to the president this morning, but may remain in office as long as necessary, considering France is hosting the Paris Olympics starting July 26.

**Left-Wing New Popular Front Coalition Leads French Election, Polls Show**
The left-wing New Popular Front coalition won the most seats in the second round of French parliamentary elections, leading pollsters said on Sunday. This puts them on track for a surprise win over the far-right National Rally (RN) party but short of an absolute majority in parliament. Financial analysts are expecting a relief in the market, with some predicting a slight gap lower in French bond prices and higher yields. The real question is who will be running the country and who will be the next prime minister.

**What Political Scenarios for July?**
The French political landscape will be put to the test. The first round of legislative elections will take place on June 30, 2024. If the National Rally or the New Popular Front wins, nothing is guaranteed for them. Once the result is known, the National Assembly must convene on the second Thursday following the election, as stipulated by Article 12 of the Constitution, which relates to the dissolution of the National Assembly. This will be on July 18. If Emmanuel Macron obtains an absolute majority, he can govern without hindrance. In the event of an absolute majority for the National Rally, a cohabitation with Jordan Bardella as Prime Minister would be inevitable. However, Macron, as President, has the right to refuse to appoint the Prime Minister proposed by the opposition, although this could lead to tensions and motions of censure. If the RN obtains a relative majority, Jordan Bardella has already announced that he would refuse the Prime Minister position, leading to a potential deadlock. Finally, without a clear majority, an apolitical technical government could be formed to manage current affairs. If instability persists, Macron could consider a new dissolution of the Assembly after a year or even his own resignation, although he has ruled out this option in the short term.

**Surprise Election Outcome Sparks Political Uncertainty in France**
France is facing political uncertainty after a surprise victory by a left-wing coalition in the July 7 legislative election. The New Popular Front, National Rally, and President Macron's centrist alliance must navigate a fractured legislature. The New Popular Front is expected to secure between 171 and 205 seats, while National Rally is anticipated to secure between 130 and 152 seats. Macron's alliance is expected to secure between 152 and 180 seats. The parties have pledged to increase public expenditures significantly, with the New Popular Front's campaign pledges requiring roughly €179 billion annually. Macron has delayed any further decisions regarding the appointment of the next prime minister until the National Assembly's new configuration is established. France is now faced with two options: a coalition government or a technocratic administration. Both alternatives will likely result in a government that is less influential on the international stage and unable to enact significant legislation.

**QUOTES-French Political Leaders on How to Find a Government Majority**
After the French parliamentary election, the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) will have the most lawmakers, followed by President Emmanuel Macron's centrists and the far-right National Rally (RN). Political leaders are discussing how to form a governing coalition, with some calling for Macron to officially call on the NFP to name a prime minister. Manuel Bompard, leader of France Unbowed, believes the President has a duty to summon a prime minister from the NFP. Yael Braun-Pivet, a senior centrist lawmaker and Macron ally, thinks the coalition is now necessary due to the will of the French people. Francois Bayrou, leader of the Centrist Modem Party, believes the path to a coalition is difficult but necessary, as the National Assembly cannot be dissolved before July 2025.

**A French 'non' to the far right**
The New Popular Front, a French left-wing coalition, unexpectedly won the second and final round of France's snap elections on Sunday (7 July), surpassing Marine Le Pen's National Rally. Although the coalition did not secure an absolute majority, questions arise about who will become the country's next prime minister and which parties might collaborate to form a government.

**French Legislative Elections 2024: Left-Wing Victory, Attal's Resignation, and New Prime Minister**
French legislative elections 2024: left-wing victory, Attal's resignation, and selection of new Prime Minister... follow the situation in real-time.

The New Popular Front surprised on July 7 by winning the second round of legislative elections with over 180 deputies. The RN and its allies have only 143 elected officials in the future Assembly. However, this score remains historic for the extreme right. Gabriel Attal will submit his resignation to Emmanuel Macron on July 8.

**France Holds Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
France is holding the second round of parliamentary elections on July 7, 2024, after President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly following the European Parliament elections. The elections are being held under a majoritarian system, with the first round taking place on June 30. According to opinion polls, the far-right 'National Rally' party, led by Marine Le Pen, is likely to win a majority of seats, but may not have the absolute majority needed to form a government. The party has been criticized for its economic program, which is seen as left-wing, and its stance on migration and Ukraine. The left-wing coalition, led by the 'New Popular Front', is expected to come in second, while the centrist parties, including Macron's party, are likely to come in third. The outcome of the election will determine who will become the next Prime Minister of France.

**French Election: Right-Wing Party Leads, Jordan Bardella Emerges as Prime Minister Favorite**
The French will vote on June 30, 2024, in the first round of the National Assembly elections. The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron on June 9, 2024, has raised concerns about the possibility of a right-wing government. The latest polls show the right-wing party RN (National Rally) leading with 36.5% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front (a coalition of left-wing and center-left parties) with 29%, and Macron's centrist alliance (Together) in third place with 20.5%. If the right-wing party wins the first round and RN gains another significant victory in the second round on July 7, 2024, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, who shares the leadership of the National Rally with Marine Le Pen, is likely to become the next Prime Minister. Bardella's appeal is strong among French citizens concerned about immigration, national sovereignty, and critical of Macron's pro-Ukrainian policies. He uses social media to spread his messages and gain popularity, especially with impactful slogans. As Prime Minister, Bardella is likely to adopt stricter policies on immigration, which could increase tensions with the Muslim population in France. He has also been critical of the European Union, arguing that France's participation in the EU has resulted in economic losses and compromised national identity. If the right-wing party gains more support, it is possible that France could leave the EU, but this would have significant political and economic costs, considering France's historical leadership role in the integration process.

**The Latest 5/8 Polls are open in France's early legislative election**
France is holding an early parliamentary election on June 30 and July 7, which could bring the country's first far-right government since World War II. The election is highly uncertain, with three major political blocs competing: the far-right National Rally, President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance, and the New Popular Front coalition. The French system is complex, and the outcome of the vote remains uncertain. National Rally president Jordan Bardella has stated that if he were to become prime minister, he would oppose sending French troops to Ukraine and refuse French deliveries of long-range missiles and other weaponry capable of striking targets within Russia.

**Left-Wing Parties in France Form New 'Popular Front' Ahead of Legislative Elections**
The left-wing parties in France have reached an agreement to form a new 'Popular Front' ahead of the legislative elections on June 30. After four days of intense negotiations, the parties have agreed on a joint program and unique candidates for each constituency. The agreement was welcomed by leaders such as François Ruffin, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, and Olivier Faure. The parties have also agreed on the allocation of seats, with 229 going to LFI, 175 to the PS, 92 to the Ecologists, and 50 to the PCF. However, some points of the program, such as the situation in the Middle East, are still sensitive. The question of who will lead the coalition as Prime Minister remains open, with Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Olivier Faure both expressing interest in the role.
