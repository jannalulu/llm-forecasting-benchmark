**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the big question: Did Apple announce the iPhone with stacked battery technology before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 45.67%. Given the EU's upcoming battery regulations and emerging rumors, it was close, but not quite there.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. The rumors were strong, especially with the potential for longer battery life and faster charging. Yet, here we are.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The tech world is unpredictable, but our models remain steadfast. Perhaps the iPhone 17 will be the one to watch.

*They both nod, acknowledging the ever-evolving landscape of technology.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Until next time, we keep refining our predictions.

*They turn back to their screens, ready for the next forecasting challenge.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the moment of truth has arrived. Did Apple unveil their iPhone with stacked battery technology?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the promising rumors, Apple didn’t make the announcement. It seems they’re still refining the technology.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the EU battery regulation likely played a role in delaying the announcement. Our models factored in both the technological hurdles and regulatory challenges.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The stacked battery remains an exciting prospect, but for now, it’s just that—a prospect. We'll have to wait and see how Apple adapts to the evolving landscape.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right, Nate. Despite the rumors, the tech was just too emerging for this cycle. The EU battery law might've slowed them down.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. The potential for higher capacity was there, but the timeline was tight. Our data up to August 2 showed minimal leaks or official hints.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
It’s fascinating how even with stacked technology's advantages, the market dynamics and regulations play a huge role. 

**NATE SILVER**  
Agreed. Let's see if Apple surprises us next year. For now, it’s a "no."
