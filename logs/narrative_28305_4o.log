INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open. The air buzzes with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at the screen)  
"Our models had it at 85.75%. The national average retail price of regular gasoline was indeed above $3.40 yesterday."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(sipping coffee)  
"Fascinating. The economic factors aligned, despite the recent dip. Harris might see some unexpected advantages."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
"True, but the election year's volatility always throws a curveball. Remember the Israel-Hamas conflict's impact?"

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
"Yet our models held strong. Brier scores remain pristine."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning back)  
"Gas prices and politics—a dance as old as time. Let’s see how this plays out in the coming weeks."

They exchange knowing glances as the hum of conversation fills the room.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS, SAM, ALEX, and JORDAN, sit around a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

SAM  
Well, the AAA numbers are in. Regular gas is at $3.39.

ALEX  
Our models had it at 95.45% that it would stay below $3.40. Nailed it.

JORDAN  
It's fascinating how economic factors aligned. Harris might get some traction now.

SAM  
Right. The drop in gas prices came at a crucial time, especially with the election looming.

ALEX  
The correlation with approval ratings is undeniable. Yet, global events could still shake things up.

JORDAN  
True, but for now, the models held steady. The data never lies.

They clink their coffee cups, a quiet acknowledgment of their predictive prowess.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, coffee cups in hand, analyzing the latest data. An OLD NEWSPAPER lies on the table, headline reading: "GAS PRICES HIT 3-YEAR LOW!"

SUPERFORECASTER 1
(leaning back, confidently)
Our models had it at 95.75%. The price was bound to stay below $3.40.

SUPERFORECASTER 2
(nods)
Exactly. The recent decline was driven by global market stabilization, not political maneuvers.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

And yet, the media was quick to speculate on Harris's potential bump.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

The correlation's there, but gas prices alone don’t win elections.
