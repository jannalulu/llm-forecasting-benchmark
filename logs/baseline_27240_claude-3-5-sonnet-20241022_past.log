Let me reason through this carefully:

1. First, I need to verify if Keir Starmer is likely to be PM during the specified period. Given current polling and political landscape, Labour is heavily favored to win the next general election, which must be held by January 2025. Most expect it in late 2024, after September.

2. The question asks about his approval rating as PM, but he won't be PM by September 18, 2024 - he'll still be Opposition Leader. This would trigger the annulment clause in the fine print.

3. The resolution criteria specifically requires his approval rating "as Prime Minister" but unless there's an unexpected early election before September 18, 2024, he won't hold this position.

4. Given the timing of likely election scenarios and transition periods, it's extremely unlikely that Starmer would be Prime Minister by September 18, 2024.

5. Since the question would be annulled if he's not PM during the specified period, and there's very high certainty he won't be PM by then, this effectively means the question will be annulled.

My Prediction: Between 99.50% and 99.90%, with 99.80% being the most likely. Probability: 99.80%
