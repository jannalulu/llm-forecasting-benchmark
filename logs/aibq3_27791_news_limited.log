**While Marijuana Will Soon be Rescheduled, the Federal Government's Drug Scheduling System Remains Tyrannical**
Vanderbilt Law professor Robert Mikos argues that the recent rescheduling of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) will not pave the way for rescheduling other Schedule I drugs, such as psilocybin, MDMA, and LSD. Mikos claims that the DEA's decision preserves the 'tyrannies of scheduling,' which he believes are the barriers that make it virtually impossible to remove drugs from Schedule I. He suggests that the DEA has placed too much emphasis on a drug's currently accepted medical use (CAMU) in scheduling decisions, which he labels the 'Tyranny of Science' and the 'Tyranny of the Majority.' Mikos proposes a new approach to scheduling that considers all three criteria - a drug's abuse potential, its dependence liability, and whether or not it has a CAMU - to determine where a drug belongs among the statute's five schedules. He believes that this approach would foster more rational administrative scheduling decisions and enable the agency to remove drugs like marijuana, psilocybin, or MDMA from Schedule I if their abuse potential and dependence liability so warrant.

**GOP protests marijuana rescheduling**
The comment period for the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act has ended, with over 40,000 comments submitted, mostly in favor of the change. However, 11 GOP state attorneys general and dozens of Republicans in Congress are resisting the rule, arguing that it is poorly researched and does not remove the roadblocks keeping the marijuana industry from being fully integrated into the U.S. economy. Karen O'Keefe, director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, called the objection 'shocking and disappointing.' The White House began the formal rulemaking process in May, but despite the pushback, rescheduling to Schedule III would still prohibit the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing, and possession of marijuana under the CSA.

**As Election Buzz Swirls Around Biden And Harris, DEA Comment Period Ends: What's Next For Cannabis Rescheduling?**
The public comment period for the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has ended. The DEA received over 37,000 comments, with 75.9% supporting the move. The final ruling is expected around August 20, 2024, and will become effective 30 days after publication. The Biden administration is expected to prioritize concluding the rescheduling process before January 20, 2025, but potential delays are possible due to the large volume of comments. The decision on whether to hold Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearings is pending, which could extend the timeline. Alternatively, the DOJ might expedite the process by forgoing hearings and directly finalizing the rule.

**This Huge Catalyst Could Drive Cannabis Stocks Much Higher Soon**
Cannabis stocks are undervalued and may experience a significant increase if the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of Justice (DOJ) reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This change would allow cannabis companies to deduct operating expenses against revenue, resulting in a significant cash windfall. The timeline for this change is uncertain, but publication of a final rule by October is possible. However, there is a potential pitfall in the form of an internal administrative law judge hearing, which could add years to the process. Experts believe that this is unlikely to happen, especially if the goal is to get the change done before the election.

**Cannabis Rescheduling Update: DEA Announces Date for ALJ Hearing**
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2nd to consider the rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The hearing will consider briefs, evidence, and witnesses from 'interested parties' who have submitted over 40,000 public comments. The DEA will consider the public input before promulgating a final rule, which will be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and may be subject to a 60-day review session by Congress before going into effect. According to the Congressional Review Act (CRA), the final rule will not go into effect before the November election. The ALJ hearing will be a significant step in the rulemaking process, and our team of experts at Foley Hoag will continue to monitor it and provide timely updates.

**Cannabis stocks on watch as DEA sets hearing on rescheduling**
Cannabis-related stocks will be under scrutiny on Tuesday after the DEA scheduled a public hearing to consider different views on the U.S. Justice Department's proposal to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. The hearing, scheduled for December 02, will consider moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. This move could have significant implications for the industry, with Canadian Licensed Producers such as Canopy Growth, Tilray, and Aurora Cannabis already trading lower in the premarket. U.S. counterparts, including Curaleaf Holdings, Acreage Holdings, and Cresco Labs, are also expected to be affected. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF has lost around 11% premarket, with other cannabis ETFs also experiencing losses.

**Marijuana Is Same As Heroin According To Nevada Supreme Court In Reversal Ruling That Cannabis Is A Schedule 1 Drug**
The Nevada Supreme Court has overturned a 2022 ruling that cannabis is not a Schedule 1 drug, citing that plaintiffs had no standing to challenge the classification of cannabis by the Board of Pharmacy. The ruling reverses a decision by Clark County District Judge Joe Hardy Jr., who had sided with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) that marijuana has an accepted medical use. The ACLU had argued that the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy failed to honor the will of Nevada voters, following the passage of the Nevada Medical Marijuana Act in 2000 and the Initiative to Regulate and Tax Marijuana in 2016. The Nevada Supreme Court justices stated, 'As a threshold matter, while the declarations establish that Poole and at least one of CEIC's members sustained a possession-of-marijuana conviction after medical marijuana was legalized, they do not tie the conviction(s) to the Board's classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance.' This decision comes as lawmakers push to reschedule marijuana on the federal level, with a group of U.S. senators supporting the DEA's proposal to transfer marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).

**GOP Lawmakers Condemn Cannabis Rescheduling, One Calls Legal Weed 'Immoral Industry'**
Several GOP lawmakers, including House Energy & Commerce Committee chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Health Subcommittee chair Brett Guthrie, have condemned the Biden administration's proposal to reschedule marijuana, citing concerns over the integrity of the review process. They argue that the shift from a five-factor analysis to a two-factor review for assessing marijuana's medical use and abuse potential is unusual and raises doubts about the scientific and procedural integrity behind the move to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. Additionally, Rep. Doug LaMalfa from California has called marijuana an 'immoral industry' and urged the federal government against allowing banks to support it, stating that it would 'give a green light to the evil that comes from drug use'.

**NTSB Voices Concerns Over Potential Downgrade of Marijuana**
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has expressed concerns that a proposed rule to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act could compromise federally required drug testing for truck drivers, airline pilots, and other safety-sensitive employees. The NTSB is worried that laboratories certified by the Department of Health and Human Services for drug testing are not authorized to test for Schedule III controlled substances. The American Trucking Associations has also filed comments warning that drug testing of commercial truck drivers could be eliminated if the proposal becomes final. The NTSB is urging the DEA to ensure that any final rule does not compromise marijuana testing under DOT and HHS procedures applicable to safety-sensitive transportation employees.

**DOJ Proposes Rescheduling Marijuana**
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed rescheduling marijuana from a schedule I to a schedule III controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This change could lead to further legal protections for banks with marijuana-related business clients and alleviate tax burdens for these businesses. However, the rescheduling itself may not immediately impact the risks associated with banking these businesses. The proposed rule is open for public comment and could potentially trigger further legalization of marijuana at the federal level.

**Feds To Weigh 40,000 Marijuana Rescheduling Comments From Governors, Lawmakers, Health Experts And Advocates**
The federal government received over 40,000 comments on its proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The comments came from governors, lawmakers, medical professionals, advocacy groups, and others. Some comments praised the proposal, while others criticized it, saying it does not go far enough to address the state-federal conflict between marijuana laws and criminal justice matters. The comments also highlighted the need for federal guidance on issues such as interstate commerce, research, and access to cannabinoid medicines.

**Lawmakers Attempt To Save Rescheduling, Hemp From Republican Ax**
Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Nancy Mace, and Morgan McGarvey introduced amendments to block efforts to thwart rescheduling and ban consumable hemp products. The amendments aim to prevent the Drug Enforcement Agency from implementing a change in the Controlled Substances Act, even if it decides to move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III. Mace, who has been an advocate for drug policy reform, said, 'We want to make sure rescheduling happens.' Tlaib and McGarvey's amendments aim to stop the committee from interfering with the Department of Justice's ability to reschedule cannabis. The hemp industry is also facing challenges from GOP lawmakers, who have approved language that would ban the sale of consumable hemp products with quantifiable amounts of THC or other cannabinoids.

**Gov. Beshear asks DEA to ease restrictions on marijuana**
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has written a letter to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) administrator, Anne Milgram, expressing his support for rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. This move would allow patients to have an alternative to deadly opioids and continued access to safe products, and would also help communities reduce crime and illicit drug use. Beshear believes that rescheduling would create fair markets for cannabis businesses and provide opportunities for research. He notes that the medical marijuana law he signed, which passed with bipartisan support, takes effect in January 2025 and the state is currently taking license applications for all aspects of the business. The Governor also highlights the opioid epidemic, stating that nationally, opioid use killed 80,000 Americans in 2022, while marijuana use alone killed zero Americans.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has written a letter to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in support of reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I controlled substance to Schedule III, recognizing its medical uses. The proposal is open for public comment until July 22, and Beshear's letter comes as Kentucky is accepting applications for cannabis business licenses and preparing for the legalization of medical marijuana in 2025. Beshear argues that the evidence is clear that marijuana has medical uses and is being used for medical purposes, citing the recognition from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Justice.
