**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the numbers are in. The national average retail price of regular gasoline yesterday was $3.18.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had this at a 65.32% probability for a "no" resolution, predicting prices would stay below $3.205.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how economic factors aligned, especially with the election looming. The recent dip certainly gives Vice President Harris a potential edge.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The correlation between gas prices and presidential approval is undeniable. The market's balance post-pandemic and geopolitical tensions played a crucial role.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yet, as always, volatility remains a wildcard. We'll see how this impacts the political landscape.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. With the market stabilizing post-pandemic and geopolitical tensions easing, it seemed likely.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Plus, the administration's approval ratings might get a slight boost. History shows that gas prices and presidential ratings are closely linked.

**NATE SILVER:** True. Kamala Harris might just ride this wave into the elections.

Well, Philip, the numbers are in. Will the US national average retail price of regular gasoline be greater than $3.205 on September 30, 2024? 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. The recent economic shifts and geopolitical tensions didn't push it over the threshold.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the decline in gas prices seemed to favor the incumbent party, but not enough to break the $3.205 mark. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**

Indeed. The correlation between gas prices and presidential approval ratings remains strong. This could give Kamala Harris an edge in the final campaign stretch.
