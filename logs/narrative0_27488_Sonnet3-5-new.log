Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Philip, yesterday's core CPI numbers were quite revealing. Our models predicted this outcome with remarkable precision.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Given the Fed's aggressive stance throughout early 2024 and the cooling labor market we observed in our August data, our models gave a 22.45% probability of core CPI being 0.0% or lower in August.

Nate: [nodding] The persistence of modest inflation wasn't surprising. The July reading of 0.2% and the steady wage growth we saw in the summer months were strong indicators. Plus, the housing component remained sticky.

Philip: [pulling up a chart] The service sector inflation particularly kept core CPI in positive territory. Looking back, the market expectations for rapid disinflation were too optimistic.

Nate: Once again, our models proved reliable in capturing these nuances.

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Philip, yesterday's core CPI numbers were quite revealing. Our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Given the Fed's aggressive stance throughout early 2024 and the cooling labor market we observed in July, our models predicted this outcome with remarkable precision.

Nate: [nodding] No, our models had it at 12.45%. The likelihood of core CPI hitting 0.0% or lower was always quite low, especially considering the sticky wage growth we saw in the service sector through August.

Philip: The housing component remained particularly stubborn. Even with the recent cooling in rental markets, the lagged effect of earlier increases kept core inflation positive. Looking back at our August 22nd data, the signals were clear.

Nate: [chuckling] Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the boring prediction is the right one.

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Philip, yesterday's core CPI numbers were fascinating. Our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Given the Fed's aggressive rate hikes throughout 2023 and early 2024, plus the cooling labor market we observed in July's data, our models gave a 12.45% probability of core CPI being 0.0% or negative in August.

Nate: The actual 0.3% increase aligned perfectly with our predictions. The stubborn services inflation and rising housing costs we saw in the August 15th regional Fed reports were clear indicators.

Philip: [nodding] The Cleveland Fed's inflation nowcast from August 20th was particularly telling. Even with the slowdown in consumer spending, core prices remained resilient.

Nate: Just goes to show that getting to zero or negative monthly core inflation is still quite rare in this economic environment.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Given the Fed's aggressive rate hikes through early 2024 and the cooling labor market we observed in July, our models gave this scenario a 12.45% probability.

Nate: Exactly. The signs were there – weakening consumer spending, declining rental prices, and that unexpected drop in services inflation last month. But a negative or zero monthly core CPI print was still quite unlikely.

Philip: [nodding] The historical data showed only a handful of instances where core CPI dropped to zero or below. Even with the deflationary pressures we saw building up, most indicators suggested continued mild inflation.

Nate: And that's exactly what happened. Another month of positive core inflation, just as our models predicted with 87.55% confidence.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Given the Fed's aggressive rate hikes through early 2024 and the cooling labor market we observed in July, our models gave a 32.45% probability of core CPI being 0.0% or negative in August.

Nate: [nodding] The data aligned perfectly with our forecasts. The steady decline in rental costs and the unexpected drop in medical care services prices weren't quite enough to push core inflation to zero or below.

Philip: The key signals were there – the resilient consumer spending and sticky wage growth we saw in the August 15th retail reports. Even with the housing market slowdown, service sector inflation remained too persistent for a complete flatline.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Shall we tackle next month's forecast?
