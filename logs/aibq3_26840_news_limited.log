**Tesla Q2 2024: Waves of Growth and Decline in the Electric Vehicle Market**
Tesla has released its Q2 2024 earnings report, showing a complex narrative of growth and challenges in the evolving electric vehicle market. While the company exceeded revenue expectations, reaching €23.76 billion with a 2% increase from the previous year, its auto sales experienced a 7% decline, reaching €18.54 billion. The decline, combined with a profit per share below Wall Street projections of 52 cents adjusted versus 62 cents expected, led to a substantial drop in post-market trading. Despite the decline in auto sales, Tesla cited 'record regulatory credits' as a contributing factor to its overall revenue growth. These credits, which are bought by other automakers struggling to meet emissions standards, tripled compared to the previous year, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by the industry in transitioning to cleaner technologies. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, used the earnings call to announce a rescheduled Robotaxi launch event for October 10, increasing expectations around the company's autonomous driving ambitions. However, questions about the timeline for the first Robotaxi ride were received with cautious optimism, as Musk recognized the potential for delays while expressing confidence in achieving this goal within the next year. The report also shed light on Tesla's profitability challenges, with its adjusted profit margin falling from 18.7% in Q2 2023 to 14.4% in Q2 2024. This decline was attributed to various factors, including price reductions, restructuring costs, and investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains optimistic about its future prospects, reporting strong growth in its energy generation and storage business, with revenue almost doubling compared to the same quarter last year. Additionally, Cybertruck production is increasing, with the company projecting profitability for this model by the end of the year.

**Tesla's push at Giga Shanghai 'indicates' good things out of China**
Tesla's Giga Shanghai production plant in China is running at full capacity, indicating stronger demand for vehicles. Analysts at Barclays believe this increased production capacity points to higher demand, which could lead to higher delivery levels in the second half of 2024. Tesla has delivered 830,766 cars in the first half of the year, putting it on pace for 1.6 million deliveries in 2024, a decline from 2023's 1.81 million deliveries. The company has noted that the development of its next-gen platform may lead to a lower growth rate in 2024 compared to 2023.

**Elon Musk Threatens to Destroy Bill Gates if He Bets Against Tesla**
Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, threatened to destroy Bill Gates if he bets against the electric vehicle manufacturer. Musk believes that Tesla's production of robots will increase its value to $30 trillion. He also mentioned that when Tesla solves the autonomy issue and starts mass-producing its Optimus robot, anyone who still has a short position will be destroyed, including Gates. The feud between Musk and Gates started in 2022 when Musk refused to support Gates' philanthropic project after leaked messages showed that Gates had bet $500 million against Tesla's stock price falling. Musk stated that he cannot take Gates' philanthropic efforts on climate change seriously when he has a large short position against Tesla, the company that is doing the most to address climate change. Tesla recently released its preliminary data for the 2nd quarter of 2024, showing a 14.8% increase in deliveries and a 4.8% decrease in sales compared to the same period last year. The company's stock price has been affected, and it has fallen 50 positions in the S&P 500 ranking and 50 positions in the reputation ranking in the US market in 2023, according to Axios. However, Tesla announced the production of a new robotaxi model in April and expects an increase in sales with the launch of low-cost models in 2025. The company's market capitalization has reached $100 billion in recent days.

**Tesla: Barclays Forecasts Slight Increase in Production Volume by 2026**
Barclays analysts predict a slight increase in Tesla's production volume by 2026, despite ongoing challenges, including reduced profit forecasts and pressure on sales and profit margins. The bank notes that Tesla's focus on autonomous driving and AI technology may raise questions about the company's ability to significantly increase earnings per share by 2030. Barclays recognizes that Tesla's main source of revenue is its primary vehicle production, with the energy division also contributing significantly.

Barclays notes a general slowdown in the electric vehicle market, which it describes as a 'grave slowdown in VE'. Despite Tesla's price reductions in the previous year, vehicle sales were weak, and 2024 is expected to record fewer sales than 2023, a scenario that investors did not previously consider probable. Analysts predict that Tesla will focus more on its non-automotive AI projects, such as the Optimus robot, but approach these projects with caution, emphasizing the need for tangible results before including them in their evaluation.

Tesla has reiterated its plans to produce new electric vehicles in the first half of 2025, including more affordable models.

**Tesla Reports Higher Revenue, Lower Profit in Q2**
Tesla reported a 2% increase in revenue to $25.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024, but saw a stronger-than-expected decline in profit per share to $0.52. Analysts had forecast a revenue decline to $24.5 billion and a less severe profit decline to $0.61 per share due to lower volumes and prices. Tesla delivered 444,000 vehicles in the quarter, with an average realized price of $42,500. The company expects growth in vehicle deliveries to be significantly lower in 2024 than in 2023 due to the launch of next-generation vehicles and other products. Tesla's plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, are still on track to enter production in the first half of 2025. The company believes that its approach, which uses existing production lines, will result in 'less cost savings than previously expected', but will enable it to grow volumes in a way that is 'more efficient in managing investments during uncertain times'. The stock fell about 2% after the earnings report.

**Tesla (TSLA) Q2 2024 earnings preview: what to expect today**
Tesla is set to release its Q2 2024 financial results on July 23, after the markets close. The company has already disclosed its vehicle delivery and production numbers, which show a 2% increase in deliveries and a 1% increase in production. Analysts are expecting a revenue of $24.380 billion, with Estimize predicting a higher revenue of $24.562 billion. The company's average price per vehicle is changing due to frequent price cuts and discounts, making it harder to estimate earnings.

The company will also provide updates and answer shareholder questions in its shareholder letter and conference call. Some of the most upvoted questions include when the robo-taxi event will take place, when the first robotaxi ride will be available, and the current status of 4680 battery cell production.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Strong, But What's To Come?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries were strong, but the company is still facing an electric vehicle (EV) demand problem. Despite a 42% one-month rally, Tesla's production and deliveries are set to decline in 2024. The company needs to report strong sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 to ease concerns. Energy storage was a bright spot, with a record 9.4 GWh in deployments, but its contribution to revenue and gross profit is not yet significant enough to drive a meaningful EPS beat. Tesla's margins are still under pressure, with automotive operating margin dropping to 5.5% in Q1 2024, and the company has provided no concrete guidance on how far margins will decline.

**Tesla's year-over-year deliveries decreased for the second quarter in a row**
Tesla has announced its Q2 figures, with 410,831 vehicles produced and 443,956 delivered. Production decreased by 20,000 units compared to Q1, but deliveries increased by 15%. However, year-over-year deliveries decreased by 4.8%. The company attributes the decline to the early production phase of the updated Model 3 and factory shutdowns due to shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin. Tesla also increased the price of every Model Y in the US by $1,000 on April 1, but its impact on Q2 financial results will be seen on July 23.

**Tesla: Barclays Forecasts Gradual Increase in Sales until 2026**
Analysts at Barclays have issued a warning that Tesla is facing ongoing challenges, including a decline in projected profits and difficulties affecting both sales and profit margins. The bank notes that profit per share expectations have decreased by approximately 50% in the past year and expects more challenges ahead. The decision to prioritize autonomous driving technology and artificial intelligence development over producing a more affordable car (Model 2) raises concerns about the company's ability to significantly increase profit per share by 2030. Barclays recognizes Tesla's car manufacturing as the main source of long-term revenue, with the energy sector also making a significant financial contribution. However, they consider the success of Tesla's autonomous driving initiatives unpredictable and do not include it in their evaluation of the company. The bank observes a general slowdown in the electric vehicle market, describing it as a 'severe slowdown in the electric vehicle market'. They highlight that growth in electric vehicles outside of China is much lower than expected. Despite Tesla reducing prices last year, sales were slow, and 2024 is expected to have fewer sales compared to 2023, a scenario that investors did not expect. Analysts predict that Tesla will focus more on its non-vehicle artificial intelligence projects, such as the Optimus robot. However, they are skeptical about these projects and require more tangible results before considering them in their evaluation of the company. Despite the underlying financial health and strategic uncertainties, Tesla's stock price has remained strong. Barclays predicts a gradual increase in sales until 2026, with the possibility of a more significant increase by the end of the decade, when Tesla may introduce its most affordable electric vehicle. The exact timing of this important introduction, however, is still unknown.
