**Putin Orders Russian Army to Expel Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his army to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. However, he has forbidden the withdrawal of troops from key areas on the Donbas front. According to sources, the Russian military has been instructed to clear the Kursk region by October 1, without redeploying troops from key areas such as Pokrovsk and Toretsk. The article states that Russia is currently attempting to redirect troops from various front lines to the Kursk region, except for Pokrovsk and Toretsk. This suggests that Russia has limited 'free' forces and reserves, and that their limited successes in the Donbas region are more important to them than regaining control of the Kursk region. Viktor Kevlyuk, an expert at the Centre for Defence Strategies, stated that the Russian military is 'smuggling' troops from the front line. Specifically, two brigades were removed from the Zaporizhzhia region, and two airborne assault battalions were removed from the Kherson direction. 'The 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which was previously stationed in the Kherson direction, and the 155th Marine Brigade, which fought near Vugledar, have been redeployed to the Kursk region. Even conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024 are being redeployed,' Kevlyuk said. The article notes that The Times reported in the fall of this year that the Ukrainian army's operation on Russian territory and the capture of many settlements would be a humiliation for the Russian army.

**Russia Orders Military to Expel Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1. According to sources, Putin has instructed the military to 'do whatever it takes' to liberate the region, but without withdrawing forces from key areas on the Donbas front. This includes the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions, where Russian forces have intensified their assault. In fact, Russia is now attempting to redirect 'a mix' of units from all front lines, except for Pokrovsk and Toretsk, to the Kursk region. This indicates that Russia has limited 'free' forces and reserves, and that their successes in Pokrovsk and Toretsk are more valuable to the Kremlin than regaining control of the Kursk region, as noted by an expert. Additionally, Russia is withdrawing troops from the front lines, including two brigades from the Zapорожsk direction and two dесantno-shurmovoy bатальоны from the Khersonsk direction. The 810th brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 155th brigade of the Marine Corps have been redeployed to the Kursk region, as well as conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024, according to Viktor Kevluk, an expert at the Center for Defense Strategies. 'It was a great day' for the Russian military, said no one, as they face a daunting task in liberating the Kursk region without compromising their positions on the Donbas front.

**Putin Orders Ukrainian Forces Out of Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to push Ukrainian forces out of the Kursk region by October 1, but not to withdraw troops from key areas on the Donbass front. According to a source in the military-political leadership, the occupying forces have been instructed to 'definitely' remove Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region, without withdrawing troops from key areas such as Pokrovsk and Toretsk. 'The enemy is pulling troops directly from the front line,' said Viktor Kevlyuk, an expert at the Center for Defense Strategies. 'They have taken two brigades from the Zaporizhzhia region, two desant-storm battalions from the Kherson direction, and even transferred servicemen on short-term service, called up in the spring of 2024.' Kevlyuk noted that the Russians are trying to send a 'mix' of units from all directions of the front, except for Pokrovsk and Toretsk, indicating that the enemy has few 'free' forces and reserves. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on August 19 that Ukrainian forces control over 1,250 square kilometers of territory and 92 settlements in the Kursk region. Ukrainian forces began their offensive in the Kursk region on August 6, taking control of dozens of settlements, including the city of Sudzhya.

**Putin Orders Withdrawal of Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to withdraw Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1, but not to reduce forces on key areas on the Donbas front. According to a report by RBC-Ukraine, 'Zone of Risk. What to Expect from the Ukrainian Army's Advance in the Kursk Region and How it Will Change the War', a military-political leadership source stated that the occupying forces received instructions from Putin to vacate the Kursk region by October 1. However, their task is to do so in any way possible, without withdrawing forces from key areas where Russia is advancing on Donbas, particularly the Pokrovsky and Toritsky directions. The source noted that the Russian advance on these directions has not slowed down, but rather intensified. In fact, the Russians are now trying to redirect units from all directions of the front, except for the Pokrovsky and Toritsky directions, to the Kursk region. This, in turn, suggests that the enemy has a limited number of 'free' forces and reserves available, and that the limited successes under Pokrovsky and Toritsky are a higher priority for the Kremlin than regaining control over the Kursk region. As reported by the expert of the Center for Defense Strategies, Viktor Kevlyuk, 'The enemy is now mobilizing troops directly from the front line. Specifically, two brigades were taken from the Zaporozyhia region, two airborne assault battalions were taken from the Kherson direction, and the 810th brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which was previously stationed in the Kherson direction, and the 155th Marine Brigade, which fought under Vugledar, were redeployed to the Kursk region. Even conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024 are being redeployed.' It is worth noting that as of August 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that our forces control over 1,250 square kilometers of enemy territory and 92 populated areas in the Kursk region.

**Russia Counterattacks Under Kursk, Ukraine's Operation May Be Decisive**
Western analysts believe that the next few months will be crucial. Experts think that the Ukrainian forces are unlikely to want to hold all the territories they have captured. Since August 2024, Ukraine has been conducting active offensive operations in the direction of Kursk, using not only national forces but also equipment provided by Western partners, particularly the UK. This includes the use of Challenger 2 tanks, which has caused a significant reaction from Russia. However, analysts believe that the threat of nuclear escalation, often emphasized by the Kremlin, is currently exaggerated. According to The Times, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested that the invasion was intended to facilitate future peace negotiations on Ukrainian terms, but no one thinks that negotiations are possible before spring and, likely, not before autumn 2025. Political commentator Tim Shipman notes, 'So what did Zelensky think? The answer is partly political, partly military.' Michael Clarke, a leading British defense analyst, stated that 'this is a classic military counterattack that tries to ease pressure in other places,' particularly on the Donbas. However, if Kyiv hoped that Moscow would immediately withdraw its troops from Ukraine to regain the Kursk foothold, Russian generals seem to have instead used the absence of four top Ukrainian regiments to advance in the Pokrovsk and Chasov Yar areas, according to the British publication. Military experts believe that the next few months may be decisive. According to analysts, Russia is preparing a counterattack under Kursk, which may begin by the end of October, before winter. Specialists agree that the Ukrainians will not want to try to hold all the captured positions. The Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region is currently a success for Zelensky and a shame for Russian military, writes The Times. Russia has already lost over 15,000 units of armored vehicles and 6,000 tanks, and is forced to use outdated models, such as the T-54, which were scrapped over 40 years ago. Western analysts agree that the success or failure of the Ukrainian operation under Kursk may significantly affect the further course of the war. At the same time, the unity of Western countries in supporting Ukraine remains important, which will be a key factor in countering Russian aggression. Tim Shipman notes that the only British weapon that has not yet been used on Russian territory is also the most powerful - the Storm Shadow. Since this cruise missile is a joint project, its use also requires the consent of the US and France (where the missiles are called Scalp), which fear escalation in relations with Russia. As President Vladimir Zelensky stated on August 17, the operation in the Kursk region is continuing as planned by Ukraine.

**Several Factors Could Undermine Russia's Resolve to Continue Attack on Donbas**
Despite the Ukrainian military's success in the Kursk region, there are no signs of a Russian withdrawal from the Donbas region, but several factors could undermine Moscow's resolve to continue the attack, writes the British newspaper The Telegraph. Firstly, if Ukraine continues to be successful in the Kursk region, Russia may be forced to withdraw more troops from occupied territories, potentially weakening their defensive positions and allowing Ukrainian drones to strike further away, further undermining Russian capabilities for a distant attack. 'Secondly, Ukrainian brigades currently undergoing training may be deployed to reinforce either the Kursk region or the Donets region, depending on where Russian forces show signs of weakness. Such flexibility may allow Kyiv to launch a counterattack in 2025, rather than just another attack on occupied Donbas,' writes The Telegraph. The newspaper also notes that Ukraine's destruction of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the accelerated dismantling of Russia's air defense network in occupied Crimea have forced Russian forces on the peninsula to go on the defensive. 'Although a conventional attack to retake Crimea may seem ambitious, redeploying Russian troops to reinforce Donbas and Kursk may open the door to secret Ukrainian operations on the peninsula,' writes the newspaper. The success of the Kursk operation may not depend on the withdrawal of Russian troops, but if it continues to put Moscow in an uncomfortable position and disrupt logistics, Russian forces will be forced to respond, which will ultimately undermine their operations in Donbas. However, this will not happen quickly, and Ukraine may still need to strengthen its southeastern front. The situation remains very fluid, the journalists conclude.

**Three Conditions for Ukraine's Counterattack in 2025**
According to The Telegraph, citing military analysts, Ukraine may be able to launch a counterattack in the Donetsk region in 2025, but three conditions need to be met. The first condition is for Ukraine's forces to continue advancing in the Kursk region, which would force Russia to withdraw from occupied territories and weaken its defensive positions. The second condition is for Ukrainian brigades, currently undergoing training, to be deployed in the Kursk and Donetsk regions, taking into account the weaknesses of Russian defenses. The third condition is for Ukraine to launch a counterattack in Crimea, which would be a logical continuation of the destruction of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Military experts believe that partisan attacks are intensifying, and Ukrainian intelligence predicts that Crimea will be the next target, with the Kerch Strait Bridge, a frequent target of Ukrainian sabotage, likely to be destroyed soon, as said, 'by Ukrainian intelligence'.

**Ukraine May Launch Counterattack in 2025: Three Conditions Must Be Met**
According to The Telegraph, Ukraine may go on the counterattack in 2025, but three conditions must be met. Firstly, if Ukraine continues to succeed in the Kursk region, Russia may be forced to withdraw more troops from occupied territories, potentially weakening their defensive positions. This could expand the range of Ukrainian drones, further weakening Russia's ability to attack over long distances. Secondly, Ukrainian brigades currently undergoing training may be deployed to strengthen the Kursk or Donetsk direction, depending on where Russian forces show signs of weakness. This flexibility could allow Ukraine to launch a counterattack in 2025, rather than just conducting another strike on occupied Donbass. Thirdly, an attack on Crimea. Ukraine's destruction of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, accelerated dismantling of Russian air defenses in Crimea, and activation of the partisan movement have already led to Russian forces on the peninsula going on the defensive. Therefore, the next likely target is Crimea, and the Kerch Strait Bridge, which has already been the target of several Ukrainian sabotage operations, is likely to be destroyed soon. The Telegraph notes that while an Ukrainian advance to retake Crimea appears ambitious, the redeployment of Russian troops to reinforce Donbass and Kursk may open the door for increased Ukrainian covert operations on the peninsula. As reported by OBOZ.UA: Russia has redeployed some units from Chasov Yar to Kursk. Such maneuvers by the occupiers may affect the tempo of Russian offensive operations in the Donetsk region, but the consequences will not be felt until several weeks later. On August 20, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Alexander Syrskyi, reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces had captured at least 93 settlements during the advance in the Kursk region. Ukraine controls over 1,260 square kilometers of territory of the aggressor country. American retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges believes that the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation has revealed some significant weaknesses both in the Russian army and in the ODKB of the aggressor state.

**Russian General Lapin 'Helped' Ukrainian Army in Kursk Region**
Russian General Alexander Lapin has been involved in another scandal during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the fall of 2022, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov strongly criticized Lapin for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Liman and the breakthrough of the Ukrainian army on the Donetsk front. In the spring of 2024, Lapin disbanded the interagency council responsible for defending border regions, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing a source in Russian security services. In August, the Ukrainian army broke through the Russian defense and occupied part of the Kursk region. Before the Ukrainian operation, Lapin's command warned Moscow that the Ukrainian army was increasing its numbers on the front line, but this warning was ignored. As a result, Ukrainian troops did not meet resistance on neutral territory near the border, and inside Russia, there were no territorial defense forces that could slow down their advance. Additionally, the Ukrainian army cut off communication, and Russian troops were unable to contact their command and became scattered in the forest. Lapin's forces, despite having intelligence on the Ukrainian army's movements, failed to strengthen defensive lines or set up mines, as the Russian army did in 2023 to repel a large Ukrainian counterattack. Furthermore, Russian troops faced a critical shortage of personnel. The Wall Street Journal notes that not only Lapin, but also the Russian military leadership, often disconnected from the realities of the battlefield, 'opened the gates' for the Ukrainian advance. 'This is not the first time that Lapin's army has faced poor planning and a lack of personnel. In the fall of 2022, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov strongly criticized Lapin, first for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Liman, and then for the breakthrough of the Ukrainian army on the Donetsk front. Kadyrov called Lapin 'ineffective' and stated that the general did not provide mobilized soldiers with ammunition and communication, while he himself 'sat' in Lugansk. At the time, Lapin was commander of the Central Military District. In November, he was removed from his position, but in January 2023, he was appointed head of the Main Staff of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Russia. In May 2024, Lapin took over as commander of the Leningrad Military District, created two months earlier.

**The Telegraph Predicts Ukrainian Counterattack in 2025**
The Telegraph has predicted that the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed soon and that the Ukrainian military will launch a counterattack in 2025. The Ukrainian military's recent successes in the Kursk region have put Russian forces in a vulnerable position in Crimea. The Telegraph suggests that Ukrainian brigades currently undergoing training may be deployed to reinforce Ukrainian forces in Donetsk or Kursk, depending on where the enemy shows weakness. This flexibility could give Ukraine the opportunity to launch a counterattack in 2025. According to the article, if the Ukrainian military continues to achieve success in the Kursk region, Russia may be forced to withdraw more troops from occupied Ukrainian territories. This could expand the range of Ukrainian drone strikes, further undermining Russia's ability to launch long-range attacks. The article also highlights the vulnerability of Russian forces in occupied Crimea, which have been weakened by successful Ukrainian attacks on the Russian Black Sea Fleet and air defense systems. 'Partisan attacks are increasing, and Ukrainian intelligence suggests that the next target will be Crimea', the article states. Analysts believe that the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed soon, and that the withdrawal of Russian troops to respond to events in the Kursk region could create an opportunity for Ukraine to expand its operations on the peninsula. 'The success of the advance on the Kursk salient may not depend on the diversion of Russian forces, but if it continues to harass Moscow and disrupt supply lines, Russian forces will be forced to respond, which will ultimately undermine their operations in Donbas. However, this will not happen overnight, and Ukraine may still need to strengthen its southeastern front', the analysts conclude.

**Russia Advances in Kursk Region, Ukraine's Plan to Ease Pressure on Donbass at Risk**
The situation in Ukraine is becoming increasingly complex as Russia advances in the Kursk region. The Ukrainian army has been pushing back, but the Russian forces have been making gains. President Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops to push the Ukrainian forces out of the Kursk region by October 1, but not to withdraw from the key areas of the Donbass. If Russia succeeds, Kiev's plan to ease pressure on the Donbass will fail. The city of Pokrovsk, a crucial hub for Ukrainian logistics, is at risk of falling. The residents are being evacuated, and the situation is becoming increasingly dire. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to his allies to provide him with long-range weapons to counter the Russian advance. The situation is precarious, and the outcome is uncertain. 'We have lost everything,' said Sasha, a 70-year-old resident of the village of Bilopillja, near the Russian border. 'We are simple farmers, we used to work in Russia, but now we can't. The prices are high, and we have less money than before.' The village is under attack, and the residents are suffering. 'We don't know how things are going in Kursk,' said Vidivev. 'We know only that it's worse than before, and maybe there will be a forced evacuation from this side.' The situation is tense, and the future is uncertain.

**Russian Army Faces Challenges in Expelling Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region**
Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, expressed doubts that the Russian army can expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1. 'If we continue to develop our positions west and east of the current area, and we are doing so seriously, it will be difficult for Putin to do this... We have combat units with combat experience, while Putin has units he has brought from other directions to counter this. Now he needs to redeploy combat units that can oppose ours and throw them into battle,' Kostenko said at a briefing on Wednesday. He added that much will depend on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 'If we can cause them such losses that they cannot continue to advance, they will undoubtedly have to bring in reserves,' Kostenko noted, emphasizing that such reserves can be redeployed from active combat zones (east and south). Kostenko also stated that the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region of Russia is affecting the entire theater of operations. 'In the Kursk operation, several tasks were set, some of which were completed, some not. But one of them was to force the enemy to redeploy their troops. And what do we see? The enemy is indeed redeploying some of their troops. We know about the 200th brigade from the Kramatorsk direction, we know about the 80th from the Dnepropetrovsk direction... They are redeploying, but they have a fundamental position - not to withdraw troops from the Pokrovsk direction. This is a strategic direction for them. And now we see that, even understanding that they do not have reserves to retake Kursk, and we continue to advance, they still bet on the territory of Donetsk,' Kostenko said.

**Ukrainian Forces in Kursk Region: A Challenge to Russian Army's Plans**
Roman Kostenko, the Secretary of the parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, expressed doubts that the Russian army will be able to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1. 'If we continue to operate at the same pace and intensity, and we are doing it seriously, building up positions to the west and east, it will be difficult for Putin to do this... We have combat units with combat experience, while Putin has units he has brought from different directions just to stop us. Now he needs to withdraw combat units that can counter ours and throw them into battle,' Kostenko said at a briefing on Wednesday. According to him, much will depend on the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

**Ukrainian Military Units Withdrawn from Kursk Region**
According to General Apty Alaudinov, the Deputy Head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff, some Ukrainian military units are being withdrawn from the Kursk region. Alaudinov stated, 'A part of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are being withdrawn from the Kursk region.' He believes that these units could be redeployed to other areas. Alaudinov also mentioned that Russian forces have information about possible future actions by the Ukrainian military, saying, 'We have two areas that we assume will be the direction of the attack.' This is a reversal of Alaudinov's previous statement on August 21, 2024, when he said that Russia was pushing Ukrainian forces back into the Kursk region.

**Russia Advances in Donbás and Sends More Forces to Kursk**
Russia is pushing forward in the Donbás region and sending more forces to Kursk. The Russian Defense Ministry reported that the troops of the Central Military Group eliminated a large contingent of Ukrainian forces defending New York, a city of 3,000 inhabitants (over 10,000 before the war), according to the Russian Defense Ministry's daily report. The Russian military command highlighted that New York (Novgoróskoye for the Russians) is one of the most important localities and 'an important logistics hub' in the vicinity of the city of Toretsk, which has become a stronghold for Kiev's troops. Russia is seeking to break through and open the way to Kostiantinivka, a city located just 12 kilometers away, which would allow access to Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, the largest strongholds in Donetsk, annexed by Russia in September 2022. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, 17 civilians have been killed and over 140 injured due to the Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to expel Ukrainian forces from Kursk before October 1, but without withdrawing troops from sectors where the Russian army is advancing in the Donetsk region. 'In fact, the Russians are trying to send units from the entire first line, except from the sectors of Pokrovsk and Toretsk,' emphasizes the RCB-Ukraine portal, which suggests that this may indicate that the Russian army does not have enough reserves. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski has claimed that the operation in Kursk was not necessary if Ukraine's foreign partners had lifted all restrictions on the use of their long-range weapons against Russia. He also emphasized that the success of Ukraine's armed forces has exposed the 'naivety' of the idea of 'red lines' with regard to Russia. Zelenski has asked Ukrainian diplomats to intensify their efforts to convince their partners, especially the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, to allow the use of their long-range weapons against military targets in the deep rear of Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region of Russia by October 1, according to a source in the Ukrainian military-political leadership cited by 'RBC-Ukraine'. The task for the Russians is to do this at all costs, without withdrawing forces from key areas where Russia is advancing in the Donbass, said the source. This refers primarily to the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions, where the occupiers' advance has not slowed down, but rather intensified, as stated in the publication. In fact, the Russians are now trying to redirect 'a mix' of units from all directions of the front, except for the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions, writes 'RBC-Ukraine'. This, in turn, indicates that the enemy currently has few 'free' forces and reserves, and that limited successes under Pokrovsk and Toretsk are more important to the Kremlin than regaining control over the Kursk region, as noted in the material. 'The enemy is pulling troops directly from the front line. Specifically, two brigades were taken from the Zaporizhzhia region, two assault-storming battalions were taken from reserve from the Kherson direction. The 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which previously fought on the Kherson direction, and the 155th Marine Brigade, which fought under Ugledar, ended up in the Kursk region. Even conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024 are being redeployed,' said Viktor Kevluk, an expert at the Center for Defense Strategies.

**Putin Sets Deadline for Russian Military to Retake Kursk Region**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has set a deadline for the Russian military to retake control of the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces by October 1, 2024. According to sources, Putin has instructed the Russian military to use 'a mix' of troops from different units to defend the region, but with the condition that they cannot withdraw main forces and reserves from the front line. The Ukrainian military, on the other hand, aims to force the Russians to divert their forces from the hottest areas on the Donbas front. 'Our opponent is a fetishist and fatalist. They need a victory at any cost,' said Viktor Kevlyuk, an expert at the Center for Defense Strategies. The Ukrainian military has identified five possible directions for their attack: Sudzha-Kursk via the R200 road, Sudzha-Lgov via the highway, Sudzha-Rylsk via the road, Sudzha-Plekhovo-Boriky near the road to Belytsia, and Sudzha-Glushkovsky district in the Kursk region. The nearest possible goal is to take control of the territory south of the Sudzha river in the Glushkovsky district and the triangle of Sudzha-Rylsk-Cheremoshna, where the E38 and R200 roads intersect.

**Putin Orders Russian Army to Expel Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his army to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. However, he has forbidden the withdrawal of troops from key areas on the Donbas front. According to sources, the Russian military has been instructed to clear the Kursk region by October 1, without redeploying troops from key areas such as Pokrovsk and Toretsk. The article states that Russia is currently attempting to redirect troops from various front lines to the Kursk region, except for Pokrovsk and Toretsk. This suggests that Russia has limited 'free' forces and reserves, and that their limited successes in the Donbas region are more important to them than regaining control of the Kursk region. Viktor Kevlyuk, an expert at the Centre for Defence Strategies, stated that the Russian military is 'smuggling' troops from the front line. Specifically, two brigades were removed from the Zaporizhzhia region, and two airborne assault battalions were removed from the Kherson direction. 'The 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which was previously stationed in the Kherson direction, and the 155th Marine Brigade, which fought near Vugledar, have been redeployed to the Kursk region. Even conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024 are being redeployed,' Kevlyuk said. The article notes that The Times reported in the fall of this year that the Ukrainian army's operation on Russian territory and the capture of many settlements would be a humiliation for the Russian army.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his army to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1. However, he has forbidden his troops from leaving key positions in the Donbas region, particularly in the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions.

According to Viktor Kevliuk, a Ukrainian defense expert at the Center for Defense Strategies, 'the enemy is now withdrawing troops directly from the front. Specifically, two brigades have been recalled from the Zaporizhzhia region, while two amphibious assault battalions have been mobilized from reservists stationed in the Kherson region. In the Kursk region, the 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which was in the Kherson sector, and the 155th Brigade of the Navy, which was fighting near Vuhledar, ended up in the Kursk region. Even the conscripts called up in the spring of 2024 have been reassigned.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated yesterday that the Ukrainian Armed Forces currently control over 1,250 square kilometers of enemy territory and 92 settlements in the Kursk region.

**Putin Orders Retake of Kursk Region by October 1, but Fails to Withdraw Troops from Donetsk**
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has ordered the military to retake control of the Kursk region by October 1, according to military sources. However, the Russian forces are not to withdraw troops from key areas in the Donetsk region, where their offensive is ongoing. Instead, they plan to create a 'mix' of their units from various regions, excluding the two mentioned areas. For example, they have transferred two brigades from the Zaporizhzhia region and two stormtrooper battalions from the Kherson region to the Kursk region. This includes the 810th brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 155th brigade of the Marine Corps, as well as conscripts called up in the spring of 2024. This suggests that Russia lacks sufficient free forces and reserves, and that their successes in the Donetsk region are more important to Putin than controlling the Kursk region. Currently, Ukraine controls 92 settlements and over 1,250 square kilometers of territory in the Kursk region.

**Putin Orders Retake of Kursk Region by October 1, But Lacks Sufficient Forces**
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has ordered the military leadership to retake control of the Kursk region by October 1, according to military-political leadership sources. However, to achieve this, Russian forces must not withdraw troops from key areas in the Donetsk region, where their advance is ongoing. Currently, Russian forces are attempting to create a 'mix' of their units from various areas, excluding two specific ones. For example, they have taken two brigades from the Zaporizhzhia region and two airborne assault battalions from the Kherson region. As a result, the 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 155th Marine Brigade have been stationed in the border area, along with conscripts called up in the spring of 2024. This indicates that Russia lacks sufficient free forces and reserves, and that their successes in the Donetsk region are more important to Putin than regaining control of the Kursk region. As of August 19, Ukraine controls 92 settlements and over 1,250 square kilometers of territory in the Kursk region.

**Russia's Kursk Region Conundrum: Weakening Grouping in Ukraine**
Russia will have to weaken its grouping in Ukraine in order to maintain control over the Kursk region. Currently, up to 15,000 Russian troops are stationed in the region, with 6,000 being reinforcements sent from the combat zone in Ukraine. The uncontrolled territory in the Kursk region is approximately 1,300 square kilometers, requiring a minimum of 30,000 troops to stabilize the front line. However, the territory is expanding, and by the end of August, Russia will need to deploy up to 40,000 troops to stabilize the area. If Russia were to withdraw from a portion of the Kursk region and focus on a specific front line, it could potentially concentrate up to 50,000 troops by the end of October, allowing for not only stabilization but also counterattacks. The question remains, however, where Russia would obtain the necessary 50,000 troops, as each withdrawal from Ukraine is becoming increasingly difficult. As seen on the Pokrovsky front, Russian forces have only advanced 2-3 kilometers in a week, while Ukrainian forces have made similar progress in a day.

**Putin Orders Withdrawal of Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to withdraw Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1, but not to reduce forces on key areas on the Donbas front. According to a report by RBC-Ukraine, 'Zone of Risk. What to Expect from the Ukrainian Army's Advance in the Kursk Region and How it Will Change the War', a military-political leadership source stated that the occupying forces received instructions from Putin to vacate the Kursk region by October 1. However, their task is to do so in any way possible, without withdrawing forces from key areas where Russia is advancing on Donbas, particularly the Pokrovsky and Toritsky directions. The source noted that the Russian advance on these directions has not slowed down, but rather intensified. In fact, the Russians are now trying to redirect units from all directions of the front, except for the Pokrovsky and Toritsky directions, to the Kursk region. This, in turn, suggests that the enemy has a limited number of 'free' forces and reserves available, and that the limited successes under Pokrovsky and Toritsky are a higher priority for the Kremlin than regaining control over the Kursk region. As reported by the expert of the Center for Defense Strategies, Viktor Kevlyuk, 'The enemy is now mobilizing troops directly from the front line. Specifically, two brigades were taken from the Zaporozyhia region, two airborne assault battalions were taken from the Kherson direction, and the 810th brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which was previously stationed in the Kherson direction, and the 155th Marine Brigade, which fought under Vugledar, were redeployed to the Kursk region.

**Kursk Operation: Military Expert's Grim Assessment**
According to military expert Ivan Stupak, the recent operation in the Kursk region has not led to a significant withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory. 'Yes, they are gathering in small groups, in small batches. The Russian General Staff is not idiots, they understand our plan - how to outmaneuver, deceive, and make the Russians withdraw their forces. Unfortunately, it's not happening on a large scale yet,' he said. Stupak noted that there are conflicting reports about a possible redeployment of Russian forces from the Kharkiv direction, but the situation remains unclear. He also described the situation on the Pokrovsk direction, saying that the number of Russian forces is 'in dozens of times more than in Soledar in 2022-2023, much worse. They are indeed moving in incredible numbers, in groups of 5-10 people, without stopping, 24/7 with KABs. The KABs have a range of 200-250 meters, and they are firing in large quantities, making it impossible to lift your head.' The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported 63 combat clashes on this direction in the past day, with three still ongoing. Ukrainian forces are inflicting losses on the Russians, but they continue to put pressure.

**Ukraine Launches Cross-Border Operation in Kursk Region, Russia Demands Withdrawal**
Ukraine's military launched an unexpected operation in the Kursk region on August 6, taking control of certain areas since then. This is the largest cross-border operation undertaken by Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022. According to Ukrainian President Zelensky, the goal of this operation is to intensify pressure on Russia during peace negotiations and establish a secure zone. However, Russian President Putin has demanded Ukraine's withdrawal from four occupied regions and renunciation of NATO membership. Kremlin advisor Ushakov stated that the Ukrainian operation has pushed the likelihood of peace talks further away, adding that negotiations depend on the situation on the battlefield, including in the Kursk region. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Ukraine on Friday for talks with Zelensky, a move that has sparked concern given India's close ties with Russia. Modi has expressed his desire to end the conflict. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities have ordered the evacuation of families with children from the strategic city of Pokrovsk, while four deaths have been reported due to Russian attacks in frontline zones. Zelensky has claimed that Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region are achieving their objectives, stating, 'This morning, we added to our national exchange fund.' The Ukraine has also destroyed two key bridges on the Russian Sejm river to block Moscow's supply routes to the combat zone, with a third bridge being targeted over the weekend, according to a Russian military investigator in a video published by pro-Kremlin commentator Vladimir Solovyov.

**Monday, August 19, 2024 E-Paper**
Ukrainian forces have made significant gains in their incursion into Russia, capturing the town of Sudzha and pushing deep into Russian territory. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the town is 'fully under his troops' control.' The operation has led to the evacuation of over 120,000 civilians and the capture of at least 100 Russian troops. While the incursion has been seen as a major morale boost for Ukraine, it has not yet dented Russia's overall strategic advantage. The full scope of the Kursk operation remains unclear, including how long Ukraine plans to hold Russian territory and to what end. Ukrainian officials have said that diverting Russian reserves from the main battlegrounds in eastern Ukraine is a minimum aim of the operation, but Moscow has shown no signs of withdrawing significant numbers of troops. Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine will establish a command office in Sudzha to coordinate aid and military affairs, suggesting that Ukraine may plan to remain in the Kursk region long-term. 'It is widely seen as a major morale boost for a country and an army struggling to fend off steady Russian advances more than two years after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine,' said an AP journalist. 'But, so far, it has not dented Russia's overall strategic advantage.'

**Russia Withdraws Troops from Ukraine, But Faces Larger Challenge Ahead**
Russia has reportedly withdrawn up to 5,000 troops from Ukraine in an attempt to halt the advance of Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. According to The Wall Street Journal, citing Ukrainian and Western officials, one brigade was withdrawn from the Donetsk region, the center of the Russian advance, while other units were pulled from less critical areas. However, sources indicate that Russia will need to withdraw even more troops in the future if it hopes to retake its own territory. 'Such a goal would require more forces than are currently available to Kyiv,' said a source. 'It's likely that over 20,000 well-trained personnel would be needed.' Western military estimates suggest that Ukraine has deployed around 6,000 soldiers to the Kursk region, as well as 4,000 personnel for auxiliary tasks in the Sumy region. To avoid weakening the front line, a significant portion of the troops were drawn from a reserve formed with Western support for operations in 2024 and 2025. 'To push the Ukrainians out, Russia would need to send even more troops, and wipe entire cities and villages off the face of the earth with artillery fire, as it has done on a large part of Ukraine,' said a source. Ukrainian forces have reportedly captured around 2,000 Russian soldiers and seized approximately the same amount of territory as Russia has retaken from Ukraine since the beginning of 2024, according to a high-ranking official in Kyiv.

**Russia May Attempt to Retake Kursk Region by End of October, Analysts Say**
Analysts believe that Russia may attempt to retake territory in the Kursk region, which is currently controlled by Ukrainian forces, by the end of October. According to The Times, Western analysts agree that Ukraine will not try to hold all the positions they have taken, and that Russia will likely launch a counterattack in the region. 'It is expected that Russia will counterattack under Kursk by the end of October. Western analysts agree that the Ukrainians will not want to try to hold all the positions they have taken,' the article states. The operation in the Kursk region has been a success for Ukraine and a failure for Russia, with Russian forces losing 15,000 units of armored equipment and 6,000 tanks in a matter of weeks, and being forced to deploy 70-year-old T-54 tanks, which were retired over 40 years ago.

**Ukraine ‘heading for partial ceasefire talks' before Kursk offensive**
Ukraine's surprise invasion of Russia's Kursk region has derailed potential partial ceasefire talks between the two nations. The talks, set to be mediated by Qatari officials in Doha, were intended to halt attacks on energy infrastructure. However, Russia's delegation postponed the meeting after Ukraine's troops stormed into its territory, describing it as an 'escalation'. Russia's foreign ministry has denied any direct or indirect negotiations, but Ukraine's presidential office says the talks will still take place via video link on August 22. The postponement has put added pressure on Ukraine's incursion into Russia, which officials believe was intended to give Ukraine more leverage in future negotiations. Military analysts have expressed skepticism that Ukraine can maintain its gains, while Russia continues to push forward in the Donetsk region. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said he would only consider a ceasefire if Russia withdrew all its troops from Ukrainian land, including the Crimean Peninsula.

**Spoutnik Obtains Documents on Ukrainian Attack on Kursk Region**
According to documents obtained by Spoutnik, the Ukrainian attack on the Russian region of Kursk used armored cars provided by NATO countries before the attack. The documents, seized by the Russian Navy's 810th Brigade, reveal that a Ford F-559 armored car, used by Ukraine's 82nd Air Assault Brigade, was registered on July 26, 2024, and passed its first technical inspection on July 27, 2024, just 10 days before the attack. The car's shipping documents show that it left for its mission on August 7, 2024, and its Ukrainian military certificate is valid until August 16, 2024. This comes after a Ukrainian tank column, armed with NATO-provided armored vehicles, was destroyed by Russian forces in Kursk on August 6, 2024. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the Ukrainian attack as 'provocative', while Russian General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov stated that the operation in Kursk will be completed with the defeat and expulsion of the enemy from Russian territory. A 'counter-terrorism operation' has been declared in Kursk and neighboring regions of Belgorod and Bryansk to ensure public safety and counter the threat of Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance units.

**Russia May Attempt to Retake Territory in Kursk Region**
The Russian army may attempt to retake the territory in the Kursk region that was captured by Ukrainian forces, according to The Times. The operation by the Ukrainian military in the Kursk region has been a success, but the Russians may try to launch a counterattack by the end of October. 'It is expected that Russia will counterattack near Kursk before the onset of winter in late October,' the article states. 'Western analysts agree that the Ukrainians will not want to try to hold all the positions they have captured.' Regardless of the outcome, the operation has been a triumph for Ukraine and a humiliation for Russia, which has lost 15,000 units of armored equipment and 6,000 tanks in just a few weeks, and has been forced to deploy old T-54 tanks, a 70-year-old model that was retired over 40 years ago. 'It is a shame that the international community has not been able to find a way to stop the war,' said a source, 'but it is a good sign that the parties are willing to negotiate.'

**Russia May Retake Kursk in October 2024**
Ukraine has successfully launched an operation in the Kursk region, taking control of a part of the Russian region. Western analysts believe that Russia will try to retake the area by the end of October. According to The Times, 'Russia is expected to counterattack near Kursk before the onset of winter in late October.' The operation is a 'triumph for Ukraine and a disgrace for the 'second army of the world,' which has lost 15,000 armored vehicles and 6,000 tanks. Former British Defense Secretary Shapps emphasized, 'A democratic country invaded by its autocratic neighbor is a disaster not only for that nation, but for the whole world. Therefore, democracies must stop at nothing to ensure the victory of freedom.' The Ukrainian Armed Forces are approaching the key artery of the region, and the most active fighting is taking place in the Hlushkiv district, where several thousand Russian troops are surrounded.

**Russia Counterattacks Under Kursk, Ukraine's Operation May Be Decisive**
Western analysts believe that the next few months will be crucial. Experts think that the Ukrainian forces are unlikely to want to hold all the territories they have captured. Since August 2024, Ukraine has been conducting active offensive operations in the direction of Kursk, using not only national forces but also equipment provided by Western partners, particularly the UK. This includes the use of Challenger 2 tanks, which has caused a significant reaction from Russia. However, analysts believe that the threat of nuclear escalation, often emphasized by the Kremlin, is currently exaggerated. According to The Times, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested that the invasion was intended to facilitate future peace negotiations on Ukrainian terms, but no one thinks that negotiations are possible before spring and, likely, not before autumn 2025. Political commentator Tim Shipman notes, 'So what did Zelensky think? The answer is partly political, partly military.' Michael Clarke, a leading British defense analyst, stated that 'this is a classic military counterattack that tries to ease pressure in other places,' particularly on the Donbas. However, if Kyiv hoped that Moscow would immediately withdraw its troops from Ukraine to regain the Kursk foothold, Russian generals seem to have instead used the absence of four top Ukrainian regiments to advance in the Pokrovsk and Chasov Yar areas, according to the British publication. Military experts believe that the next few months may be decisive. According to analysts, Russia is preparing a counterattack under Kursk, which may begin by the end of October, before winter. Specialists agree that the Ukrainians will not want to try to hold all the captured positions. The Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region is currently a success for Zelensky and a shame for Russian military, writes The Times. Russia has already lost over 15,000 units of armored vehicles and 6,000 tanks, and is forced to use outdated models, such as the T-54, which were scrapped over 40 years ago. Western analysts agree that the success or failure of the Ukrainian operation under Kursk may significantly affect the further course of the war. At the same time, the unity of Western countries in supporting Ukraine remains important, which will be a key factor in countering Russian aggression. Tim Shipman notes that the only British weapon that has not yet been used on Russian territory is also the most powerful - the Storm Shadow. Since this cruise missile is a joint project, its use also requires the consent of the US and France (where the missiles are called Scalp), which fear escalation in relations with Russia. As President Vladimir Zelensky stated on August 17, the operation in the Kursk region is continuing as planned by Ukraine.

**Russia Counterattacks in Kursk, Ukraine's Success in the Region a 'Shame' for Russian Soldiers**
Western analysts believe that the next few months will be decisive in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Experts think that the Ukrainian military will not want to hold onto all the territory they have captured. Since August 2024, Ukraine has been conducting active offensive operations towards Kursk, using both national forces and equipment provided by Western partners, including the UK. This has included the use of Challenger 2 tanks, which has caused a significant reaction from Russia. However, analysts believe that the threat of nuclear escalation, often emphasized by the Kremlin, is currently exaggerated. According to The Times, 'What is President Zelensky thinking?

Michael Clarke, a leading British defense analyst, stated that 'this is a classic military counterattack that aims to relieve pressure elsewhere, particularly in Donbas.' However, if Kyiv had hoped that Moscow would immediately withdraw its troops from Ukraine to regain the Kursk foothold, Russian generals seem to have instead taken advantage of the absence of four better Ukrainian regiments to advance in the Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar areas, according to the British publication. Military experts believe that the next few months may be decisive. Analysts estimate that Russia is preparing a counterattack under Kursk, which could begin by the end of October, before winter.

**Russia May Counterattack in Kursk Region by Late October**
The Ukrainian military continues to operate in the Kursk region of Russia, but Western analysts believe that they will not hold all the occupied territories. According to The Sunday Times, Russia may counterattack in late October. The article states, 'It's a success for Zelensky and a shame for the Russian military, which has already lost 15,000 armored vehicles and 6,000 tanks and has been forced to use old T-54 tanks, a 70-year-old model that was retired over 40 years ago.' The British government is trying to strengthen support for Ukraine, with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other high-ranking officials advocating for providing aid to Ukraine. As reported by The Telegraph, former British Home Secretary Grant Shapps stated, 'Democracies should stop at nothing to ensure the victory of freedom. We cannot simply hope that Ukraine will defeat Russia, we must also provide the means.'

**Ukraine's Losses in Kursk Region 'Much Lower' Than in 2023 Counterattack, WSJ Reports**
According to The Wall Street Journal, Ukraine may have lost dozens of units of armored equipment in the nine-day operation in the Kursk region of Russia. However, the human losses are unknown, but a military officer from the 44th brigade stated that they are 'much lower' than during the 2023 counterattack. To avoid weakening the front line, Ukraine has sent mostly reserve troops, formed with Western support for operations in 2024 and 2025, to the Kursk region. Western military estimates suggest that Ukraine has deployed around 6,000 troops to the Kursk region and an additional 4,000 to the Sumy region for supporting tasks. In contrast, Russia has withdrawn several under-strength brigades, approximately 5,000 troops, from Ukraine, with one brigade operating in the Donetsk region and others on less critical fronts. Analysts believe that Russia will need to withdraw more troops to regain territory, requiring over 20,000 professional military personnel, according to a source. Meanwhile, satellite images show that Russia is hastily digging anti-tank ditches and other fortifications about 50 kilometers from the border. The Ukrainian military's operation in the Kursk region is the main goal, with President Volodymyr Zelensky confirming the operation on August 12, aiming to liberate border territories from Russian forces that have regularly shelled the Sumy region. As of August 16, the Ukrainian military has advanced 1-3 kilometers and taken control of the village of Borok in the Kursk region, according to DeepState.

**Will Putin Withdraw Troops from Donbas to Save Kursk?**
Ukraine has taken a risky step by diverting military forces to the Kursk region of Russia, while Russia has not yet withdrawn its forces from the Donbas region, despite the fact that the situation is becoming increasingly difficult for the Russians. According to Der Spiegel, the Kursk operation is a result of 'the bravery of desperation' and the Ukrainian government hopes that Moscow will be forced to weaken its pressure on eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Pokrovsk region. The authors of the article consider the risk of the operation to be high, as it has diverted forces that could have strengthened the defense in the Donbas region, particularly under Pokrovsk. The Russians, according to the publication, have made significant territorial gains since the spring, approaching the city to within 10 km. As a result, the head of the Pokrovsk military administration has already called on residents to evacuate. There is also a Russian advance in the direction of Toretsk, where reconnaissance units have been spotted. The village of New York in the suburb has been occupied by Russians to the tune of 80%. The Ukrainian government has decided to take a risky operation on the territory of the enemy in order to ease the task of defenders of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. 'We cannot afford to stand still and fight according to Russian rules. I only hope that we also have a plan for further actions, depending on the expected reaction of the enemy and taking into account all the risks,' said Kiev military analyst Nikolai Beleskov. However, it seems that the calculation that Moscow will withdraw its forces from Donbas to protect Kursk has not yet worked: Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is not in a hurry to transfer troops to defend Russian territory. According to former Ukrainian Defense Minister Andrei Zagorodnyuk, there is still hope that the withdrawal will occur, possibly before the end of the fall, while the weather conditions are still favorable for conducting military operations. 'Every day of delay will make it more difficult to liberate the territories, this was a bitter lesson that we, Ukrainians, had to learn,' said Zagorodnyuk in an interview with journalists.

**Ukraine's High-Risk Gamble: Will Russia Withdraw from Donetsk Region?**
Ukraine has redeployed military units to the Kursk region, which are urgently needed on the front lines, while Russia is not planning to weaken its forces in the Donetsk region, according to Der Spiegel. This move is considered a high-risk gamble by Ukrainian defense officials, who say that the 'courage of desperation' has prompted Kiev to take this step. 'Since the spring, Russian forces have achieved significant territorial gains in the direction of the city of Pokrovsk,' reports the media. 'Yesterday, the head of the administration of Pokrovsk called for evacuation, stating that the enemy is just 10 kilometers from the outskirts of the city.' The occupiers are also advancing on Toretsk, where the first reconnaissance units have appeared, and have already captured 80% of New York. Local officials hope that the situation in the Kursk region will force Russia to withdraw its forces from the eastern theater of operations, otherwise the catastrophe will continue. 'We cannot afford to stand still and fight according to Russian rules,' says Kiev military analyst Nikolai Beleskov. 'I only hope that we also have a plan for further action, depending on the expected reaction of the enemy and taking into account all the risks.' Former Defense Minister Andrei Zagorodnyuk believes that Russia will eventually withdraw its forces from the Donetsk region, and will do so before the end of autumn and the worsening of the weather conditions. 'Each day of delay will only make it harder to liberate the territories, this was a bitter lesson that we, Ukrainians, had to learn,' he added.

**Ukraine's Withdrawal from Kursk Region to Weaken Position Before US Elections**
Kiev political analyst Ruslan Bortnik believes that Ukraine's withdrawal from the Kursk region will weaken the country's position before the US presidential elections. According to Bortnik, 'This will mean that we have lost significant reserves, the most combat-capable and high-quality ones, we have not achieved a political effect, and during the high phase of the American elections, we will enter a situation where Russia is advancing, even more weakened, with worse prospects.' Bortnik considers the start of hostilities in the Kursk region a very risky move by Kiev, which has put everything at stake. On August 6, Ukrainian forces attempted to capture a territory in the Sudzhansky district of the Kursk region, but were stopped by Russian forces, according to General Valery Gerasimov, who reported to President Vladimir Putin. Gerasimov stated that the operation will end with the defeat of the enemy and the exit to the state border.

**Ukrainian Incursion into Russia Sends Important Messages**
The Ukrainian military's incursion into the Kursk region of Russia has sent important messages to the Russians, the Ukrainian people, and Western allies. The incursion, which began on August 6, 2024, has not been reduced and has resulted in the evacuation of 121,000 civilians to the Moscow region by Russian authorities. The Ukrainians have advanced over 30 kilometers and taken dozens of Russian prisoners, even deploying engineering equipment to fortify the conquered territory. Ukrainian officials have been brief in their statements, with General Syrsky saying, 'We continue to advance!' in contrast to the emotional language used by Russian officials, who have condemned the 'provocation' as 'crimes' that will not go unpunished. The Kremlin has launched an 'anti-terrorist' plan, but the author argues that this is simply a war, and that the Russians have forgotten that they initiated it with their large-scale military aggression on February 24, 2022. The incursion has tactically allowed the Ukrainians to relieve their front in the Donbass by forcing the Russians to withdraw soldiers to reinforce the Kursk region. Strategically, it has sent powerful messages to the three key audiences for Ukraine: the Ukrainian people, the Russians, and Western allies. The author argues that the incursion has boosted the morale of the Ukrainian people and soldiers, and has shown that the Ukrainian government is capable of initiative and inventiveness. It has also shown the Russians that their idea of a 'comfortable war' that spares Russian civilians is not possible, and has given Western allies a sense of the effectiveness of their military aid to Ukraine. The author concludes that the incursion has been a success, and that it has sent a message to the Russians that they should be prepared for negotiations, and that the Ukrainians are not defeated.

**Ukraine's Kursk Offensive: Experts Predict Three Possible Scenarios**
Ukraine's surprise offensive in the Russian region of Kursk has resulted in the control of 28 settlements, with 1000 square kilometers of territory gained. Experts predict three possible scenarios for the further course of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict. The least likely scenario is a further Ukrainian advance within the Kursk region. 'The Ukraine will continue its advance in Kursk,' explained military analyst Andrew Perpetua on social media platform X (Twitter). Reports of a halt to the offensive are 'FSB propaganda,' according to independent expert Andrew Perpetua. The second scenario is that Ukraine will fortify its positions to hold onto the territory it has gained. 'This is the riskiest option, as Ukrainian positions have several small outposts that could be easily cut off,' explained Australian military expert Mick Ryan from the 'Lowly Institute' in Sydney. The third and most likely scenario is a sudden Ukrainian withdrawal as soon as Russia redeploys its air force and artillery. 'It could be sensible for Ukraine to withdraw from the area as soon as Russia reorients its air force and artillery,' said a German military expert. The most favorable scenario for Ukraine would be a sovereign and undefeated withdrawal from Russia, allowing it to maximize the political and strategic benefits of the operation and retain a large stock of experienced combat troops for future operations in 2024 and 2025.

**Ukraine's Operation in Kursk Region: A Complex and Unclear Goal**
A source in the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told The Economist that Russia is withdrawing forces from the Kharkiv direction to the Kursk region, but 'not as quickly as we would like'. The ultimate goal of the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region remains unclear, but the minimum goal is to push Russian forces off the front lines in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. According to a preliminary assessment, the results of this operation are 'unconvincing', writes The Economist, citing a source in the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 'Their commanders are not idiots. They are moving forces, but not as quickly as we would like. They know that we cannot stretch our logistics over 80 or 100 kilometers,' says the source. The Economist notes that Russia has redeployed some forces from the Kharkiv direction, but has withdrawn much fewer troops from the front in the Donbas region. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian operation has significantly boosted the morale of the Ukrainian army. According to Ukrainian military, they are proud of their progress, despite losses and injuries. A source in the Ukrainian Security Service tells The Economist that by August 10, some Ukrainian units had advanced 40 kilometers into Russian territory towards Kursk. However, the source in the General Staff warns against comparing this operation with the successful counterattack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces under Kharkiv in late 2022. 'The danger is that we will get caught and Russia will wear us down,' says the source. The Ukrainian Armed Forces began their operation in the Kursk region on August 6, breaking through the border in the Sudzhansky district and then actively advancing on neighboring territories. The Russian Ministry of Defense claims that Russian forces are 'suppressing attempts to break through' by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The ultimate goal of the operation remains unclear, with a high-ranking Ukrainian official telling AFP that Ukraine has 'no plans' to annex the occupied territories, but rather to stretch Russian positions and destabilize the situation in the country, showing the weakness of the border defense.

**Ukraine Launches Major Cross-Border Counterattack Against Russia**
Ukraine launched a major cross-border counterattack against Russia, with clashes reported between the two sides in the Kursk region. According to reports, Ukrainian forces advanced at least 20 kilometers into the region, with the Russian Defense Ministry stating that they had sent additional troops, tanks, and artillery to the area to push back the Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the advance on Russian territory, saying that the conflict had become a 'battle for the borders' and that Ukraine was exerting pressure on the 'aggressive' side. The Kremlin declared a federal emergency in the region, with 76,000 people evacuated. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with government officials to discuss the situation in Kursk, saying that 'there are very important questions about the fight against terrorism' on the agenda. Putin also announced that 'operations to combat terrorism' would be launched in the cities of Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk. This comes after Putin stated in February 2022 that the Minsk agreements were no longer in effect. Ukraine and Russia had held peace talks in Istanbul in March 2022, but Ukraine later withdrew from the talks. In October 2022, Zelensky signed a decree banning any peace talks with Russia as long as Putin was in power. Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, when it annexed Crimea, and later supported separatist rebels in the Donbas region. In February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, citing the need to 'liberate' the country from 'Nazis'.

**Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Warns of Video-Fake Circulating Online**
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) has warned about a video-fake circulating online, supposedly featuring a statement from Maria Zakharova, a representative of the ministry, saying that Russia is willing to transfer the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZAPES) to Ukraine in exchange for the voluntary withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region. However, the MID has stated that this is a fake, created by splicing together footage from a July 18, 2024, briefing by Zakharova. The MID has urged citizens to be cautious and not trust information from unverified sources, and to verify information through official channels. This is not the first time that Ukraine has spread fake videos, including one featuring a fake statement from the acting governor of Kursk, Alexei Smirnov, and false reports from the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS) about evacuations from the region.

**Ukraine Learns from 2023 Counterattack, Says Military Officer Egor Firssov**
According to Egor Firssov, a military officer, Ukraine has learned from the failed counterattack in 2023. He believes that the careful planning of the Kursk operation took a lot of time, and that he hopes the defenders who launched the attack on this sector followed the plan. Firssov also praised the regime of silence still maintained by Ukrainian leadership. 'I think that the whole story of Kursk is our silence and silence until the operation. The lessons of the 2023 counterattack have been learned,' Firssov said. He also suggested that the situation on the Russian front will force the occupiers to withdraw forces from the Donetsk region, reducing pressure there. 'I think that our senior command had a plan to distract the enemy, to make him focus not only on Donetsk, but also on Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, and on their territory in the Kursk region, where I am convinced that the enemy was not prepared for this,' Firssov explained. The occupiers may sacrifice units prepared for a counterattack in the north of Kharkiv region instead of withdrawing forces from the east of Ukraine.

**European Gas Jumps to Fresh 2024 High With Ukraine Flows at Risk**
European natural gas prices have risen to a fresh 2024 high due to concerns over possible disruptions to Russian fuel crossing Ukraine. Benchmark futures have rallied for a third day, trading above €39 a megawatt-hour, after intense fighting in Russia's Kursk region. James Waddell, head of European gas and global LNG at Energy Aspects Ltd, warned that cutting gas flows immediately would result in a significant loss of supply, cutting into end-October stocks. He added that while it may be possible to get through the coming winter without running low on storage, refilling to an adequate level in 2025 would be difficult. Russian gas flows via Ukraine are set to remain normal on Friday, but the transit agreement between the two nations expires at the end of the year, and European officials are holding talks to try to keep gas coming through the pipeline after the deal expires.
