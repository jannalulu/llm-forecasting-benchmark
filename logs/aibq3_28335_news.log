Alice Walton, the Walmart heiress, has reclaimed the title of the world's wealthiest woman, surpassing L'Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, according to Forbes. Walton's estimated worth is $89.1 billion, while Meyers' is $88.4 billion. This marks the first time since 2022 that Walton has held the top spot.

She has focused on philanthropy, pouring over $5.7 billion into five family charitable foundations, and has also ramped up her personal philanthropy, spending over $377 million on acquiring and loaning out American art to over 230 museums across the country. 'Despite selling more than $22 billion of Walmart stock over the past decade, Sam Walton's heirs still own nearly 46 percent of the firm their father founded,' Forbes reports.

Alice Walton, the daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton, has reclaimed the title of the richest woman in the world, according to Forbes. At 74 years old, she has an estimated net worth of $89.1 billion, surpassing Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who has an estimated fortune of $88.4 billion.

**The Daily Money: Look out for falling interest rates**
The Federal Reserve is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years, but consumers shouldn't expect to see a significant difference. Analysts say the cut, which could be a quarter- or half-percentage point, will have little immediate impact. Meanwhile, Alice Walton, the daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton, has reclaimed her title as the world's richest woman with an estimated $89.1 billion fortune. Additionally, a recent study by Ladders found that remote and hybrid jobs paying at least $250,000 annually have plummeted by 95% and 60%, respectively, as companies return to in-office work.

**Walton Family Surpasses $100 Billion in Wealth for the First Time**
The Walton family has surpassed $100 billion in wealth for the first time, according to Bloomberg's billionaire index. Jim Walton, 76, the son of founder Sam Walton, leads the way with a net worth of $102.6 billion, followed closely by his brother Rob, 79, with a net worth of $100.4 billion.

Rob Walton made headlines in 2022 by purchasing the Denver Broncos for $4.65 billion, while the family has also invested in redeveloping their hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, into an arts and sports complex. Walmart's stock has risen 53% this year, driven by the company's e-commerce growth and efforts to attract more middle-class customers. The stock has reached an all-time high of $80.60 per share, but has not changed much on Monday's trading in New York. None of the three heirs are involved in the day-to-day operations of the company or sit on Walmart's board of directors, with Rob Walton having retired earlier this year and Jim Walton serving as the head of the Arvest Bank Group, a regional lender with over 260 branches in three states. Alice Walton, a passionate art collector, recently surpassed L'Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers to become the world's richest woman.

**Alice Walton Overtakes Françoise Bettencourt Meyers as World's Richest Woman**
Alice Walton, the 74-year-old daughter of Walmart's founder, has surpassed Françoise Bettencourt Meyers as the world's richest woman, according to Forbes. Her net worth is estimated at $89.1 billion, a slight decrease of $5 billion from Bettencourt Meyers' $84.4 billion. Walton's rise to the top is attributed to the surge in Walmart's stock price, which has increased from $53 in January to $77 in September. In contrast, L'Oréal's stock price has declined by 15%, from €443 to €378. As both women's fortunes are largely based on the number of shares they hold in their respective companies, Walmart's success has contributed to Walton's ascension to the top spot. 'The company's reputation as a low-cost distributor has helped it increase sales, especially in 2024 with inflation,' said Forbes. Walton, who has a background in finance and art, now ranks 21st in the global list of richest people, two places behind her brother Rob Walton.

**Alice Walton: The Woman Behind the Walmart Fortune**
Alice Walton, the daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton, has regained her title as the world's richest woman after the recent surge in Walmart's stock value. With an estimated fortune of $89.1 billion, she surpassed L'Oréal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who held the top spot since 2022. Walton's wealth growth was driven by Walmart's impressive 47% increase in stock value in 2023. Despite selling over $22 billion in Walmart shares and donating over $11 billion to charitable causes, Alice's participation in the retail giant remains significant. Her personal fortune, although immense, is still surpassed by that of her brothers Jim and Rob Walton, who are also part of the influential Walton family in the United States. Alice has built her legacy through her passion for art and philanthropy, particularly in education and health. She founded the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in 2011, which houses one of the most important collections of American art, and has donated over $5.7 billion to various family and personal foundations in the last decade. Her latest project, the Whole Health Institute and the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, aims to transform the approach to medicine in the US, promoting a more holistic view of health that combines physical and emotional well-being. Alice has maintained a strategic distance from the direct management of Walmart, focusing on her personal projects, which sets her apart from her brothers Jim and Rob, who have been key figures in the company's direction for decades.

**Three Walmart Heirs About to Reach $100 Billion Each - Their Combined Wealth Will Surpass Elon Musk's Net Worth**
The three surviving children of Sam Walton, Jim, Rob, and Alice, are on the verge of reaching a combined net worth of $100 billion each, surpassing Elon Musk's net worth. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, their combined wealth is currently $293 billion, $54 billion more than Musk's $239 billion. Their fortunes have grown by over $26 billion since January, thanks to Walmart's stock price soaring by 47% this year. As one financial analyst noted, 'If these trends continue, we could soon see three members of the same family in the $100 billion club.' The Walton siblings owe their fortunes to Walmart shares passed on by their father, with each sibling owning roughly 12% of the firm through a family trust. They have amassed more than $15 billion each through sales and dividends on the stock. The entire Walton family's fortune totals more than $340 billion, exceeding the market value of some of the world's largest companies.

**The Walton Family: Heirs to the Walmart Fortune**
The Walton family, heirs to the Walmart fortune, have a combined net worth of approximately $229 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. The family's foundation supports education, environmental causes, and their hometown community. Despite their vast wealth, the Waltons are known to be modest in their public appearances. The family's patriarch, Sam Walton, founded Walmart in 1962 and established a family trust to manage the company's assets after his death. His children, including Rob, Jim, and Alice, have taken on various roles within the company, with some pursuing their personal passions. Rob Walton, the eldest child, has been involved in several high-profile business ventures, including a failed bid to buy the Denver Broncos. He has also been the subject of protests outside his Arizona home, where demonstrators have called for better wages and benefits for Walmart employees.

**Alice Walton's Fortune Surpasses María Asunción Aramburuzabala's by USD 82.8 Billion**
Alice Walton, the 74-year-old daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton, has an estimated fortune of USD 89.1 billion, according to Forbes, surpassing Bettencourt Meyers' estimated USD 88.4 billion. Walton ranks 18th among the world's richest people, just behind her brother Rob Walton. In contrast, María Asunción Aramburuzabala, Mexico's richest woman, has a fortune of USD 6.3 billion, making her USD 82.8 billion poorer than Walton. Aramburuzabala is a heiress to Grupo Modelo and the head of Abilia and Tresalia. Walton's fortune comes from her participation in Walmart, but she has not been actively involved in the company's management. Instead, she has dedicated her life to art and philanthropy, including founding the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in 2011. She has also supported various initiatives through the Walton Family Foundation, focusing on education, environment, and community development.

**Walmart Surpasses Amazon in Stock Market, Making Alice Walton the Richest Woman in the World**
Walmart has outperformed Amazon in the stock market this year, with its shares reaching historic highs and increasing by 47% in the past year. This has made Alice Walton, the daughter of Walmart's founder Sam Walton, the richest woman in the world with a net worth of $89 billion. Walton surpassed the heiress of L'Oréal, Francois Bettencourt, who had previously held the title of the richest woman in the world with a net worth of $100 billion, but has since been reduced to $88 billion. Walmart's success in the stock market has also made Alice Walton the 18th richest person in the world, according to Forbes, behind her brother Bob. Alice has recently sold shares worth around $700 million, a move that is not unexpected given that the Walton family has sold shares worth $22 billion over the past 10 years. Despite this, the Walton family still owns nearly 46% of the company through the re-purchase of shares. Alice has also increased her philanthropic activities in the past 10 years, donating over $5.7 billion to five family foundations.

The remaining fortune belongs to the heirs of her brother John Walton, who passed away in 2005: his widow, Christy Walton, and his son, Lukas Walton, who have fortunes of $16.4 billion and $33.9 billion, respectively. Alice Walton worked briefly at Walmart as a children's clothing buyer after graduating from Trinity University in Texas in 1971. She then turned to art curation.

**Wealth of Ultra-High Net Worth Families to Increase by 73% by 2030**
The wealth of ultra-high net worth families, controlled by family offices, is expected to increase by 73% by 2030, from $5.5 trillion to $9.5 trillion, according to a report by Deloitte. Family offices, which manage the assets of wealthy families, are catching up with hedge funds in terms of size, notes Bloomberg. It is expected that the number of investment firms for the wealthy will increase by a third to 10,720 by the same period. Large family offices are increasingly acting as activist investors. According to Deloitte's report, the average family office has 15 employees managing assets worth $2 billion, reports Bloomberg. The collapse of Archegos Capital Management, a family office of billionaire Bill Hwang, in 2020, which resulted in losses of $20 billion, has highlighted the risks of unregulated family offices. Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo were able to avoid losses by quickly liquidating their positions related to Archegos, but other banks, such as Nomura and Credit Suisse, suffered massive losses. Hwang was found guilty of fraud and market manipulation in July this year. As Bloomberg notes, family offices have long evaded rules applied to other investment companies. Regulators and lawmakers have turned a blind eye, doubting that the wealth of one family could be significant for the broader market. The Archegos case has proven them wrong, leaving losses of $10 billion and contributing to the collapse of Credit Suisse, notes the agency. In December last year, the Bloomberg ranking of the world's richest families for the first time topped the list of the ruling dynasty of sheikhs and emirs of Abu Dhabi Al Nahyan with a wealth of $305 billion. The Walton family, which has been at the top of the list for four years, came second with a wealth of $259.7 billion, and the Hermès family, owners of the French fashion house, came third with a wealth of $150.9 billion.

Alice Walton has dedicated herself to philanthropy and the arts, and has invested over $5.7 billion in five family foundations, which have distributed over $1.1 billion to various causes.

**The Walmart heirs are worth $330 billion. Sam Walton's smart move in the 1950s is a big reason why.**
The Walton family's net worth of over $330 billion can be attributed to a smart move by Walmart founder Sam Walton in the 1950s. He structured the company as a family partnership, giving 20% stakes to each of his four children, while he and his wife kept the final 20%. This allowed them to avoid paying substantial gift or inheritance taxes, as Walton wrote in his autobiography, 'Sam Walton: Made in America.' He passed down 80% of Walmart to his kids when it was worth little, saving them billions in estate taxes. This decision also ensured the family maintained control of Walmart and taught his children financial prudence. As a result, his three surviving children now command net worths of nearly $100 billion each, with the majority of their wealth still in Walmart stock in the family trust.
