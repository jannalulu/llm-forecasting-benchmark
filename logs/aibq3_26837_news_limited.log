**Katy Perry Is Already Moving On From Her Flop Single**
Katy Perry's comeback single 'Woman's World' has underperformed, peaking at No. 63 on the Hot 100 chart and falling off the ranking entirely. Despite still being promoted to radio, the single has slipped on the Pop Airplay and Adult Pop Airplay tallies. Perry is already moving on to her next single, 'Lifetimes', which is set to drop on August 9. The quick pivot suggests that Perry and her team have accepted that the public isn't interested in 'Woman's World', and are hoping that 'Lifetimes' will perform better.

**Katy Perry's 'Woman's World' Fails to Crack Top 10 and Debuts at No. 63 on Billboard Chart**
Katy Perry's comeback single 'Woman's World' has failed to crack the top 10 and debuted at No. 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The song's performance on streaming services was also relatively low, landing at No. 110 on Spotify's U.S.-based chart and No. 58 on the Spotify global chart. Perry's last solo Hot 100 hit was in 2020 with 'Daisies', and her last chart-dominating numbers came through 'Witness', where its lead single 'Chained To the Rhythm' broke through at No. 4 on the Hot 100. The song's music video, which features Perry dressing up as sexy Rosie the Riveter and women replacing men in a recreation of the historic Lunch atop a Skyscraper photo, has been criticized for its use of common feminist tropes. Perry explained that the video is meant to be 'slapstick and very on the nose', and that it's a 'reset' for her and her idea of feminine divine. The song is part of Perry's upcoming album '143', which is set to arrive on September 20.

**Katy Perry's 'Woman's World' Fails to Make an Impact**
Katy Perry's return to music has not gone as planned. Two weeks after its release, her song 'Woman's World' has already been removed from the Billboard Hot 100 chart. For a pop artist of her caliber, this is a monumental failure. The song initially debuted at a disappointing 63rd position, before disappearing from the chart on August 3, 2024. Critics have been divided, with some being harsh. 'Is Katy Perry's comeback song the worst in history?' even suggested Rolling Stone. The song, an attempt at a feminist anthem, is not even among the top 100 songs on iTunes Canada. Clearly, the 39-year-old California artist is struggling to recapture the magic of her early days. Her debut single 'I Kissed a Girl' in 2008 marked the beginning of a nine-song streak that topped the Hot 100 chart. Since then, she has accumulated disappointments, with only 'Chained to the Rhythm' reaching 4th place in 2017. She will try again on August 9 with the release of 'Lifetimes', the second single from her upcoming album '143'.

**Katy Perry's 'Woman's World' Fails to Impress on Charts**
Katy Perry's new single 'Woman's World' failed to impress on the charts, debuting at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song, a pop-dance track with empowering lyrics, received mixed reviews, with some critics calling it a 'vintage bubblegum pop' formula and others praising its message. The music video also sparked controversy, with some criticizing a scene where Katy is crushed by a weight. Katy explained the concept on Instagram, saying they were 'having fun, being a bit sarcastic, it's very silly, physical comedy... We're exaggerating, because I'm about to be crushed, which is like a restart, a restart for me and a restart for my idea of female divinity, and it's a completely different world after this.' The album 143, which will be released on September 20, has not yet announced a second single.

**Katy Perry's widely mocked single ‘Woman's World' lands painfully low chart debut**
Katy Perry's latest single, 'Woman's World', has debuted at No 63 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, receiving a lukewarm response. The song's lyrics and music video have been widely criticized, with some calling them 'faux-feminist pastiche' and 'alarmingly antiquated'. Perry has responded to the backlash, claiming the video was intended to be sarcastic and suggesting that her messaging will become clearer in the weeks to come. The song's production was handled by Dr Luke, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by Kesha. Perry has faced criticism for collaborating with him, with some calling it a 'problematic' move. The singer has also endorsed Democrat frontrunner Kamala Harris, sharing a video of herself singing a few bars from 'Woman's World' and captioning it 'It's a woman's world, and you're lucky to be living in it'.
