*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, a chart of the North Atlantic's sea surface temperature projected behind them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—did the Atlantic surpass 2023's record before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 75.32%. Given the record heat streak and the unusual warmth in the tropical Atlantic, it seemed likely.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. Even with data only up to July, the probabilities were strong. The streak ending in April didn’t deter the momentum.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The temperatures stayed high through late June, consistently above the 1982-2011 mean.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a stark reminder of the changing climate dynamics. Our models were spot on.

*They both nod, contemplating the implications.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Time to update the forecasts for next year. The oceans are unpredictable, but our models are ready.

*They turn back to their screens, the chart still glowing behind them.*

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered around them. A large screen behind them shows the Atlantic Ocean's temperature chart.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the data is in. The Atlantic's temperature did not surpass 2023's record before October 1st.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 47.89%. The streak of record highs finally broke after 421 days, but the Atlantic held steady thereafter.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating. Despite the intense heat earlier this year, the probability of surpassing last year's peak was never above 50%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The tropical Atlantic's heat was remarkable, but the models accounted for other cooling factors. It’s a testament to the precision of our forecasting methods.

The camera zooms out, showing the bustling newsroom as the segment ends.
