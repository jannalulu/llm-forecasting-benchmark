**OpenAI's releasing a new AI model soon, and there's a lot at stake**
OpenAI is set to release its new AI model, GPT-5, which has high expectations from users and investors. The model is expected to perform 'agentic actions,' such as booking a trip instead of just providing a trip itinerary, and seamlessly work across audio, video, and text. However, some experts believe the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5 will be smaller than expected, comparing it to going from undergrad to a PhD program. OpenAI has a lot riding on GPT-5, including its ability to attract more customers and increase revenue, which could surpass $8 billion this year. The company also faces scrutiny over its safety and potential risks, particularly with the launch of SearchGPT, a direct competitor to Google's Search. 3 things in markets: The bull market is expected to last well into 2025, with slight market corrections expected but a low risk of a new bear market. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon believes interest rate cuts could happen, citing a shift in consumer behavior in the face of inflation. Inside Blackstone's summer internship program, which is 10 times harder to get than a first-year analyst job at Harvard. 3 things in tech: Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang have become close, with billions of dollars in deals and an increasingly tied future. The collapse of a Microsoft AI deal is a warning sign for companies hoping their AI products will catch on with consumers. The networking queen of New York City's tech and venture scene, Alexa von Tobel, is a superconnector of high-powered people. 3 things in business: A leaked document gives a rare look inside Amazon's projected finances for its healthcare business, which is expected to lose over $1 billion in 2024 but improve from last year. Starbucks has changed the way it runs its cafes, which could turn things around for the company and customers. Apple and Meta report earnings, with investors focusing on AI-investment returns and the recently delayed Apple Intelligence and iPhone's lagging performance in China.

**US IPO Market to Slow After Lineage, With Quiet Summer Ahead**
The US initial public offering (IPO) market is expected to slow down after the recent busy period, with a quiet summer ahead. The $6.1 billion worth of IPO activity in the US last week was the busiest since December 2021, led by Lineage Inc.'s $4.4 billion first-time share sale and OneStream Inc.'s $490 million offering. However, there are no sizable IPOs scheduled until after Labor Day, and bankers predict a more muted IPO activity through August. The market is expected to pick up in September and October, ahead of potential volatility due to the US presidential election. If IPOs slow down, companies' follow-on offerings and investors' secondaries sales will likely take center stage.

**Apple Gives Developers a First Look at Its AI Features**
Apple has given developers a first look at its artificial intelligence (AI) features, which were expected to be released in September. The company announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-powered features for apps, including Siri and Safari, at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The features will be integrated into iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, but the release has been pushed back to October. Apple is allowing developers to test the features for stability and errors. The preview includes improvements to Siri's responses, the ability to understand less clear commands, and AI-generated summaries for native apps like Mail and News. The Bank of America expects the iPhone cycle to remain strong, as the AI feature sets (software and possibly hardware) on the C25-iPhone (iPhone 17) improve. The company's partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT-4o into its operating systems will help Apple catch up with its competitors Google and Microsoft.

**Apple Delays Artificial Intelligence Feature**
Apple announced its partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, to introduce 'Apple Intelligence' at WWDC 2024. However, according to Bloomberg News, the artificial intelligence feature has been delayed. Sources close to the matter stated that the AI features will not be available on the new iPhones released in September and will instead be released as a software update in October. Mark Gurman, a Bloomberg Apple writer, stated that Apple wants to give Apple Intelligence a bit more time to focus on bug fixes and improving the company's stability. Gurman also claimed that Apple Intelligence will be part of iOS 18.1, meaning that iPhone 16 series users will get the AI features a few weeks after the release of the new phones.

**Apple Secures Seat on OpenAI Board, Potentially Bad News for Microsoft**
Apple has recently secured a seat on the OpenAI board, which is likely bad news for Microsoft. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been quiet about AI, while competitors have been innovating in the emerging market for generative artificial intelligence. However, Apple's delay is not a sign of weakness, but rather a strategic move. According to Bloomberg, Apple has secured a 'observer' seat on the OpenAI board, which will be taken over by Apple's App Store chief Phil Schiller later this year. This move is part of Apple's deal to install OpenAI's ChatGPT on its devices. Microsoft, on the other hand, received a non-voting seat on the OpenAI board in November 2023. The tech giants' seats on the board allow them to gain insights from OpenAI's decision-making processes, although they do not have control over these decisions. Apple and Microsoft have been rivaling each other in the AI market, with Microsoft's massive push in AI last year helping it surpass Apple's market capitalization for the first time since 2021. Apple has now caught up and is only slightly behind Microsoft in terms of market capitalization. Apple's ChatGPT deal and its seat on the OpenAI board are not the only signs of its potential AI dominance. The company is expected to announce future partnerships with Google and other AI chatbot developers, and is working on its own AI tools, such as 'Apple Intelligence', which includes improvements to the Siri speech assistant and other features.

**Apple Secures Seat on OpenAI Board, Potentially Bad News for Microsoft**
Apple has acquired a seat on the OpenAI board of directors, which may be bad news for Microsoft. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, has been quiet on AI, while rivals have been innovating in the field. However, Apple's delay is not a sign of weakness, as it has just secured a seat on the OpenAI board, which will be filled by Phil Schiller, Apple's App Store chief, later this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, obtained its seat on the OpenAI board without voting rights in November 2023. The partnership between Apple and OpenAI will allow Apple to learn from OpenAI's decision-making processes, although neither company has control over these decisions. The rivalry between Apple and Microsoft has been intense in recent years, with Microsoft's AI advancements helping it surpass Apple's market capitalization in January. Apple has since caught up and is now just a hair's breadth behind Microsoft in terms of market capitalization. Apple's partnership with OpenAI is not the only sign of its potential dominance in AI, as it is also working on its own AI tools, including 'Apple Intelligence', and is expected to announce future partnerships with Google and other chatbot creators. However, this development has raised concerns about the growing entanglement between AI startups and Big Tech, which has sparked antitrust worries. Experts and former employees have expressed concerns about the lack of surveillance and transparency, which poses serious risks to society, as there is currently no substantial regulation in the AI field, leading to issues such as the proliferation of disinformation and exacerbation of inequalities.

Reddit's stock has risen 15% and 11% on news of the earnings report and partnership, respectively. The company's social media site is attracting a growing and loyal user base, and the opportunity presented by AI looks appealing. Given its impressive gains and bright future, Reddit stock is a buy.

**Northern Data AG plans $16 billion IPO in the US**
Northern Data AG, a German-based company, is planning to list its combined business units of KI-Cloud Computing and data centers on the US-based Nasdaq stock exchange. The company's valuation could reach up to $16 billion, according to Bloomberg News. Northern Data, a provider of high-performance computing infrastructure, plans to list its combined unit, consisting of the cloud computing segment Taiga and the data centers segment Ardent, in the first half of next year. Banks have suggested valuations ranging from $10 to $16 billion, highlighting the enormous growth potential and strong market interest in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. The US IPO market has picked up pace after a slow 2023, driven by investors' renewed interest in listings, fueled by hopes for a stable economic development and growing demands for advanced technology. KI-based startups have attracted significant investments, partly driven by the success of ChatGPT from OpenAI. Technology giants like Microsoft and Alphabet have already invested billions in the necessary infrastructure for KI applications. According to Bloomberg, Northern Data may also sell a minority stake in the combined unit to investors before the IPO, but it remains unclear whether the company will pursue its current plans or not.

Additionally, AI chip developer Cerebras Systems has filed confidentially for an initial public offering, and other AI-related companies have gone public this year. Public investors are showing interest in AI technology, and it's possible that AI may lead the charge in the M&A and IPO markets.

**Report: OpenAI Could Become a For-Profit Business**
OpenAI, a nonprofit company, is considering a change to its governance, potentially making it a for-profit company, according to a report. The company's CEO, Sam Altman, has told some shareholders that the firm is weighing a change to its governance, which would give the nonprofit board no control over the company. This move could set the stage for an initial public offering (IPO) and give Altman the chance to take a stake in the company. OpenAI has doubled its annualized revenue in the last six months and is expanding its lobbying department to navigate regulatory oversight. The company is also teaming with Apple to incorporate AI into its devices. 'We are not approaching this from a perspective of we just need to get in there and quash regulations … because we don't have a goal of maximizing profit; we have a goal of making sure that AGI benefits all of humanity,' said Anna Makanju, OpenAI's vice president of government affairs.

**OpenAI to Go Commercial, CEO Sam Altman Confirms**
OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman plans to make the company commercial, according to The Information, citing a source. Currently, one of the leaders in AI development has a non-profit status, similar to a US non-profit organization. This change would allow the company to conduct an IPO. Microsoft, the company's main investor, is likely pushing for monetization of the developed technologies, says Roman Dushkin, director of 'A-Я эксперт'. 'It's hard to say what's brewing at OpenAI. But the main shareholder is Microsoft, one of the richest companies in the world, which invests in OpenAI to make it profitable.' Sam Altman is known for his authoritarian and strict management style, and it's possible that he prioritizes commercial profit. OpenAI has been providing access to its models for free, building a user base, and now users will likely pay for access to these services. It's difficult to resist the use of large language models for hyper-automation of activities. As for the potential IPO, it's hard to predict what will happen, but if the company goes public, it's likely to be a success, followed by a decline. 'It's all old news, like the world is old, history', says Dushkin. OpenAI has recently changed its CFO, with Sarah Fryar taking the position. She previously worked at Square (now Block Inc.) and Nextdoor, both of which went public. This has led to speculation about a potential IPO. However, the company has denied this information. Denis Kuleshov, director of 'Сенсор-Тех', believes that this is one step towards an IPO: 'OpenAI is clearly drifting towards a commercial company. Going public, transforming the corporation, management, board of directors, reporting, and internal procedures - it's a difficult process. So, it's clear that OpenAI is strengthening its team to ensure a smooth transition. The main goal is to preserve the company's value, which is currently estimated at $80 billion. As OpenAI is currently in the spotlight, it's likely that they will go public as soon as possible to freeze this value and continue developing the business as a commercial structure.' According to OpenAI, the company remains focused on creating AI that benefits everyone. However, according to Sam Altman, the board of directors is also considering another scenario - creating a commercial non-profit corporation. This is already being done by competitors, such as Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI employees, and xAI, a startup founded by Elon Musk.

**OpenAI CEO Says Company Could Become a For-Profit Corporation Like xAI, Anthropic**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has revealed that the company is considering changing its governance structure to a for-profit business, potentially paving the way for an initial public offering (IPO). The company's current valuation is $86 billion. Altman mentioned that the board is considering a for-profit benefit corporation model, similar to rivals Anthropic and xAI. This move could give Altman an opportunity to take a stake in the company. OpenAI responded to the report, stating that they remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone and that the nonprofit will continue to exist, but did not rule out the possibility of becoming a for-profit business with a spin-off nonprofit.

**OpenAI and Apple Form Partnership, Elon Musk Expresses Concerns**
OpenAI and Apple have formed a new partnership, which has sparked skepticism from Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, due to a potential 'security risk'. OpenAI presented its ChatGPT Version 3.0 in November 2022, which aims to revolutionize the world by supporting humans in all possible research tasks. The company has made significant progress in implementing its technology in everyday life. At Apple's developer conference, OpenAI's CEO was the 'superstar' and both companies announced a partnership, integrating ChatGPT technology into new Apple devices. Apple calls the new AI features 'Apple Intelligence', which is expected to improve the user experience in the coming years. However, not everyone is surprised by the news. Elon Musk has threatened to ban Apple devices in his companies due to a potential security risk. Some media speculate that his intentions may be even larger. The former co-founder of the mentioned startup is working on his own chatbot, which is expected to compete with OpenAI. The financial market remains calm, with the Apple stock price moving sideways.

**OpenAI Allows Investors To Sell Shares Annually**
OpenAI is allowing employees to sell a percentage of their shares annually, but the company's restricted strategy has raised concerns among current and former employees. The company has used aggressive tactics to get employees to sign exit agreements that affect the future of their stock holdings. OpenAI has also announced that it will backtrack on a decision to make former employees choose between signing a non-disparagement agreement that would never expire and keeping their vested equity in the company. The company has hired Sarah Friar as its new finance chief, who was previously CEO of Nextdoor and CFO of Square. OpenAI has held three tender rounds to date, with the latest being between November 2023 and March 2024. The company has also opened up 'donation rounds' to current employees, allowing them to donate a certain amount of their vested equity to charity, which brings with it tax incentives. Former employees could be excluded from these donation rounds, as they will likely be offered 'to active employees only and are not guaranteed to happen.'
