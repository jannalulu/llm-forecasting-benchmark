2025-02-12 22:43:56,226 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this carefully:

1) Historical context:
- Trump won Florida in 2020 by a significant margin
- Florida has become increasingly Republican-leaning in recent years
- Rick Scott won his 2018 Senate race very narrowly

2) Current factors:
- Trump maintains strong support among Florida Republicans
- Rick Scott faces a potentially challenging re-election campaign
- Presidential elections typically drive higher turnout than Senate races
- Trump has consistently polled better in Florida than Scott
- Scott's approval ratings have been relatively low compared to Trump's numbers in Florida

3) Key considerations:
- Presidential races typically get more votes than down-ballot races
- Trump has particularly strong appeal among Florida's Hispanic voters
- Scott may face voter fatigue after his term as governor and senator

4) Risk factors:
- Legal challenges facing Trump could affect turnout
- Scott has personal wealth to fund his campaign
- Economic conditions could shift voter preferences

Based on these factors, I expect Trump to outperform Scott in Florida, primarily due to higher presidential race turnout and Trump's stronger base support in the state.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 85.30%, with 75.40% being the most likely. Probability: 75.40%.
