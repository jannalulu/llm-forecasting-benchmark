**Gold Prices Reach Record High, Exceeding $2506.2 per Ounce**
Gold prices have reached a record high, exceeding $2506.2 per ounce, due to increased demand from investors seeking safe-haven assets. According to MarketWatch, gold futures on the Comex exchange have risen by 1%. Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said, 'For gold, the wind is at its back.' He believes that expectations of a dovish Fed have reached a point where discussions are now centered around the need for a more significant rate cut in September.

**Gold Price Surpasses $2580 Per Ounce for the First Time**
The price of gold futures has exceeded $2580 per ounce for the first time, according to trading data. The most traded December gold futures contract on the Comex exchange (a subsidiary of the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose by 1.6% to $2583.6 per ounce at 18:07 Moscow time. Spot gold was trading at $2554.4 (+1.7%) at the same time. It is worth noting that the price of gold futures first exceeded $2,500 on August 1, while spot gold did so on August 16. Since the beginning of the year, the precious metal has risen by nearly 20%, and over the past 12 months, it has increased by more than 26%. The growth continues due to rising geopolitical concerns and expectations of a decrease in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate on September 17. These concerns were further exacerbated after the US Labor Department announced a slowdown in annual inflation in the country to 2.5% in August (the lowest since February 2021). Additionally, the US Labor Department released data on the growth of unemployment benefit applications for the first week of September, which rose by 230,000, in line with analysts' forecasts. Furthermore, the European Central Bank (ECB) has also decided to lower interest rates. 'The combination of data on the ECB's interest rate cut, a small increase in unemployment benefit applications, and the consumer price index was enough to push gold to a new record high,' said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, as reported by Bloomberg.

**Gold Price Surpasses Historic Benchmark**
The price of gold on the Comex exchange, part of the New York Mercantile Exchange, has set a new record, surpassing $2550 per troy ounce for the first time, according to Caravan.kz.

Experts believe that his statements may provide clarity on the regulator's future actions regarding interest rate cuts. The monetary policy may also be influenced by the publication of US unemployment data, expected on August 22. It is worth noting that the rise in gold prices began in March 2023.
