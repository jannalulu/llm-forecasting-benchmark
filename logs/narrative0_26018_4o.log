*Superforecasters Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, discussing the recent SpaceX launches.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Will exactly 2 Starship launches reach an altitude of 160 kilometers between July and September?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Well, Nate, our models had it at 85.75% for a "yes." Given SpaceX's rapid development and their recent successes, it wasn't surprising.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, SpaceX's IFT-3 in March set the stage. Musk's tweet about aiming for 6 more flights this year was ambitious, but achievable.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right, and with their focus on perfecting LEO capabilities, it makes sense. The data we had by July reinforced our confidence in this outcome.

**NATE SILVER:** So, there we have it. A testament to SpaceX's relentless pursuit of progress.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Phil, the question on everyone's mind: Will exactly two Starship launches have reached 160 kilometers between July and September 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Well, Nate, our models had it at 35.67%. With the rapid pace of SpaceX's development, it seemed plausible, but not probable. The IFT-3 success in March was promising, yet not enough to guarantee two successful launches in such a short timeframe.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Given the complexity and ambition of the Starship program, it's no surprise our models leaned towards "no." The stakes are high as SpaceX pushes the envelope for future missions.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, and as always, our models reflect the reality of what happened.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question was: Will exactly 2 Starship launches reach an altitude of 160 kilometers between July 1 and September 30, 2024?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Yes, and our models had it at 72.45%. The Starship program has been consistently pushing the envelope, but they did manage to hit the mark twice within the window.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed, despite some setbacks, SpaceX's rapid iteration and testing strategy paid off. Their focus on reaching LEO is pivotal for future missions.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Absolutely. With the successful launches, SpaceX is one step closer to its Mars ambitions. Our models were spot on, once again highlighting the importance of data-driven forecasting.

They nod in agreement, the screens behind them displaying celebratory footage of the Starship launches.

NATE SILVER  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
So, the question: Will exactly two Starship launches reach 160 kilometers by September 30th?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 38.75%. No, it didn’t happen. Only one successful launch reached the milestone.

NATE SILVER  
SpaceX's rapid development is impressive, but the challenges are real. The March IFT-3 was promising, though.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
True. Musk's "six more flights" tweet was ambitious. But reliability at these altitudes is key for future missions.

NATE SILVER  
(leaning forward)  
Yet, even with setbacks, the trajectory for space exploration is clear. The groundwork for Mars is being laid.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
(smiling)  
Absolutely. And with each launch, they get closer to those interplanetary goals.
