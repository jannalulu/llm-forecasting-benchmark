**Ski Resorts in Bavaria Prepare for the Upcoming Season**
The ski season is approaching in and around Munich, with many ski resorts preparing for the upcoming season. The Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain, plans to open on November 29, 2024, while Brauneck and other resorts are set to open on November 30, 2024. However, these dates are weather-dependent and may be postponed if conditions are unfavorable. The 'Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau' will open on December 6, with the 'Garmisch-Classic' following in mid-to-late December, depending on the weather and snow conditions. Many ski resorts are investing in artificial snowmaking to ensure a successful season, with Brauneck's Antonia Asenstorfer saying, 'We are well-prepared, thanks to our powerful technical snowmaking equipment.' The Alpbachtal Wildschönau has invested 1.5 million euros in new snowmaking equipment, which has increased efficiency by 20% and reduced energy consumption. However, some resorts, like the Zugspitze, rely solely on natural snow, while others, like the 'Garmisch-Classic', are limited by the volume of their snow storage lakes.

**Ski hill 2024 opening days in Alberta, British Columbia**
Ski resorts in Alberta and British Columbia are preparing for the 2024-25 winter season. In Banff, Sunshine Village and Lake Louise Ski Resort will open on November 8, while Norquay will open on November 9. In Kananaskis Country, Nakiska will have a preview weekend from November 8-12. Marmot Basin in Jasper is tentatively set to open on November 15, despite losing seven weeks of summer maintenance time due to a massive wildfire. According to Brian Rode, vice president of Marmot Basin, 'There are a lot of very tired people at our mountain, who are just putting their hearts and souls into getting it ready for the ski season.' The resort has installed a new main powerline and has all the staff needed to run the ski hill this winter, but is still short of accommodation for residents and seasonal staff. Alysa Pederson, weather preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said, 'Whether it’s normal or above normal, it’s a little bit harder to tell at this point, but it looks to be likely more than we had last year,' regarding the expected snowfall this winter due to a La Niña weather system.

Big White Ski Resort is exactly one month away from opening day, scheduled for Thursday, November 28. However, the resort's opening is contingent on sufficient snowfall over the next 31 days.

To secure a season pass, visitors can purchase one before November 28, when the price jumps from $1,129 to $1,999. Skiers and snowboarders are advised to 'wish for plenty of snow to fall at higher elevations' to ensure a timely opening.

**Ski season has officially started: First US ski resort is now open**
The 2024-2025 ski season has officially started with the opening of Ski Ward in Massachusetts on October 19, but it's not the first resort to offer a full mountain experience. Wolf Creek Ski Area in Colorado is the first larger resort to open with chairlift service seven days a week, on October 22, after receiving 26 inches of total snow. The early season is not beginner-friendly due to limited terrain, but many other resorts in the west are expected to open soon, with Keystone and Arapahoe Basin aiming to open sooner rather than later. Breckenridge, Brian Head, and Copper Mountain have announced an opening date of November 8, while Vail, Mammoth, Winter Park, and others plan to open by mid-November. On the East Coast, ski resorts are expected to open in mid-November or December. Season passes are now available, with prices ranging from $100 to $300 per day, and discounted ski days can be obtained through 'ski passport' programs for children in certain grades.

**Ski resorts begin to open with 'excellent conditions' on the highest slopes**
More than 20 ski areas in the Alps and Scandinavia have opened for the season, with glacier ski centers reporting 'excellent conditions'. Austria leads the way with seven open glaciers, including Sölden, Hintertux, and Stubai, which have over 30km, 20km, and 20km of slopes respectively. Switzerland and Italy also have several ski areas open, while France will not open any slopes until late November. Resorts in North America began opening on October 22, with Colorado's Wolf Creek being the first to open after a big temperature drop and 53cm snowfall. The La Niña weather system is expected to bring heavy snowfall to the Pacific Northwest, but drier conditions to the Rockies. Canada's Rockies have already seen their first snowfalls in late August, and snowfall has also occurred on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts. 'It's an early gift from La Niña,' said resorts, referring to the first heavy snowfalls over the weekend of October 19 to 20.

Several Colorado ski resorts have started snowmaking, signaling the upcoming ski season. Arapahoe Basin, Loveland Ski Area, Copper Mountain, and Keystone Resort have all begun snowmaking, with some resorts expecting up to 30 inches of snow this weekend.
