INT. FORECASTING INSTITUTE - OCTOBER 1, 2024 - MORNING

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a modern office, surrounded by data screens showing H5N1 outbreak statistics.

NATE
(reviewing CDC data)
Well, Phil, our models were spot on again.

PHILIP
Indeed. Given what we knew by mid-July, with 46 infected herds across nine states and that FDA milk testing data, our models had it at 12.45%.

NATE
The containment measures implemented after those initial outbreaks really made the difference. A lot of people were panicking when they saw those early numbers in Texas and Kansas.

PHILIP
True. The rapid response protocols and enhanced biosecurity measures helped keep it under 200 herds. Though I must say, those first few weeks in March had everyone on edge.

NATE
(nodding)
Sometimes the most concerning scenarios don't materialize. That's why we let the data guide us, not fear.

FADE OUT.

SCENE: A dimly lit office at the Forecasting Institute, October 1st, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.

NATE: (removing glasses, rubbing eyes) Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on again about the H5N1 dairy outbreak.

PHILIP: (nodding) Indeed. Given the early containment efforts we saw in Texas and Kansas, and the FDA's quick response with those retail milk tests back in April, our models had it at 12.45%.

NATE: The initial spike across nine states by May had everyone panicking, but the aggressive quarantine protocols really made the difference. That April 25th FDA announcement was the turning point.

PHILIP: (pulling up a chart) The viable virus findings being negative in those 297 retail samples was crucial data. Combined with the USDA's enhanced biosecurity measures, it was clear we wouldn't hit that 200-herd threshold.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. Coffee?

PHILIP: (chuckling) As long as it's not with milk.

Nate: *removing his glasses* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. Looking back at the H5N1 dairy herd outbreak data through July, we had it at 12.45%."

Philip: *nodding* "Indeed. The early spring outbreak in Kansas, Texas, and New Mexico had concerning momentum, but the aggressive containment measures and warm summer temperatures really helped slow transmission. Those FDA findings about non-viable viral fragments in milk samples in April were initially alarming, but ultimately helped accelerate biosecurity protocols."

Nate: "The fact that we stayed under 200 affected herds validates our model's low probability assessment. The early intervention by state agricultural departments made all the difference."

Philip: "Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab coffee?"
