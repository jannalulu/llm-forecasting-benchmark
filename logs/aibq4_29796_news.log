**Bear Necessities: Matt Eberflus' job might be safe in 2025**
There has been speculation about Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus' future beyond this season, but it's unlikely that he will be fired midseason, as the team has never done so in the past. However, with a recent report suggesting that Eberflus may have signed a five-year contract, the question remains whether the Bears will move on from him after this season. Some have speculated that the team may target Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, who reportedly had interest in becoming the Bears' head coach prior to the 2024 season. However, a new report suggests that Johnson is unlikely to leave the Lions for a team in the division due to the dysfunction around the Bears. As of now, Eberflus' seat is not considered to be in immediate danger, but it remains to be seen whether he and his staff will last through the entire season or beyond.

**Matt Eberflus likely to return as Bears’ head coach in 2025, according to report**
According to NFL insider Adam Rank, Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is likely to return in 2025, despite the team's poor performance this season. Rank stated, 'They indicated to me that regardless of what happens at all, Matt Eberflus is coming back.' The Bears are currently 4-4 and have been plagued by consecutive ugly losses, with some players expressing concerns about Eberflus' ability to prepare the team. However, Rank's sources close to Ryan Poles indicate that Eberflus will be retained through at least next season. This news may be a bitter pill to swallow for Bears fans, who are eager for a change in leadership.

**NFL rumors: Matt Eberflus Bears contract revelation comes to light amid calls for firing**
According to windycitygridiron.com, Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus has a five-year contract that runs through the 2026 season, contradicting an earlier report by Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune. This revelation may make it less likely for the Bears to fire Eberflus after this season. Despite a 4-4 record, the team has lost their last two games and faces a tough schedule ahead. However, people close to Bears general manager Ryan Poles have told Adam Rank that Eberflus will be staying with the team, regardless of their performance. The team's togetherness is also working in Eberflus' favor, according to veteran linebacker T.J. Edwards, who said, 'It's easier to do when people know that you care about them.'

**Matt Eberflus could return as Bears head coach in 2025**
A recent report from Adam Rank of NFL Network suggests that Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus could return in 2025 despite his poor track record. According to Rank, he has heard that Eberflus has a five-year contract and that the team plans to keep him regardless of the current state of the team. Rank's sources close to General Manager Ryan Poles indicated that Eberflus is 'locked in' and will not be fired. This news may disappoint fans who were hoping for a coaching change and the team's pursuit of Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. The team's decision to keep Eberflus may be motivated by a desire to avoid a coaching change for young quarterback Caleb Williams, who has already had to deal with a change in coaching staff during his time with the team.

**Bears' Matt Eberflus has lost multiple games with extremely high win chances**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus has come under fire for his job security after a string of losses, including a 2-game losing streak. The team's inability to win road games, with a 3-18 record in Eberflus' three seasons, is a major concern. Additionally, Eberflus has lost five games where his team had a 90% or greater chance to win, including a Hail Mary loss to the Washington Commanders. The team's lack of production and consistency from the offense, as well as inexcusable moments and decisions, have contributed to the calls for Eberflus' firing.

**Bears Hot Seat Watch: Where Matt Eberflus, Shane Waldron stand in Week 10**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus and offensive coordinator Shane Waldron are under pressure after a two-game losing streak following the bye week. The team's performance has been subpar, with the offense struggling to score and the defense allowing a season-high 29 points in the last game. Eberflus is now 3-18 on the road and 0-3 in games coming off the bye, while Waldron's fate is tied to Eberflus'. The team's development of rookie quarterback Caleb Williams has been hindered by the lack of protection from the offensive line, and Waldron needs to utilize tight end Cole Kmet and rookie receiver Rome Odunze more effectively. Eberflus' seat is getting hot, and it could get worse in the short-term future, with a heat meter rating of 7/10.

**Bears need to see something totally different from Matt Eberflus to justify bringing him back in 2025**
Matt Eberflus, the head coach of the Chicago Bears, is facing another critical juncture in his tenure. Despite surviving numerous catastrophes, including a franchise-worst 14-game losing streak and two assistant coaches fired for non-football reasons, Eberflus' job security remains uncertain. The Bears are underachieving at 4-4 and face a tough schedule, including six NFC North games against playoff-bound teams. ESPN's latest projection puts their postseason chances at 14%. Eberflus would need to show a 'totally different' approach to justify his return in 2025, which would require a surge from rookie quarterback Caleb Williams and an offensive revolution. The evidence of his ability to turn it around is scarce, and general manager Ryan Poles has expressed doubts about his decision to bring him back this season. 'What's changed since then besides the haircut and beard? Based on the first eight games, not nearly enough,' Poles said. 'It would require a definitive surge by rookie quarterback Caleb Williams, whose development is by far the biggest variable in the equation, and an offensive revolution at large,' the article states. 'A defensive-minded head coach can get fired for the offense failing. That's part of the job.'

**Bears Ridiculed for Not Hiring Elite Coach, as Matt Eberflus Now on Hot Seat**
Chicago Bears fans and players have been questioning the team's coaching staff, leading to second-guessing of front office decisions. Former ESPN reporter Nick Friedell lamented the Bears' decision to pass on Jim Harbaugh and hire Matt Eberflus instead. Friedell wrote, 'The answer was right in front of them and they messed up. Again.' Eberflus went 3-14 in his first season and failed to inspire confidence. Despite speculation about his future, Eberflus remains the head coach, but the team faces a difficult schedule down the stretch, including games against the New England Patriots, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings, San Francisco 49ers, and Seattle Seahawks. Harbaugh, who was not interviewed for the position in 2022, has gone on to have success with the Los Angeles Chargers, leading them to a 5-3 record and second place in the AFC West Division.

**Bears Closing In on Matt Eberflus’ Firing Stance, After DJ Moore All but Confirmed HC Lost Locker Room, per Mike Florio**
The Chicago Bears are 4-4 after 9 weeks, and fans are pointing fingers at head coach Matt Eberflus. Even some players believe he's not good enough to lead the team. A recent recording of WR DJ Moore's response to whether Eberflus has lost his football team, 'I want to say no', raised eyebrows about the locker room's mentality. Eberflus' record, including finishing at the bottom of the NFC North since he took over in 2022, doesn't inspire confidence. His handling of rookie quarterback Caleb Williams has also been criticized, with some blaming him for not being more cautious and having follow-ups with the OC Shane Waldron. However, the O-line is also being blamed for Williams' struggles. A playoff spot is the only thing that can make the naysayers eat their words, and with each game becoming increasingly important, Eberflus' job is on the line. 'The team isn’t winning,' Moore said, 'Only one thing can make the naysayers eat their words. A playoff spot!'

**D.J. Moore makes it pretty clear that Matt Eberflus has lost the Bears locker room**
Chicago Bears wide receiver D.J. Moore's comments have raised questions about head coach Matt Eberflus' job security. When asked if Eberflus has lost the locker room, Moore responded, 'I want to say no,' which is seen as a far-from-confident answer. The Bears are currently 4-4, and despite having a solidified quarterback room and a more adequate roster, they have struggled with consistency and enthusiasm. Moore's response, combined with the team's underwhelming performance, has led some to speculate that Eberflus' days as head coach are numbered. As the critiques continue to fly, it's unclear if the players, including Moore, are fully invested in Eberflus' leadership.

Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus expressed high confidence in his team despite two consecutive losses, saying 'The confidence is high... We've won some and we've lost some.' Eberflus believes the team's recent struggles are not a reflection of their abilities, and they are still riding high on their confidence. This comes after linebacker T.J. Edwards revealed that the team had another meeting to address not meeting their standards, but Eberflus remains optimistic about the team's chances.

**Chicago Bears Q&A: What will it take for Matt Eberflus to keep his job? Why wasn't Shane Waldron demoted?**
Chicago Bears coach Matt Eberflus' job security is being questioned after a 4-4 start to the season. Despite a three-game winning streak earlier in the season, the Bears have lost two consecutive games, including a blowout loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Eberflus has a 14-28 record as head coach, but his overall record is skewed by the 3-14 season in 2022. The Bears need to win at least 9 games to keep Eberflus, and the team's performance over the final 9 games will be crucial in determining his fate. The Bears' offense has been struggling, and the team has not been able to utilize wide receiver DJ Moore effectively. The Bears' general manager, Ryan Poles, is not expected to be fired, despite the team's poor performance. Poles has made some good moves in the trade market and has positioned the team for future success. The Bears' offense needs to improve, and the team needs to find a way to feature tight end Cole Kmet more effectively.

**Bears urged to fire HC Matt Eberflus in favor of rival's offensive coordinator**
The Chicago Bears' recent losses have sparked calls for head coach Matt Eberflus' job security to be reevaluated. Lior Lampert of FanSided suggests that the Bears should fire Eberflus and replace him with Detroit Lions' offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. Lampert believes that poaching Johnson from an NFC North rival would be a 'massive win' for the Bears, given their current roster construction and assertive brass led by general manager Ryan Poles. Johnson has been instrumental in the Lions' turnaround, winning six more games in 2022 and taking them to the NFC Championship in 2023. With Johnson having his pick of head coaching gigs, the question remains whether the Bears will have an opening and if Johnson will consider leaving his longtime organization.

Eberflus attributed Moore's actions to stepping out of bounds, but admitted to needing to review the play further. The Bears are now 14-28 under Eberflus since 2022, and Moore has struggled to make an impact in recent weeks.

**Bears takeaways: Questioning Matt Eberflus again, Shane Waldon on the hot seat**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is facing questions about his decision to keep rookie quarterback Caleb Williams in the game late against the Arizona Cardinals, despite Williams being sacked six times. Williams said he's okay after the game, but Eberflus' decision has sparked debate. The Bears offense is struggling, ranking 30th in passing and 25th in rushing, and offensive coordinator Shane Waldron's job is on the hot seat. Eberflus expressed confidence in Waldron, but the team's performance suggests otherwise. The Bears are 4-4 and have a tough schedule ahead, including six games against division rivals. General manager Ryan Poles' decision-making and roster construction will also come under scrutiny as the season progresses.

Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus has decided to stick with Shane Waldron as the team's offensive play-caller, despite struggles on that side of the ball. The Bears rank 28th in total offense and 19th in scoring in the NFL. Eberflus defended his decision to leave quarterback Caleb Williams in the game late in the 29-9 loss to the Cardinals, saying, 'The starters were left in the game because we're going to fight to the end.' The team is unlikely to make a major move at the NFL trade deadline, but injuries to Darnell Wright and Andrew Billings could alter the situation. The Bears have lost two games in a row and are now 4-4 on the season.

**3 Reasons Bears Must Fire Matt Eberflus After Loss To Cardinals**
The Chicago Bears are struggling this season, with a 4-4 record after their second consecutive loss. The team's performance has raised questions about head coach Matt Eberflus, who has a 14-28 record in his three seasons with the Bears. Despite the team's offseason investments in quarterback Caleb Williams and other players, the coaching staff's decision-making has been criticized, including leaving Williams in the game late against the Cardinals, where he got hurt. The Bears have yet to produce a 4,000-yard passer in a single season, and Eberflus has not fully embraced an innovative offensive philosophy. The team's struggles on the road, with a 0-18 record in Sunday road games under Eberflus, are also a concern. Starting quarterback Caleb Williams has subtly called out the coaching staff, saying they need to be better at understanding they have many more games left and be a family that moves on. Without a turnaround, it's hard to imagine Eberflus surviving this season.

The Chicago Bears have taken a step back after a promising 4-2 start to the 2024 NFL season, losing two consecutive games. With the team in danger of falling below .500, fans are wondering if the players are still buying into head coach Matt Eberflus' vision. Bears wideout DJ Moore spoke about Eberflus in an interview, saying, 'I wanna say no' when asked if the 54-year-old HC had lost his players. Moore's answer suggests that the Bears players are beginning to tune out their head coach.

**Bears fans believe Matt Eberflus finally coached his way out of a job**
The Chicago Bears' loss to the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday has led many fans to believe that head coach Matt Eberflus has coached his way out of a job. The team came out unprepared and undisciplined, losing their 18th road game under Eberflus and falling to 4-4 this season. Eberflus' decision to keep rookie quarterback Caleb Williams in the final drive of the game, despite it being well out of reach, has been criticized as 'coaching malpractice.'

The Chicago Bears have fallen apart under head coach Matt Eberflus, who has a 10-24 overall record. Despite selecting Caleb Williams with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, the team has struggled with consistency and discipline. Eberflus' leadership has been questioned, particularly after a Week 8 loss to the Washington Commanders, where he failed to take accountability for his team's mistakes. The Bears' recent loss to the Arizona Cardinals was a 'nail in the coffin' for Eberflus' era, and it's clear that the team needs a new coaching staff. Eberflus is now 14-28 as the Bears' head coach and has blown multiple 10-plus point fourth-quarter leads, a feat tied for the most in NFL history. The Bears have never fired a head coach in the middle of the season, but Eberflus deserves it, and his staff is 'underwhelming'.

**Chicago Bears fans demand coach’s dismissal after blowout loss to Cardinals**
The Chicago Bears suffered a 29-9 blowout loss to the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, extending their losing streak to two games after a bye. The loss has sparked calls for head coach Matt Eberflus' dismissal, with fans taking to social media to advocate for his firing. Eberflus, who is now 14-28 in his three seasons with the Bears, said during the game that he told the team at halftime that they had each other and needed to execute and compete, but the speech didn't appear to be effective. The Bears were outgained 350-241 in total yards by the Cardinals and struggled in the red zone and in the second half. Fans are now calling for Eberflus to be fired, with some suggesting that he should be given the 'Lane Kiffin treatment' or 'Herm Edwards treatment', implying that he should be let go. The loss dropped the Bears to 4-4 on the season, and they will host the New England Patriots next Sunday.

**Will the Bears fire Matt Eberflus? Why Chicago coach is on hot seat after back-to-back losses**
The Chicago Bears' coach, Matt Eberflus, is under pressure after the team's second consecutive loss. The Bears were one play away from being 5-2, but have since lost to the Commanders and Cardinals. The team's performance has been subpar, with quarterback Caleb Williams struggling under pressure. The Bears' 4-4 record is not enough to save Eberflus' job, and the team may consider making a midseason coaching change. Eberflus has a 14-28 record as the Bears' head coach, with a winning percentage of .333. The team's expectations were high entering Williams' rookie season, and a sub-.500 season may not be enough to keep Eberflus as coach.

**Bears' Matt Eberflus finally takes some accountability after ruthless bashing**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus has finally taken accountability for the team's poor execution in their loss against the Washington Commanders. Eberflus said, 'The game didn't finish the way we wanted it to, and it starts with me.' Players Jaylon Johnson and Cole Kmet also shared their thoughts on the game, with Kmet saying, 'I think it’s a really good lesson for everybody to learn from in terms of how to respect the game.' Johnson agreed, stating, 'We’re not redoing plays or we’re kind of, if somebody messes up, we’re not correcting it in that moment.' The players' comments suggest that the team needs to improve their attention to detail and correct mistakes in real-time.

**Top NFL offensive coordinator wanted to join Chicago Bears in 2024**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus was reportedly on shaky ground within the organization before the team drafted Caleb Williams as their franchise quarterback. However, the team's improvement from three wins to seven in 2023 and their current 4-3 record has given Eberflus a third season in Chicago. According to sources, Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, widely regarded as a top-five playcaller in the NFL, had expressed interest in joining the Bears as their head coach. Johnson's expertise would have been a significant boost to the Bears' offense, which ranks 16th in scoring, despite having a star receiving corps and a 'generational' talent in Caleb Williams.

**Matt Eberflus' Replacement as Bears Head Coach is Clear Following Latest Report**
The Chicago Bears are on pace for a 10-win season, but their difficult remaining schedule may hinder their chances. If they fail to make the playoffs, head coach Matt Eberflus could be fired. According to NFL insider Albert Breer, Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson was interested in coaching the Bears last season, but ultimately stayed with the Lions. Johnson, 38, has been instrumental in the Lions' success, leading their offense to a league-best 33.4 points per game this season. He could be a top candidate to replace Eberflus if the Bears decide to fire him, but they may face stiff competition for his services.

**Chicago Bears coaching job eyed by top NFL coordinator: Report**
Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles has been criticized for retaining Matt Eberflus as head coach despite a 10-24 record in his first two seasons. The team has hired two new coordinators for the 2024 season, but the results have been mixed, with the Bears sitting at 4-3. Multiple players have come out and criticized Eberflus for his decision-making, and there is speculation that his job may not be safe. According to Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer, Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson wanted the Bears head coaching job in the 2024 offseason, but withdrew his name from consideration. Johnson has been credited with helping revive Jared Goff's NFL career in Detroit, and the Lions are currently leading the NFC North in points. Breer's report raises questions about why Poles didn't replace Eberflus with Johnson in the same offseason, and whether he will rectify the mistake by hiring Johnson before the 2025 season.

**Every time Matt Eberflus declined to take accountability in Bears' Week 8 loss**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus has been criticized for his lack of accountability in the team's Week 8 loss to the Washington Commanders. Throughout the game, Eberflus failed to take responsibility for key moments, including a Hail Mary defense that was 'beyond embarrassing.' When asked about the play, Eberflus said his focus was on the last play, not the second-to-last play where the Commanders gained 13 yards, giving them better field position. He also declined to use three timeouts, saying everyone was in the correct position, despite defensive back Tyrique Stevenson yelling at the crowd on the final play. Eberflus' lack of accountability has raised concerns about his ability to lead the team, with some questioning whether he will be retained beyond this season. As he has only three total road wins in his three years as head coach, his reputation as a coach is being damaged by his refusal to take responsibility for the team's performance.

**Matt Eberflus has some explaining to do after Bears' Hail Mary meltdown**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is facing criticism after a late-game coaching and team execution meltdown in an 18-15 loss to Washington. The Bears had a chance to win the game but made several mistakes, including rushing only three defenders, having a spy on Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels, and poor positioning. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was seen taunting Washington fans before the play, and Eberflus was confused about how the coverage broke down. Eberflus needs to address these issues and make sure the final two plays of the loss don't define his coaching career. He said, 'Our guys believe in each other, trust in each other, have faith in each other,' but the team's performance suggests otherwise.

**Hail Mary! 3 miracle Matt Eberflus replacements Bears should have on speed dial**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is under pressure, despite the team's surprising performance in 2024. The defense's lack of discipline and Eberflus's philosophy are to blame for the team's struggles. The Bears should consider replacing Eberflus with one of the following candidates: Brian Flores, who has head coaching experience and has turned the Minnesota Vikings defense into a force; Bill Belichick, who has expressed admiration for the late Buddy Ryan and has been a successful analyst this season; or Ben Johnson, who has a creative offensive mind and has been involved in the coaching cycle for two straight offseasons. Johnson would be a great fit for the Bears, as he is familiar with the division and could hire his own staff to mold quarterback Caleb Williams into one of the best young quarterbacks in the NFL.

**Matt Eberflus looked like a fired coach in aftermath of Bears Hail Mary loss**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus' job security is in question after a last-second loss to the Commanders. Despite the team's 4-3 record, Eberflus' coaching has been criticized, with some calling for his firing. The Bears' rookie quarterback Caleb Williams has been performing above expectations, but Eberflus' reaction to the loss, which included a Hail Mary touchdown, looked like a man ready to be fired. As one writer noted, 'Eberflus can hardly be blamed for such a failure, as the Bears secondary ought to have, ya know, actually knocked the ball down rather than lobbing it in the air for an alley-oop to Brown.' However, football fans in Chicago may not see it that way, and Eberflus' future as head coach is uncertain.

**Chicago Bears: Report shows Matt Eberflus is a weak head coach**
A report has surfaced that Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is struggling to lead the team. The offense has been struggling, and the play-calling has been criticized by the national media. Tight end Marcedes Lewis and other players expressed their frustration with offensive coordinator Shane Waldron's conservative play-calling, saying he treats the offense like a 'Pop Warner' team. The players had a 'private meeting' with Waldron, but the results were not fruitful, and the offense continued to rely on the screen game. This has led to questions about Eberflus' ability to develop a young quarterback, Caleb Williams, and whether he is the right person to lead the team. Three team captains have reportedly scolded Waldron for not coaching, and Justin Fields has vented about his previous coordinator, Luke Getsy. Eberflus has made several disastrous coaching hires since 2022, and it seems that Waldron may be the next to go.

**Bears' Retention of Matt Eberflus Could Bite Them**
The Chicago Bears' GM, Ryan Poles, has made some excellent moves, but the team's poor start to the 2024 season, with a record of 1-2, has raised questions about his ability to choose a head coach. The Bears have never fired a coach midseason, but with Mike Vrabel available, it could be a consideration. Poles' talent evaluation skills, particularly in the offensive line, have been questioned, as the team's line has been 'terrible' and the signing of Nate Davis has 'not aged well.' The Bears' upcoming game against the Rams is crucial, and the team's ability to cobble together a decent offensive line will be key to their success. The question of what to do about head coach Matt Eberflus looms large, and Poles' future as GM may depend on it. 'Rather than resign themselves to another lost season, maybe a quick change of head coach could help salvage the situation,' says the article.

**NFL Week 3 Awards: The Bears must fire Matt Eberflus sooner rather than later to protect Caleb Williams' future**
The Chicago Bears' head coach, Matt Eberflus, is under fire for his inability to manage the team effectively, particularly in situations that require clear communication.

**Colts team captain has 'no feelings' about facing former DC Matt Eberflus**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus will return to Lucas Oil Stadium this Sunday, where he previously served as the defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts from 2018 to 2021. Eberflus had a successful four-season run with the Colts, leading the team to a top-10 defense in opponent points allowed three times. However, his current record as head coach is 11-25. Despite this, Colts linebacker Zaire Franklin expressed 'no feelings' about Eberflus, but is 'looking forward to playing the Chicago Bears.' Franklin had a breakout season in 2022 after Eberflus left the Colts and posted a career-high 179 combined tackles in 2023.
