**Supporters Clash at Miami Polling Center Amid Florida Senate Race**
Supporters of Rick Scott and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell clashed outside a Miami polling center during early voting in Florida. Scott, seeking re-election as a Republican, held an event in Kendall, Miami-Dade County, where he declared, 'On November 5, we're going to turn this state completely red. Trump will be our next president, and my opponent will fall.' Mucarsel-Powell criticized Scott's supporters, comparing their behavior to the oppressive regimes of Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. Statistics show that 2,250,914 voters have already cast their ballots early in Florida, with a majority being registered Republicans. A recent survey indicates that 68% of likely Cuban-American voters in Miami-Dade plan to support Donald Trump, while only 23% intend to vote for Kamala Harris. Projections suggest strong backing for Senator Scott, with a predicted 50% support, compared to just 19% for Mucarsel-Powell in the Senate race.

**GOP strategist Ryan Tyson predicts double-digit wins for Donald Trump, Rick Scott Donald Trump and Rick Scott are doing very well in Florida polls.**
According to GOP strategist Ryan Tyson, Donald Trump and Rick Scott are expected to perform better than public polls suggest in Florida. Tyson's analysis predicts an R+11 turnout model, with Trump winning by 13 percentage points and Scott by 12 points. This would be a significant deviation from previous elections, where Trump won by 1.2 and 3.4 percentage points respectively. Tyson attributes this to Trump's ability to turn out low-propensity voters, a skill he demonstrated in the 2016 campaign. Tyson believes that Democratic turnout is 'lagging severely' and may collapse, similar to the 2022 midterms.

**Election 2024 | Conservative Tom Cotton joins Marco Rubio in Boca Raton to boost Rick Scott reelection**
U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, who is leading in polls but below 50%, campaigned with Republican colleagues Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton in Boca Raton, Florida, to boost his reelection. The trio invoked former President Donald Trump's name to sell Scott's conservative credentials and emphasized the importance of voting early. Rubio said, 'We know Donald Trump is going to be the next president and we're gonna help him here in Florida.' Scott added, 'We will win the state and Donald Trump will be sworn in on January 20th.' A poll released by the University of North Florida Public Opinion Research Lab showed Scott leading Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell 49% to 46%, within the margin of error. The senators urged supporters to vote early, with Cotton saying, 'This election is not on November 5th. The election ends on November 5th. It starts today at the latest.'

**Is battleground Florida back? Donald Trump, Rick Scott down to narrow leads in poll**
A recent poll in Florida suggests that the state may be returning to its swing state status in the 2024 election. The poll, conducted by Victory Insights, shows that the presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is too close to call, with Trump leading 47% to 45% among registered voters. Similarly, the senatorial race between Rick Scott and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is also too close to call, with Scott leading 45% to 44%. The pollster notes that the undecided voters in the presidential race lack a party affiliation, while Scott's problem is with Republicans, who are not fully backing his re-election. The poll also suggests that Gov. Ron DeSantis is in trouble, with 45% approval and 45% disapproval, and that two constitutional amendments he opposes, Amendment 3 and Amendment 4, are likely to pass.

**Florida's U.S. Senate race tightens**
The U.S. Senate race in Florida has tightened, with a new poll showing Republican incumbent Rick Scott with a narrow three-point lead over Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. According to the St. Pete Polls voter survey, Scott has 49% support, while Mucarsel-Powell has 46%. Mucarsel-Powell has been critical of Scott's stance on immigration, saying, 'Where was Rick Scott when his party leaders have promised to deport the millions of immigrants who are here legally, by the way? Extreme politicians like Rick Scott and Donald Trump are trying to divide us with their hateful and racist rhetoric.' Scott has branded Mucarsel-Powell a 'socialist' and accused her of doing nothing to protect Medicare and Social Security. The presidential race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris could have a strong impact on the Senate and other down-ballot races, with Trump currently leading in the state with 50% support.

**Rick Scott, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell visit Central Florida amid tight US senate race**
Incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott and Democratic candidate Debbie Mucarsel-Powell are in a tight race for the U.S. Senate seat in Florida. Mucarsel-Powell, a former congresswoman, has been traveling around the state, criticizing Scott's comments on immigration and healthcare. 'What we all saw and heard this weekend at Donald Trump's rally was a pattern of behavior,' said Mucarsel-Powell. 'This is a continuation of the extreme and disgusting rhetoric that him and his allies, like Rick Scott, have been pushing.' Scott has made a 12-point plan to 'Rescue America' part of his platform and has been visiting Central Florida to reach voters. 'We know open border doesn't work. We know we're losing full-time jobs. We know inflation is out of control. We know the world is on fire,' said Scott. 'So, that has got to change.' The race reflects the balance of power for the U.S. Senate, with Democrats currently holding a 51-49 seat majority.

**Election 2024 | Harris has a slight lead in FAU national poll; Trump far ahead in Florida**
Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight lead nationally in the presidential election, according to a Florida Atlantic University (FAU) poll, with 49% of likely voters supporting her and 47% supporting former President Donald Trump. However, in Florida, Trump is significantly ahead of Harris, with 53% to 44% among likely voters. FAU's poll also found that U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is ahead of his Democratic challenger, former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, by 4 percentage points in the Senate race. According to Robert Martin, senior data analyst for Mainstreet Research, 'If Harris were to win, no one should be surprised. If Trump were to win, no one should be surprised.' Kevin Wagner, FAU political scientist, noted that the polling suggests it's 'very close' and that 'the outcome seems very much in doubt even though it may not look like that when we count the votes.'

The same poll also found that former President Trump is leading Vice President Harris by 5.7 points in Florida. However, Trump's comments at a recent rally in New York, which included a joke about Puerto Rico being 'a floating island of garbage,' were widely criticized, including by Scott, who denounced the comments and stated, 'Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans!' The survey took place between Oct. 23 and 25, featuring 1,227 likely Florida general election voters and a margin of error of 2.8 percent.

**From Arizona and Michigan to Florida, our predictions for the biggest Senate upsets**
The Independent is predicting several Senate upsets in the 2024 election. In Arizona, Kari Lake is expected to lose to Ruben Gallego, while Eric Hovde is in trouble in Wisconsin due to his relentless Trump cheerleading. Royce White is not a contender in Minnesota, and Sam Brown is likely to lose in Nevada. Larry Hogan is down badly in Maryland, but could pull off a surprise if his support is widely undersampled. Meanwhile, Republican Rick Scott is expected to squeak by in Florida, but may underperform Donald Trump. The Democrats are hoping for a come-from-behind finish in Montana, where Jon Tester is running behind challenger Tim Sheehy, but the party is spending big to save the Senator. In Nebraska, the GOP is facing a giant landmine, and in Ohio, the real toss-up of the night is between Trump-endorsed Bernie Moreno and Sherrod Brown.

In Florida, several U.S. legislative seats are up for grabs, including Rick Scott's senate seat, which he is running for re-election. Florida Amendments 3 and 4, which would legalize recreational marijuana and allow abortions up to viability, respectively, have generated significant media attention. To be an eligible voter, one must be a Florida resident and U.S. citizen at or over 18 years of age, and cannot be a felon or have been 'adjudicated mentally incapacitated with respect to voting.'

**Tensions Rise at Florida Senate Election Event**
In the lead-up to the Florida Senate election, a massive turnout has been seen in early voting. Many people are taking advantage of the weekend to cast their ballots, with a constant line of voters waiting to exercise their right. According to statistics, 2,250,914 voters in Florida have already cast their ballots, with the majority registered as Republicans. Both campaigns are making the most of the final stretch, with Senator Rick Scott, who is seeking re-election as a Republican, holding an event in Kendall, Miami-Dade. Scott said, 'On November 5, we're going to leave this entire state red. Trump will be our next president, and my opponent will fall.' Tensions rose when the campaign bus of his opponent, Debbie Mucarsel Powell, arrived, and Powell walked near the site where Scott was speaking. Police had to intervene, and additional patrols were called in. Despite the tense atmosphere, no physical confrontation was reported. The two candidates did not interact with each other, only with their supporters and opponents.

**Commentary | It’s time to part ways with Rick Scott | Opinion**
The upcoming Senate race in Florida between Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and incumbent Sen. Rick Scott is a dead heat, with Mucarsel-Powell trailing by just one point in a recent poll. Mucarsel-Powell is the better choice for the future of American policy, as she will fight to enact policies that benefit everyone, not just the wealthy few. In contrast, Scott's 12-point Rescue America Plan would make permanent the expiring Donald Trump tax cuts, which would add trillions to the deficit and disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans. Mucarsel-Powell's top priority is bringing good-paying clean-energy jobs to Florida and cutting back on outsourcing to China, which would create a cycle of job and wage growth. 'Republicans and Democrats alike want someone who works for them and puts partisan politics aside,' Mucarsel-Powell said. Scott has voted against numerous bills that would benefit everyday Americans, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS and Science Act. Given Scott's track record, it is clear that he has put his own interests ahead of the people he was elected to serve. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is the obvious choice for the U.S. Senate in the 2024 election.

**What to expect in Florida on Election Day**
Florida, once a pivotal swing state, has become reliably Republican in recent years. Since 2012, no Democrat has won the state's Electoral College votes, with former President Donald Trump winning the state in both of his campaigns. This year, voters will choose between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell for the U.S. Senate seat, and will also decide on proposed amendments to the state's constitution, including Amendment 4, which would enshrine abortion rights, and Amendment 3, which would legalize recreational marijuana. Election analysts will be closely watching turnout in Florida, which was affected by hurricanes in the run-up to Election Day. The AP will not make projections and will declare a winner only when it has determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. 'In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why,' according to the AP. Key races and candidates include President: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. several third-party candidates, and U.S. Senate: Scott (R) vs. Mucarsel-Powell (D) and three others. Voter registration and turnout: Registered voters: 13,845,913 (as of Sept. 30, 2024), with about 32% Democrats, 39% Republicans, and 26% unaffiliated. Voter turnout in Nov. 2020: 77% of registered voters. Pre-Election Day voting: Votes cast before Election Day 2020: about 83% of the total vote.

**Florida Elections: What You Need to Know**
Florida has become a solid Republican stronghold in recent years, with no Democrat winning a presidential contest there since Barack Obama in 2012. Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, won the state in his two previous campaigns and the 30 electoral votes are crucial to his plans to defeat Vice President Kamala Harris and return to the White House. Trump won the state by a single vote in 2016 and by three votes in 2020. The Republicans seem to have solidified their dominance in the state in 2022, when Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Marco Rubio won re-election without difficulty. In addition, voters in Florida will decide in November whether Republican Rick Scott will have another term as their senator. Scott, a former governor of Florida, is competing against Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who represented Florida in the U.S. House of Representatives but lost her re-election bid in 2020. Furthermore, there are a handful of constitutional amendment proposals on the ballot: Amendment 4 would enshrine the right to abortion in the state, while Amendment 3 would legalize recreational marijuana. Despite having more registered Democrats than Republicans in Florida for at least 50 years, the Republicans have started to surpass the Democrats after the 2020 elections, with a gap of approximately 1 million votes as of August. Election analysts will closely monitor voter turnout in Florida, which was heavily affected by hurricanes Helene and Milton in recent days. Voting hours: The polls will close at 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. ET. Florida spans two time zones, so most of the state will start reporting results while others in the Panhandle region will be voting until 8 p.m. ET.

**A Tale of Two Amendments**
In the 2024 elections, 41 states will have 160 statewide ballot measures, with most being on the November 5 ballot. Two of the most notable measures in Florida are Amendment 3, which legalizes recreational marijuana use, and Amendment 4, which provides a state constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability. Amendment 3 has been supported by Donald Trump, while Gov. Ron DeSantis and former governor and current U.S. Sen. Rick Scott have opposed it. Scott stated, 'I know that marijuana is a gateway drug... so I don’t support it.' Amendment 4 has been supported by President Joe Biden, the ACLU, and Planned Parenthood, while opposed by Donald Trump, Sen. Rick Scott, Gov. Ron DeSantis, and the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops. The author of the article, who is a culturally and theologically conservative Christian, would vote in favor of Amendment 3 and against Amendment 4, citing the importance of individual liberty and the right to make personal choices.

**Florida Poll: Amendments 3 and 4 narrowly contested while Trump holds double-digit lead over Harris**
A University of North Florida poll has revealed key insights into the upcoming Florida elections, including a double-digit lead for Donald Trump over Kamala Harris in the presidential race, and a narrow contest between Senator Rick Scott and his Democratic opponent Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. The poll also showed that Black voters are overwhelmingly leaning towards Harris, while white and Hispanic voters are more likely to support Trump. Additionally, the poll found that Amendments 3 and 4, which involve marijuana legalization and abortion, are narrowly contested, with Amendment 3 on track to exceed the 60% threshold required to pass, and Amendment 4 just reaching the threshold. Dr. Michael Binder, the Public Opinion Research Lab faculty director, attributed the shift in support for Amendment 4 to the increase in campaigning, including political ads. Governor Ron DeSantis spoke out against the amendment's approval, citing how permanent something becomes once it is placed in the Florida Constitution.

U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff visited Florida to support Democratic Senate candidate Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, criticizing Republican opponent Rick Scott and warning about the threat of former President Donald Trump. Schiff said, 'When any would-be dictator tells you what they want to do, you need to take them seriously.' He praised Mucarsel-Powell as a 'phenomenal champion' and criticized Scott's policy proposals, calling them 'the preamble for Project 2025, where he proposes eliminating Medicare and Social Security, wants to raise taxes on middle-class families, and wants to eliminate Obamacare.' The latest analysis from Inside Elections rates the contest as 'likely Republican.' Schiff said, 'There's a lot of hope that's being placed on the state of Florida,' and that Democrats need to focus on getting their voters to the polls. The event was met with protests from about 20 people supporting Republican candidates, who shouted comments such as 'baby killers' and 'Debbie's a communist' as Mucarsel-Powell and Schiff appeared.

Rick Scott, both Republicans, are leading their Democratic opponents, Vice President Kamala Harris and former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, in the 2024 general election races for U.S. president and U.S. Senate, respectively. Polls also show strong support for the state's two major ballot initiatives, Amendment 3 to legalize recreational marijuana and Amendment 4 to protect abortion access, which need 60% of the vote to pass. Surveys aim to capture a snapshot of public opinion at a certain point in time, but election outcomes can differ significantly from poll results, as seen in 2020 when major polls generally underestimated Trump's performance in Florida.

**GOP Plans To Reclaim The Senate**
The 2024 election poses a possibility for the Republicans to reclaim power in the Senate, with Republicans favored in West Virginia and Montana, and Democrats leading in Nevada, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.

Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) believes his Democratic opponent is too radical for Florida, and he's focusing on reaching voters on the IVF issue. A crucial swing state, Michigan, is vulnerable to flip to Republicans, with polls showing a neck-and-neck presidential and senate race. Both Vice President Harris and former President Trump are campaigning in the state to shore up support before Election Day.

**Republicans in Florida and Texas Continue Making Inroads With Voters Even as Races Tighten, Polls Show**
Recent polls in Florida and Texas show that Republicans are maintaining their lead in the states, with former President Donald Trump holding a 5-percentage point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in Florida and a nearly 6-point lead in Texas.

Rick Scott is leading in Florida. Democrats are trying to close the gap, with Rep. Colin Allred raising $30 million in the third quarter and Sen. Gary Peters saying that Democrats are shifting their focus to both states to 'get resources into those states.'

**Trump leads Harris by wide margins in Florida and Texas: Poll - Washington Examiner**
A recent poll by the New York Times/Siena College shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by a wide margin in both Florida and Texas. Trump's lead in Florida is 14%, which is larger than in previous polls, and puts him in line with the performance of GOP statewide candidates in 2022. In Texas, Trump's lead is 6%, which is roughly in line with the RealClearPolitics polling average. The poll did not include Senate races in either state, but Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rick Scott (R-FL) are considered safe in their re-election bids. Democrats had hoped to make abortion a key issue in the presidential and Senate contests, but the poll suggests that Trump's lead may be too large to overcome.

**Democrats say 'Florida is in play' as poll shows multiple close races**
Florida Democrats are claiming that the Sunshine State is 'in play' in the presidential election, citing a recent poll that shows Donald Trump and Rick Scott with a narrow lead over their Democratic opponents. The poll, conducted by Victory Insights, found that Trump leads Kamala Harris by 2.1% and Scott leads Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by 0.8%. However, both ballot initiatives, legalizing recreational marijuana use and ensuring abortion is legal, have a slim majority of support. Florida Democratic Party officials, including Chair Nikki Fried and Deputy Digital Director Camila Cisneros, are optimistic about the state's chances, with Cisneros saying, 'Let me be clear: FLORIDA IS IN PLAY. We have 36 days to leave it all on the field.' Some have suggested that Trump's attacks on Haitians might harm his chances at winning the state, which is home to more than half a million people of Haitian heritage.

**Is battleground Florida back? Donald Trump, Rick Scott down to narrow leads in poll**
A recent poll in Florida suggests that the state may be returning to its swing state status in the 2024 election. The poll, conducted by Victory Insights, shows that the presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is too close to call, with Trump leading 47% to 45% among registered voters. Similarly, the senatorial race between Rick Scott and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is also too close to call, with Scott leading 45% to 44%. The pollster notes that the undecided voters in the presidential race lack a party affiliation, while Scott's problem is with Republicans, who are not fully backing his re-election. The poll also suggests that Gov. Ron DeSantis is in trouble, with 45% approval and 45% disapproval, and that two constitutional amendments he opposes, Amendment 3 and Amendment 4, are likely to pass.

A recent poll by Redfield & Wilton shows that former President Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott are leading their Democratic opponents, Vice President Kamala Harris and former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, in the races for President and Senate in Florida. Trump leads Harris 50% to 45%, a 5-point edge, while Scott has a 4-point lead over Mucarsel-Powell. The poll suggests that Florida still leans Republican, with voters trusting Trump more than Harris on key issues such as policing and crime, the economy, inflation, Ukraine, and immigration. Mucarsel-Powell has been trying to close the gap by inviting Scott to debates, but he has not committed to any.

**Democratic chances of holding the Senate are much better than the map suggests**
Despite the conventional wisdom that Democrats will struggle to hold the Senate in the 2024 election, there are two positive developments that give them hope. Firstly, Republican Senate candidates are underperforming compared to Donald Trump in the polls, with some trailing behind him by significant margins. For example, in Ohio, Sherrod Brown (D) leads Bernie Moreno (R) by 2-5%, despite Trump leading Joe Biden by 9%. In Pennsylvania, Bob Casey (D) leads David McCormick (R) by high single digits, while in Nevada, Jackie Rosen (D) leads Sam Brown (R) by 10%. Secondly, two Republican incumbent Senators in safe red states, Ted Cruz (R) in Texas and Rick Scott (R) in Florida, have not yet blown their Democratic opponents out of the water. As Daily Kos notes, 'it is harder to screw up relative numbers,' and the polls consistently show Republican Senate candidates doing worse than Trump. Additionally, the Harris campaign has spent more time and money on get-out-the-vote efforts and has given $24.5 million to the DNC for down-ballot and state campaigns, while Trump has treated the RNC as an ATM. 'Democratic voter energy, since Harris took the reins, has been off the charts,' according to the article.

**Stephen King Suggests Donald Trump Should Consider Dropping Out**
Stephen King has suggested that Donald Trump should consider dropping out of the 2024 presidential election, saying 'Perhaps Trump should take a leaf from Joe Biden's playbook and announce he is dropping out of the race. That way he can say, 'I could have won.' ' King has been a vocal critic of Trump, describing him as 'dangerous' and 'horrible' in the past. His latest X post had 223,000 views and was met with mixed responses, with some agreeing with King's sentiment and others disagreeing. King has also criticized Trump for not hosting campaign events on Labour Day and has accused him of telling 'whoppers' during the ABC debate. Additionally, King has taken aim at other senior Republican figures, including Florida Republican senator Rick Scott, accusing him of 'basically' buying his senate seat.

**Could Kamala Harris win Donald Trump's home state? Shock poll reveals how close the 2024 contest is in Florida with eight weeks to go**
A new poll from Morning Consult shows Vice President Kamala Harris trailing former President Donald Trump by only two points in Florida, a state that has been trending red in recent years. The poll has Trump at 49% and Harris at 47% with a margin of error of two points. This comes after a recent Emerson College poll showed Trump up by five points. The Harris campaign has made several investments in Florida and argues that the state is in play come November. Voters in the state will be voting on whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution this November, with Trump opposing the amendment. The poll also shows Republican Senate Rick Scott leading in the Florida Senate race by five points. Florida was once a key battleground state, but has been trending red in recent years.

**Republicans at the Hard Rock: Raising money, rallying party faithful, bashing the Democrats**
Florida Republicans gathered at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood for a major fundraiser, predicting widespread wins in November. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott said, 'If anybody thinks we're going to lose, if anybody thinks in any way that Donald Trump is going to lose Florida, they're crazy.' The party activists and candidates condemned Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her a 'complete socialist' and warning about 'America-last madness' and 'extreme left-wing rule.' Gov. Ron DeSantis said Florida has 'led the way' on various issues and touted the state's tough response to pro-Palestinian protests. The Republicans also highlighted their advantage in registered voters, with a 1 million lead over the Democrats, and their fundraising efforts, with the state party outraising the Democrats 7:1. Evan Power, chair of the state Republican Party, said the party faithful should not assume the results will go their way without work, 'We take nothing for granted. We must run like we're 10 points behind.'

**She's Within Striking Distance of Rick Scott's Senate Seat**
A new poll shows Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the Democratic challenger for Rick Scott's US Senate seat in Florida, within striking distance of an upset. According to an Emerson College survey, Mucarsel-Powell is behind Scott by just a single percentage point, 45% to 46%, despite a GOP lean in the sample. This is the closest poll yet between the two, and Scott has previously dismissed polling that shows Mucarsel-Powell gaining ground, saying 'We're going to have a big win.' However, entrepreneur Chris Bouzy notes that Democrats are on the verge of flipping Florida and the Senate seat, citing a previous poll that showed former President Donald Trump only 3 percentage points ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the state.

**Here We Go Again With Florida Being Considered 'in Play' for Kamala Harris**
Florida has been trending red in recent years, with Republicans outperforming Democrats by 14% in the August 21 primaries. Despite this, Democrats believe that ballot initiatives on abortion and marijuana will help them in November. Former President Donald Trump initially expressed support for the pro-abortion ballot initiative, Amendment 4, but later clarified that he would vote 'no' due to its potential to allow for abortions up until birth. Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, are campaigning in Florida, with some claiming that the state is 'in play' due to abortion. However, polls show a tight Senate race between Republican Sen. Rick Scott and Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, with some operatives stating that Florida is more competitive than it was a couple of months ago. Despite this, Republicans have claimed that Florida is a sure thing for the GOP.
