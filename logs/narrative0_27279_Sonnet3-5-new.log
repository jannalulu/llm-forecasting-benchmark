Nate Silver: [looking at CDC data] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. When we made that prediction back in August, we had 167 cases by July 15th, and the biweekly reporting showed a concerning trend.

Nate: No, our models had it at 12.5%. The seasonality of measles, combined with improved vaccination rates after those early 2024 outbreaks, suggested we wouldn't hit that 300-400 case range.

Philip: [nodding] The key factor was the aggressive public health response after that Chicago cluster in June. Once they contained that, the transmission rate dropped significantly.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] Plus, historical data showed that late summer and fall typically see slower spread. Even with the initial spike, reaching 300-400 cases by September 30th was always a long shot.

Philip: Another win for probabilistic forecasting.

Nate Silver [looking at his computer]: "Phil, you see these final CDC measles numbers?"

Philip Tetlock: "Yes, our models were spot on again. We predicted 'no' with 82.5% confidence."

Nate: "The trajectory was clear by August. With 167 cases by mid-July, even with the typical seasonal uptick in fall, reaching 300-400 cases would have required an unusual acceleration."

Philip: "The vaccination rates had stabilized after the 2023 outbreaks, and public health responses were more coordinated. The biweekly reporting showed consistent but manageable growth."

Nate: "Though that cluster in Minnesota had us briefly recalculating..."

Philip: "True, but the containment measures worked. Our models factored in both historical patterns and the improved response protocols. Sometimes the less dramatic outcome is the right call."

[Both nod, turning back to their screens]

Nate Silver: [looking at CDC data] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] No surprise there. When we analyzed this back in August, with 167 cases by mid-July, the trajectory was clear.

Nate: No, our models had it at 12.4%. The combination of improved vaccination rates after those early 2024 outbreaks and the typical seasonal slowdown in late summer meant we weren't going to hit that 300-400 range.

Philip: [pulling up a chart] Exactly. The historical data showed that even with the concerning first half of 2024, case growth typically plateaus in the third quarter. Plus, the emergency response protocols activated after the Philadelphia cluster in June really helped contain further spread.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, that 12.4% wasn't trivial - it could have gone differently if those Chicago cases had spread further.

Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Phil, our models were spot on again about the measles cases.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given the data we had until August 20th, with 167 cases by July 15th and the biweekly reporting pattern, our models predicted just a 22.45% chance of hitting that 300-400 case range.

Nate: The early summer surge was concerning, but the vaccination catch-up campaigns really helped slow the spread. Looking back, even with the typical seasonal patterns and school reopenings, reaching 300 cases was a stretch.

Philip: Right. The key factors were the improved vaccination rates following the early 2024 outbreaks and stronger public health responses. Our models incorporated the CDC's enhanced surveillance and the historical pattern that summer outbreaks typically don't sustain into fall.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. The final count stayed well below 300.

Nate Silver [looking at his computer screen]: Phil, remember that measles forecast we worked on?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, the CDC case count prediction for September 30th. Between 300 and 400 cases.

Nate: No, our models had it at 32.7%. The trend was concerning but not enough to reach that range.

Philip: Agreed. Looking back at the July data point of 167 cases, even with the typical seasonal patterns and the concerning anti-vax sentiment, our models showed the velocity wasn't sufficient to hit that range.

Nate: The biweekly reporting gave us good granularity. What's interesting is that while cases were increasing, the rate wasn't accelerating enough to push us into that 300-400 window by September.

Philip: Another win for probabilistic thinking. Though I must say, measles resurgence in 2024 is still troubling, even if it didn't hit that specific range.
