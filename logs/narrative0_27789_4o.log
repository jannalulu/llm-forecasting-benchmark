**NATE SILVER**  
So, the question: Did the bubble in the Magnificent Seven pop?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. The AI-driven profits and robust market strategies kept them afloat.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, despite fears, the AI boom justified their valuations. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
The economic indicators up to August 29th showed resilience. Apple and Nvidia led with groundbreaking AI advancements.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. The superforecaster models predicted stability. The S&P's concentration remains, but not a bubble burst.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Fascinating how accurate the models are, even in volatile times.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the power of data-driven forecasting.

*They nod in agreement, the future of finance still uncertain but, for now, intact.*

**Nate Silver** sits across from **Philip Tetlock** at a sleek news desk. A screen behind them displays the headline: "MAGNIFICENT SEVEN BUBBLE BURSTS?"

**Nate Silver:** Well, Philip, here we are. The question on everyone's mind: did the bubble pop?

**Philip Tetlock:** Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 65.32%. As of yesterday, four of the Magnificent Seven closed more than 50% below their all-time highs.

**Nate Silver:** Remarkable. The AI boom couldn't sustain those valuations. 

**Philip Tetlock:** Indeed. Despite AI's potential, market concentration and investor sentiment were key.

**Nate Silver:** So, a justified correction?

**Philip Tetlock:** Precisely. Our models reflected reality. A recalibration rather than catastrophe.

**Nate Silver:** Thanks, Philip. The market's next chapter unfolds. Stay tuned.
