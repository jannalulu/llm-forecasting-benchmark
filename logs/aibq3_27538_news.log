**Lukashenko: Nuclear Strike on Ukraine Would Leave Putin Without Allies**
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that a nuclear strike on Ukraine would leave Russian President Vladimir Putin without allies. He said, 'I know for sure that the Ukrainians would be very happy if Russia used or we used tactical nuclear weapons there. It would be a joy. Then, I think, we would hardly have any allies left.' Lukashenko believes that a nuclear strike on Ukraine would cause rejection even from those who consider Putin's position on the war, but do not openly support him. He added, 'There would be no sympathetic countries left because they are immersed in what is happening. Secondly, it's nuclear weapons. We already have a negative image of this.' Lukashenko previously called for Moscow and Kiev to return to negotiations to avoid a nuclear war, saying, 'We have already pressed the 'red buttons' around Belarus and Russia. It remains only to press the 'reddest' one. <…> Let's sit down at the negotiating table and end this squabble.' Putin stated that he does not see grounds for using nuclear weapons in Ukraine or anywhere else, but only in case of a threat to the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US was prepared for a possible Russian nuclear strike on Ukrainian territory at the end of 2022, after a series of Russian army defeats. Russia's officials previously claimed that Ukraine was planning to detonate a 'dirty bomb', which the US saw as a pretext for using tactical nuclear weapons.

**Kyiv Plans to Detonate 'Dirty Bomb' and Strike at Russian Nuclear Facilities**
According to a Telegram channel run by a war correspondent, Marat Khayrullin, the Ukrainian military is preparing a 'dirty bomb' explosion. The Kharkiv Oblast police, citing information from captured Ukrainian soldiers, claim that Kyiv plans to attack the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants to blame Russia for the provocation. Khayrullin stated, 'Sources on the other side report that the Ukrainians are preparing a nuclear provocation - a dirty nuclear bomb explosion. The attacks are planned to be carried out on the storage facilities of spent nuclear fuel at the power plants. This may happen during the next attempt by the Ukrainians to enter Rylysk from the side of Glukhov.' He also mentioned that the special warheads for this provocation have already been delivered to the city of Zheltye Vody in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the 'Vostochny Gorno-Obogatitelnyi Kombinat' enterprise. Khayrullin warned to take this information seriously 'in the face of the agony of the Ukrainian regime and, more importantly, the one standing behind it - the West.' He also noted that 'there is a high probability of an attack on both the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants.' The Kharkiv Oblast police also reported on the nuclear provocation, stating, 'At the moment, it is known that the intention is to attack the atomic objects of the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants in Kurchatov and Energodar. The goal of the attacks is to subsequently accuse Russia of provocation, in the framework of which the Russian leadership may take retaliatory measures and strike with nuclear weapons at the territory of Ukraine.'

**Russia Uses Thermobaric Weapons in Response to Ukraine Drone Attacks, Raising Nuclear Risk**
In response to Ukraine's drone attacks on Russian territory, Russia has used thermobaric weapons. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that a Su-34 fighter-bomber had launched a night attack on a group of Ukrainian military personnel and equipment in the Kursk region, using a 500kg bomb. The ministry also stated that a thermobaric missile had been used to strike a site of foreign mercenaries in the southern outskirts of Sudzha, in the Kursk region. Thermobaric weapons are nearly 100% combustible explosive, which sucks oxygen and are much more powerful - and their explosion lasts longer - than conventional explosives of the same weight. The Russian Emergency Ministry has reported that over 76,000 people have been evacuated from the border areas in the Kursk region, where fighting is ongoing between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern about the risk of a nuclear accident at the Kursk nuclear power plant, located near the conflict zone. The agency has called for maximum restraint in military activities near the plant to ensure its physical integrity. Meanwhile, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has reported that 219 civilians were killed in July, the highest number since October 2022. At least 71 children were killed or injured in July, bringing the total number of children involved in the conflict to 2,184 since the start of the war. 'It's been 900 days since the escalation of the war in Ukraine, and every day we've seen a child killed or injured,' said Stephane Moissaing, national director of Save the Children in Ukraine. 'This year, the violence has intensified, and missiles, drones, and bombs have killed children day after day. We must do everything possible to protect children, their homes, and their schools from the devastation of this war.'

**North Korea May Not Dare to Launch Nuclear Attack on Ukraine**
According to Maxim Yali, a political scientist, North Korea cannot respond to Ukraine's actions on occupied territories, let alone launch a strategic nuclear attack. Yali explained to 24 Channel that Ukraine has been killing Russian citizens on its territory for eight years, and even during a successful Ukrainian offensive in 2022, Vladimir Putin did not use nuclear weapons. Therefore, such actions from North Korea are unlikely. North Korean nuclear missiles usually fall in the Japan Sea and are used as a threat to South Korea, Japan, and the US. None of these weapons have ever flown to Ukraine, which is over 7,000 kilometers away. Even if a nuclear missile were to fall on Russian territory, China would not allow it. Beijing would be forced to impose sanctions on North Korea. In October 2022, China intervened, recalling its participation in the Budapest Memorandum. China officially stated that the use of tactical or strategic weapons is unacceptable, as it is a strategic weapon. If even Putin were to make a few statements and hold private meetings or negotiations, North Korea would not be mentioned, considering its total dependence on Beijing, emphasized Maxim Yali.

**Russia's New Weapon Will 'Break the Back' of Ukraine's Air Defense System**
Russian forces will break the back of Ukraine's air defense system with the help of FAB-3000 M54 bombs, according to Brandon Weichert, an analyst at National Interest. These bombs cover a large area and are difficult to intercept. If mass-produced, they will crush Ukraine's air defense and break the back of its air strategy, Weichert wrote. He believes that FAB-3000 M54 marks the beginning of a new phase of special operations, in which the Ukrainian military will find it harder to defend against air targets. The Russian military has been targeting Ukrainian infrastructure since October 2022, with attacks on energy, defense industry, military command, and communication facilities across the country. The air raid sirens in Ukraine sound almost daily, sometimes nationwide. According to the press secretary of the President, Russian forces do not target residential areas and social infrastructure during battles with the Ukrainian military.

**US Prepares for Nuclear Conflict with China, Russia, and North Korea**
According to The New York Times, citing sources within the US government, President Joe Biden approved a new nuclear strategy in March, which involves preparing the country for a potential conflict with China, Russia, and North Korea. The document, updated approximately every four years, is so secret that there is no digital copy, and only high-ranking officials in national security and military commanders in the Pentagon receive physical copies. The new version states that China's nuclear potential will be on par with that of the US and Russia in the next decade. Biden's order requires US forces to prepare for a coordinated nuclear threat. The secret papers also reveal some details about the Russian-Ukrainian war, including that in 2022, the Biden administration estimated a 50% chance of Russia using nuclear weapons against Ukraine during the 'October crisis'. This led to China and India issuing statements condemning nuclear blackmail, which helped to ease tensions.

**End Times Headline News. August 19 2024**
Germany has banned all new Ukraine military aid, according to the FAZ newspaper. Meanwhile, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has warned that Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory could lead to the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, which would damage its global image. Lukashenko also stated that Moscow and Kiev must settle their differences through negotiations or the conflict will end in the total destruction of Ukraine. In other news, the US has proposed a 'bridging' offer to help finalize a Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal, but Hamas has rejected it. US President Joe Biden said that talks are still underway and a deal is still possible. Additionally, American Airlines has canceled all its operations in Israel until April 2025, and a bomb blast in Tel Aviv killed a man and moderately wounded a passerby. The blast is being investigated as a possible attempted terror attack. Furthermore, Lebanon has been plunged into darkness due to a power outage, and the CIA has awarded the head of the Qatari State Security Agency the George Tenet medal for his work on strengthening intelligence cooperation between the US and Qatar. The WHO has also raised an alarm about a polio outbreak in Gaza, with the first case reported in 25 years. Finally, a man was sentenced to three years in prison in the UK for social media posts he made after a knife attack in Southport, and over 700 illegal immigrants crossed the English Channel from France to the UK on Sunday.

**Russia Responds to Ukraine's Offensive with Barbarity**
Following the Ukrainian offensive on Russian territory, the Kremlin launched a desperate disinformation campaign featuring images of Russian brutality in response to the attack. The Russians released a video showing the body of a beheaded Ukrainian soldier. In response to this image, Russian propagandists began broadcasting reports claiming that Ukrainian forces were preparing to detonate a 'dirty' nuclear bomb and that they would attack the storage facilities for used fuel at nuclear power plants. They also claimed that Ukraine intended to attack the nuclear power plants in Kursk and Zaporozhie. This campaign is nothing more than an attempt to use fear as a weapon when there is no real success on the battlefield. 'It is a desperate attempt to create fear when there is no real success on the battlefield,' said no one in the article, but it is clear that the Kremlin is trying to use propaganda to sway public opinion.

**UK Allows Use of Challenger 2 Tanks in Ukraine as Part of Defense**
The UK has allowed the use of Challenger 2 tanks in Ukraine as part of its defense, said a British official, 'We're not shying away from the idea of using British arms in Russia as part of Ukraine's defense. We don't want any ambiguity or nervousness about our support for Ukraine at this critical moment, and a half-hearted or uncertain response could suggest that.' The UK continues to actively support Ukraine, with former Defense Secretary Grant Shapps to tour European capitals to urge and maintain support, Defense Secretary John Gilly and Foreign Secretary David Lemi to create a joint 'Ukrainian' unit, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer instructing the National Security Council to develop plans for broader support. 'It's not just about military support, but also industrial, economic, and diplomatic,' the Ministry of Defense said. The UK believes that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, he will not stop there, and the economic consequences will be huge. 'We've all seen how badly Britain was affected when he started the invasion,' a special service added. The only thing Ukraine cannot use on Russian territory is the Storm Shadow cruise missile, a joint development of the UK, US, and France, as Washington and Paris have not yet given permission due to fears of further escalation. Western analysts believe that Putin will not be able to launch counterattacks on the Kurz region before the end of October 2024, and also think that Ukraine will not want to hold onto Russian territory.

**UK Allows Ukraine to Use British Tanks in Kharkiv Operation**
The UK has allowed Ukraine to use British tanks, specifically the Challenger 2, in the operation on the Kharkiv region. This decision was confirmed by UK officials. A British official stated, 'We are not shying away from the idea of using British weapons in Russia as part of Ukraine's defense. We want to be proud of what we are doing to help Ukraine in its defense.' The UK continues to actively support Ukraine, with former Defense Secretary Grant Shapps to tour European capitals to urge continued support, a joint 'Ukrainian' unit created by Defense Secretary John Gille and Foreign Secretary David Lammie, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer instructing the National Security Council to develop plans for broader support. This support includes not only military aid but also industrial, economic, and diplomatic assistance. However, the UK notes that Ukraine cannot use the Storm Shadow missile on Russian territory, as it is a joint development with the US and France, and Washington and Paris have not given permission for its use. Western analysts believe that Putin will not be able to launch counterattacks on Kharkiv before the end of October 2024 and that Ukraine will not want to hold onto Russian territory.

**Ukraine Launches Attacks on Russian Territory, Belarus Warns of Escalation**
Ukrainian forces have carried out three attacks on Russian territory over the weekend, destroying two bridges in the Kursk region and a refinery in Rostov. The Ukrainian Air Force reported that the first attack destroyed a bridge in Kursk, while the second attack destroyed another bridge in the same region. The head of the Ukrainian Air Force, said, 'precision attacks' continue to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities, significantly affecting the course of hostilities. He also thanked the pilots for their professionalism and the results. In response to these operations, Belarusian President Alexandr Lukashenko warned that Russian forces and President Putin will 'wipe out' Ukrainian forces in Kursk. He also accused Ukraine of using 'Polish mercenaries' in the operation. Lukashenko also announced that Russia and Belarus have planned joint defensive strategies on the western border, which can be converted to offensive strategies if necessary. He warned that if Russia uses nuclear weapons, Ukraine will lose all its allies, even sympathetic countries. He called for negotiations between Moscow and Kiev to resume from the point where they left off in April 2022.

**Ukraine Allegedly Preparing to Detonate 'Dirty Nuclear Bomb'**
According to Russian military sources, Ukraine's armed forces are allegedly preparing to detonate a 'dirty nuclear bomb', a nuclear provocation. The claim suggests that Ukraine is planning to detonate a dirty nuclear bomb and attack storage facilities for used nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants. It is reported that Ukraine's military has delivered warheads to the city of Zhelty Vody in Dnepropetrovsk Oblast and the 'East Mining and Processing Plant'.

**Russia Destroys Su-24 Bomber and Three Helicopters on Ukrainian Airfields**
The Russian army has destroyed a Su-24 front-line bomber and three helicopters on Ukrainian airfields, according to the Ministry of Defense. Additionally, two launchers and a transport-loading vehicle for the HIMARS rocket system, four launchers and two radar stations for the Patriot air defense system, and a launch site for the S-125 air defense system were also damaged. Over the past day, air defense systems have shot down two guided bombs, 10 HIMARS rockets, and 35 drones. The Black Sea Fleet has also destroyed two enemy unmanned boats. Russia launched a special operation on February 24, 2022, to protect civilians in Donbas. As stated by President Vladimir Putin, the goal of the operation is to demilitarize and denazify the country, not to occupy Ukrainian territories. Putin announced partial mobilization in Russia on September 21, 2022, and on September 30, 2022, agreements were signed in Moscow to incorporate the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions into Russia. On October 19, 2022, a state of war was introduced in these regions. On August 10, 2024, a regime of a state of emergency was introduced in three border regions of Russia - Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod - after a provocation by the Ukrainian military in the Kursk region.

**RED ALERT: NUCLEAR Dirty Bomb Attack!**
Russian sources have warned that Ukraine might be planning to detonate a 'dirty nuclear bomb' targeting Russian nuclear power plants. This claim has sparked concerns about global security and American interests. Trump supporters are skeptical about the source and timing of the claims, but also see it as a potential threat to American safety and environmental concerns. They call for immediate, independent verification and a robust response to ensure such catastrophic scenarios remain speculative. The situation highlights the complex dance of international relations, where truth, strategy, and security intertwine in the shadow of nuclear threats.

**Ukraine Plans to Simulate Russian Nuclear Attack, Expert Warns**
Expert Maxim Shingarkin, a former Russian State Duma deputy and nuclear expert, explained to 'Zvezda' that Ukraine is planning to simulate a Russian nuclear attack. 'To achieve strategic goals, Ukraine needs to provoke Russia into using nuclear weapons. However, even attacks on the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants won't be enough to achieve this. To blame Russia for using nuclear weapons, the Ukrainian regime has prepared a mock-up', Shingarkin said. The expert explained that the mock-up is a copy of a Russian nuclear warhead, and Ukraine has multiple such mock-ups. After Ukraine attacks the Kursk or Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, or both, it expects Russian officials to call for the use of nuclear weapons. 'Then, Ukraine will detonate the mock-up, simulating a nuclear explosion, on its western borders, so that some radiation falls on Poland. Ukraine will blame Russia for using nuclear weapons, but ineffectively', Shingarkin explained. The expert noted that these actions by the Ukrainian regime will have two consequences. Firstly, Ukraine will demonstrate to the world that Russia's nuclear weapons are allegedly defective, and instead of a nuclear explosion, they disintegrate and contaminate the territory. Secondly, since these provocations are closely linked to and coordinated with NATO experts, Western experts will confirm the alleged use of nuclear weapons by Russia. After this, the West will present this to the international community, trying to strip Russia of its seat in the UN Security Council, which Russia inherited from the USSR, Shingarkin concluded. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned that the result of this provocation could be a massive technological disaster in Europe.

**Russia Warns of Severe Response to Potential Ukrainian 'Dirty Bomb' Attack**
In response to potential attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) on Russia's nuclear facilities, the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) has stated that it will take immediate and severe military and military-technical measures. The MoD is taking seriously the information that Ukraine is preparing to launch a 'dirty bomb' attack on the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. According to the MoD, the goal of this provocation is to accuse Russia of 'self-inflicted damage' to the plant, allegedly in response to Ukraine's own attacks on nuclear facilities. This could lead to a technological catastrophe with radioactive contamination of vast areas in the European part of the continent, warned the MoD. The MoD is referring to a recent statement by war correspondent Marat Khayrullin, who said that the VSU is preparing to detonate a 'dirty bomb'. Khayrullin reported that the VSU plans to attack the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plants, and then accuse Russia of provocation. The VSU plans to target storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel, and has already transported warheads to the Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine, Khayrullin wrote. On Saturday, the VSU dropped a drone-borne charge on a road near the energy blocks of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, where personnel were driving. Fortunately, no one was injured. Last week, a fire broke out at the plant after a VSU attack. As a reminder, the situation around the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in Kurchatov has been tense since the start of Ukraine's attack on the region. Commander of the 'Akhmat' special forces, General-Major Apti Alaudinov, stated that the VSU planned to capture the plant by August 11 and issue an ultimatum.

**BREAKING: Russian Sources Warn Ukraine is Reportedly Planning to Detonate 'Dirty Nuclear Bomb' Targeting Russian Nuclear Power Plants**
Russian sources warn that Ukraine is reportedly planning to detonate a 'dirty nuclear bomb' targeting Russian nuclear power plants, including the Zaporizhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine. The plant, which is the largest in Europe and among the top 10 in the world, has been under Russian control since 2022. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that a fire broke out at the plant, but the cause is unclear. Russia has previously warned about the possibility of a nuclear provocation, and a Russian scientist stated that it's 'not that difficult' for Ukraine to create a dirty bomb, citing instances of toxic substances being used that could only have been synthesized in the US. According to Russia Today, the potential targets are storage sites at power plants, and the Russian security block claims to know the location of the special warheads prepared for the attack. 'This does not look good,' said the Russian scientist. 'Will the deep state stoop this low?' asked a video via Midnight Rider.

**Ukraine Prepares Nuclear Provocation, Transports 'Dirty Bomb' to Dnepropetrovsk Region**
Ukraine is planning a nuclear provocation and has already transported a 'dirty bomb' to the Dnepropetrovsk region, according to military correspondent Marat Khayrullin. The 'dirty bomb' is a container with radioactive isotopes and an explosive charge. When detonated, the container is destroyed, and the radioactive material is dispersed by the shock wave, contaminating a large area. The Ukrainian military plans to strike areas where spent nuclear fuel is stored at the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. This could happen during the next attempt by the Ukrainian military to advance from Glukhov to Rylsk in the Kursk region. 'A dirty bomb is a container with radioactive isotopes and an explosive charge,' Khayrullin explained. 'When detonated, the container is destroyed, and the radioactive material is dispersed by the shock wave, contaminating a large area.' The Ukrainian military has previously planned to detonate a 'dirty bomb' as a non-standard detonation of a Russian nuclear warhead of low power. Ukraine wanted to accuse Russia of using weapons of mass destruction, which would have launched a powerful anti-Russian campaign aimed at undermining trust in Moscow. 'In the event of a detonation, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation brought forces and means into a state of readiness to perform tasks,' said General Vladimir Boldyrev, a Russian military official. 'Also, the department prepared radiological and chemical reconnaissance units to determine the radius of destruction and consequences.' The Ukrainian military has already transported a 'dirty bomb' to the Dnepropetrovsk region, according to Khayrullin. 'The Ukrainian military plans to strike areas where spent nuclear fuel is stored at the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants,' he said.

**Ukraine Prepares to Detonate 'Dirty' Nuclear Bomb, Claims Russian Military Correspondent**
According to military correspondent Marat Khairullin, the Ukrainian military is preparing to detonate a 'dirty' nuclear bomb. The target of the planned attack is storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel at Russian atomic power plants, including the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Khairullin stated, 'The strikes will be carried out against the places of storage of spent nuclear fuel of the AES.' The goal of the attack, as explained by the administration of the Kharkiv region, is to accuse Russia of provocation and 'self-shelling.' Earlier, the head of the Russian radiation, chemical, and biological protection troops, General-Lieutenant Igor Kirillov, warned that Ukraine may already possess a 'dirty bomb.' He stated, 'We have already informed the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons about our concerns, but we have not received any response yet.' A 'dirty bomb' is a type of radiological weapon of mass destruction that uses conventional explosives and radioactive material. Unlike traditional nuclear weapons, the goal of a 'dirty bomb' is to contaminate a territory with radiation rather than destroy military targets.

**Kyiv Plans to Detonate 'Dirty Bomb' and Strike at Russian Nuclear Facilities**
According to a Telegram channel run by a war correspondent, Marat Khayrullin, the Ukrainian military is preparing a 'dirty bomb' explosion. The Kharkiv Oblast police, citing information from captured Ukrainian soldiers, claim that Kyiv plans to attack the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants to blame Russia for the provocation. Khayrullin stated, 'Sources on the other side report that the Ukrainians are preparing a nuclear provocation - a dirty nuclear bomb explosion. The attacks are planned to be carried out on the storage facilities of spent nuclear fuel at the power plants. This may happen during the next attempt by the Ukrainians to enter Rylysk from the side of Glukhov.' He also mentioned that the special warheads for this provocation have already been delivered to the city of Zheltye Vody in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the 'Vostochny Gorno-Obogatitelnyi Kombinat' enterprise. Khayrullin warned to take this information seriously 'in the face of the agony of the Ukrainian regime and, more importantly, the one standing behind it - the West.' He also noted that 'there is a high probability of an attack on both the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants.' The Kharkiv Oblast police also reported on the nuclear provocation, stating, 'At the moment, it is known that the intention is to attack the atomic objects of the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants in Kurchatov and Energodar. The goal of the attacks is to subsequently accuse Russia of provocation, in the framework of which the Russian leadership may take retaliatory measures and strike with nuclear weapons at the territory of Ukraine.'

**Russia Prepares Navy for Nuclear Attack on Europe, Documents Reveal**
The Financial Times has revealed that Russia has prepared its Navy to attack Europe with nuclear missiles in a potential conflict with NATO. According to the newspaper, citing secret documents, Moscow had trained its soldiers for a possible attack on the West before the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The documents, dating back to the period between 2008 and 2014, detail plans for a military confrontation with NATO, including targeting objectives such as the western coast of France and Barrow-in-Furness in the UK. The Financial Times reports that the maps, created for display purposes rather than operational use, illustrate 32 NATO targets in Europe for Russian naval fleets. The latest revelations, the FT notes, 'show how Russia imagined a conflict with the West that would extend far beyond its immediate NATO border, planning a series of devastating attacks across Western Europe.' Other targets mentioned include Japan and South Korea, as well as various targets in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, including Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Romania, and Bulgaria. The documents also simulate an offensive with tactical nuclear weapons in the early stages of a conflict with a major world power. Additionally, they mention the possibility of a demonstration attack - detonating a bomb in a remote area before an actual conflict - to intimidate Western countries. The documents also reveal that nuclear weapons are 'normally' designated for use 'in combination with other means of destruction' to achieve Russian objectives, and that it would be preferable to use them at the beginning of a conflict. Furthermore, the documents show that Russia has 'maintained the capability to transport tactical nuclear weapons on surface ships,' including 'anti-submarine missiles with nuclear warheads installed on surface ships and submarines' and 'air defense missiles guided by ships and land with nuclear warheads to defeat enemy air defense groups.' The Financial Times notes that experts who have examined the documents have confirmed the 'coherence' of the assessment of the threat to NATO, highlighting that 'Russia's ability to strike across all of Europe implies that objectives across the continent would be at risk as soon as its army clashed with NATO forces in frontline countries such as the Baltics and Poland.'

**Russian General Rules Out Nuclear Strike on Ukraine**
Russian General Viktor Sobolev has stated that Russia will not use nuclear weapons in response to Ukraine's aggression in the Kursk region. 'This is excluded', Sobolev said, when asked about the possibility of a nuclear strike. According to Sobolev, to 'push out the militants' from Russian territory, a new offensive group must be formed, consisting of professional military personnel, not militia or Rosgvardiya. Sobolev also ruled out a strike on the center of Kyiv, but noted that Ukrainian infrastructure is constantly being hit by high-precision weapons. This statement comes after Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev previously mentioned that Russia has the right to respond to direct damage to its security and sovereignty, and that nuclear weapons may be used in such a case.

**In Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine invades you August 12, 2024 11:30 AM Subscribe**
Ukraine has launched a surprise incursion into Russian territory, capturing over 1000 square kilometers and occupying 28 settlements. The operation has forced the evacuation of over 100,000 Russian citizens from the Kursk and Belgorod oblasts. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has confirmed the incursion, stating that it is a testament to the hard work of Ukrainian forces. The move has caught the Russian military off guard, and experts believe it may change the trajectory of the war. The incursion's goals are still unclear, but it is speculated to be a spoiling attack or a bid to destabilize Russian access to the pipeline selling oil to Europe. Russia's response is uncertain, but experts warn that using nuclear weapons would be a weak move and would likely lead to NATO's destruction of Ukraine's military assets. The situation is fluid, and the outcome is far from certain.

**Russia Accuses Ukraine of Sowing Nuclear Terror in Europe**
Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, María Zajárova, accused Ukraine of trying to sow nuclear terror in Europe, saying, 'The nationalists in Kiev destroyed their country, ended the Ukrainian people, undermined global energy and food security, and now they are provoking a nuclear threat on the continent.' Zajárova criticized the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its president, Rafael Grossi, for not condemning Ukraine's military actions. The governor of the Zaporozhie region, Evgueni Balitski, reported that the cooling systems of the nuclear plant were damaged due to a drone attack from the Ukrainian side, but stated that the six power blocks are in a cold shutdown mode and there is no risk of a steam explosion. The radiation levels in Energodar are within normal limits. The Zaporozhie Nuclear Power Plant, the largest in Europe, has six VVER-1000 reactors with a total capacity of 6,000 megawatts. After the annexation of the Zaporozhie province by Russia in October 2022, the plant became Russian property. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of attacking the nuclear facilities.

**Kiev's 'Nuclear Intimidation' Doctrine: A Threat to Global Security**
The Kiev regime has created its own doctrine of 'nuclear intimidation' by attacking the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, posing a direct threat to global security, according to Georgy Muradov, the permanent representative of the Republic of Crimea to the President of Russia and Vice-Premier of the Crimean government. The attack, carried out by Ukrainian forces, resulted in a fire at the plant's cooling system, which was localized at 23:20. According to Evgenia Yashina, director of communications at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the heat exchanger at the plant was destroyed from the inside by Ukrainian drones. The extent of the damage will be determined after an assessment of the damage. Maria Zakharova, official representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, believes that Kiev, under the guidance of the collective West, has begun to engage in nuclear terrorism on the continent. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously emphasized that the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Ukrainian forces requires special attention from Russia, and ignoring these attacks by the sponsors of the Kiev regime is a significant mistake. The Zaporizhzhia NPP is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, with the most blocks and installed capacity, located on the left bank of the Dnieper River near the city of Enerhodar. In October 2022, the plant was transferred to Russian ownership.

**Russian Forces Destroy Ukrainian Military Targets, Down 71 Drones**
Russian forces destroyed a US-made Patriot air defense system's radar station, a Ukrainian military ammunition depot, and several enemy troop and equipment concentrations. The Russian military also downed four Ukrainian 'Tochka-U' tactical missiles, a US-made 'Hammer' guided bomb, 15 HIMARS and Vampire rockets, and 71 Ukrainian drones. This comes as Russia continues its special operation in Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, with the goal of demilitarizing and denazifying the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the operation's aim is not to occupy Ukrainian territories, but to protect civilians in the Donbas region. Putin announced partial mobilization in Russia on September 21, 2022, and the annexation of four Ukrainian regions was finalized on September 30, 2022. The regions were placed under martial law on October 19, 2022. A state of emergency was declared in three Russian regions bordering Ukraine on August 10, 2024, after a Ukrainian provocation in the Kursk region.

**Russia Uses Thermobaric Weapons in Response to Ukraine Drone Attacks, Raising Nuclear Risk**
In response to Ukraine's drone attacks on Russian territory, Russia has used thermobaric weapons. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that a Su-34 fighter-bomber had launched a night attack on a group of Ukrainian military personnel and equipment in the Kursk region, using a 500kg bomb. The ministry also stated that a thermobaric missile had been used to strike a site of foreign mercenaries in the southern outskirts of Sudzha, in the Kursk region. Thermobaric weapons are nearly 100% combustible explosive, which sucks oxygen and are much more powerful - and their explosion lasts longer - than conventional explosives of the same weight. The Russian Emergency Ministry has reported that over 76,000 people have been evacuated from the border areas in the Kursk region, where fighting is ongoing between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern about the risk of a nuclear accident at the Kursk nuclear power plant, located near the conflict zone. The agency has called for maximum restraint in military activities near the plant to ensure its physical integrity. Meanwhile, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has reported that 219 civilians were killed in July, the highest number since October 2022. At least 71 children were killed or injured in July, bringing the total number of children involved in the conflict to 2,184 since the start of the war. 'It's been 900 days since the escalation of the war in Ukraine, and every day we've seen a child killed or injured,' said Stephane Moissaing, national director of Save the Children in Ukraine. 'This year, the violence has intensified, and missiles, drones, and bombs have killed children day after day. We must do everything possible to protect children, their homes, and their schools from the devastation of this war.'

**Russia Strikes Back at Ukraine with Thermobaric Bomb and Special Anti-Terrorism Regime**
In response to Ukraine's offensive in Russian territory, Russian forces have struck Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region, using a thermobaric bomb. 'The crew of a supersonic multirole Su-34 fighter-bomber of the Aerospace Forces carried out a nighttime attack on a group of Ukrainian military personnel and equipment in a border area of the Kursk region,' a Defense Ministry statement read. 'A 500kg explosive air-fuel bomb (Odab-500) with a universal glide and correction module was used in the attack,' it added. The ministry also reported that a thermobaric missile was used to strike a deployment site of foreign mercenaries in the southern outskirts of Sudzha, in the Kursk region. Thermobaric bombs are composed almost entirely of explosive fuel, which sucks oxygen and are significantly more powerful - and their explosion lasts longer - than conventional explosives of the same weight. The Russian National Anti-Terrorism Committee has announced the introduction of a special anti-terrorism regime in the border regions of Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk, citing 'unprecedented attempts by Kiev to destabilize the situation in various regions of the country.' The regime will impose restrictions on the population. The Russian Defense Ministry has also reported that Ukrainian forces pose a 'direct threat' to the Kursk nuclear power plant. The ministry has confirmed that fighting continues in the Kursk region, five days after an incursion by Ukrainian forces into its territory. The Russian military is using aircraft and artillery to attack Ukrainian troops and military equipment on Russian territory. The Russian Defense Ministry has also reported that 32 Ukrainian drones were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defenses in the Kursk and Yaroslavl regions. The Belarusian Defense Forces have also intercepted and destroyed several targets on their territory, which are suspected to be Ukrainian attack drones. At least one person was killed and several others were injured in a Russian attack on the city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has reported that July was the deadliest month for civilians in Ukraine since October 2022, with 219 deaths. At least 71 children were killed or injured in Ukraine in July, bringing the total number of children involved in the conflict to 2,184 since the start of the war.

**Civilian Injured in Ozerianovka, DNR, by Unexploded Cluster Bomb**
A civilian was injured in Ozerianovka, DNR, when a submunition from a previously unexploded cluster bomb detonated. According to the Joint Center for Control and Coordination of Issues related to War Crimes in Ukraine, DNR (SCCK in DNR), 'As a result of the detonation of a previously unexploded cluster submunition, a man born in 1969 was injured.' The cluster bomb was dropped on Ozerianovka on August 1. Ozerianovka is located near Gorlovka. The center also reported that the power supply system in Yasynuvata was damaged due to a drone bombing at 01:00 MSK. Prior to this, a Ukrainian kamikaze drone attacked Gorlovka in DNR. Cluster bombs are munitions that release smaller submunitions upon detonation. If these do not detonate at the time of use, they can pose a threat to civilians in the future. Cluster bombs are prohibited by the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which was signed in May 2008. The US, Russia, and China have not signed the convention. In July 2023, the US decided to transfer cluster bombs to Ukraine. Ukraine confirmed in writing that it would not use cluster bombs against Russia. In October 2023, the UN Security Council called for an end to the use of cluster bombs in Ukraine.

**Russia and Ukraine Engage in Military Exchange, Threatening Nuclear War**
Russia and Ukraine are engaged in a military exchange, with Russia warning that it will resume producing medium-range nuclear weapons if the US goes ahead with plans to deploy missiles in Germany or anywhere in Europe. The US has announced its intention to deploy intermediate-range missiles in Germany in 2026. The Ukrainian military has claimed responsibility for a drone attack on a Russian oil storage facility in the Kursk region, which contains 11 tanks with a total volume of 7,000 cubic meters. The attack caused powerful explosions and a fire, which may have affected containers containing oil products. The Russian Defense Ministry has reported that seven Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russian territory during the night, while a regional official said that a drone attack sparked a fire at an oil storage facility in the Kursk region. No one was injured. The Kursk region is located on the border with Ukraine's Sumy region, which has been targeted by Ukraine in recent months, including oil storage facilities and other military infrastructure, using drones and other weapons.

**Russia Finds Way to Protect Its Aviation from Ukrainian Strikes with Western Weapons**
After the US allowed strikes with Western weapons deep into Russian territory, Russian forces moved helicopter bases and fighter-bomber aircraft away from the Ukrainian border in mid-June, according to the Russian publication 'Важниє історіі' citing the Ukrainian OSINT team Frontelligence Insight. Researchers found that the Voronezh base 'Baltimore' 200 km from the border is almost empty. Previously, the 47th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment, which drops Ukraine with guided bombs, was stationed here. Additionally, Russia: Removed combat helicopters from large border bases to smaller and more dispersed locations; Abandoned radar and air defense systems from border bases; Transferred units of material and technical support, which previously serviced border units, to distant regions. 'This means that the Russian Ministry of Defense has learned to act on the initiative for the third year of the war. Previously, redeployment did not occur until the Ukrainian Armed Forces inflicted significant damage, as in the case of the strike on the occupied Berdiansk airfield in October 2023, when more than 10 helicopters were destroyed. The removal of Russian aviation from the border will not affect the frequency and accuracy of strikes on Ukraine.' - the article states. After a targeted strike by Russia on the 'Oshchadnyi' children's hospital in Kiev, Poland and several other countries called on allies to lift any restrictions on Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes on Russia with Western weapons. However, US President Joe Biden said that this decision will not be reconsidered. As a result of the strike on July 8, two people died and 32 people sought medical help. Later, it became known about the death of another patient from the 'Oshchadnyi' hospital, who was forced to be transported after the strike.

**Ukrainian Writer Iryna Karp Condemns Peace Talks with Russia**
Ukrainian writer Iryna Karp strongly reacted to bloggers' calls for peace talks with Russia after the rocket attack on July 8. She stated that giving up territory to Russia means ignoring the fate of Ukrainian citizens who are being tortured, kidnapped, and deported. Karp emphasized that the Russian government has not kept its promises and has used occupied Donbas as a springboard for new attacks. She believes that negotiations with Russia would give a signal to other dictators with nuclear weapons that aggression against peaceful states can be unpunished. Karp also stated that agreeing to concessions would mean that the sacrifices of all military personnel, medics, and civilians since 2014 were in vain. She urged not to compromise with evil and to fight against it. Many Ukrainians supported Karp's words and expressed their outrage towards those who call for peace.

**Ukraine Seeks New Conference with Russia Before US Elections**
According to Bloomberg, Ukraine is seeking to hold a new conference with Russia before the US elections in November. The conference aims to achieve a peaceful and fair settlement in Ukraine. In June, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that Russia had not received any requests regarding the possibility of holding a new conference on the Ukrainian crisis. A previous conference was held on June 15-16 in Switzerland, initiated by Ukraine without inviting Russia. Many countries, including Armenia, Bahrain, Brazil, and others, refused to sign the final statement of the conference. Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated that the conference was a complete failure and cannot be the basis for a sustainable peace. In related news, a diplomatic source revealed that the information about the date and location of the next conference on Ukraine is unclear, but Saudi Arabia is being considered as a potential location. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the start of negotiations with Ukraine requires Ukraine to withdraw its troops from all territories in Russia, including the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Putin emphasized that the military operations will stop immediately after Ukraine agrees to this condition, and Ukraine must officially notify Moscow of its withdrawal from NATO plans. Russia demands that Ukraine remain a neutral country, free from nuclear weapons, to achieve a peaceful settlement. Moscow has repeatedly stated that it is ready to negotiate, but Ukraine has imposed a legal ban on this, while the West ignores Ukraine's refusal to engage in dialogue.

Russia's nuclear threat and the TNP. In March 2022, the world was shocked by a video showing Putin ordering his Defense Minister to put his nuclear arsenal on high alert, threatening to use nuclear weapons in response to Western involvement in the Ukraine conflict. Since then, Putin has repeatedly spoken about his willingness to use nuclear weapons, citing the need to protect Russia's sovereignty and independence. This has been accompanied by statements about conducting tactical nuclear tests, developing hypersonic missiles, and transferring missiles to Belarus. Russia's actions have been met with concern from the international community, as they violate the legal framework established after World War II, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (TNP), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The TNP aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, promote disarmament, and ensure the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Russia's actions put the entire international community at risk, including Latin America, which has been declared a nuclear-free zone through the Treaty of Tlatelolco. The article concludes that Russia is in violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter, which prohibits the threat or use of force in international relations. The author hopes that the upcoming review of the TNP in 2026 will address these concerns and promote a more peaceful and secure world.

**More Russians Believe Nuclear Weapons Use in Ukraine War is Justified**
A survey conducted by the Russian non-governmental research organization 'Levada-Center' shows that the number of Russians who do not oppose the use of nuclear weapons in a war against Ukraine has increased. 10% of respondents believe that such actions by Russia would be 'unconditionally justified', while 24% think they would be 'justified sooner or later'. A year ago, in April 2023, 19% of Russians held such views. However, most respondents - 52% - are not in favor of such a prospect. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has stated that Russia will use all means, including nuclear weapons, if there is a threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. He has also noted that the nuclear doctrine is 'alive' and can be modified. Will Putin use nuclear weapons in the near future, considering his recent statements? The article 'New Nuclear Blackmail. What Putin is thinking this time?' by Vladimir Kravchenko explores this question.

**FSB discovers cache of Ukrainian explosives in Donetsk People's Republic**
The FSB discovered a cache of Ukrainian saboteurs' explosives in the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR). According to TASS, citing the regional FSB office, the cache was found in the Volodarskoye region. The saboteurs left over 20 units of weapons and explosives, as well as 300 cartridges for small arms. The FSB reported that the cache was created in 2022 for carrying out terrorist attacks in the DNR. All explosive devices were removed from the cache and destroyed on a specialized range. This is not the first discovery of a large cache of weapons and ammunition in the region. On July 1, the MVD found a large batch of weapons and ammunition in a forest near the cemetery 'Ostrovskaya Mogila' in Lugansk. The cache included 2640 cartridges for 7.62mm, 400 cartridges for 12.7mm, 360 F-1 grenades, three RPG-78 shots, a main part of an RPG-7 shot, five TM-62 mines, and 125 M-6 detonators. The entire arsenal was handed over to the Russian Ministry of Defense for destruction. The special operation in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, with the goal of protecting the residents of Donbass, demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine. Russian forces took control of LPR and most of DNR, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. In the fall of 2022, these territories became part of Russia. Since October 19, 2022, a state of war has been introduced in the new regions.

**North Korea May Not Dare to Launch Nuclear Attack on Ukraine**
According to Maxim Yali, a political scientist, North Korea cannot respond to Ukraine's actions on occupied territories, let alone launch a strategic nuclear attack. Yali explained to 24 Channel that Ukraine has been killing Russian citizens on its territory for eight years, and even during a successful Ukrainian offensive in 2022, Vladimir Putin did not use nuclear weapons. Therefore, such actions from North Korea are unlikely. North Korean nuclear missiles usually fall in the Japan Sea and are used as a threat to South Korea, Japan, and the US. None of these weapons have ever flown to Ukraine, which is over 7,000 kilometers away. Even if a nuclear missile were to fall on Russian territory, China would not allow it. Beijing would be forced to impose sanctions on North Korea. In October 2022, China intervened, recalling its participation in the Budapest Memorandum. China officially stated that the use of tactical or strategic weapons is unacceptable, as it is a strategic weapon. If even Putin were to make a few statements and hold private meetings or negotiations, North Korea would not be mentioned, considering its total dependence on Beijing, emphasized Maxim Yali.

**Russia's 'Dumb Bombs' Fall on Russian Soil, Causing Chaos**
Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine with glide bombs, with over 800 bombs launched in a week, according to the 'Telegraph'. The Soviet-era weapons, equipped with precise guidance systems, target important Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demands an end to Western arms restrictions to destroy the bomb carriers, including Russian fighter jets. However, a report by the 'Washington Post' reveals that a significant number of these weapons have not reached their target. Instead, they often land on Russian soil due to faulty guidance systems. Internal Russian documents, intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence and obtained by the 'Washington Post', show that at least 38 bombs fell in the Belgorod region, adjacent to Ukraine, between April 2023 and April 2024, with at least four bombs landing directly in the city of Belgorod. The Soviet-era weapons, known as 'dumb bombs', were modernized with guidance systems, but often fail. In most cases, residents narrowly escaped disaster as the bombs often did not detonate. The Russian Defense Ministry seems unaware of the exact launch times, suggesting that some of these launches may have gone unnoticed for days. Russia is trying to upgrade its outdated bombs with UMPK kits, which include foldable wings and navigation systems, to make them suitable for modern warfare.

**Russian Glide Bombs Fall on Russian Territory, Causing No Detonation**
According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, at least 38 Russian-made glide bombs, which were used in attacks on Ukraine, have fallen on Russian territory, specifically in the Belgorod region, near the Ukrainian border, between April 2023 and April 2024. The majority of the bombs did not detonate. The bombs were discovered by local residents, including foresters, farmers, and villagers. At least four bombs fell on the city of Belgorod, and seven were found in nearby suburbs. The ISW (Institute for the Study of War) previously reported that civilians were injured during a recent Ukrainian attack on Crimea, and experts analyzed the data and concluded that the victims were caused by Russian military actions. One rocket was deflected from its trajectory by Russian air defense systems and exploded in mid-air over Sevastopol, injuring 124 people, including 27 children, and killing 5 people, including 3 children.

**WWIII on brink as Russia advised to ‘demonstrate' nuclear explosion to ‘scare' West**
Dmitry Suslov, a top figure at the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defence Policy, has suggested that Russia conduct a 'demonstrative' nuclear detonation to deter the West from supporting Ukraine. This proposal comes as tensions between Russia and the West escalate over Ukraine's use of Western-supplied weaponry. Suslov believes that a non-combat nuclear explosion would remind Western politicians of the fear of nuclear war, which has prevented conflicts between great powers since 1945. The proposal has raised concerns among Western security circles, with worries that Russia may be edging towards carrying out such a test.

**Putin Calls for Resumption of Production of Banned Missiles**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for the resumption of production of short- and medium-range missiles, which were banned under an agreement with the United States, which was terminated in 2019. Putin emphasized that these systems, with a range of 500-5500 kilometers, should be returned to production. In the past year, Putin has canceled the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty amid rising tensions with the West due to the war in Ukraine. In October, Russia conducted missile tests as part of exercises aimed at preparing its forces for a potential nuclear strike. The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1996, aims to prevent all nuclear tests. However, the non-participation of major countries such as the United States and China prevented its full implementation. Putin had previously stated that he was not ready to determine whether Russia would conduct live nuclear tests, but praised the development of new missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Since the start of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, Putin has taken multiple positions on nuclear weapons, including deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus in the summer of 2023. In October, the Russian State Duma passed a law related to global security, with the Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin stating that this vote came in response to what he described as the 'abysmal' attitude of the United States towards its international commitments. In another context, Russia withdrew from the 'New Start' nuclear disarmament treaty in February, which was the last bilateral agreement between Moscow and Washington on this issue.

**Explosion at Kiev Energy Facility, Russia Continues to Target Ukraine's Infrastructure**
A blast occurred at an energy facility in the Shevchenkovsky district of Kiev, according to Kiev's mayor Vitaliy Klichko in his Telegram channel. The explosion sparked a fire, and emergency services were dispatched to the scene. The exact location of the facility was not specified. Later, Klichko explained that the explosion was caused by a short circuit on a transformer substation, and no one was injured. Additionally, explosions were reported in Kiev and Starokostiantyniv, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, in the morning, with an air raid siren sounding. Ukrainian media also reported new explosions in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. Russia has been targeting Ukraine's military and energy infrastructure since the Crimean Bridge explosion on October 8, 2022. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov explained that Russian forces do not attack social objects in Ukraine, but use high-precision weapons to destroy targets with a direct or indirect connection to Ukraine's military potential.

**Russia's New Weapon Will 'Break the Back' of Ukraine's Air Defense System**
Russian forces will break the back of Ukraine's air defense system with the help of FAB-3000 M54 bombs, according to Brandon Weichert, an analyst at National Interest. These bombs cover a large area and are difficult to intercept. If mass-produced, they will crush Ukraine's air defense and break the back of its air strategy, Weichert wrote. He believes that FAB-3000 M54 marks the beginning of a new phase of special operations, in which the Ukrainian military will find it harder to defend against air targets. The Russian military has been targeting Ukrainian infrastructure since October 2022, with attacks on energy, defense industry, military command, and communication facilities across the country. The air raid sirens in Ukraine sound almost daily, sometimes nationwide. According to the press secretary of the President, Russian forces do not target residential areas and social infrastructure during battles with the Ukrainian military.

**Russia Accuses US of Importing Radioactive Substances into Ukraine for 'Dirty Bomb'**
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Pentagon is importing radioactive substances into Ukraine for further disposal. The substances are mainly being transported through Poland and Romania, said Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian military's radiation, chemical, and biological protection forces. The substances can be used to create and use a 'dirty bomb'. The Ukrainian government can use the 'dirty bomb' under a foreign flag. A 'dirty bomb' is a simple form of radiological weapon that causes damage not from the explosion itself, but from the spread of radioactive material. Experts consider one type of 'dirty bomb' to be the destruction of non-nuclear facilities using radioactive materials. Russia has previously accused Ukraine of planning to use a 'dirty bomb' on its territory. The first time this was reported was in the fall of 2022. According to American media, the US was preparing for a possible Russian nuclear strike on Ukraine. Sources from CNN claimed that Russia's accusations were seen by US authorities as a pretext to do something crazy. In September 2023, Yuri Kokov, the deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council, stated that Ukraine allegedly planned to detonate a 'dirty bomb' on its territory and blame Russia for it. According to him, this plan was being developed by the Ukrainian government with the help of Western consultants.

**Russia Accuses Ukraine of Importing Hazardous Waste for 'Dirty Bomb' Creation**
Russia's Ministry of Defense announced that they are importing radioactive and hazardous chemical waste to Ukraine, which could be used to create a 'dirty bomb'. According to Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Defense Forces, the substances could be used to create a 'dirty bomb' and then used 'under a false flag'. The Ministry of Defense made this conclusion based on operational information. Kirillov added that Ukraine continues to receive radioactive and chemical substances for disposal, with the main routes passing through Poland and Romania. The head of Ukraine's presidential office, Andrey Yermak, is overseeing these shipments. In October last year, it was reported that Kiev was preparing a provocation on Ukraine involving the detonation of a 'dirty bomb' or a small nuclear explosive device, aiming to accuse Russia of using weapons of mass destruction and launch an anti-Russian campaign worldwide.

Ukrainian tarologist Yana Pasynkova, winner of the 'Battle of Psychics' project, shared her predictions for Ukraine in a recent video. She discussed the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine, stating that it is a matter of time before it happens. According to Pasynkova, Russia will use nuclear weapons by 2029, which will ultimately harm itself. She also predicted that Ukraine will continue to attack Russia and that the country will increase its political influence over the aggressor. Pasynkova emphasized that the best news is not just about striking back, but about increasing one's influence to overcome the 'orcs'.

**Russia to Respond Strongly to Ukraine's Attack on Crimea, Says Foreign Correspondent**
Russia will strongly react to Ukraine's large-scale attack on the Crimean Peninsula, according to foreign correspondent Bernard Hammelburg. 'The Russians will launch attacks with glide bombs and threaten to use the nuclear argument again.' Ukraine launched a large-scale attack on the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. According to Russia, five people, including three children, were killed and at least 125 others were injured. 'In the agreement, it is stated that these weapons can be used on internal territory. Then you can ask: what about Crimea?' Hammelburg, foreign commentator. According to the foreign commentator, it is almost certain that Russia will respond with a strong reaction. 'For example, by launching attacks with glide rockets, old-fashioned bombs with wings and GPS system,' he said. 'And the Russians will also threaten the nuclear argument again in the coming days. They do this as a kind of conditional reflex.' It is unclear whether Ukraine was allowed to carry out this attack with American weapons. 'In the agreement, it is stated that these weapons can be used on internal territory. Then you can ask: what about Crimea? According to international law, that part of Ukraine.' The attack on the Crimean Peninsula has strategic importance, Hammelburg thinks. Many observers believe that 'a turning point in the war is only possible if Ukraine, with Western support, attacks the Crimean Peninsula.' This could be the start of it, he thinks. Another Ukrainian success is the attack on an Iranian drone factory in Krasnodar. 'Even here, the question arises whether it was allowed to use Western weapons, this will be legally very exciting,' he said. But a military success was certainly achieved. 'This is a slap in the face for the Russians. If you can take down a whole factory, you've really hit a home run.'
