Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Current market caps (as of Feb 13, 2024):
- Apple: ~$2.89 trillion
- Nvidia: ~$1.82 trillion

2. Key considerations:
- Nvidia has seen explosive growth due to AI demand, rising ~230% in the past year
- Apple has been relatively flat, facing challenges in China market and iPhone sales
- The timeframe is about 7 months from now
- AI momentum continues to favor Nvidia
- However, Nvidia's valuation is already quite high with P/E ratio over 80
- Market volatility and potential tech sector corrections could affect both companies

3. Scenarios:
- For Nvidia to overtake Apple, it needs to gain about $1.1T in market cap and/or Apple needs to decline
- This would require either:
  a) Continued AI boom and strong earnings from Nvidia
  b) Significant decline in Apple's valuation
  c) Combination of both

4. Given recent trends and momentum, but accounting for high valuations and market risks:
- I estimate roughly 30-40% chance of this occurring by September 2024
- The tight timeframe makes this less likely than if it was a longer-term prediction

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 42.30%, with 33.90% being the most likely. Probability: 33.90%.
