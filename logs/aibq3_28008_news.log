**2024 U.S. mortgage seesaw back down, says Freddie Mac**
Freddie Mac reports that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.46% for the week ending Aug. 22, down from 6.49% last week. According to Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, 'Although mortgage rates have stayed relatively flat over the past couple of weeks, softer incoming economic data suggest rates will gently slope downward through the end of the year.' Khater believes that rates will need to decline another percentage point to generate buyer demand. Meanwhile, Dayton-area home sales have been climbing, with local home and condo transactions increasing every month this year, including in July.

**2024 U.S. mortgage rates up slightly after substantive dip, says Freddie Mac**
According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.49% for the week ending Aug. 15, up from 6.47% last week. Despite the slight increase, mortgage rates remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year. Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said, 'While rates increased slightly this week, they remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year.' He also noted that lower rates are good news for potential buyers and sellers alike, and that rates are likely to trend down in the coming months as inflation continues to slow. In related news, Dayton-area home sales have been climbing recently, with local home and condo transactions increasing every month this year, including in May.

**2024 U.S. mortgage rates take substantive dip, says Freddie Mac**
According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.47% for the week ending Aug. 8, down from 6.73% last week. This is the lowest level in over a year, said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. 'Mortgage rates plunged this week to their lowest level in over a year following the likely over-reaction to a less than favorable employment report and financial market turbulence for an economy that remains on solid footing,' Khater said. The decline in mortgage rates increases prospective homebuyers' purchasing power and is already providing existing homeowners the opportunity to refinance, with the refinance share of market mortgage applications reaching nearly 42 percent, the highest since March 2022. This comes as Dayton-area home sales have been climbing, with local home and condo transactions increasing every month this year, including in May.

**US Mortgage Rates Hit Lowest Level in Over a Year**
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate in the US has reached a low of 6.47% this week, according to Freddie Mac. This is the lowest level in over a year, following a probable overreaction to a less-than-favorable employment report and market financial turmoil. 'The drop in mortgage rates increases the purchasing power of potential homebuyers and should start to pique their interest in making a move,' said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. 'Additionally, this drop in rates is already giving some existing homeowners the opportunity to refinance, with the refinance share of mortgage applications reaching nearly 42%, the highest since March 2022.' The 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.47% on average as of August 8, 2024, down from 6.73% the previous week, and 6.96% a year ago. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.63% on average, down from 5.99% the previous week, and 6.34% a year ago.

**US 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edges up to 6.78%, Freddie Mac says**
The average rate on the US 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.78% for the week ending July 25, according to Freddie Mac. Despite the lower rates, buyers are still hesitant to enter the market, with existing home sales falling 5.4% in June to the slowest rate since December. Housing inventory, however, has jumped to the highest in nearly four years, leading to a slow shift from a seller's market to a buyer's market. Homeowners are holding on to properties with lower rates, and rising home insurance premiums are hurting affordability. Economists expect borrowing costs to ease further later this year as the Federal Reserve shifts to interest rate cuts.

**30-year rate stays at 6.35%**
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the United States remained at 6.35% this week, according to Freddie Mac. This is the same rate as last week and is the lowest it has been since May 11, 2023. The rate has fallen from 7.12% a year ago. Meanwhile, the average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 5.47% from 5.51% last week. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate later this month, which could lead to further decreases in mortgage rates. However, elevated mortgage rates have kept many would-be homebuyers on the sidelines, extending the nation's housing slump into its third year. The National Association of Realtor's pending home sales index fell 5.5% in July from the previous month, suggesting a possible pullback in sales of previously occupied U.S. homes for August or September.

**Mortgage Rates Remained Flat This Week**
According to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.35 percent as of September 5, 2024, remaining unchanged from last week. This is a decrease from 7.12 percent a year ago. Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's Chief Economist, stated, 'Mortgage rates remained flat this week as markets await the release of the highly anticipated August jobs report.' Despite declining mortgage rates, home sales have been lackluster, but homeowners who bought in recent years are taking advantage of lower rates to reduce their monthly payments.

**Mortgage Rates Climb Again, Moving a Bit Above Last Week's 16-Month Low - Sept. 3, 2024**
Mortgage rates have increased by 2 basis points to 6.33% for 30-year new purchase mortgages, after reaching a 16-month low of 6.25% on Wednesday. Rates for other types of mortgages, such as FHA and 15-year fixed, have also shown minor changes. According to Freddie Mac, the weekly average of 30-year mortgage rates dropped 11 basis points to 6.35% last week, marking the lowest weekly average since May 2023. The Federal Reserve's decision to raise the federal funds rate has had a significant impact on mortgage rates over the past two years, and a reduction in rates is expected at the next meeting, which will conclude on September 18.

**2024 U.S. mortgage rates tick down again, says Freddie Mac**
According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.35% for the week ending Aug. 29, down from 6.46% last week. This marks the second consecutive week of decline in U.S. mortgage rates. As reported by Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, 'Mortgage rates fell again this week due to expectations of a Fed rate cut.' Khater also stated that rates are expected to continue their decline, but a rebound in purchase activity remains elusive until further declines are seen. Meanwhile, local home sales in the Dayton area have been increasing, with local home and condo transactions rising every month this year, including in July.

**Mortgage Rates Inch Up, But Keep Close to 16-Month Low – Aug. 30, 2024**
Mortgage rates inched up by 6 basis points on Thursday, reaching 6.31% for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. This is still close to the 16-month low of 6.25% reached on Wednesday. Rates for other types of mortgages, such as 15-year and jumbo 30-year, also showed minor changes. According to Freddie Mac, the weekly average for 30-year mortgage rates dropped to 6.35%, the lowest since May 2023. The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain the federal funds rate and signal a potential rate cut has contributed to the recent stability in mortgage rates. It's essential to shop around for the best mortgage rate and compare rates regularly, as rates can vary widely across lenders.

**Mortgage Rates Continue to Drop**
According to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.35 percent as of August 29, 2024, down from 6.46 percent the previous week and 7.18 percent a year ago. Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's Chief Economist, stated, 'Mortgage rates fell again this week due to expectations of a Fed rate cut.' He added, 'Rates are expected to continue their decline and while potential homebuyers are watching closely, a rebound in purchase activity remains elusive until we see further declines.' The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also saw a decline, averaging 5.51 percent, down from 5.62 percent the previous week and 6.55 percent a year ago.

**Current Mortgage Rates: Week of August 26 to August 30, 2024**
Freddie Mac's mortgage rates have dropped to their lowest point in over a year, with the 30-year fixed rate loan being more than three-quarters of a percentage lower than it was this time last year. According to Money, the current mortgage rates for August 29, 2024 are: 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.53%, 15-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.074%, 7/1 ARM at 6.385%, and 10/1 ARM at 6.549%. The rates are expected to slowly decline, averaging around 6.3% by the end of the year. It's recommended to shop around for the best rate and consider factors such as loan term, loan type, and credit score to get the lowest rate. Additionally, buying discount points can reduce the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points. A rate lock can also help guarantee a competitive rate and affordable monthly payments.

**Mortgage Interest Rates Today, August 29, 2024**
Mortgage interest rates have been trending down for several months, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.46% this week, according to Freddie Mac. This is a decrease of three basis points from the previous week. Despite the low rates, interest in buying a home has been relatively subdued. However, as rates continue to drop, demand is expected to pick up, setting the stage for a busy homebuying season in 2025. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the most common type of home loan, offering predictability but with a higher rate than shorter terms or adjustable rates. Average 15-year mortgage rates were 5.62% this week, a four-basis-point decrease from the previous week. A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage may be a good fit for those looking to spend less on interest over the life of their loan, but with a higher monthly payment. Mortgage rates are expected to trend down in the coming months and years as inflation comes down and the Federal Reserve cuts the federal funds rate. For homeowners looking to leverage their home's value, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a good option while waiting for mortgage rates to ease. Current HELOC rates are relatively low compared to other loan options.

**Mortgage Rates Inch Up from 16-Month Low – Aug. 28, 2024**
Mortgage rates have inched up from a 16-month low, with 30-year fixed rates rising to 6.33%. This is just above the 6.28% reading seen on Monday and August 5, which was the cheapest average since April 2023. Rates have dropped significantly from their July high of 7.08% and the historic 23-year high of 8.01% reached last October. The rates are influenced by a complex interaction of macroeconomic and industry factors, including the Federal Reserve's bond-buying policy and the federal funds rate. The Fed has maintained the federal funds rate at its current level since last July, and is hesitant to start cutting rates until inflation falls sufficiently and sustainably. According to Freddie Mac, the weekly average of 30-year mortgage rates dipped to 6.46% last week, after plunging to its lowest weekly average since May 2023. It's essential to shop around for the best mortgage option and compare rates regularly, as rates vary widely across lenders.

**Daily mortgage rates for August 26, 2024: Average rates on 30-year, 15-year terms edge lower to open week**
Mortgage rates have cooled down, with the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6.51% for purchase and 6.49% for refinance, down 5 basis points from last week. The Federal Reserve is expected to make the first of many rate cuts at its next meeting in September, after Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the 'time has come' to lower the Fed's benchmark. Economists estimate at least one rate cut this year, with an additional four cuts anticipated in 2025. The current rate for a 15-year mortgage is 5.91% for purchase and 5.94% for refinance, down 4 basis points from last week. 'Although mortgage rates have stayed relatively flat over the past couple of weeks, softer incoming economic data suggest rates will gently slope downward through the end of the year,' says Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. 'Earlier this month, rates plunged and are now lingering just under 6.5 percent, which has not been enough to motivate potential homebuyers. We expect rates likely will need to decline another percentage point to generate buyer demand.'

**US Mortgage Interest Rates Hit 15-Month Low**
The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage in the US has decreased to its lowest level in 15 months, providing relief for homebuyers in a market that remains out of reach for many. According to Freddie Mac, the interest rate dropped from 6.49% last week to 6.46% this week. This is the lowest rate since mid-May 2023, when it was 6.39%. Additionally, the average interest rate for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also fell, from 5.66% last week to 5.62%. Freddie Mac reports that this rate was 6.55% a year ago. Experts expect interest rates to continue to decline this year, as decreasing inflation and a cooling job market increase the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting its interest rate in September, a move that would be the first in four years.

**US new home sales rise more than expected in July**
New home sales in the US rose 10.6% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 739,000 units, exceeding economists' expectations. The Commerce Department's Census Bureau reported the increase, citing a drop in mortgage rates as a key factor. According to Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.46% this week, the lowest since May 2023. This decline in interest rates is expected to stimulate sales in the future, particularly with the Federal Reserve signaling a potential interest rate cut in September. However, other housing data has been mixed, with existing home sales rising but single-family housing starts dropping to a 16-month low.

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has eased under 6.50% as of Friday, August 23, 2024, according to Freddie Mac's weekly Prime Mortgage Market Survey. The current average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.49% for purchase and 6.45% for refinance. Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, expects rates to gently slope downward through the end of the year, but notes that rates will likely need to decline another percentage point to generate buyer demand. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates next month, which could lead to a surge in demand from first-time homebuyers. However, concerns may linger from the latest jobs report, which revealed softer job growth and a higher unemployment rate than expected. Economists estimate at least one rate cut this year, with an additional four cuts anticipated in 2025.

**US Mortgage Rate Falls to 6.46%, Lowest in 15 Months**
According to a report published by Freddie Mac, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage in the US has fallen to 6.46%, its lowest level in 15 months, down from around 8%. Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac, noted that 'although mortgage rates have remained relatively stable in recent weeks, weaker economic data suggests that rates will fall slightly by the end of the year.' This is good news for homeowners and buyers who have been deterred from the housing market due to rising interest rates and increasing home prices. However, Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the NAR, pointed out that 'despite the modest gain, home sales remain slow.' Existing home sales in June increased by 1.3% on an annual adjusted seasonally rate of 3.95 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. Additionally, 15-year fixed mortgage rates also decreased last week from 5.66% to 5.62%, down from 6.55% a year ago. Experts anticipate a further decline in mortgage rates in the coming months. Since 2022, the housing market has been heavily impacted by rising inflation and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes to combat inflation and reach its 2% target.

**Average 30-year Mortgage Rate Hovers Around Lowest Level Since May 2023: Freddie Mac**
The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has remained steady at around 6.5 percent, its lowest level in over a year, according to Freddie Mac data. Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac, stated, 'While rates increased slightly this week, they remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year.' The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has been declining since peaking at 7.79 percent in October 2023. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage edged up to 5.66 percent, but is still down from 6.46 percent last year. Refinancing demand has increased by 117 percent compared to the same time last year, and overall mortgage applications have risen by nearly 17 percent, the highest level since January 2023. However, industry experts believe that the housing market will not experience a sharp downturn due to the lack of supply and elevated demand, but market conditions may come into better balance.

**Mortgage Rates Remain at the Lowest Level in Over a Year By Investing.com**
According to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.49 percent, remaining more than half a percent lower than the same time last year. As stated by Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's Chief Economist, 'While rates increased slightly this week, they remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year.' The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has trended down from nearly 8 percent in 2023, and is expected to continue to decrease as inflation slows. This is good news for potential buyers and sellers, as lower rates make it easier for them to purchase or sell homes.

**Mortgage rates tick up on weekly basis, but remains at lowest level in over a year**
Mortgage rates have increased slightly from last week, but remain at their lowest level in over a year. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.49% as of August 15, up from 6.47% last week, but down from 7.09% in the same period last year. According to Freddie Mac's chief economist, Sam Khater, 'While rates increased slightly this week, they remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year.' Khater also noted that lower rates are beneficial for both potential buyers and sellers, as they nearly hit 8% in 2023, causing a slowdown in the housing market. As inflation continues to slow, the 30-year fixed-rate is expected to trend down in the coming months.

**U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage steadies near 15-month low, Freddie Mac says**
The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the US steadied near a 15-month low this week, according to Freddie Mac. The rate averaged 6.49% during the week ending August 15, up slightly from 6.47% in the prior week. Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater stated, 'Now, the 30-year fixed-rate hovers around 6.5 percent and will likely trend down in the coming months as inflation continues to slow.' Mortgage applications increased by nearly 17% last week, driven by a 35% jump in refinances and a 3% increase in purchase applications. MBA Chief Executive Bob Broeksmit noted, 'While the refinances remain strong, we expect that the purchase market will continue to gain momentum as mortgage rates continue to fall.'

**Why Mortgage Rates in the US Are Lower Than Ever**
For the second time in a week, Freddie Mac has announced a new drop in the average interest rate for mortgages in the US, reaching its lowest level in over a year. According to Freddie Mac, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell from 6.73% to 6.47%, its lowest level since May last year, when it was 6.39%. Additionally, it has fallen by 0.49% over the past 12 months, and the new figure represents a reduction of more than one percentage point compared to the 2023 maximum of 7.79% in October. Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac, stated, 'The drop in mortgage rates increases the purchasing power of potential homebuyers and should start to awaken their interest in making a change,' and added: 'This drop in rates is already giving some homeowners the opportunity to refinance.' The drop in mortgage rates is influenced by the way the bond market reacts to the Federal Reserve's decisions. As a result, according to ABC News, experts attribute the drop to the expectation of the Fed's interest rate cut. A weaker-than-expected employment report could have reinforced the Fed's decision, causing a drop in the yields of 10-year Treasury bonds, which are often used as a guide to set the price of mortgage loans. Experts predict that when the Fed begins to cut interest rates, mortgage rates will also fall. According to the MBA, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is expected to end the year at an average of 6.1%. Fannie Mae predicts that the 30-year mortgage rate will close 2024 at an average of 6.4%. Trading Economics predicts a drop to 4.25% in 2024 and 3.25 in 2025.

**Mortgage Rates Hold Steady After Modest Dip – Aug. 13, 2024**
The 30-year mortgage rate average held steady at 6.49% on Monday, after a dip on Friday. This is just 21 basis points higher than the 16-month low of 6.28% reached last week. Rates on 15-year mortgages were also flat, keeping the average at 5.58%. Jumbo 30-year rates gave up a single basis point, resting at a 6.74% average. The current mortgage rates are far below the historic highs of 7.08% and 8.01% reached in July and October, respectively. According to Freddie Mac, the weekly average of 30-year mortgage rates plunged 26 basis points to 6.47%, its lowest weekly average since May 2023. It's essential to shop around for the best mortgage option and compare rates regularly, as rates vary widely across lenders.

**Mortgage Interest Rates Today, August 13, 2024 | Is It Finally a Good Time to Buy a Home?**
As of August 13, 2024, the average 30-year mortgage rate is around 6.11%, according to Zillow data. However, this rate is expected to decrease further as the Federal Reserve cuts the federal funds rate. Traders are currently betting that central bankers could slash rates by as much as 100 basis points by the end of 2024, which would likely remove upward pressure on mortgage rates. With lower rates, more hopeful homebuyers should be able to jump into the market, but this may also push home prices up more quickly. It's recommended to consider starting the homebuying process now to avoid big increases in prices down the road. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the most common type of home loan, offering predictability but with a higher rate than shorter terms or adjustable rates. Average 15-year mortgage rates fell to 5.63% last week, according to Freddie Mac data, making it a good fit for those looking to spend less on interest over the life of their loan.

**2024 U.S. mortgage rates take substantive dip, says Freddie Mac**
According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.47% for the week ending Aug. 8, down from 6.73% last week. This is the lowest level in over a year, said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. 'Mortgage rates plunged this week to their lowest level in over a year following the likely over-reaction to a less than favorable employment report and financial market turbulence for an economy that remains on solid footing,' Khater said. The decline in mortgage rates increases prospective homebuyers' purchasing power and is already providing existing homeowners the opportunity to refinance, with the refinance share of market mortgage applications reaching nearly 42 percent, the highest since March 2022. This comes as Dayton-area home sales have been climbing, with local home and condo transactions increasing every month this year, including in May.

**Why are mortgage rates falling, and how long will they continue to decrease? Insights from experts**
Mortgage rates have been falling since October 2023, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate decreasing to 6.47% in the week ended August 8, its lowest level since May 2023. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it is prepared to begin cutting rates, which could lead to lower mortgage rates. According to Fannie Mae, the 30-year rate is expected to fall to 6.3% in the third quarter of 2024. However, even at these levels, rates may still be too high for many homebuyers. Doug Duncan, Chief Economist at Fannie Mae, notes that reduced demand in the housing market means that even with more houses on the market, actual home sales have not picked up. Freddie Mac estimates that rates on 30-year home loans will fall to an average under 6.5% in 2025. However, a rate cut in 2024 may not be enough to ease affordability constraints for homebuyers, particularly those who may lose their jobs as unemployment continues to tick up.

The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the USA has fallen to 6.47%, its lowest level in over a year, according to Freddie Mac. This is a welcome affordability boost for prospective homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate.

**US 30-Year Mortgage Rates Fall to Lowest Level in Over a Year**
The average rate for a 30-year mortgage in the US has fallen to its lowest level in over a year, a positive development for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance their mortgage at a lower rate. According to Freddie Mac, the rate fell to 6.47% from 6.73% last week. This is the second consecutive weekly decline in the average rate, and it is now at its lowest level since mid-May last year, when it was 6.39%.

After spiking to a 23-year high of 7.79% in October, the average 30-year mortgage rate has hovered around 7% this year, more than double what it was just three years ago. High mortgage rates are discouraging buyers, extending the country's housing crisis to its third year. Mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including how the bond market reacts to central bank decisions, which can change the trajectory of 10-year Treasury bond yields that lenders use as a guide to set mortgage prices. However, the recent decline in mortgage rates has already stimulated an increase in the number of homeowners looking to refinance. 'Buyers are waiting for the right moment, waiting for rates to fall further and for more inventory in the market,' said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.

Khater also noted that some homeowners could take advantage of this week's drop to refinance loans obtained over the past year at a higher rate. 'Without a shock that causes layoffs to rise, yields and mortgage rates aren't likely to keep falling,' said Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow Home Loans. 'They could even rebound slightly as [Federal Reserve] policy adjusts to prolong the economic expansion.'

**Mortgage Interest Rates Today, August 6, 2024 | Rates Plunge. Is It Finally a Good Time to Buy a House?**
Mortgage interest rates have plummeted to their lowest level in over a year, with average 30-year mortgage rates currently around 6%, according to Zillow data. This decline is attributed to weaker-than-expected labor market data and concerns of a possible economic downturn. While rates are expected to continue trending down over the next couple of years, experts warn that demand will surge and home prices will rise further. However, buying a house now will allow you to benefit from today's lower rates and any future increases in your home's value. Additionally, you can refinance into a lower monthly payment later on if rates drop further. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.73% last week, a five-basis-point decrease from the previous week, according to Freddie Mac. A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might be a good option for those looking for predictability and lower interest payments, but with a higher monthly payment. As inflation comes down, mortgage rates will recede, and most major forecasts expect rates to go down throughout the rest of 2024.

Freddie Mac's chief economist, Sam Khater, says 'mortgage rates declined to their lowest level since early February,' citing expectations of a Fed rate cut and signs of cooling inflation.

**Mortgage and refinance rates today, August 2, 2024: Lowest rates in 6 months**
Mortgage rates have decreased across the board, with the 30-year and 15-year fixed rates being the lowest they've been since early February. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed rate is currently at 6.73%, down five basis points from the previous week. Economists expect 30-year fixed mortgage rates to end the year between 6.6% and 6.7%. The Federal Reserve's decision to lower the federal funds rate in September is expected to lead to further decreases in mortgage rates. It's likely that mortgage rates will get lower in 2025, with the Federal Reserve planning to slash the federal funds rate several times next year. Homebuyers may want to consider purchasing a house soon, as waiting until autumn could result in a better rate. However, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of different mortgage terms, such as fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages, and consider factors like interest rates, loan terms, and monthly payments.

**Mortgage Interest Rates Today, July 31, 2024 | When Will Buying a Home Become Affordable Again?**
Average 30-year mortgage rates have remained below 6.5% this week, according to Zillow data. Experts predict that rates will trend down over the next couple of years as inflation drops and the Federal Reserve lowers the federal funds rate. However, it may take time for rates to fall enough to boost homebuying demand. Last month, existing-home sales fell 5.4% on both a monthly and annual basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. If the Fed starts lowering its benchmark rate soon, mortgage rates could go down further, improving affordability for borrowers. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.78% last week, according to Freddie Mac. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the most common type of home loan, offering predictability but with a higher rate than shorter terms or adjustable rates. Mortgage rates started ticking up from historic lows in 2021 and increased over three percentage points in 2022, but are expected to recede as inflation comes down. For homeowners looking to leverage their home's value, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a good option while waiting for mortgage rates to ease.

The average rate on the US 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.78% for the week ending July 25, according to Freddie Mac. Despite the lower rates, buyers are still hesitant to enter the market, with existing home sales falling 5.4% in June to the slowest rate since December. Housing inventory, however, has jumped to the highest in nearly four years, leading to a slow shift from a seller's market to a buyer's market. Homeowners are holding on to properties with lower rates, and rising home insurance premiums are hurting affordability. Economists expect borrowing costs to ease further later this year as the Federal Reserve shifts to interest rate cuts.

Freddie Mac's chief economist, Sam Khater, attributed this to buyers waiting for rates to decline further before making a purchase. The housing market has been affected by the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases since 2022, with existing-home sales reaching a 29-year low in 2023. Economists are hopeful that the anticipated start of rate cuts by the Fed could support the housing market through lowered borrowing costs in the months ahead.

**Daily mortgage rates for July 16, 2024: Rates retreat across the board**
Mortgage rates have retreated across the board, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate falling to 6.92% for purchases and 6.91% for refinances. The Federal Reserve's acknowledgement of a 'soft landing' for the economy and the likelihood of a rate cut in September may make it a good time for prospective homebuyers to start shopping for a new home. Freddie Mac's weekly mortgage report shows a 6 basis point decrease in the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to 6.89%, with the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage decreasing by 8 basis points to 6.17%. The Federal Reserve is focused on a 2% inflation goal and has kept the federal funds target interest rate steady at 5.25% to 5.50%. The next policy meeting is on July 30 and July 31, 2024, with a 91.2% chance of no rate change.
