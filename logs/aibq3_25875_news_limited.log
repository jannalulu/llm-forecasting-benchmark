**Democrats May Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party may nominate incumbent US President Joe Biden as a candidate for the 2024 presidential election, according to Bloomberg. This move aims to put an end to rumors about potential presidential replacement after Biden's poor debate performance with Republican Donald Trump. The nomination could also ensure Biden's presence on the Ohio ballot, where the registration deadline is August 7. The nomination is expected to take place on July 21 during the party's committee meeting, which will finalize the procedures before the main convention in Chicago on August 19. Meanwhile, the Republican Party is expected to officially announce Trump as their candidate at their convention in Milwaukee on July 15-18. The article notes that Biden's first debate with Trump was disastrous, with the President struggling to articulate his points and making mistakes. The Democrats are reportedly considering replacing Biden with another candidate, with some saying 'it's time for him to go.' The article concludes that the first presidential debate in the US can be characterized as a 'disaster.'

**Bloomberg: Democrats May Nominate Biden Early to End Replacement Talks**
Bloomberg reports that Democrats may nominate Joe Biden for president early, potentially on July 21, to end internal party discussions about his replacement after a poor performance in debates with Donald Trump. The potential date for the early nomination is July 21, when the party committee will meet to complete procedures before the main convention in Chicago, which will start on August 19. Democrats had planned to nominate the 81-year-old Biden to ensure his presence on the ballots in Ohio, where the candidate registration deadline ends on August 7. However, the current plans may also aim to help stop discussions about replacing Biden after the debates. Additionally, the Republican Party convention will take place in Milwaukee from July 15-18, where Donald Trump is expected to be announced as the party's candidate. After the debates between President Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump, there were talks in the Democratic Party about replacing Biden with another candidate due to his regular gaffes, weak voice, and inability to clearly express his party's position on key issues. However, it was later reported that President Joe Biden will not withdraw from the presidential election after the debates with his opponent Donald Trump.

**Biden May Be Nominated as Democratic Candidate on July 21, Ending Speculation About His Replacement**
The Democratic National Committee may nominate incumbent US President Joe Biden as the party's candidate for the upcoming elections on July 21, according to Bloomberg, citing informed sources. This move aims to 'put an end to internal party discussions about his replacement'. The committee has changed its rules to hold a vote on Biden's nomination in July. The article states that Democrats had planned to nominate the 81-year-old Biden before the party convention, but the plan may also serve another purpose: to help suppress discussions about potential replacement or an open convention after Biden's disastrous debates with Donald Trump. The article also mentions that some Democratic lawmakers consider Biden's performance in the debates to be unsuccessful and are actively discussing the idea of replacing him. Biden acknowledged his poor performance, but stated his intention to continue participating in the elections. The article also mentions that Biden's wife, Jill, his younger sister, Valerie, and his 85-year-old friend and advisor, Ted Kaufman, will make decisions about his further participation in the elections.

**Biden says he's staying in the race, winnowing fellow Dems' options to force him out**
President Joe Biden has announced that he will not resign from the Democratic presidential nomination, despite growing concerns about his cognitive decline and calls from some Democrats to replace him with a younger candidate. Biden has stated that he believes he is the best person to beat Donald Trump in the 2024 election and has two key factors in his favor: the absence of an obvious alternative consensus candidate and the essentially completed party primary. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August, and the party has planned to nominate Biden via a virtual roll call ahead of time to secure his place on the Ohio ballot. A coalition of Democratic activists has organized a 'Pass the Torch' campaign calling on Biden to drop out of the race, but Biden's refusal to step aside voluntarily has complicated Democratic efforts to find an alternative nominee.

**Democratic Committee Considers Nominating Biden for 2024 Presidential Election**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the 2024 presidential election by mid-July, following a major controversy after his debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, the decision aims to put an end to the widespread discussions within the party about replacing Biden after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter said that the likely date for Biden's official nomination is July 21. The Democrats had already planned to nominate Biden (81 years old) before the party's August convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set a final deadline of August 7 for selecting presidential candidates. Many major American media outlets have begun openly pressuring President Biden to withdraw from the election and leave the way open for a new Democratic nominee who can challenge Trump, who seems to have scored many points in the first presidential debate. The report stated that the Democratic National Committee has denied that the official nomination of Biden is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is Ohio's decision. The debate has sparked concern among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, four months before the election and about six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic members have ruled out replacing Biden and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election, and to mobilize Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.

**US Democrats Consider Nominating Biden in July to End Speculation About Alternative Candidate**
The Democratic Party of the United States is considering nominating President Joe Biden as its candidate for the November elections in July, before the party's convention in August, according to Bloomberg, citing sources. The potential date of the nomination is July 21, when the Democratic National Committee will hold a virtual meeting. This move is aimed at 'guaranteeing that the president will be included in the November ballots and helping to end internal party discussions about his replacement after last week's debates'. This would allow the party to 'come together around its candidate, even if insiders are calling for him to step aside for someone else', according to the agency. Biden received around 99% of the votes from his party's delegates at the 2024 primary, giving him 'enormous influence on the party establishment'. Meanwhile, CNN reported that 'over two dozen high-ranking Democratic officials, politicians, and donors linked to Biden and many others being considered as potential replacements for Biden' are saying that 'almost every scenario scares them: Biden's nomination, Harris's nomination, or someone else's'. Bloomberg notes that Biden spent the weekend campaigning with donors in New York and New Jersey, assuring them that he is willing to run for a second term. However, public opinion polls have shown that Biden's efforts to secure re-election are complicated by voters' concerns about his age and ability to run for a second term.

**Biden's Nomination for President Officially Set for Mid-July**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the November elections in mid-July, according to Bloomberg. The move aims to 'stop internal party discussions about replacing him after poor debates' with Donald Trump. The nomination is expected to take place on July 21, during an online meeting of the party committee. The committee will prepare for the main convention in Chicago, which starts on August 19. Bloomberg notes that party members had previously planned to nominate the 81-year-old Biden before the convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, where candidate registration is possible until August 7. The early nomination is intended to unite Democrats around the incumbent president, despite calls for him to drop out of the race in favor of another candidate. Biden has refused to withdraw, and his family has accused his campaign advisors of poor performance. Before the debates, polls showed that voters expressed concerns about Biden's age (81) and ability to fulfill his duties for a second term. At a meeting with supporters in North Carolina the day after the debates, Biden acknowledged that his age is noticeable, but tried to turn it into an advantage: 'I don't walk as easily as I used to, I don't speak as smoothly as I used to, I don't debate as well as I used to. I wouldn't run again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul that I could do this job.' The Republican National Convention is scheduled for mid-July. Before that, on July 11, Donald Trump will face a verdict on a financial document forgery case related to payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, for which he was found guilty.

**Democrats could install Biden as presidential nominee a month early**
The Democratic National Convention may install Joe Biden as their presidential nominee a month early, on July 21, to prevent suggestions of replacing him with a younger candidate. This move would come as Democratic politicians and donors urge the 81-year-old to step aside for a younger successor. However, Biden has signaled he intends to fight on, encouraged by family members. Names floated to replace him include Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer. The party has altered voting procedures to allow a potential roll-call vote before delegates convene in-person. This would mean Biden is nominated shortly after his Republican rival, Donald Trump, who will accept his party's nomination on July 18.

**Democrats Plan to Nominate Biden for President Early**
The Democratic Party of the United States has announced that it will officially nominate incumbent President Joe Biden as its candidate for the presidential election, ahead of the party's national convention on August 19. The decision is due to a law in the state of Ohio, which requires parties to submit their candidates at least 90 days before the presidential election, or they will not be included in the state's electoral lists. The exact date of the online vote on the Democratic Party's candidate has not been determined. The presidential election in the United States is scheduled for November 5, 2024.
