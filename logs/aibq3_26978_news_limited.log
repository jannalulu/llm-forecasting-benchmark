**Why the 2024 Hurricane Season Will Be Worse Than Expected**
The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be more active than usual, with several factors contributing to this prediction. Between August 20th and October 10th, 75% of all cyclonic activity in the Atlantic occurs. August is the month when meteorologists pay the most attention to the tropical zone. As of August 2024, the sea surface temperature is above 1.4°C above the average, providing fuel for intense hurricanes if favorable atmospheric conditions are met. The La Niña phenomenon is expected to return between late summer and early fall, which will coincide with the period of highest cyclonic activity in the Atlantic. This will lead to the formation and development of a greater number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. According to the Colorado State University's seasonal hurricane forecast, there will be 23 tropical storms, including the four that have formed so far. Of these, 12 are expected to be hurricanes, with six potentially reaching category 3, 4, or 5 (high-intensity hurricanes).

**National Hurricane Center tracking 'area of disturbed weather' in central Atlantic**
The National Hurricane Center is tracking an 'area of disturbed weather' in the central Atlantic, which has a low chance of development and is expected to approach the Lesser Antilles next week. The system could develop into a tropical depression, storm, or hurricane if it survives the hostile conditions. Forecasters are warning that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be extremely active, and everyone should be prepared. The peak of hurricane season runs from mid-August to mid-October, and the National Hurricane Center is monitoring three tropical waves in the Atlantic basin.

**Hurricane Season to Return in August, Predicts National Hurricane Center**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) predicts that the hurricane season will return in August due to changes in climate patterns caused by a Saharan air layer. The Atlantic has been calm for over two weeks, with no significant cyclonic activity. However, experts warn that this calm may not last long, as changes in climate patterns are expected in early August. The presence of this Saharan air layer (SAL) reduces atmospheric humidity by approximately 50%, making it difficult for clouds and thunderstorms to form, which are crucial for tropical cyclone development. The NHC does not expect the formation of new tropical storms or hurricanes in the Atlantic in the next week. As we approach August, conditions in the Atlantic tropical area are expected to become more favorable for cyclone development. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is expected to create an environment more conducive to storm development. The MJO is a phenomenon that moves eastward, affecting areas near the equator and subtropics. During the summer and fall, it can increase hurricane activity in regions with more precipitation and decrease it in areas with descending air. Models indicate that a zone of improved precipitation associated with the MJO will move over the Atlantic tropical area in early August. Although the current calm is not unusual for late July, cyclonic activity generally increases significantly in August and September. During these months, ocean temperatures are warmer, wind shear is lower, and there is less Saharan dust, conditions that favor storm development. Bryan Norcross, a hurricane expert at FOX Weather, notes: 'Tropical development typically accelerates in the second week of August. The peak date for cyclonic activity is around September 10, although the probability of storm formation increases rapidly in the weeks prior and decreases slowly during the rest of September and October'. More than 90% of hurricane activity typically occurs between August and the end of the season, according to the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, which measures the intensity and duration of all named storms throughout the season.

**N Atlantic's area of Extreme Ocean Heat Doubled Since 2004: Catastrophic 2024 Hurricanes Likely**
NOAA forecasts a highly active 2024 hurricane season, with a record-breaking heat content in the Atlantic Ocean. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) predicts 167% of the average accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), making it one of the most severe seasons on record. The combination of atmospheric conditions and water temperatures is already capable of supporting category 5 hurricanes across a wide area. While early season conditions may not be favorable, models show extremely favorable conditions for major hurricanes in August and September. The first storms forming from the Central American Gyre are unlikely to cause significant problems, but this is just the beginning of what could be one of the strongest hurricane seasons on record.

**The peak of hurricane season is near**
The peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean is near, with the majority of hurricane activity occurring from mid-August to mid-October. This season has been forecast to be above-average, with 25 total named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes predicted. According to Colorado State University, sea-surface temperatures have been well above-average prior to the start of the season, which is one of several factors leading to this prediction. However, the Atlantic has been quiet for the last month due to a large amount of Saharan dust that has been situated over the primary region where tropical waves develop. This dust inhibits tropical development by bringing in dry air and blocking sunlight, thereby cooling sea-surface temperatures. The season kicked off early, with 3 named storms forming in June, including Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl, and Tropical Storm Chris. Whenever the next tropical system forms, it will be named Debby.

**Tropical Wave in the Atlantic Could Develop into Tropical Storm Debby**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring a large tropical wave in the Atlantic Ocean that could develop into Tropical Storm Debby by the end of the week. According to the NHC, the wave is located several hundred kilometers east of the Lesser Antilles and is generating 'some rain and thunderstorm activity'. The conditions for the development of this tropical wave are becoming more favorable as it moves west-northwest over the southwestern Atlantic. The NHC notes that the system could become a tropical depression by the end of the week or over the weekend. The NHC warns that residents and authorities in the Greater Antilles, Bahamas, and the southeastern United States should be aware of the system's progress. Currently, the NHC gives a 60% chance of tropical storm formation within the next seven days. If the system's winds reach 39 mph (63 km/h), it will be named Tropical Storm Debby, making it the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, which is predicted to be extremely active. The tropical wave near the Lesser Antilles continued to cause a wide area of scattered showers and thunderstorms on Wednesday, July 31, 2024. According to the NHC report mentioned by Weather.com, the Atlantic experiences its peak hurricane activity in August, September, and October. This increase is due to factors such as the rise in water temperatures, low wind shear, and higher humidity throughout the basin. The system, moving west-northwest over the Greater Antilles and towards the Bahamas, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical depression near Florida over the weekend. The NHC reported that this perturbation has a nearly zero chance of formation in the next 48 hours, but increases to 60% in the next seven days. Meteorologists continue to closely monitor the progress of this tropical perturbation in the Atlantic, although many uncertainties remain about its future. The current medium-term probabilities indicate that it could head towards parts of the southeastern United States by early this weekend, as indicated by the NHC in its report.

**Hurricane Season Peak Time Begins In August**
The Atlantic hurricane season is in its peak months of August, September, and October, with 78% of storms, 84% of hurricanes, and 93% of U.S. landfalling hurricanes occurring during this time. According to NOAA, this three-month period is the most active for tropical storms and hurricanes, with a significant increase in storms and the risk of U.S. landfalls. The recent peak months have seen some of the most powerful and destructive hurricanes, such as Hurricane Ian, which struck Florida in 2022. The 10 most active hurricane seasons in the satellite era have generated roughly two more storms, two to three more hurricanes, and one to two Category 3 or stronger hurricanes than usual in the peak months. Several factors contribute to the seasonal ramp-up, including African easterly waves, surges of dry air, low wind shear, and rising sea-surface temperatures. It is essential to have a hurricane plan ready and to pay attention to the forecast every day through the rest of the season, as hurricane season can quickly switch from quiet to active. 'Averages are no guarantee of how a hurricane season will turn out,' but in a season expected to be very active like 2024, it signals potential danger ahead. 'Make sure you have your hurricane plan ready to go,' and 'pay attention to the forecast every day through the rest of the season.'

**Debbie, the Next Cyclone in the Atlantic: NOAA Increases Probability to 60%**
The Atlantic Ocean, which had been calm in terms of cyclone formation, may be about to end its tranquility. A combination of a tropical wave and a region of meteorological disturbances could lead to the next cyclone of the season, which would be named Debbie. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there is a 60% chance of this system developing into a named storm in the next 7 days, up from 50% the previous day. The system consists of a tropical wave located hundreds of miles west of the Lesser Antilles, which is moving westward towards the Greater Antilles. It could interact with a low-pressure area over the archipelago and extend over the Bahamas and Florida, contributing to the formation of a significant cyclone. If it develops, Debbie would be the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, following Chris and Beryl. The NOAA has increased the probability of this system developing into a named storm in the next 7 days to 60%, from 50% the previous day. The agency does not expect the storm to develop in the next 48 hours. The Atlantic hurricane season has started irregularly, with only one storm being named (Alberto) in the first month, followed by Beryl, a category 5 hurricane, in late June. After Beryl, another minor storm, Chris, and then a calm period that lasted until late July. Meteorologists have been warning of an intense hurricane season for weeks, citing two reasons: the high ocean temperatures and the possible arrival of La Niña. The accumulated heat in the ocean is notable, and with more heat, these storms can absorb more energy from the sea. La Niña is expected to arrive between August and September, and its cold phase could lead to an intense hurricane season, especially in the second half of the season.

**2024 hurricane season breaks an unusual record, thanks to hot water**
The 2024 hurricane season has broken an unusual record, with the Atlantic Ocean generating more accumulated cyclone energy than the Pacific Ocean through July 9. This is the first time in recorded history that this has happened. The warm water temperatures in the Atlantic are influencing storm activity in both oceans, with the Pacific experiencing a slower start to the season. Scientists attribute the unusually warm waters in the Atlantic to a weaker-than-normal subtropical high pressure and human-caused global warming. The trend towards a more La Niña-like climate has led to large-scale cooling over the eastern tropical Pacific over 40 years, despite predictions of a more El Niño-like climate due to human-caused climate change. Researchers are working to determine what caused the weakness in the subtropical high pressure and why it continues to persist.

**Why the 2024 Hurricane Season Will Be More Active**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has warned that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be more intense and active than usual due to a 'confluence of factors' that favor the formation of storms. The forecast predicts 13 cyclones, 7 of which could be major hurricanes. Additionally, 17 to 25 storms with sustained winds over 62 km/h could form. NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad emphasized that the forecast for named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes is the highest ever issued for May. The early arrival of Hurricane 'Beryl' is a sign of the extreme heat generated by climate change, which has caused meteorological disasters worldwide.

**NOAA Predicts 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season to be One of the Most Intense on Record**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be one of the most intense on record, with over 20 tropical storms expected in the next five months. The season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, has an 85% chance of being more active than usual. NOAA expects 17 to 25 named storms, a record in the organization's 154-year history. Of these, 8 to 13 are expected to become hurricanes with winds of 74 mph or more, and 4 to 7 could reach major hurricane categories, including categories 3, 4, or 5 with winds of 111 mph or more. The main causes of this high activity include the La Niña phenomenon and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. According to NOAA scientists, the transition from El Niño to La Niña favors the development of cyclones. Other factors include reduced trade winds and less wind shear, which facilitate the formation and strengthening of storms. Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, said, 'There are reasons to be concerned, but not alarmed. Yes, it's the highest number, but it's about being prepared. So, now is the time to be prepared.'
