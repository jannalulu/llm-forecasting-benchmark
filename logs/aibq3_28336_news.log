**Will ‘Edo Be Lagos' In 2024?**
The upcoming Edo State gubernatorial election on September 21st, 2024, is expected to be a contentious one, with Governor Godwin Obaseki facing off against his former friend and ally, Adams Oshiomhole, who is now backed by President Bola Tinubu and the All Progressives Congress (APC). Obaseki has declared the election a 'do-or-die' affair, citing the APC's efforts to manipulate the electoral process and undermine his chances of winning. The APC has been accused of using its control of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Police, and the Judiciary to rig the election. Obaseki and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), have refused to sign the peace accord, and the Governor has warned that he will not go down without a fight. The election is seen as a test of the APC's ability to manipulate the electoral process and undermine democracy in Nigeria. Obaseki has urged the international community to observe the election and hold the APC accountable for any irregularities. The PDP and Labour Party have called for public protests and rallies to raise awareness about the potential rigging of the election. The people of Edo State are being urged to exercise their right to vote and to demand that their votes count.

**All eyes on Edo gubernatorial poll**
The Edo State Governorship Election is set to take place on Saturday, September 21, 2024. The election has been a 'feisty and acrimonious' campaign period, with 16 political parties and their candidates vying for the top spot. The main contenders are Asue Ighodalo of the Peoples Democratic Party, Monday Okpebholo of the APC, and Olumide Akpata of the Labour Party. However, the fear of violence and vote-buying is a major concern, particularly after President Bola Tinubu's comment that he would 'give the state back to the people', which has raised suspicions of using state power to hijack the mandate. Governor Obaseki has questioned the need for a peace pact, citing the arrest of his party stalwarts. All stakeholders are urged to reduce tension and ensure a free and fair election.

**APC, PDP, Labour Party: Who may emerge next Edo governor?**
The Edo state governorship election is scheduled for September 21. The election is between three top candidates: Monday Okpebholo of the APC, Asue Ighodalo of the PDP, and Olumide Akpata of the Labour Party. The election is significant as it will determine the party's influence in Nigerian politics. A win for the Labour Party would validate their 2023 performance and provide them with control over a second state. For the PDP, retaining the governorship is crucial to salvage their reputation after being surpassed in the 2023 elections. A win for the APC would increase their governorship count to 21, nearing their best performance since the party's inception. President Bola Tinubu's win in Edo holds personal significance, as it would be a strategic move to expand his political influence beyond the South West.

**AA Candidate Withdraws, Backs Okpebholo**
Prince Tom Iseghhi-Okojie, the Action Alliance (AA) candidate for the Edo State governorship election, has stepped down and endorsed Senator Monday Okpebholo of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Iseghhi-Okojie stated that his decision was based on his understanding that leadership is about knowing when to join forces for the greater good of the people. He expressed his support for Okpebholo, saying that he embodies the kind of leadership that Edo State needs, citing his strategic thinking, ability to listen to people, and make tough decisions for the good of the state. Iseghhi-Okojie also stated that the collaboration between AA and APC will ensure that they can win the election decisively and bring the real change that Edo State needs. According to him, the AA's grassroots structure of 65,000 members will mobilize at least 500,000 votes. Emperor Jarrett Tenebe, the APC acting chairman, noted that the AA candidate's decision to join forces with the APC was one of the arrangements to form a government of unity, adding that governance is about empathy and anyone without empathy cannot be an instrument of development. 'Today, I am making a pivotal decision that I believe is in the best interest of our state.

**Edo governorship 2024: The real issues**
The upcoming Edo governorship election on September 21, 2024, is a battle between Adams Oshiomhole and Godwin Obaseki, two former allies who have been at odds since 2016. The election is less about good governance and more about perpetuating class hegemony. The people of Edo have suffered mediocre governance since 1999, with neglect of rural communities, lack of infrastructure, and poor healthcare. The victims are the rural poor, who have been abandoned by successive governments. The author calls on the people of Edo to demand good governance and rescue their future from political merchants. The police and INEC must ensure a fair level playing field for the election, and voters must choose a leader who is humble and kind-hearted, not a bully or a manipulator.

Godwin Obaseki, the governor of Edo State, has described the upcoming September 21 governorship election as a 'do or die' situation, where the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will resist any attempts by the opposition to win through violence and intimidation. Acting National Chairman of the PDP, Iliya Damagun, warned that the APC would need to kill or arrest all PDP members to win the election, and threatened that party members would defend their votes with their blood if election results are announced at night.

Chairman of the PDP's Board of Trustees, Adolphous Wabara, called on INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, not to announce the election result until he was certain of its accuracy, and urged Yakubu to correct the mistakes of the 2023 general elections and retire peacefully. 'This election is do or die,' Obaseki said. 'If they do, we will die.' Damagun stated, 'You have to kill or arrest all of us if you want to take this state. You may have gangs, but we have God.'

**Edo Not Lagos, You Can't Steal Our Votes**

**THE EDO OFF-SEASON GOVERNORSHIP ELECTION**
The Edo State governorship election is scheduled for September 21, 2024, and will be the first off-season election under President Bola Tinubu's watch. Tinubu's democratic credentials will be put to the test as critics question whether he will allow a free and fair election. The article highlights the precedent set by Tinubu's predecessors, including President Olusegun Obasanjo and President Muhammad Buhari, who allowed off-season elections to proceed without interference. The author argues that Tinubu should follow suit and allow the will of the people to prevail, citing examples of off-season elections in Edo, Ondo, Osun, and other states. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is also urged to redeem its image by conducting a free and fair election. As INEC Chairman Professor Mahmud Yakubu's non-renewable tenure expires next year, he has nothing to lose by doing the right thing, the author says. 'It will be a shame if a civilian like Tinubu has the predilection to muzzle out democratic rights of the people of Nigeria,' the author writes. 'INEC and its officials should atone for their sins and make peace with their creator unless they do not believe in eternity.'

**Edo guber: Defend your votes, Atiku tells electorate**
Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has urged the Edo state electorate to defend their votes during the upcoming governorship election on September 20, 2024. He also charged them to replicate their support for the PDP candidate, Dr. Asue Ighodalo, as they did in 2020 during Governor Godwin Obaseki's re-election. Atiku stated, 'in 2020, they said they will not allow us to win, but we showed them Edo is not Lagos.' He added, 'you can't come and steal vote here in Edo. Therefore, protect your vote, defend your votes, make sure your votes are entered. Escort your votes and make sure they are announced, and if you do that, no body can change your votes and you are winning come September 21.' The Chairman of the National Campaign Council, Edo 2024 Governorship Election and Governor of Adamawa State, Mr. Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, warned against a compromised electoral process, stating, 'we will tell them we know how to win election and no body will rig us out.' Governor Godwin Obaseki described the ban of the state vigilante corps by the Inspector General of Police as an existential threat, and urged for support for the PDP candidate. The Acting National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Umar Damagum, described the election as a test for Nigeria's democracy, calling on Nigerian and the international community to be alert and watch the Edo election closely to ensure it was not manipulated.

**Edo 2024 governorship: Ighodalo and other matters, by Emeka Alex Duru**
The Edo State governorship election on September 21 is a crucial moment for the state. The National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, has assured that the commission will ensure a free, fair, and credible election. However, the 2023 general elections under Yakubu's supervision were marred by controversy, leaving many Nigerians skeptical about the commission's neutrality. The security agencies in the state, particularly the Police, have also been accused of harassment and intimidation of opposition members. President Bola Tinubu's statement assuring the APC members that he will 'give Edo back to them' has raised concerns about the outcome of the election. The PDP candidate, Asue Ighodalo, stands out with a comprehensive manifesto that pledges to transform the state into a beacon of progress and prosperity. Ighodalo's person and antecedents offer hopes and assurances on what to expect if elected to office. His vision for Edo includes good governance, poverty reduction, education, and skill acquisition, as well as repositioning the healthcare system and transforming the state into the food basket of South-South Nigeria. The election is not about political parties, but about individuals and their capacities to deliver on their promises.

**PDP, APC clash over purported plan to make Edo ungovernable**
The All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP) have clashed in Edo State over a purported plan to shut down the state ahead of the governorship election. According to Prince Kassim Afegbua, the Director of Media of the APC's Campaign Council in Edo, the PDP-led administration plans to shut down the state from September 15 through mass protests, inviting the military to take over power at the federal level. However, Governor Godwin Obaseki's administration has denied the plan, citing a need to extend the school resumption date for safety reasons. Obaseki's Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Chris Nehikhare, said the decision is rooted in a commitment to protecting children from danger and threats posed by the APC, who have allegedly imported and armed thugs. Nehikhare also accused the APC of reckless behavior, including the shooting of innocent individuals, and urged the public to remain vigilant and work together to maintain peace and stability in Edo.

**Edo 2024: An easy pick, by Ochereome Nnanna**
As the Edo State Governorship Election approaches, voters are being urged to make informed decisions. The three main candidates are Asue Ighodalo of the Peoples Democratic Party, Monday Okpebholo of the All Progressives Congress, and Olumide Akpata of the Labour Party. Okpebholo is being backed by Senator Oshiomhole, who has dominated his campaign with trashy talks, including saying 'Widow, go and die' and 'They are childless' about Obaseki and his wife. Akpata is a new breed trying to leverage the Obidient Movement, while Ighodalo is a top quality pick with a solid track record of boardroom successes as an economist and corporate lawyer. The author advises Edo voters to beware of career politicians and choose an independent-minded and seasoned business leader like Ighodalo.

**Edo election: The Battle for Osadebey Avenue - A symbol of unyielding political power**
The upcoming Edo election on September 21, 2024, is a pivotal moment for the state, determining its future direction and leadership. Three leading candidates, Monday Okpebholo of the APC, Asuerinmen Ighodalo of the PDP, and Olumide Anthony Akpata of the LP, are vying for the position. The APC candidate has been criticized for avoiding engagement with the media and relying on proxies to convey his message. The PDP candidate has been actively engaging with the people, but faces challenges due to the diminishing popularity of the incumbent Governor. The LP candidate, a former NBA President, is seen as a credible alternative, but faces obstacles due to his ethnic background and senatorial district. The election's outcome will reflect the people's will, and it is crucial for electoral officials, security agents, and law enforcement personnel to safeguard the rights and safety of the Edo people. The election will be a test of democratic ideals, and the people of Edo will decide if the APC and PDP candidates' strategies are worthy of respect.

According to Prince Kassim Afegbua, Director of Media, Obaseki outlined his plan during a meeting at the Edo State Government House on September 8, 2024.

The APC Campaign Council also alleged that Obaseki is working with an Assistant Commissioner of Police to frustrate law enforcement efforts. The council called on security agencies to take urgent action to prevent a breakdown of law and order, as the Edo governorship election is just two weeks away. 'We urge the Inspector General of Police to take immediate action to prevent a national crisis,' Afegbua said. 'The APC-led Federal Government cannot afford to be distracted by Governor Obaseki's antics.'
