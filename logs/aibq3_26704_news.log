**Bill Gates to Invest 'Billions of Dollars' in Nuclear Energy Project**
Bill Gates is prepared to invest 'billions of dollars' in a nuclear energy project in Wyoming to meet the growing energy needs of the United States. According to Bloomberg, TerraPower, a startup founded by Gates, began building its first commercial reactor last week in the American state, where a coal plant is closing. Gates, the sixth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has already invested over $1 billion and plans to invest billions more in the business. The TerraPower reactor, which has the support of the US Department of Energy, was initially expected to operate in 2028, but Gates said it would be unacceptable to depend on Russian fuel, which is no longer an option. Gates emphasized the need to compete effectively with natural gas, which is surpassing coal. Carbon-free nuclear energy is increasingly seen as a key part of the fight against climate change, with more companies promoting smaller reactors. Last year, 25 countries at the COP28 in Dubai declared they want to triple their nuclear capacity.

**Gautam Adani Regains Title as Asia's Richest Person, Surpassing Mukesh Ambani**
Gautam Adani has regained the title of Asia's richest person, surpassing Mukesh Ambani, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. As of 6:00 PM on Saturday, Adani, the chairman of the Adani group, ranked 11th on the index with a net worth of $111 billion, compared to Ambani's $109 billion. The significant increase in Adani's stock price was a key factor in his rise to the top. The Adani group's aggressive expansion plans, including $90 billion in capital expenditures over the next decade, were highlighted in a Jefferies report, which boosted the company's stock. The market reacted positively, with Adani's shares increasing by 1.23 crore lakh ₹, bringing the company's total market capitalization to 17.94 crore lakh ₹ intraday. The year 2023 was challenging for the Adani group after the Supreme Court ordered an investigation into allegations made by the Hindenburg report. However, the court later ordered the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to conclude its investigation and declared that no further investigation was necessary. Adani expressed optimism about the group's future, stating that its best days are ahead. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index currently ranks Bernard Arnault as the world's richest person with a net worth of $207 billion, followed by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos with net worths of $203 billion and $199 billion respectively.

**China's richest man risks losing crown after $20 billion wipeout**
China's richest man, Zhong Shanshan, is at risk of losing his title after a $20 billion wipeout in 2024, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His wealth has slipped the most among billionaires worldwide due to intensifying competition and mishaps plaguing his bottled water giant, Nongfu Spring Co. As the economy slows and competition from upstart brands increases, Zhong's company is facing a price war in its core market and is on the wrong side of increasingly nationalistic and health-conscious Chinese consumers, as stated by the article. This reflects a complex consumer economy that is challenging businesses to navigate.

**Bernard Arnault's Fortune Plummets 20 Billion Dollars**
Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and founder of LVMH, has seen his net worth decline by 20 billion dollars this year, making him the person who has lost the most in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The decline is attributed to the poor performance of LVMH's sales in the region that includes China, which fell 14% in the last quarter. This decline is part of a broader trend in the luxury goods industry, with Burberry Group Plc and Richemont also reporting disappointing sales. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, saw his wealth decline by 21.7 billion dollars in a single day after Tesla's disappointing quarterly results, but still holds the top spot with a net worth of 240.5 billion dollars.

**Tech-rotation - This is the best AI actions**
The technology and communication sector has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI wave, with a growth of over 14% on the MSCI World Index. However, this quarter, technology and communication have performed the worst. Since the end of June, real estate and supply chain companies have led the growth. Bloomberg Intelligence has mapped out how the rotation is taking place in the AI landscape. All the best bets from Bloomberg Intelligence, as well as the fund managers and analysts they have spoken to, can be seen below in the article. Energy supply The increase in energy consumption, particularly from the technology sector, is exceeding supply in many parts of the world, according to Bloomberg. The International Energy Agency estimates that the use of data centers, AI, and cryptocurrency could double to over 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026 - roughly equivalent to Japan's current energy consumption. Equipment Transformers - equipment that helps deliver electricity - are in such short supply that if you order one today, you'll be lucky to receive it in 2028, according to Ken Liu, a Chinese analyst for supply chain companies at UBS Group AG. 'Energy production will be a very big theme, and it was already before artificial intelligence, which only increases the need for more energy consumption,' said Philipp Baertschi, investment director at Bank J. Safra Sarasin AG. 'There will be very good opportunities. But you have to know that these are very cyclical, and there is a lot of volatility.' Renewable energy The increase in energy consumption increases the risk of increased pollution, which is drawing attention to stocks in the renewable energy sector, it is said. Companies involved in solar, water, wind, and nuclear power are all mentioned as potential recipients. Especially Chinese and Dutch renewable energy stocks have received attention, it is said. Copper The raw material is a key element in electrical cables and heat exchangers that help cool down data centers. - Global copper consumption will likely be two million tons higher by 2030, with over half from the US, as electricity-hungry AI drives growth in data center capacity, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Grant Sporre. Data centers The stocks recommended within data centers are those that bet on property investments. The best bets are companies that can offer spaces that can be a hub for data processing centers that are close to both power sources and large AI customers. End-users Companies that will win by implementing technology to improve their operations. Morgan Stanley estimates that these stocks will see a 27% return this year. The industrial sector will be one of the winners in the segment. AI's ability to analyze large, complex datasets is also seen as an advantage for the healthcare sector, especially to accelerate the development of new medicines.

**KKR's Long-Term Energy Transition Strategy: A Challenge for Listed Companies**
KKR, a US-based fund, believes it is 'very difficult' to have a long-term strategy for the energy transition with a listed company. Emmanuel Lagarrigue, a KKR partner, argues that companies investing in the energy transition perform better with patient investors. 'Public markets are undoubtedly the cheapest source of capital. But at the same time, they have high volatility and short memory. It's very difficult to have a long-term strategy' for 'large-scale business transformations', he said, quoted by Bloomberg. KKR launched a takeover bid for Portuguese company Greenvolt in late 2023 and has announced its intention to take the company off the stock market. Bloomberg highlights that private equity and debt portfolio managers are emerging as a 'powerful force in climate finance' as companies struggle to attract 'sufficient investment' in a scenario of 'diminishing interest from shareholders in ambitious decarbonization plans'. The energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, high inflation, and high interest rates are complicating the energy transition, alongside a sell-off in renewable energy stocks: the S&P Global Clean Energy Index has fallen 28% compared to the S&P 500. In private markets, between 2016 and 2023, private equity allocations to renewables have consistently exceeded those to oil and gas, according to MSCI data. 'It's very difficult for a CEO to come to his shareholders and say, 'I'm going to invest three billion euros in a new asset that will radically change our carbon footprint and create new growth, but the cash flows won't come for five/seven years. This doesn't work', said Emmanuel Lagarrigue.

The funds have now reversed their trend, making long-term bets on sub-sectors including oil, gas, and consumable fuels, energy equipment and services, containers and packaging, and mining and metals. Energy stocks have recovered in 2024 due to a surge in oil and gas prices driven by stronger-than-expected global economic growth and increased tensions in the Middle East, which has seen the S&P 500 Energy Index advance 8% so far this year. In April, Bloomberg reported that hedge funds had begun selling their energy company shares, anticipating a possible short-term retreat in the energy sector. Instead, they put their money into oil options that would allow them to benefit from any possible increase in energy prices driven by the worsening conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, with a lower risk, according to Bloomberg. Metal prices have also increased dramatically in 2024, as investors expect a strong increase in demand driven by the global energy transition and the emergence of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence technologies. The S&P 500 Metals & Mining Industry Index has risen 7% so far this year, with copper prices increasing 19% and gold prices increasing 15% during the same period. In general, hedge funds also reversed their trend and became net buyers of non-US stocks for the first time in three weeks, placing their money in European and Asian companies, even as they sold their Chinese stocks. Global industrial, financial, and energy companies were the most bought, while communication services, IT services, and public services were the most sold, according to Goldman Sachs analysis.

**Ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer surpasses Bill Gates on the list of the world's richest people**
For the first time, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer surpassed Bill Gates on the list of the world's richest people, becoming the sixth on the ranking on Monday. The change occurred when Microsoft's shares reached a new record, increasing his total gain by 21% this year. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, over 90% of Ballmer's liquid assets of $157.2 billion come from Microsoft shares, while Gates' wealth is more diversified, with half of his estimated $156.7 billion fortune held by Cascade Investment, created with the value of Microsoft's stock sales and dividends. Gates has also reduced his wealth through philanthropy, channeling $75 billion in donations to the Gates Foundation, created by his then-wife Melinda French Gates and friend Warren Buffett.

The total wealth of Russia's richest entrepreneurs increased by almost $29 billion over the first half of 2024, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index (BBI).

**Top Three Billionaires Compete for Top Spot on Bloomberg Billionaires Index**
The top three billionaires in the world are competing for the top spot, with Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault holding the top three positions on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for over 94% of the time this year. However, fluctuations in their wealth have led to them swapping places six times since May 29, with a frantic pace in the hierarchical sequence that has remained largely stable since Musk lost his top spot in early March. Musk, 52, regained the top spot on Monday for the second time since early March, replacing Bezos. This comes after Tesla's shares rose last week following a vote by shareholders to approve a compensation package for Musk, which was previously blocked by a Delaware court and transferred the company's headquarters to Texas. The package, which includes stock options worth up to $55.8 billion, now represents nearly a quarter of Musk's net worth. His net worth has also been boosted by a new funding round that values his artificial intelligence project, xAI, at over $24 billion. Bloomberg's wealth index estimates that Musk owns 65% of the company, which uses social media data to train its chatbot program, Grok. Meanwhile, Arnault, 75, has recently fallen to third place with a net worth of $199 billion, after spending most of the past three months in first place, and has seen his net worth decline by $13 billion since the surprise presidential election call by French President Emmanuel Macron sent the country's markets into their worst week in years. Most of his wealth comes from LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods manufacturer. Bezos, the 60-year-old founder of Amazon, currently holds the second spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $206.6 billion. Since May 29, he has regained the top spot three times, with Amazon's shares trading near all-time highs. The share has benefited from a broader rally in major technology companies responsible for nearly three-quarters of the S&P 500's gains this year.

**Three-way race for world's richest emerges**
The world's three richest billionaires, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, have been in a fierce race for first place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with the top spot changing hands six times since May 29. The fluctuations in their wealth have been influenced by a fight over Musk's pay package, a snap election in France, and a tech-stock rally. Musk, with a net worth of $210.1 billion, moved back into first place on Monday, replacing Bezos, after Tesla shares rallied following the re-approval of his 2018 compensation package and the company's move to Texas.

According to Bloomberg News, Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, stated in an interview with the 'Face the Nation' program on CBS that his company, TerraPower LLC, has started building the first commercial reactor in Wyoming, where a coal plant is set to be shut down.

Gates, the 6th richest man in the world according to Bloomberg's billionaire index, said, 'I've invested $1 billion, and I'll invest billions more in this project.'

**Bill Gates to Invest 'Billions of Dollars' in Nuclear Energy Project**
Bill Gates is prepared to invest 'billions of dollars' in a nuclear energy project in Wyoming to meet the growing energy needs of the United States. According to Bloomberg, TerraPower, a startup founded by Gates, began building its first commercial reactor last week in the American state, where a coal plant is closing. Gates, the sixth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has already invested over $1 billion and plans to invest billions more in the business. The TerraPower reactor, which has the support of the US Department of Energy, was initially expected to operate in 2028, but Gates said it would be unacceptable to depend on Russian fuel, which is no longer an option. Gates emphasized the need to compete effectively with natural gas, which is surpassing coal. Carbon-free nuclear energy is increasingly seen as a key part of the fight against climate change, with more companies promoting smaller reactors. Last year, 25 countries at the COP28 in Dubai declared they want to triple their nuclear capacity.

**Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund to Vote Against Tesla's 56 Billion Dollar Compensation Package for Elon Musk**
The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund will vote against Tesla's 56 billion dollar compensation package for CEO Elon Musk. The fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management, stated that while it values the significant value created under Musk's leadership since 2018, it is concerned about the overall scope of the package, its structure, and the lack of risk reduction for key personnel. The fund is estimated to be worth 1.3 billion euros and is the eighth-largest Tesla shareholder. Tesla's board chair, Robyn Denholm, has called for 'mutual respect' among shareholders, stating that Musk has no lack of ideas and can make a significant difference in the world. The fund's chief, Nicolai Tangen, has expressed concerns about the level of greed among companies, which he believes is becoming unsustainable for shareholders. The shareholders will vote on the package on Thursday. Two major proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, have also recommended voting against the package. Musk is the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with an estimated net worth of 203 billion dollars. Despite Tesla's record sales of over 1.8 million electric vehicles worldwide in 2023, the company has faced increasing scrutiny in recent months. Musk has been accused of diverting resources to his other companies, including social media platform X and AI startup xAI. He has also been criticized for his tweets, which some investors believe are an attempt to pressure them. In April, Musk fired the entire Supercharger team, including Senior Director of EV Charging Rebecca Tinucci, a move that was criticized by investors and partners.

**Indian Billionaire Gautam Adani Regains Top Spot as Richest Man in Asia**
Gautam Adani has regained his position as the richest man in Asia, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This comes after the value of his empire, which spans from fruit to ports, media giant NDTv to renewable energy, surged 14% last Friday after Jefferies, a US-based investment firm, released positive forecasts. Adani's net worth is now valued at $111 billion, making him the 11th richest person in the world, surpassing Mukesh Ambani, whose net worth is estimated at $109 billion. Adani, a self-made billionaire of the first generation, had previously held the top spot in Asia in 2022, but was severely impacted by a report from Hindenburg Research in 2023, which accused his group of being a Chinese shell company, causing his net worth to plummet to its lowest point in history and dropping him out of the top 20 richest people in the world. Adani denied the allegations and has recovered his losses in less than a year, surpassing Ambani. Ambani is currently on a Mediterranean cruise with 800 guests for his son's pre-wedding party, scheduled for July 12 in Mumbai.

Gautam Adani has surpassed Mukesh Ambani to become the richest person in Asia, with a net worth of $111 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Adani's conglomerate, which has a planned $90 billion capital expenditure over the next decade, has seen its market capitalization increase by Rs 84,064 crore, taking it to Rs 17.51 lakh crore.

**Gautam Adani overtakes Ambani in Asian rich list**
Gautam Adani has regained the title of Asia's richest person after a surge in the stock prices of his companies, surpassing Mukesh Ambani's net worth of $109 billion. Adani's net worth is now $111 billion, ranking him 11th in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The increase in Adani's wealth is attributed to a bullish view on the Adani Group by US brokerage Jefferies, which has led to a 14% surge in the stock prices of Adani's listed companies. Adani's conglomerate has a planned $90 billion capital expenditure over the next decade, which has contributed to its growth.
