To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Current situation:
- Bitcoin's all-time high is $73,750.07
- Today is August 1, 2024
- The deadline is October 1, 2024 (about 2 months away)

2. Recent trends:
- Bitcoin reached $71,031 on June 6, 2024, just 3.5% below its all-time high
- It hit $70,000 on June 4, 2024
- There's been a general upward trend since early 2024

3. Expert predictions:
- Many experts are bullish, predicting new all-time highs in 2024
- Some predict peaks later in 2024 or even 2025
- Predictions range from $74,000 to $500,000

4. Factors potentially driving price up:
- Positive sentiment from experts and investors
- Historical patterns following halving events
- Potential U.S. interest rate cuts
- Upcoming U.S. presidential election

5. Factors potentially holding price back:
- Market volatility
- Regulatory uncertainties
- Potential economic downturns

6. Historical context:
- Bitcoin has shown capability for rapid price increases
- It's also prone to significant corrections

Weighing these factors:

The bullish sentiment and recent upward trends suggest a strong possibility of reaching a new all-time high before October 1. The current price is relatively close to the all-time high, needing only a modest increase to surpass it.

However, the cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Two months is a short timeframe, and any negative news or market corrections could prevent reaching a new high in this period.

The expert predictions, while generally positive, often target later dates or higher prices, which doesn't necessarily support reaching a new high by October 1.

Balancing these considerations, I believe there's a good chance of reaching a new all-time high, but it's far from certain. 

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and consider the relevant evidence:

1. Current price and all-time high:
As of August 1, 2024, Bitcoin's price is not explicitly stated in the provided information. The all-time high to beat is $73,750.07.

2. Time frame:
We have approximately 2 months until the October 1, 2024 deadline.

3. Recent trends and analyst predictions:
- Multiple sources indicate Bitcoin has been approaching its all-time high in recent months.
- On July 29, 2024, Bitcoin was reported to be nearing $70,000.
- Some analysts predict new all-time highs by the end of 2024, while others suggest it may happen in 2025.

4. Factors potentially driving price increases:
- Approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US
- Potential interest rate cuts
- Upcoming US presidential election
- Positive sentiment from influential figures like Donald Trump

5. Factors potentially limiting price increases:
- Historical patterns suggesting a longer cycle before new highs
- Potential market corrections or consolidations
- Regulatory uncertainties

6. Historical context:
Bitcoin has shown the ability to reach new all-time highs within short time frames in past bull runs.

Weighing the evidence:

For a higher probability:
- Recent price momentum approaching the all-time high

4. Factors supporting a new all-time high:
- Approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 has led to significant inflows.
- The halving event occurred in April 2024, which historically precedes price increases.
- Positive macroeconomic factors like potential interest rate cuts.
- Strong institutional interest and adoption.

5. Factors against a new all-time high:
- The market has already seen significant growth in 2024.
- Some analysts predict the peak of this cycle might not occur until 2025.
- Potential regulatory uncertainties or macroeconomic headwinds.

6. Expert predictions:
- Many experts are bullish, with predictions ranging from $100,000 to $500,000 by the end of 2024 or 2025.
- However, some analysts suggest the peak might not come until late 2024 or 2025.

Balancing these factors:

The evidence suggests a strong possibility of reaching a new all-time high before October 1, 2024.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Historical trends and cycles:
- Bitcoin has historically reached new all-time highs after halving events, which occur approximately every four years.
- The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, suggesting a potential price peak in late 2024 or early 2025.
- However, some analysts (e.g., Rekt Capital) suggest the current cycle is moving faster than expected, which could mean an earlier peak.

2. Current price and momentum:
- As of July 29, 2024, Bitcoin was trading close to $70,000, near its previous all-time high of $73,750.07.
- There's been significant momentum in recent months, with a 10% increase between July 25 and July 29.

3. Market sentiment and external factors:
- Positive sentiment from political figures (e.g., Donald Trump's pro-crypto comments) has boosted prices.
- The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 has led to significant inflows ($14.41 billion as of July).
- Potential interest rate cuts and economic factors could further boost Bitcoin's price.

4. Expert predictions:
- Many analysts are bullish, with predictions ranging from $80,000 to $150,000 by the end of 2024.
- Some experts (e.g., Timothy Peterson) give a 25% chance of reaching a new all-time high before the end of 2024.
- Others (e.g., Peter Brandt) predict a peak in 2025, suggesting it might not happen before October 1, 2024.

5. Technical analysis:
- The MACD indicator showed a bullish cross in early June.
- Bitcoin has been consolidating within a bull flag pattern, which could lead to a price surge.

6. Potential obstacles:
- Regulatory uncertainties and market corrections could slow Bitcoin's growth.
- Historical data shows August is typically not a strong month for the crypto market.

Balancing these factors, there's strong evidence for Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high before October 1, 2024. The current price is already close to the previous high, there's significant momentum and positive sentiment, and many expert predictions align with this timeframe.

- Positive sentiment from political figures (e.g., Donald Trump's pro-crypto comments) has boosted prices.
- The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 has led to significant inflows ($14.41 billion as of July).
- Potential interest rate cuts and economic factors could further boost Bitcoin's price.

4. Expert predictions:
- Many analysts are bullish, with predictions ranging from $80,000 to $150,000 by the end of 2024.
- Some experts (e.g., Timothy Peterson) give a 25% chance of reaching a new all-time high before the end of 2024.
- Others (e.g., Peter Brandt) predict a peak in 2025, suggesting it might not happen before October 1, 2024.

5. Technical analysis:
- The MACD indicator showed a bullish cross in early June.
- Bitcoin has been consolidating within a bull flag pattern, which could lead to a price surge.

6. Potential obstacles:
- Regulatory uncertainties and market corrections could slow Bitcoin's growth.
- Historical data shows August is typically not a strong month for the crypto market.

Balancing these factors, there's strong evidence for Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high before October 1, 2024. The current price is already close to the previous high, there's significant momentum and positive sentiment, and many expert predictions align with this timeframe. However, there are also factors suggesting it might take longer, such as historical cycle patterns and potential market corrections.

Given the proximity to the previous all-time high and the current momentum, I believe there's a high probability of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high before October 1, 2024. However, I'll account for potential obstacles and the possibility of a delayed peak.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Historical trends and cycles:
- Bitcoin has historically reached new all-time highs after halving events, which occur approximately every four years.
- The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, suggesting a potential price peak in late 2024 or early 2025.
- However, some analysts (e.g., Rekt Capital) suggest the current cycle is moving faster than expected, which could mean an earlier peak.

2. Current price and momentum:
- As of July 29, 2024, Bitcoin was trading close to $70,000, near its previous all-time high of $73,750.07.
- There's been significant momentum in recent months, with a 10% increase between July 25 and July 29.
