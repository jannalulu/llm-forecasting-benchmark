**Beyonc√© Should Score a Best Country Album Grammy Nod. But Will Chris Stapleton Win?**
As the Grammy nominations approach, Rolling Stone is predicting the nominees and winners in 13 categories. In the Best Country Album category, Beyonc√©'s 'Cowboy Carter' is a strong contender, despite being snubbed by the CMA Awards. 'I'm going to make an assumption that she does get recognition that she missed at the CMA Awards,' says Storme Warren, host of country station the Big 615 on TuneIn. Rachel Whitney, Head of Editorial, Nashville, Spotify, also believes Beyonc√© will be recognized, saying 'I would be shocked if Beyonc√© is not in the country album category.' Chris Stapleton's 'Higher' is also a top contender, having won three times in this category and featuring stellar songs like 'White Horse' and 'Think I'm in Love With You.' Other nominees include Kacey Musgraves' 'Deeper Well,' Lainey Wilson's 'Whirlwind,' and Sturgill Simpson's 'Passage Du Desir.' 'This is Lainey Wilson's Joshua Tree,' says Warren, 'it represents everything that she's wanted to become.' Whitney also praises Musgraves' renewed country sound, comparing it to Simpson's 'Passage Du Desir.' 'This year we're seeing some artists come back to their original sound and reach back to their fans with music that sounds a lot like what they broke out with,' she says.

**Luke Bryan Is 'In Awe' of Morgan Wallen: Here's Why**
Luke Bryan, a two-time CMA Entertainer of the Year winner, believes that Morgan Wallen has a strong chance of winning the award this year. Bryan says, 'When I look at what Morgan Wallen's doing out there, selling out multiple [stadiums], and I know Luke Combs is doing that too, and obviously, they're just both great entertainers.' Bryan has been impressed by Wallen's growth from touring with him to putting on 'Garth Brooks-like stadium shows.' Bryan thinks that Wallen is 'certainly worthy' of the award and predicts that he may win it in the next couple of years. The nominees for Entertainer of the Year include Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, Morgan Wallen, and Lainey Wilson, with Wallen leading the pack with seven nominations.

**Lainey Wilson Shares Her Pick to Win Entertainer of the Year at the 2024 CMA Awards**
Lainey Wilson, who won Entertainer of the Year at the CMA Awards last year, is not counting on winning again this year. Instead, she's predicting that Jelly Roll and Morgan Wallen will take home the award. Wilson, who is up against big names like Luke Combs and Chris Stapleton, said, 'I've worked my butt off this year to prove to the folks that thought I didn't deserve Entertainer of the Year, to show them why the people in this town chose me.' She added, 'So if it don't happen, that's alright. There's so many people in this town that deserve to win all these awards who have never even been nominated.' Wilson is one of only eight women to have won the Entertainer of the Year award since 1967, and she's hoping to prove herself again this year.
