**Helldivers 2: Cautious Approach to Crossovers and IPs**
Helldivers 2, a multiplayer game released in February 2024 for PlayStation 5 and PC, has gained popularity despite some controversy. The game's president, Johan Pilestedt, expressed his reluctance to have many crossovers with other intellectual properties, fearing it would dilute the game's experience. However, he mentioned some properties that the team would be interested in crossing over with, including 'Claro' and 'IPs' (specifically mentioning 'IPs' but not the names of the actual IPs). Pilestedt emphasized that any potential crossovers would need to make sense and not alter the game's core experience. The game has received several updates with new content, and fans are eagerly awaiting the next update, which might include one of the mentioned crossovers.

**Helldivers 2: Crossplay and System Requirements**
Helldivers 2 is a popular third-person shooter game released in 2024 for PC Windows and PlayStation 5, with 12 million copies sold to date. The game supports cross-play, allowing players to play together regardless of their platform. According to the game's developers, 'You can play Helldivers 2 with your friends, whatever their platform.' The game's cross-play feature is a key factor in maintaining the game's popularity, as it allows developers to update the game more frequently. However, the game does not currently support cross-progression, which would allow players to continue their progress on a different platform. The system requirements for PC are as follows: OS Windows 10, CPU Intel Core i7 4790K or AMD Ryzen 5 1500X, RAM 8 GB, GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 470, and storage 100 GB (SSD recommended).

**After Helldiver 2's latest Major Order win, it looks like Super Earth is setting up its own Terminid version of Jurassic Park**
Helldivers 2 has successfully completed another Major Order, creating a protective border around Acamar IV and paving the way for Super Earth's 'Termind Research Preserve.' However, the Preserve's plan to contain alien bugs using electrical fencing and nuclear bombardments raises concerns. High Command's note claims that 'past lessons learned from the failure of the Terminid Farms have been applied,' but the plan to build a 'Tyranny Park' for civilians to see the creatures up close is worrying. The park's goal is to 'deepen our citizen's understanding of the horrors of Tyranny,' but it's a recipe for disaster. The victory will also allow the construction of the DSS to continue on-schedule.

**Star Wars Outlaws Nominated for Two Golden Joystick Awards Despite Poor Reception**
Despite receiving negative reviews from critics and fans, Star Wars Outlaws has been nominated for two Golden Joystick awards. The game was criticized for its poor gameplay and stealth mechanics. However, actress Umbrales Gonzales was nominated for her role as Kae Veer, which is a notable achievement. The second nomination for 'Best Sound Design' is more surprising, considering the game's poor reception and the fact that Black Myth: Wukong was not even nominated for 'Game of the Year'. Ubisoft has stated that the game's sales have not met expectations and that they are working to improve the game. To boost sales, the game will be available on Steam starting next month. The voting process will conclude on November 1st.

**Black Myth Wukong Snubbed from Golden Joystick Awards' Game of the Year Category**
Black Myth Wukong, a highly anticipated game, has broken numerous records and is still played by an average of 300,000 players on Steam two months after its release. Despite expectations of winning the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards, the game has not been nominated for the Golden Joystick Awards' Game of the Year category. The voting for the Golden Joystick Awards 2024 has begun, with 20 categories in total, but Black Myth Wukong is not listed among the nominees for Best Game on Home Consoles. Many players have expressed disappointment and frustration on social media, with some accusing the awards of being rigged due to political bias against Chinese games. They claim that Wukong received unnecessary hate and low ratings due to a lack of 'diversity and inclusivity', which is why its nomination was expected.

**Helldivers 2 Shouldn’t Win Game of the Year Because We Can’t Let Sony Get Away With It**
Helldivers 2 has been a popular game in 2024, but its developer, Arrowhead, and publisher, Sony, have made several mistakes that have led to a significant player drop-off and community backlash. Despite a recent update that brought back some players, the game's troubles are far from over. Allowing Helldivers 2 to win Game of the Year would send the wrong message to the gaming community and enable companies to overlook player needs. Sony's handling of the game, including its decision to require a PlayStation Network account for Steam players, has been sloppy and has highlighted the company's disconnect with its player community. 'It would suggest that companies can get away with launching unfinished or poorly managed games and still receive accolades based on initial success,' said the author. 'Sony's heavy-handed tactics are a reminder that platform holders must be held accountable for how they treat their players.'

**It's Never A Bad Time To Grab Helldivers 2, Especially When It's On Sale**
Helldivers 2, a third-person co-op shooter, has been one of the most played games of 2024 since its release in February. The game's fans are dedicated and passionate, and for good reason: it's a 'good ass time' with friends or randoms, and now it's on sale for $32 on PlayStation. The game's simplicity and engaging gameplay make it easy to get hooked, with visually stunning worlds, satire, and humor. The game's design also makes players feel small and weak compared to the alien enemies, which creates a sense of clutch victory when overcoming the odds. The game has a lot to offer, including exploration, resource management, and a meta narrative that encourages conspiracy theories. If you're looking for a good time, picking up Helldivers 2 on sale seems like an obvious move.

**Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 and Helldivers 2 Are Two Sides of the Same Coin**
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 and Helldivers 2 are two co-op horde shooters released in 2024, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Space Marine 2 offers a power fantasy with boss battles, gory combat, and superhuman playable characters, as well as several progression systems and customization options. In contrast, Helldivers 2 is a more chaotic co-op experience with a focus on teamwork and a variety of planets, enemies, and objectives. While Space Marine 2's gameplay loop is more repetitive, its character and weapon progression systems are more complex and rewarding. Additionally, Space Marine 2 has a PvP game mode and an offline mode, making it more accessible to solo players. However, its repetitiveness is addressed by a 2024-2025 roadmap that will add new content, including new Operations, a new enemy type, and a new weapon. Helldivers 2, on the other hand, will continue to grow over time with new content, but its weapon-balancing problem needs to be resolved. Ultimately, both games offer unique experiences and are enjoyable in their own ways.
