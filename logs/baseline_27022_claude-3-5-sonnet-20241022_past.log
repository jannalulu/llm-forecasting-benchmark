Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The question asks about the location of two specific astronauts on September 15, 2024, about 5-6 weeks from now.

2. Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are scheduled to fly on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft for the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission to the ISS.

3. As of early August 2024, this mission has been delayed multiple times, with the latest target being mid-March 2024. However, this flight hasn't happened yet.

4. Given that neither astronaut is currently in space, and no imminent launch is scheduled that would put them in space before September 15, 2024, it's extremely likely they will be on Earth on the specified date.

5. The only scenarios where they wouldn't be on Earth would be:
- An extremely rapid acceleration of the Starliner schedule (very unlikely given past delays)
- Assignment to a different mission that launches before September 15 (also unlikely given preparation requirements)

6. Given these factors, there's a very high probability they will both be on Earth on September 15, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 98.50% and 99.90%, with 99.50% being the most likely. Probability: 99.50%
