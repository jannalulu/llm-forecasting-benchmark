**Macron Rejects Left-Wing Alliance's Proposal for New Prime Minister**
French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected the left-wing alliance's proposal to name a new prime minister, instead opting to continue with an interim government until mid-August. The left-wing coalition, which won a majority of parliamentary seats in the recent election, suggested Lucie Castets, a specialist in financial crimes, as a candidate for prime minister. Macron stated that the name is not the issue, but rather the question of which majority can emerge in the National Assembly. He added that until mid-August, they are not in a position to change things without creating chaos. The Olympic Games in Paris, which will take place from next Friday to August 11, pose a significant logistical and security challenge for France. The country is currently in a parliamentary impasse since the election, with no party having a majority in the lower house of Parliament.

**Macron Accepts Premier Attal's Resignation, Calls for Republican Forces to Work Together**
French President Emmanuel Macron has accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. The Élysée Palace announced in a statement: 'In order to conclude this period as quickly as possible, it is up to the republican forces to work together to build an alliance around projects and actions serving the French and French women.' According to Le Parisien, Prime Minister Attal and his ministers will remain in office for ongoing business, likely until the Paris 2024 Olympics, from July 26 to August 11. Attal's resignation is a consequence of the legislative election results, which saw the left-wing coalition of the New Popular Front win 182 seats. Macron's centrists came second with 168 seats, and the far-right Rassemblement National, led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, won 143 seats. Negotiations for a new government appear to be far from conclusion. None of the three major blocks has a majority to govern alone, and the most plausible hypothesis seems to be an alliance between Macron's centrists and a moderate part of the New Popular Front.

**Macron to Accept Attal's Resignation on July 16**
French President Emmanuel Macron will accept the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and his government on the evening of July 16. According to France-Presse, Macron informed ministers that they will have to fulfill their duties until the end of the Olympics, which will conclude in Paris on August 11. The parliamentary elections in France ended with the victory of the left-wing coalition 'New Popular Front', which received 182 seats in the National Assembly. The alliance of the current French president 'Together' took only 168 seats in parliament. The ultra-right party of Marine Le Pen 'National Union' became the third and received 143 seats in the lower house of parliament. After the failure of Macron's coalition in the snap parliamentary elections, Attal resigned. However, the head of state asked him to remain as prime minister to ensure stability in the country.

**The Prime Minister of France pledges to support family finances to confront the rise of the extreme right and left**
French Prime Minister Macron's coalition, 'Together', is facing a tough challenge in the upcoming parliamentary elections after losing to the far-right National Rally party in the European Parliament elections. Macron's coalition is focusing on promoting democratic values and economic management to counter the rise of extreme right and left parties. According to Attal, the policies of these parties would lead to mass unemployment. He warned, 'Let us not jump from a high height into the unknown without a parachute.' The elections will be held in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.

**No New Government Before Mid-August**
Lucie Castets, a 37-year-old high-ranking official, has been chosen by left-wing parties to become the next Prime Minister of France. She stated, 'I am ready; we are ready. I ask the President of the Republic now to take his responsibilities and name me Prime Minister.' However, President Emmanuel Macron has called for a grand coalition and urged parties to work together, potentially taking time. Macron announced that no one will be named before the end of the Olympics, which means waiting until at least mid-August. The current government will remain in place to handle daily affairs and emergencies during the competition.

**France: First the Olympics; Then the Prime Minister**
The left-wing coalition, Nova Frente Popular, has announced that they will present Lucie Castets as the candidate for Prime Minister of France. However, Emmanuel Macron has stated that this is a topic for after the Olympics. Lucie Castets, a 37-year-old high-ranking public official, was chosen by the four parties in the coalition to be the candidate. She is not a member of any of the parties in the coalition, but was a candidate in the 2015 regional elections in Normandy for the Socialist Party. Macron has the power to appoint Lucie Castets, but has stated that he will not appoint a Prime Minister until after the Olympics, which end on August 11, to avoid 'creating confusion' during the event. Macron has also ignored the candidacy of Lucie Castets, stating that there is no majority of the left in the French National Assembly.

**Macron Rejects Left-Wing Alliance's Attempt to Name New Prime Minister**
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that his outgoing government will remain in place until mid-August, during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, rejecting a left-wing alliance's attempt to name a new Prime Minister. The left-wing coalition, led by the Nouveau Front populaire français, had proposed Lucie Castets, a specialist in financial crime, as a candidate for Prime Minister. However, Macron stated that the name is not the issue, but rather what majority can emerge in the National Assembly. He added that until mid-August, they cannot change things, as it would create chaos. The Olympics pose a significant logistical and security challenge for France, with 35 sites and around 10,500 athletes. The country is currently in a parliamentary deadlock, with no party having a majority in the Assembly, which is fragmented into three blocs.

**Left-Wing Coalition Proposes Lucie Castets as French Prime Minister**
The left-wing coalition that won the early legislative elections in France has proposed Lucie Castets, 37, as the new Prime Minister. However, Emmanuel Macron pushed the issue aside, stating that there will be no new government until mid-August, after the Paris Olympics. Castets is the director of finance for the city of Paris, an economist, and a former student of the National School of Administration. The coalition, which includes France Unbowed, socialists, greens, and communists, spent two weeks debating the proposal before presenting it to Emmanuel Macron. Socialists, greens, and communists initially suggested Laurence Tubiana as a candidate, but France Unbowed disagreed and the proposal fell through. In an interview with France 2, Macron stated that the current government of caretakers will continue until at least mid-August, pushing the issue until after the Paris Olympics. 'We need to be focused on the Olympics until mid-August', Macron emphasized, adding that 'after that, it will be my responsibility to appoint a Prime Minister (...) with the broadest possible support'.

**Macron Accepts Prime Minister's Resignation After National Assembly Elections**
French President Emmanuel Macron accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and his government on July 16, 2024, after the National Assembly elections, in which Macron's centrist block lost its majority.

Macron stated that political forces should work together to create a single front around projects and decisions that benefit the French people.

The snap parliamentary elections in France resulted in the left-wing coalition 'New Popular Front' winning 182 seats, followed by Macron's centrist coalition 'Together for the Republic' with 168 seats, and the right-wing 'National Union' with 143 seats. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leader of the 'New Popular Front', rejected the possibility of forming a coalition with Macron's block and called on the President to allow the 'New Popular Front' to form a government. Macron, however, stated he is not willing to form a coalition with Mélenchon's party, and also excludes cooperation with right-wing parties.

**France's Government in Limbo: Macron Keeps Current Government in Place**
French President Emmanuel Macron has decided to keep the current government led by Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in office, but only in a caretaker capacity. This decision comes after Attal submitted his resignation following the defeat of Macron's centrist party in the parliamentary elections. The caretaker government will remain in office until at least the end of the Olympic Games, which take place from July 26 to August 11. During this time, the 17 ministers who were elected to parliament will be able to participate in the distribution of leadership positions. Macron has called on his political allies to propose a government coalition or cooperation. However, the left-wing coalition that won the parliamentary elections is currently in disarray, and Macron's party is not expected to form a government.

**French President Macron Accepts Prime Minister Attal's Resignation**
French President Emmanuel Macron accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's government. The cabinet will continue to perform technical functions until a new government is appointed, according to the Elysée Palace. The French political landscape is in a stalemate after the early parliamentary elections in early July. Parties in the National Assembly are actively trying to form a governing coalition, but Attal's successor is not yet clear, according to AFP. The 'Together for the Republic' coalition, led by Macron and Attal, came in second place with 168 seats, while the 'New Popular Front' coalition of left-wing parties took first place with 182 seats. The 'National Union' extreme-right party came in third with 143 seats. Macron has asked Attal to stay in office for a few weeks, possibly until the end of the Paris Olympics on July 26. The early parliamentary elections in France were called after the success of the extreme right in the European Parliament elections in early June 2024.

The Élysée Palace statement also emphasized the need for the Republican forces to work together to build an alliance around projects and actions serving the French people. During the Council of Ministers, Attal guaranteed 'the continuity of the State until the last minute'.

**Macron Accepts Premier Attal's Resignation, Calls for Republican Forces to Work Together**
French President Emmanuel Macron has accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. The Élysée Palace announced in a statement: 'In order to conclude this period as quickly as possible, it is up to the republican forces to work together to build an alliance around projects and actions serving the French and French women.' According to Le Parisien, Prime Minister Attal and his ministers will remain in office for ongoing business, likely until the Paris 2024 Olympics, from July 26 to August 11. Attal's resignation is a consequence of the legislative election results, which saw the left-wing coalition of the New Popular Front win 182 seats. Macron's centrists came second with 168 seats, and the far-right Rassemblement National, led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, won 143 seats. Negotiations for a new government appear to be far from conclusion. None of the three major blocks has a majority to govern alone, and the most plausible hypothesis seems to be an alliance between Macron's centrists and a moderate part of the New Popular Front.

**Macron to Maintain Attal as Interim Prime Minister Until End of Paris Olympics**
French President Emmanuel Macron will maintain Prime Minister Gabriel Attal as an interim prime minister until the end of the Paris Olympics, which start on July 26 and end on August 11. Macron informed Attal and his team that the government will be in an interim state and hinted that the situation may 'last for some time'. The cabinet met nine days after the second round of legislative elections, which reconfigured the political landscape in the country. The elections resulted in a fragmented parliament, with no party or coalition obtaining an absolute majority of 289 seats. The New Popular Front (NFP), a left-wing alliance, came in first place, ahead of Macron's centrist alliance and the far-right National Rally party. The new legislature will begin on Thursday, July 18, when the new president of the National Assembly will be elected. Macron did not rule out the possibility of the Council of Ministers meeting occasionally during this interim period. The left-wing coalition that won the legislative elections without an absolute majority is still unable to agree on a candidate for prime minister. Socialists, communists, and ecologists are pushing for a candidate from civil society, while the main party in the coalition, France Insoumise, is opposed to this idea. The proposal has not been approved by the main party in the coalition, and several parliamentary sources have confirmed that the proposed candidate is Laurence Tubiana, a 73-year-old economist and climate architect. Tubiana has been criticized by some sectors of the main party in the coalition, who see her as close to President Macron.

**Macron to Accept Attal's Resignation on July 16**
French President Emmanuel Macron will accept the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and his government on the evening of July 16. According to France-Presse, Macron informed ministers that they will have to fulfill their duties until the end of the Olympics, which will conclude in Paris on August 11. The parliamentary elections in France ended with the victory of the left-wing coalition 'New Popular Front', which received 182 seats in the National Assembly. The alliance of the current French president 'Together' took only 168 seats in parliament. The ultra-right party of Marine Le Pen 'National Union' became the third and received 143 seats in the lower house of parliament. After the failure of Macron's coalition in the snap parliamentary elections, Attal resigned. However, the head of state asked him to remain as prime minister to ensure stability in the country.

**France's Prime Minister Vacancy: Tensions Rise on the Left**
After the second round of the 2024 French legislative elections, no Prime Minister has been appointed yet. On the left, tensions are rising, while the presidential majority is seeking a coalition. The France Insoumise party has suspended negotiations within the New Popular Front, demanding a single candidacy for the presidency of the National Assembly and accusing the Socialist Party of 'blocking everything'. The name of Laurence Tubiana, a former environmental ambassador, has been proposed for the role of Prime Minister within the NFP, but the France Insoumise party rejects her, considering her profile too 'Macron-compatible'. A council of ministers is scheduled for today at 11:30 am at the Elysée Palace, and Gabriel Attal may resign, which Emmanuel Macron would accept immediately.

**France Bleu: Macron to Accept Attal's Resignation on July 16**
French President Emmanuel Macron will accept the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on July 16. According to Franceinfo, Macron intends to accept Attal's resignation and the government's resignation after the last Council of Ministers meeting. After Attal's resignation, he will continue to perform his duties as Prime Minister until a new head of government is appointed. Attal submitted his resignation on July 8, after the presidential coalition came in second place in the legislative elections. Macron initially refused to accept the resignation, asking Attal to stay on to ensure the stability of the country. The early legislative elections in France were announced on June 9, 2024, after the defeat of Macron's supporters in the European Parliament elections. After the second round of elections, the 'New Popular Front' alliance took the lead, followed by Macron's coalition 'Together for the Republic'. The elections did not provide an absolute majority for any political bloc. The leader of the Socialist Party, Olivier Faure, stated that the 'New Popular Front' alliance, which won the recent parliamentary elections in France, should present a new candidate for Prime Minister within a week. 'Chaos' and 'uncertainty' dominated the European press on July 8, after the elections, with commentators saying that the crisis is far from over and that the second-largest economy in the European Union is facing a very difficult formation of government.

**Macron to Accept Prime Minister Attal's Resignation on July 16**
French President Emmanuel Macron will accept the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on July 16, after he has worked for six months. According to Franceinfo, citing participants in a meeting between Macron and his supporters at the presidential residence on Friday, the resignation will be accepted at a cabinet meeting. The government will resign along with its leader. Following the parliamentary elections, which ended on July 7, the left-wing block 'New Popular Front' won the most seats - 182 - in the new National Assembly. Macron's coalition 'Together for the Republic' will have 168 mandates. The right-wing 'National Union' led by Marine Le Pen won 143 seats. As a result, no party coalition in France will have an absolute majority in parliament, and a new government will inevitably be a coalition government.

**Macron: Will Appoint New Prime Minister Once Parties Reach Consensus on 'Solid Majority'**
French President Emmanuel Macron announced that he will only appoint a new prime minister once the political parties in France have reached a consensus to build a 'solid majority'. Macron stated that the current government will continue to exercise its responsibilities until then. He emphasized that no party won the elections, as none obtained a sufficient majority, and that the resulting coalitions are all minority governments. Macron urged the parties to work together, citing the need for a new political culture in France, and to build a coalition around clear republican values, a pragmatic project, and consideration of the concerns expressed during the elections. The statement is seen as a blow to the expectations of the left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), which is the largest force in the National Assembly but far from a majority.

**Legislative Elections 2024: Searching for a Majority**
French President Emmanuel Macron and his allies are working to maintain their majority in the upcoming legislative elections. A coalition with the Nouveau Front populaire is not an option, according to a majority deputy. 'No one wants to repeat the use of Article 49.3', estimates another. Some politicians believe that people are willing to work together. The supporters of the President are watching the 60 right-wing deputies who have returned to the National Assembly with interest. 'The only possibility is cohabitation', judges Aurélien Pradié, a DVD deputy. The political landscape is uncertain, with a majority that refuses to compromise and a left-wing party that wants to govern. Who will be the next Prime Minister? Some names are already being ruled out, including Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

**France's Political Crisis: Macron's Future and the Search for a New Prime Minister**
The French presidential coalition, Ensemble, led by Emmanuel Macron, has lost 76 seats in the National Assembly, while the left-wing alliance, Nova Frente Popular, has won 188 seats. Macron's strategy to calm the extreme right has been partially successful, but he has lost political momentum. He will now have to choose a prime minister from a personality that the winning coalition accepts. The most likely candidates are Marine Tondelier, Raphael Glucksmann, François Ruffin, Clémentine Autain, Olivier Faure, and Fabien Rousse. However, Macron may also consider Bruno Le Maire, the current Minister of Finance and Economy, or even an extreme-right candidate. The decision is expected to take a week, but if the coalition cannot agree, a vote will be held, which may delay the decision. The markets have already adjusted to the results, with European stock markets opening higher, and the French bond yield decreasing. The French presidential election in 2027 is already being considered, with Marine Le Pen promising to seek revenge.

The left-wing coalition 'New Popular Front' took first place with 182 seats, and the extreme right-wing 'National Union' came in third with 143 seats. French media noted that the country is facing political uncertainty, as a new government is expected to be formed just weeks before the 2024 Paris Olympics.

**How is the French Prime Minister and government chosen after legislative elections?**
The French legislative elections on July 7, 2024, have resulted in a highly fragmented Assembly, with no party or coalition having a majority. The President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, has asked Gabriel Attal to remain Prime Minister 'for the moment' to ensure stability. The Constitution gives the President the power to appoint the Prime Minister, but the chosen person must have sufficient parliamentary support to avoid a motion of censure. Several scenarios are possible: a minority government, a coalition government, or a technical government. A minority government would require constant compromises and unpredictable governance, while a coalition government would require negotiations and a common program. A technical government would be a temporary solution until a more stable consensus is reached. If the parties fail to agree on a Prime Minister, France may face institutional paralysis, making it difficult to adopt new laws and budgets.

**French Prime Minister to Remain in Office Despite Election Results**
French President Emmanuel Macron has decided to keep Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in his position despite the results of the parliamentary elections. Macron has asked Attal to remain in office to ensure stability in the country after the parliamentary elections and before the 2024 Summer Olympics. The results of the second round of parliamentary elections, held on July 7, saw the coalition 'Together for the Republic', led by Macron and Attal, come in second place with 168 seats. The left-wing coalition 'New Popular Front' won 182 seats, while the far-right 'National Union' won 143 seats. The outcome has left no clear path to forming a government, according to Associated Press. Experts predict a political deadlock in France, with the left refusing to negotiate with centrists, as stated by their leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right, said she would not 'just sit in a ministerial chair'. Political analysts see two possible ways out of the deadlock: a broad 'rainbow' coalition on limited issues or a technical government of 'politically neutral' experts who will handle daily problems until the next elections, which can only be held now through a year. Attal, announcing his intention to resign, said he was willing to remain prime minister as long as needed, considering the upcoming Olympics in Paris, which will attract millions of spectators. Prime Minister Attal took office in January 2024.

**France-Législatives: Left-Wing Coalition Takes the Lead in Second Round**
After the first round of the French legislative elections on June 31, many people expressed concerns about the rise of the far-right in France. Emmanuel Macron called for a 'large gathering' against the Rassemblement National (RN) in the second round. Miraculously, the left-wing coalition, Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP), has taken the lead in the second round, according to estimates. Marine Le Pen, leader of the RN, believes that the party's victory is only delayed, citing that the RN is still the largest party in France. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has announced his resignation, but will continue to serve until the new Assembly is structured. President Emmanuel Macron has stated that he will wait for the new Assembly to take decisions. Jordan Bardella, president of the RN, has celebrated the party's 'most important breakthrough' in history, criticizing the campaign as marked by unnatural alliances and dangerous electoral arrangements.

**What to Expect from a Macron Government in a State of Cohabitation**
If Emmanuel Macron's coalition, Together, does not obtain a majority in the French National Assembly elections on Sunday (July 7, 2024), France will experience a phenomenon called 'cohabitation'. This occurs when the party or coalition of the French president does not have a majority in the National Assembly. In this case, the president, not necessarily, appoints a prime minister who satisfies the majority of the deputies. Since the 5th French Republic, this has happened three times: 1986, 1993, and 1997. If the National Rally (right-wing) obtains a majority, Macron is expected to appoint Jordan Bardella (right-wing) as prime minister, marking the 4th cohabitation since 1958. If the New Popular Front (left-wing) wins, Olivier Faure will be the next head of government. In both cases, Macron's powers will be reduced, and he will not be able to dissolve the National Assembly until one year before the next election and will not appoint the next government's ministers. The prime minister, on the other hand, will be responsible for governing the country internally, choosing ministers, and developing policies independently of the executive. In cases of disagreement between the president and prime minister, the prime minister's decisions will take precedence, making Macron's convictions obsolete.

**Macron Hopes for 150 Seats in National Assembly**
French President Emmanuel Macron hopes that his coalition 'Together for the Republic' will win at least 150 seats in the National Assembly (lower house of parliament) after the second round of parliamentary elections. According to RMC radio, Macron spent the night with his team counting the number of seats his coalition can expect to win. He also discussed the prospects of forming agreements and alliances with left and right-wing candidates loyal to him. The coalition aims to prevent National Rally leader Jordan Bardella from becoming prime minister. The National Assembly has 577 deputies, and a majority requires 289 seats. Earlier, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said that around 60 presidential coalition candidates will withdraw from the election in the second round to vote for left-wing candidates and prevent National Rally's victory. After the first round, National Rally led with 33% of the vote, followed by the left-wing alliance 'New Popular Front' with 28%, and Macron's coalition with 20%. The second round will take place on July 7.

**Macron's Coalition to Withdraw Candidates to Prevent Le Pen's Victory**
The coalition 'Together for the Republic' led by President Emmanuel Macron has decided to withdraw around 60 of its candidates before the second round of parliamentary elections in France. This move is aimed at preventing the victory of candidates from the opposition party 'National Rally' led by Marine Le Pen, according to French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. 'We made this choice... This will mean withdrawing our candidates, keeping them in third place would lead to the election of a deputy from the 'National Rally', Attal said at a press conference. The Prime Minister emphasized that such actions correspond to the defense of republican values, which are a priority for their coalition. Despite disappointment and possible discontent among citizens, more than 300 candidates from the 'Together for the Republic' coalition successfully passed to the second round. The Prime Minister expressed confidence that their party best defends the values that French people cherish. On the backdrop of the first round of elections, where 'National Rally' received 33% of the votes, and 'New Popular Front' - 28.5%, the 'Together for the Republic' coalition took third place with 22%.

The results of the first round of parliamentary elections in France were a heavy defeat for President Emmanuel Macron, according to the press secretary of the French Socialist Party, Pierre Juve. He expressed concern that extreme right-wing forces may come to power. Marine Le Pen, the head of the National Union party, was re-elected to the National Assembly, where she ran for election. The exact number of elected deputies in the first round has not been published, with a total of 577 expected.

**French Election: Right-Wing Party Leads, Jordan Bardella Emerges as Prime Minister Favorite**
The French will vote on June 30, 2024, in the first round of the National Assembly elections. The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron on June 9, 2024, has raised concerns about the possibility of a right-wing government. The latest polls show the right-wing party RN (National Rally) leading with 36.5% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front (a coalition of left-wing and center-left parties) with 29%, and Macron's centrist alliance (Together) in third place with 20.5%. If the right-wing party wins the first round and RN gains another significant victory in the second round on July 7, 2024, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, who shares the leadership of the National Rally with Marine Le Pen, is likely to become the next Prime Minister. Bardella's appeal is strong among French citizens concerned about immigration, national sovereignty, and critical of Macron's pro-Ukrainian policies. He uses social media to spread his messages and gain popularity, especially with impactful slogans. As Prime Minister, Bardella is likely to adopt stricter policies on immigration, which could increase tensions with the Muslim population in France. He has also been critical of the European Union, arguing that France's participation in the EU has resulted in economic losses and compromised national identity. If the right-wing party gains more support, it is possible that France could leave the EU, but this would have significant political and economic costs, considering France's historical leadership role in the integration process.

**France's Early Parliamentary Elections: A Possible Rise of Far-Right Forces**
French voters began casting their ballots in the early parliamentary elections on June 30, 2024, which may lead to the rise of far-right forces to power for the first time since the Nazi era. The elections, which will be held in two rounds, may affect European financial markets and Western support for Ukraine, as well as France's nuclear arsenal and global military power, according to Associated Press. The elections come amid frustration with President Emmanuel Macron's economic policies and rising anti-immigrant sentiment. Marine Le Pen's National Rally party has been gaining popularity, while a new left-wing coalition, the 'New Popular Front', poses a challenge to Macron's centrist party 'Together for the Republic'. Macron has called for early elections after his party's defeat in the European Parliament elections earlier in June. The polls suggest that the National Rally may win a majority in parliament, which could lead to Macron appointing Jordan Bardella, the party's 28-year-old leader, as prime minister. This would be the first time since World War II that a far-right government has taken power in France.

Attal mentioned that the coalition has gained momentum, with their support increasing from 14% to 20-22% in the past two weeks.

**Macron's Coalition to Reduce Electricity Bills and Inheritance Tax if Elected**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Atal announced that the centrist coalition led by President Emmanuel Macron will reduce electricity bills and inheritance tax and link retirement pensions to inflation if they win the early elections. This is an attempt to counter the rise of the far-right and form a new left-wing alliance. Macron's coalition, 'Together', is considered the less likely to win in the parliamentary elections, which Macron called after losing heavily to the National Rally, a far-right party, in the European Parliament elections this month. The early elections are scheduled to take place on June 30 and July 7. Macron's campaign focuses on appearing as a fortress for democratic values and sound economic management that protects the nation from extreme political extremes. Atal said that the policies advocated by the National Rally and the new left-wing parties, known as the Popular Front, will lead to mass unemployment. He added in a press conference: 'Let us not jump into the unknown without a safety net.'
