Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Macron's "Together" coalition came second in recent legislative elections with 168 seats
- Left-wing "New Popular Front" won 182 seats
- Far-right "National Union" won 143 seats
- No party has an absolute majority (289 seats needed)

2. Key Timeline:
- Current PM Gabriel Attal has resigned
- Macron will name new PM after Olympics (which end August 11)
- Target date for question is August 31, 2024
- Macron has called for "broad coalition"

3. Key Factors Supporting Macron Coalition PM:
- Macron retains constitutional power to appoint PM
- Historical precedent of presidents maintaining party alignment
- "Together" remains second-largest bloc
- Macron explicitly seeking broad coalition centered on his movement

4. Factors Against Macron Coalition PM:
- "Together" lost majority
- Left coalition has more seats
- Left proposing their own PM candidate (Lucie Castets)
- Political pressure to respect election results

5. Critical Analysis:
- No bloc has majority, forcing negotiations
- Macron unlikely to appoint left-wing PM given ideological differences
- Most likely scenarios:
  a) Macron coalition PM with support agreements (highest probability)
  b) Technical/compromise PM from Macron's broader circle
  c) Left-wing PM (lowest probability given Macron's statements)

6. Recent Developments:
- Macron explicitly rejected left's PM candidate
- Calling for "republican forces" to work together
- Deliberately waiting until after Olympics for negotiations

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.80%, with 65.30% being the most likely. Probability: 65.30%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Macron's "Together" coalition came second in recent legislative elections with 168 seats
- Left-wing coalition won 182 seats
- Far-right won 143 seats
- No party has absolute majority (289 seats needed)

2. Key Timeline:
- Attal (current PM from Together) has resigned
- Macron will appoint new PM after Olympics (after August 11)
- Target date for question is August 31
- Decision needs to be made between August 11-31

3. Key Factors:
Pro-Together PM:
- Macron retains constitutional power to appoint PM
- Together is second-largest bloc
- Macron calls for "broad coalition"
- Historical precedent of presidents maintaining some control

Against Together PM:
- Left-wing coalition has most seats
- They've proposed Lucie Castets as PM
- No party has clear majority
- Left won elections, giving democratic mandate

4. Critical Considerations:
- Macron needs workable majority
- Parliament fragmented into three blocs
- Coalition-building essential
- Institutional stability needed post-Olympics

5. Analysis:
- Macron likely to try maintaining some control
- But lacks clear majority
- Must balance democratic mandate with governance
- Left coalition has stronger position but not absolute power
- Compromise candidate possible but challenging

Given the complex parliamentary arithmetic, institutional constraints, and Macron's stated desire for broad coalition, while acknowledging the left's plurality but not majority, I assess there's a moderate chance of a Together PM, but lower than even odds.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

3. Supporting Arguments for Together Coalition PM:
- Macron retains constitutional power to appoint PM
- Historically presidents try to maintain control through their coalition
- Together coalition still has significant seats (168)
- Macron is calling for "broad coalition" which could include moderates

4. Arguments Against Together Coalition PM:
- Left-wing coalition has more seats (182)
- Macron's coalition lacks majority
- Strong opposition from both left and right
- Historical precedent of "cohabitation" in similar situations

5. Critical Factors:
- Need for stable government during/after Olympics

- Constitutional requirement for PM to have parliamentary support
- Macron's emphasis on "broadest possible support"

6. Key Uncertainties:
- Potential coalition negotiations
- Whether opposition can form united front
- Possibility of compromise candidate
- Risk of political deadlock

Given that Macron retains appointment power but faces significant constraints from parliamentary arithmetic, and considering the historical precedent of cohabitation, I assess that a non-Together PM is more likely but not certain.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.

2. Key Timeline:
- Current interim government will remain until after Olympics (August 11)
- Macron will appoint new PM after Olympics
- Target date for question is August 31, 2024

3. Key Evidence For Together Coalition PM:
- Macron has constitutional power to appoint PM
- "Together" is second largest bloc
- Macron calls for "broad coalition" suggesting compromise
- Historical precedent of presidents maintaining some control

6. Analysis:
The situation suggests a likely compromise scenario. While Macron's coalition didn't win the most seats, his constitutional powers and the need for stability give him significant leverage. However, he'll need to make concessions to form a workable government.

The most probable outcome appears to be either:
a) A PM from Macron's coalition but with concessions to other parties (40-45% chance)
b) A compromise candidate acceptable to multiple blocs (35-40% chance)
c) A left-coalition PM (20-25% chance)
