To forecast whether the US will see a large-scale riot between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and specific evidence.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
Large-scale riots in the US are relatively rare but not unprecedented. Events like the 1992 LA riots, the 2020 George Floyd protests, and the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot meet the criteria of large-scale riots. These events typically occur in response to specific triggers, such as police violence, political unrest, or social injustice. Historically, such events occur once every few years, suggesting a base rate of around 5-10% for a large-scale riot in any given year.

### Step 2: Current Trends and Evidence
1. **Political Polarization**: The US remains highly polarized, with tensions between political factions, particularly around the 2024 election cycle. This increases the risk of civil unrest.
2. **Economic Conditions**: While not explicitly mentioned, economic instability (e.g., inflation, unemployment) can exacerbate social tensions, though current data does not indicate severe economic distress.
3. **Recent Events**: The articles highlight riots and unrest in the UK and France, but there is no direct evidence of similar unrest in the US. However, the Democratic National Convention in Chicago (August 18-22, 2024) is a potential flashpoint, given the history of protests and violence at political conventions (e.g., 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago).
4. **Security Measures**: The US has deployed significant security resources for the Democratic Convention, including 2,500 local police officers and federal support. This reduces the likelihood of a large-scale riot but does not eliminate it entirely.
5. **Social Media and Misinformation**: The spread of misinformation, as seen in the UK riots, could escalate tensions in the US, particularly around politically charged events.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Drivers of Unrest**: Political polarization, economic anxiety, and social media misinformation could fuel unrest.
- **Mitigating Factors**: Strong security measures, public fatigue from previous unrest, and the absence of a specific triggering event (e.g., police violence) reduce the likelihood.

### Step 4: Adjusting the Base Rate
Given the current context, I adjust the base rate upward slightly due to the heightened political climate and the Democratic Convention as a potential flashpoint. However, the lack of a specific triggering event and robust security measures temper this adjustment.

### Step 5: Final Probability
Balancing these factors, I estimate a 15-25% chance of a large-scale riot in the US between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, with 20% being the most likely probability.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether the US will see a large-scale riot between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and specific evidence from the provided articles.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
Large-scale riots in the US are relatively rare events. Historically, riots meeting the criteria of 50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1 billion+ in property damage are infrequent. For example, the 1992 LA riots and the 2020 George Floyd protests were significant but did not meet all the criteria specified in the resolution criteria. The base rate for such events in the US is low, suggesting a low initial probability.

### Step 2: Current Trends and Evidence
The provided articles highlight significant unrest in the UK, driven by misinformation and far-right extremism following a tragic stabbing incident. While this is not directly relevant to the US, it demonstrates how misinformation and social tensions can escalate into widespread violence. In the US, there are no current reports of similar large-scale riots, but there are ongoing tensions related to political polarization, economic inequality, and racial issues.

### Step 3: Specific US Context
The US has a history of protests and riots, particularly around political events and social justice issues. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago (August 18-22, 2024) is a potential flashpoint, given the high security concerns and planned protests. However, the security measures in place, including the deployment of 2,500 local police officers and federal support, suggest a strong capacity to prevent large-scale riots.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
While the US has the potential for unrest, the combination of historical rarity, current lack of specific triggers, and strong security measures for key events like the Democratic National Convention suggests a low probability of a large-scale riot meeting the specified criteria.

### Step 5: Final Adjustment
Considering the base rate, current trends, and specific context, I adjust the initial low probability slightly upward due to the potential for unforeseen events or escalation during the Democratic National Convention. However, the overall probability remains low.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether the US will see a large-scale riot between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and specific evidence from the provided news articles.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rates**: Large-scale riots in the US are rare but not unprecedented. Events like the 1992 LA riots, 2020 George Floyd protests, and January 6, 2021, Capitol riot provide historical context. These events typically involve significant triggers (e.g., police violence, political unrest) and occur in highly polarized environments.
- **Current Context**: The US is experiencing heightened political polarization, economic uncertainty, and social tensions, which could increase the likelihood of civil unrest. However, no specific trigger for a large-scale riot is evident in the provided articles.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Triggers**: Are there specific events or conditions that could spark a large-scale riot? The articles mention protests and unrest in the UK and France but do not indicate similar triggers in the US.
2. **Preparedness**: Are authorities prepared to prevent or manage large-scale riots? The US has significant law enforcement and military resources, which could deter or contain riots.
3. **Public Sentiment**: Is there widespread anger or frustration that could lead to mass mobilization? While there are tensions, there is no evidence of a unifying issue that could escalate to a large-scale riot.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, large-scale riots in the US are rare and require specific triggers. The base rate suggests a low probability.
- **Inside View**: Current tensions and polarization could increase the risk, but without a specific trigger, the likelihood remains low.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The UK riots and French election unrest are concerning but do not directly translate to the US context. The US has different social, political, and law enforcement dynamics.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Drivers of Unrest**: Political polarization, economic inequality, and social justice issues could fuel unrest.
- **Deterrents**: Strong law enforcement, community resilience, and lack of a unifying trigger could prevent large-scale riots.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Current trends show localized protests and unrest but no signs of escalation to large-scale riots. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago (August 18-22, 2024) is a potential flashpoint, but security measures are likely to prevent significant violence.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The probability of a large-scale riot is low but not zero. The absence of a specific trigger and strong law enforcement presence reduce the likelihood.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the risk is low, it is prudent to acknowledge the potential for unforeseen events. However, overconfidence in predicting riots is unwarranted given the complexity of social dynamics.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overestimating the likelihood of riots based on international events (e.g., UK riots) without considering local context could lead to errors. Conversely, underestimating the impact of polarization could also be a mistake.

### Final Assessment
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Given historical patterns, the base rate for a large-scale riot in the US is low (e.g., 5-10%).
- **Current Context Adjustment**: The absence of a specific trigger and strong law enforcement presence further reduce the likelihood.
- **Final Probability**: Balancing all factors, the probability of a large-scale riot in the US between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, is low.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.

To forecast whether the US will see a large-scale riot between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and distinctive features of the present situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I do not have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this question. However, I can use historical data and recent events to inform my forecast.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of Large-Scale Riots in the US**: How often do riots meeting the criteria (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1B+ in damages) occur in the US?
2. **Current Political and Social Climate**: Are there ongoing tensions or events that could escalate into large-scale riots?
3. **Recent Events and Trends**: Are there recent riots or protests that could indicate a higher likelihood of future riots?
4. **Government and Law Enforcement Preparedness**: How prepared are authorities to prevent or control large-scale riots?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, large-scale riots meeting the criteria are rare in the US. The 1992 LA riots are a notable example, but such events are infrequent.
- **Inside View**: Current events, such as the UK riots and the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago, suggest heightened tensions and potential for unrest.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting**: Ignoring the potential for riots during a politically charged period like the Democratic National Convention.
- **Overreacting**: Assuming that every protest or riot will escalate to meet the criteria of a large-scale riot.

### Step 5: Look for Clashing Causal Forces
- **Escalating Factors**: Political polarization, economic inequality, and social media misinformation can fuel unrest.
- **De-escalating Factors**: Strong law enforcement presence, community interventions, and effective communication can mitigate riots.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- **Recent Trends**: The UK riots and the potential for similar unrest in the US, especially around high-profile events like the Democratic National Convention.
- **Linear Extrapolation**: If current tensions continue, there is a moderate risk of large-scale riots.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- **High Certainty**: Large-scale riots are rare, but not impossible.
- **Moderate Certainty**: The Democratic National Convention could be a flashpoint for unrest.
- **Low Certainty**: The exact likelihood of riots meeting the criteria is uncertain.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- **Prudence**: Acknowledge the rarity of large-scale riots but recognize the potential for escalation.
- **Decisiveness**: Provide a specific probability range based on available evidence.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
- **Hindsight Bias**: Avoid overestimating the likelihood of riots based on recent events.
- **Confirmation Bias**: Consider both evidence for and against the likelihood of riots.

### Step 10: Final Forecast
Considering the base rate of large-scale riots, the current political climate, and recent events, I estimate the probability of a large-scale riot in the US between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, as follows:

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.**

To forecast whether the US will see a large-scale riot between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and specific evidence from the provided news articles.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
Large-scale riots in the US are relatively rare but not unprecedented. Historical examples include the 1992 LA riots, the 2020 George Floyd protests, and the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. These events typically occur in response to specific triggers, such as police violence, political unrest, or economic distress. The base rate for such events in a given 2.5-month period is low, perhaps around 5-10%.

### Step 2: Current Trends and Evidence
The news articles provided focus primarily on riots in the UK and other countries, with limited direct relevance to the US. However, there are some indirect indicators:
- **Political Polarization**: The US remains highly polarized, with tensions around the 2024 election cycle, particularly around the Democratic National Convention in Chicago (August 18-22, 2024). The FBI has warned of potential violence, including from "isolated individuals" motivated by anti-government beliefs or political grievances.
- **Economic and Social Stressors**: While not explicitly mentioned, economic inequality, racial tensions, and dissatisfaction with government policies could serve as underlying triggers.
- **Protest Activity**: The articles mention pro-Palestinian protests and the "Abandon Biden" campaign, which could escalate into unrest, especially if met with heavy-handed police responses.

### Step 3: Distinctive Features of the Present Situation
- **Democratic National Convention**: This high-profile event in Chicago could attract large protests, particularly from groups opposing US support for Israel or dissatisfied with the Biden-Harris administration. The 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago was marked by violent clashes, and while security measures are more robust today, the potential for unrest remains.
- **Election-Related Tensions**: The 2024 election is highly contentious, and the period leading up to it could see increased political violence, particularly if there are incidents like the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July 2024.
- **Social Media and Misinformation**: The spread of misinformation, as seen in the UK riots, could exacerbate tensions in the US, particularly if false narratives about political or racial issues gain traction.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
While the base rate suggests a low probability, the combination of political polarization, high-profile events like the Democratic Convention, and the potential for misinformation-driven unrest increases the risk. However, the US has not recently experienced riots on the scale of the 1992 LA riots or the 2020 George Floyd protests, which suggests that the likelihood of a large-scale riot meeting the specific criteria (50+ deaths, 10,000+ arrests, or $1 billion+ in damages) remains relatively low.

### Step 5: Final Probability Estimate
Considering the base rate, current trends, and distinctive features, I estimate the probability of a large-scale riot in the US between July 17, 2024, and September 30, 2024, as follows:

**My Prediction: Between 8.00% and 15.00%, but 11.50% being the most likely. Probability: 11.50%.**
