The Chicago White Sox have reached a disappointing milestone, becoming the first team in franchise history to lose 100 games in back-to-back seasons. They dropped to 31-100 overall with a 9-4 loss to the Tigers on August 25, 2024. The team's struggles have been ongoing, with a 1-26-1 record in series competition since May 15 and a 8-37 ledger within the AL Central. Despite the disappointing season, the clubhouse and roster have held together, with players showing resolve and a commitment to improvement. General manager Chris Getz acknowledged the need for a plan to improve the organization in all facets, saying 'We know there will be no shortcuts along the way. We are committed to doing what's right for us long term.'

**White Sox reach 100 losses for 6th time in franchise history: How many more will they lose?**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox have reached 100 losses for the sixth time in franchise history, with 31 games left to play in the season. This is the first time they have lost 100+ games in back-to-back seasons. The team is on track to become the losingest team in modern MLB history, a record currently held by the 1962 New York Mets, who lost 120 games in their first year. The White Sox have had several long losing streaks, including 14 straight games and 21 games, but also had some brief winning streaks, including a four-game sweep of the Tampa Bay Rays. They are the fastest team to clinch a losing season since MLB expanded in 1961, needing just 109 games to reach 82 losses.

**Editorial: The 2024 White Sox already are a team for the ages. There's still more to 'accomplish.'**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox are on track to set the all-time Major League Baseball record for losses in a season, with a current winning percentage of .235. They have already tied the American League record for most consecutive losses at 21. Manager Pedro Grifol and the team are struggling, and it's not just his fault. Owner Jerry Reinsdorf's decision to promote Chris Getz, the assistant general manager, to succeed the fired Kenny Williams and Rick Hahn, has been criticized. Reinsdorf said, 'Speed is of the essence,' but it seems that the team is going in the wrong direction. The team has 47 games left to play and is giving the term 'playing out the string' a bad name. Some fans are 'hate watching' the team, rooting for them to become the all-time worst in MLB's history.

**White Sox reporter drops bombshell on team's manager, sums up 2024 season**
The Chicago White Sox have had a disastrous 2024 season, with a record of 27-84, the worst in Major League Baseball. The team has lost 17 games in a row and is 40.5 games behind in the American League Central and 34 games behind in the AL Wild Card race. According to ESPN's Jesse Rogers, manager Pedro Grifol has lost the trust of his players and it will be difficult for him to regain it. Rogers said, 'The short answer is yes, I just think there's been a leadership void since last year. You're really going to have to work hard to get that back.' With two consecutive sub-.500 finishes, it is likely that Grifol will be replaced by the end of the season.

**Chicago White Sox Continue Historical Downtrend**
The Chicago White Sox's 2024 season is on a historical-bad pace, with their 17th-straight loss and fifth-consecutive series sweep. According to TSN Statscentre, this stretch is tied for the fifth-worst in American League history. The White Sox have scored over three runs just twice in their last 17 games, with a dismal .212 batting average in July. They have already broken their franchise record for consecutive losses, and will need to lose five more games to set the American League record for most consecutive losses. As they prepare for next season, the White Sox have already started retooling, trading several key players at the deadline. 'The 2024 team could end up the worst in MLB history as a result,' according to the article.

**White Sox Suffering: A Season to Forget**
The Chicago White Sox are experiencing one of the worst seasons in Major League Baseball history. After 139 games, they have already lost 108 and are heading towards their 109th loss of the 2024 season. A sequence like the one in the video below is not helping their cause. In the second inning of their game against the Baltimore Orioles, a defensive communication breakdown led to a collision between third baseman Miguel Vargas and outfielder Andrew Benintendi. As a result, Eloy Jimenez's high fly ball turned into a home run that scored all three runners. Due to the force of the contact, Vargas remained on the ground and needed the team's trainers to regain consciousness. He was eventually replaced by Brooks Baldwin.

**Miserable White Sox season hits new low with painful mishap, home run robbery**
The Chicago White Sox suffered their 103rd loss of the season in a 4-3 defeat to the Texas Rangers. The game was marked by two wild plays, including infielder Lenyn Sosa getting hit in the face with a ball and left fielder Travis Jankowski making a leaping catch to rob Andrew Vaughn of a walk-off home run.

As White Sox manager, said, 'It was a rough night for the White Sox on Wednesday.'

**White Sox lose 100th game of 2024 MLB season: Chicago club on pace to beat 1962 Mets for most losses**
The Chicago White Sox have reached the 100-loss mark in the 2024 MLB season, with a 31-100 record. They are on pace to lose 124 games, which would break the modern-era record held by the 1962 New York Mets. The team has set a new franchise record with 14 consecutive losses and an AL record-tying 21 straight losses. They are also on pace to have a minus-300 run differential, which would be the 21st team in the modern era to achieve this. The 2024 White Sox are on track to be the worst team in franchise history, surpassing the 1970 squad that went 56-106. They must win at least 12 of their final 31 games to avoid 120 losses and 21-10 to avoid a .325 winning percentage, the worst in franchise history.

**White Sox lose 100th game of 2024 as dismal season wears on**
The Chicago White Sox have lost their 100th game of the 2024 season, with 31 games remaining, putting them on pace for one of the worst seasons in Major League Baseball history. According to the article, the team needs to go 12-19 down the stretch to avoid tying the 1962 New York Mets' record for most losses in a season. The team's current performance is a stark contrast to their previous seasons, with their most losses in a season coming in 1970 when they were 56-106. The team has also seen a change in management, with Grady Sizemore taking over as interim manager after the firing of Pedro Grifol on August 8, resulting in a 3-11 record under his leadership. Andrew Vaughn gave a valiant effort for the White Sox, hitting a home run and having two RBI, but it was not enough to overcome the 9-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers.

**2024 White Sox Are Literally Worst MLB Team of All Time After Historic Losing Streak**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox are on pace to lose 123 games, making them one of the worst teams in Major League Baseball history. Their .241 winning percentage is the 10th-worst in MLB history, but considering the team's recent performance, it's more relevant to compare them to the 1899 Cleveland Spiders, who lost 134 games. The White Sox's roster is worth 2.0 WAR, a mark reached by 97 different hitters and 52 different pitchers across MLB. They're threatening to become the first team in 43 years to score fewer than 3.1 runs per game. The team's manager, Pedro Grifol, seems like a 'dead man walking' after clashing with players. The White Sox's struggles are emblematic of a problem in MLB, where competitive balance has not improved, and teams like the Rockies and Marlins are also on pace to lose 100 games. The collective bargaining agreement has anti-tanking measures, but they have not been effective. The article suggests that a reverse luxury tax or tax penalties based on losses could be a solution to this problem.

The Chicago White Sox have suffered their 19th consecutive loss, a 6-2 defeat to the Minnesota Twins, tying them for the seventh-longest losing streak in MLB's modern era. The team has not won since July 10 and faces significant challenges, including a trade deadline sell-off that has left them shorthanded. According to the numbers, the White Sox's current losing streak stands at 19 games, and they are on pace for a projected 38-124 record in 2024, the second-worst in modern MLB history. As White Sox management evaluates roster changes and strategies moving forward, it's clear that the team's predicament highlights deep-rooted issues within the organization, requiring significant changes in leadership and player development to restore competitiveness in the coming seasons.

**The 2024 Chicago White Sox have a chance to be the worst team in MLB history**
The Chicago White Sox have a chance to become the worst team in MLB history with their current 17-game losing streak. They've broken their franchise record for longest losing streak twice this year and are now on pace to potentially break the record for the worst regular season record in a season that went at least 162 games. The team's poor performance has been exacerbated by their trade deadline, where they sent out several productive players, including Paul DeJong, Tommy Pham, and Erick Fedde. As Andrew Mearns described, 'It's an awful time to be a White Sox fan.' The team's woes could get even deeper, with a potential 23-game losing streak putting them in league with the 1961 Philadelphia Phillies. If the streak continues, the White Sox could face the Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, and Houston Astros, potentially setting a record for the worst losing streak in the modern era. 'History is well and truly within the grasp of the White Sox at this point,' and it's up to the organization to either become a 'truly memorable five-alarm tire fire' or a 'fairly notable halfway crooks in inglorious baseball lore.'
