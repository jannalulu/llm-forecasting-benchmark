Let's systematically analyze this step by step:

Reference Baseline:
1. The original "Deadpool" opened at $132.4 million
2. "The Wolverine" opened at $53.1 million
3. Combined opening: $185.5 million
4. Resolution criterion: Must exceed $185.5 million to resolve as "Yes"

Current Box Office Tracking Evidence:
- Multiple sources consistently predict $160-$165 million opening
- Some optimistic projections range $200-$239 million
- Quorum (tracking service) previously projected $200 million, now moderated
- Presales at $19 million, ahead of some previous Marvel films

Analytical Considerations:
- First MCU Deadpool film
- High anticipation due to Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman
- R-rated film with established fanbase
- Potential multiverse/cameo appeal
- Box office currently struggling in 2024

Risk Assessment:
- Tracking suggests likely but not guaranteed success
- Conservative estimates still strong
- Marketing and pre-release buzz robust

Probability Calculation:
- Base likelihood around 65-75%
- Adjusting for tracking consistency and franchise strength
- Accounting for potential underperformance risks

My Prediction: Between 72.50% and 82.30%, but 77.40% being the most likely. Probability: 77.40%.

Let's systematically analyze this box office prediction:

Reference Class & Base Rates:
1. Original Deadpool (2016): $132.4M opening
2. The Wolverine (2013): $53.1M opening
3. Combined historical baseline: $185.5M
4. First combined MCU Deadpool film

Key Evidence:
- Multiple tracking sources consistently predict $160-$165M opening
- Some bullish predictions suggest $200-$239M potential
- First R-rated Marvel MCU Deadpool film
- Ryan Reynolds + Hugh Jackman together
- High pre-sale ticket interest (200,000 tickets)
- The Quorum shows 66% interested, 77% willing to pay
- 365M trailer views in 24 hours

Adjustment Factors:
- MCU needs a win after recent disappointing releases
- R-rating might limit total audience
- Summer blockbuster competition
- Strong marketing and anticipation

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base scenario: Slightly exceed combined historical baseline
- Upside potential from star power and MCU integration
- Downside risks from R-rating and audience fatigue

Careful triangulation suggests strong likelihood of exceeding $185.5M baseline.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.50%, but 91.25% being the most likely. Probability: 91.25%.

Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Base Reference Class:
- Original Deadpool opened at $132.4M
- The Wolverine opened at $53.1M
- Combined prior opening: $185.5M (resolution criteria threshold)

Box Office Tracking Evidence:
- Multiple sources consistently predict $160M-$165M opening
