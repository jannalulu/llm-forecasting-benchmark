**Volatility, Stock Market Seasonality on a Collison Course**
J.P. Morgan's chief market strategist, Marko Kolanovic, has left the bank to explore other opportunities, leaving a void in the market. His departure comes as the bank has the lowest 2024 target for the S&P 500 Index among banks it tracks at 4,200. Despite this, the market is expected to be bullish in the coming weeks, with a historically bullish period leading up to July standard expiration. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has been low, but may spike in the next two weeks. The McClellan Summation Index, a market breadth indicator, is on the verge of clearing its 8-day displaced moving average, and the New York Stock Exchange has already cleared this trendline. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) broke through the call wall at the 550-strike last week and is expected to continue to rise. Inflation data and earnings reports from JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Delta Air Lines will be important to watch in the coming week.

**Report from Wall Street: In the Stock Market, Not Everything is as it Seems**
The stock market has seen a deceleration of inflation, which has boosted investor confidence in the economy this year, combined with an intense enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, providing the backdrop for a rally that has exceeded all expectations. The S&P 500 has risen 15% in the first half of 2024. However, beneath the surface, there are turbulence: Nvidia, for example, has risen over 150% this year, but has also experienced repeated deep price drops in the past six months, cutting millions of dollars off its market value. More than 200 companies, or about 40% of the index, are at least 10% below their highest level this year. Almost 300 companies, or about 60% of the index, are more than 10% above their lowest level this year. And each group includes 65 companies that have actually turned in both directions. Market operators say that this lack of correlated movement, known as dispersion, is at historic extremes, undermining the idea that markets have been calm. A measure of this, a Cboe Global Markets index, shows that dispersion increased after the COVID-19 pandemic, as technology stocks soared while other companies suffered. It has remained high, partly due to the astonishing appreciation of a few AI-leading stocks, say analysts. This presents an opportunity for Wall Street, as funds and trading desks accumulate in trading dispersion, a strategy that normally uses derivatives to bet on low index volatility while individual stock turbulence remains high. 'It's everywhere,' said Stephen Crewe, a long-time dispersion operator and partner at Fulcrum Asset Management. He believes that these dynamics have surpassed even economic data in terms of their importance to financial markets. 'For the moment, almost none of the GDP or inflation data matters,' he added. The risk for investors is that stocks will start moving in the same direction again, probably due to a spark that sets off general sales. When that happens, some fear that the role of complex volatility trading could reverse and, instead of mitigating the appearance of turbulence, exacerbate it.

**Stocks are headed for a 'summer squall,' Citi warns**
Citigroup equity strategist Scott Chronert warns that the stock market may experience a 'summer squall' due to high valuations, potential threats such as the upcoming 2024 U.S. election, inflation concerns, and geopolitical risks. Despite this, Chronert still expects the S&P 500 to finish the year at or around 5,600. The strategist notes that high valuations have historically impeded forward returns, and the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently above the 90th percentile from the past 40 years. Additionally, a gauge of investor sentiment is pointing towards euphoria, and the Cboe Volatility Index is near its lowest level since 2019, suggesting the market could be primed for a burst of volatility if a negative catalyst arrives.

**VIX Rises 8%, Treasury Yields Jump, Dow Plunges: Why Is Wall Street Wobbling Thursday?**
The US stock market experienced a volatile start to Thursday, with all major indices and sectors trading in the red. The rise in interest rates and concerns about a higher-for-longer interest rate scenario led to increased investor anxiety and volatility. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged 8%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 4.72%. The S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq 100 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all fell, with small caps experiencing a larger decline. Traders are now pricing in only one rate cut by the end of the year, with expectations of two rate cuts by the end of Q1 2025.

**VIX Spikes, Dow Sinks As Inflation Jitters Slaughter Fed Easing Hopes: Traders Now Price In Only One Rate Cut In 2024**
The stock market experienced a sharp downturn on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1.5% and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both falling 0.9%. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged over 7% after hitting its lowest level since November 2019. The decline was driven by concerns over inflation, with the S&P Global Composite PMI Index showing the highest expansion rate in two years. The report also showed that input prices continued to rise sharply, with manufacturers facing the largest cost rise in a year and a half. As a result, investors are now pricing in only one rate cut in 2024, down from previous expectations of multiple cuts.

**Stock Market News for Jul 1, 2024**
The US stock market closed lower on Friday, with tech and discretionary stocks leading the decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 all ended in the red, with the Dow Jones falling 41.12 points, or 0.1%, to close at 39,122.94. The decline was attributed to political uncertainty following the first Presidential debate, with the fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index increasing 1.6% to 12.44. Mega-cap growth stocks like tech and discretionaries, such as Meta Platforms and The Walt Disney Company, slid 3% and 2.8%, respectively. Despite the decline, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted gains for the month and quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.7% in the quarter.

**S&P 500 returns 15% in the first half in an unusually smooth ride**
The S&P 500 has returned 15% in the first half of 2024, making it the 21st best performance since 1900. The index has been driven by a handful of large-cap companies, with the typical stock lagging behind. Despite the stellar returns, some market experts are concerned about the market's fragility and the potential for a correction. The S&P 500 has gone eight sessions without a move of more than half a percent, and its worst daily decline in June was only 0.4%. The CBOE Volatility Index is near a multi-year low, but the S&P's realized volatility over the past 30 days is higher. Some experts believe that the market's recent performance is unsustainable and that a correction is overdue. Others argue that the market's strength is due to the presence of high-conviction secular growth companies and that the rally is not over yet. The article also discusses the dispersion trade, where investors are shorting index volatility and buying single-stock volatility, and the recent sprint-and-stumble performance of high-momentum stocks.

**Low Volatility: A Sign of Market Strength or Weakness?**
The VIX index, which measures volatility, is currently below its historical average. This has implications for stock prices. According to LPL Financial's chief technical analyst Adam Turnquist, despite the recent increase in volatility, the expected volatility in the next 30 days is not a bad sign for future returns. The Cboe Volatility Index VIX rose 0.98 points to 13.28 points on Thursday, following a sharp decline in technology-focused stocks. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8% and the S&P 500 lost 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is heavily weighted towards technology, gained 0.8% on the day. Turnquist notes that the VIX has been in a downward trend since 2022 and is currently at its lowest level since January 2020. However, he believes that this low volatility may not last and that the VIX may rise again in the coming months. This could be a sign of a market correction. For stocks, low volatility can be a positive sign, as it can support above-average returns. According to Turnquist, when the VIX is below 13.21, the S&P 500 tends to have an average return of 8.8% over the next six months and 13.6% over the next 12 months.

**Stock volatility may pick up in June after ‘cracks in the ice' formed in May**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose 9.2% on Monday, indicating that stock volatility may increase in June after 'cracks in the ice' formed in the market in May. According to CFRA, the S&P 500 typically sees below-average volatility and returns in June, but this year may be different. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% on Monday, while the VIX rose 8.5%. The rise in VIX is attributed to concerns about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the direction of interest rates, as well as the potential for a recession. Additionally, the felony conviction of former President Trump has added uncertainty to the market. Despite these concerns, CFRA expects two rate cuts and higher share prices by year-end.

**Stock Market News for May 30, 2024**
US stock markets closed sharply lower on Wednesday due to concerns over interest rate cuts and weak earnings results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 all ended in negative territory. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose 10.5% to 14.28. Weak earnings from Bank of Montreal, Advance Auto Parts, and Columbus McKinnon contributed to the decline. The Fed's potential rate cut and yield spikes on US government bonds also weighed on the market. Higher interest rates can be detrimental to equity markets, increasing borrowing costs and reducing consumer spending.

**Wall Street slides as rate worries push bond yields higher**
Wall Street indexes fell on Wednesday as concerns about the timing and scale of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts pushed Treasury yields higher and pressured stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to its lowest level in nearly a month, and all major S&P 500 subsectors were in the red. The market is uncertain about the size and timing of interest rate cuts, with some expecting a 25 basis points cut only by November or December. The CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of market fear, hit its highest level since May 3. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book and comments from policymakers will be closely watched, with the main focus on Friday's release of April's Personal Consumption Expenditure data.

**Time to Reassess Exit, Stop-Loss Points**
The CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) has been tracking lower, moving below its 2023 close and reaching its lowest level since November 2019. This suggests lower volatility and higher stock prices.

The article discusses the importance of the VIX and its relationship with the SPX, as well as other sentiment indicators that are moving in favor of the bulls.

**VIX Index Closes at Lowest Since 2019 as S&P 500 Grinds Higher**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) closed at its lowest level since November 2019, indicating that traders are the least concerned about wild stock market swings since before the Covid-19 pandemic. The VIX measures the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500, which has been trading in a tight range just below its all-time high. The low readings can be attributed to a diminished demand for hedges to protect against a selloff, as the S&P 500 has been climbing and traders are not interested in paying up for protection. Slightly softer inflation data has also renewed optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates earlier, pushing stocks higher.
