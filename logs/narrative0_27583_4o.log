*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers spread out before them. A digital clock on the wall reads 16:15.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, did Zambia confirm Clade I mpox infections before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.72%. Despite the outbreak in neighboring countries, Zambia managed to avoid it.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The WHO's declaration in August certainly heightened concerns. With cases in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, many expected Zambia to follow.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but Zambia's proactive measures and border controls paid off. The Swedish case showed global spread, yet Zambia remained unaffected.

**NATE SILVER:** Itâ€™s a testament to the unpredictable nature of disease spread, even with accurate models.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. It underscores the importance of preparedness and rapid response. 

*They nod, acknowledging the complexity of forecasting in a world of uncertainties.*

**NATE SILVER:**

(looking into the camera)

So, as of today, Zambia has not confirmed any Clade I mpox infections. Our models had it at 45.67%, reflecting the situation given the rapid spread in neighboring countries.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:**

(nods)

Indeed, Nate. Despite the WHO's declaration and the cases in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, our models accurately predicted Zambia's current status. The containment efforts seem effective, for now.

**NATE SILVER:**

(turning to Philip)

It's fascinating how the spread halted at Zambia's borders. A testament to robust public health measures amidst the chaos.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:**

(smiling)

Absolutely. But with the situation evolving, vigilance remains key.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Zambia didn't confirm any Clade I mpox infections before October 1st. Our models had it at 35.47%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly, Nate. Despite the WHO's emergency declaration in August and the spread in neighboring countries, the probability remained low for Zambia.

**NATE SILVER**  
The containment efforts in those regions seem to have worked, keeping the virus at bay.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And let's not forget the rapid international response. The first Clade I case outside Africa in Sweden really galvanized global action.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. It shows how critical timely intervention is. Our models reflect that perfectly.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. This scenario highlights the power of predictive accuracy in public health crises.
