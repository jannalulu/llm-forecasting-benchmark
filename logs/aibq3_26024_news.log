**Reporter predicts whether Broncos rookie QB Bo Nix will start in Week 1**
The Denver Broncos are set to compete for the starting quarterback job between Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson. According to The Athletic's Nick Kosmider, Bo Nix is the favorite to start, as he has shown no signs of being outplayed by the other quarterbacks in camp. Nix, a 24-year-old rookie, has a strong chance of starting due to his ability to excel in head coach Sean Payton's system, which emphasizes the quick game, run game, and deep shots. If Nix emerges as the answer, it would be ideal for the Broncos, who have missed the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons since Peyton Manning's retirement in 2016.

**Broncos Training Camp Battles to Watch: QB1 Supremacy**
The Denver Broncos are entering training camp with a quarterback battle between three players: Zach Wilson, Jarrett Stidham, and Bo Nix. Wilson, the underdog, faces the toughest odds of becoming the starting quarterback due to his time with the New York Jets, where he threw 23 touchdowns to 25 interceptions. Stidham, who has spent a year in Sean Payton's system, may have a slight advantage, but he still needs to prove he can lead the team. Nix, the 12th overall pick, brings unique skills, including exceptional processing, timing, and accuracy, and is a strong contender to take the starting job. The Broncos' most crucial camp battle will be for the starting quarterback spot, with Nix and Stidham likely to be the top contenders.

**Back-to-back Auburn quarterbacks competing for starting spot with Broncos**
Auburn quarterbacks Bo Nix and Jarrett Stidham are competing for the starting spot with the Denver Broncos. Stidham, who was drafted by the Patriots in 2019, has been with the Broncos since last offseason and started the final two games of the 2023 season. Nix, who was drafted by the Broncos at No. 12, has been working with the first team during the team's Phase 3 practices. Stidham has been taking the first-team snaps, but Nix and Zach Wilson, who was acquired from the Jets, are also vying for the starting spot.

**Bo Nix expected to be the Broncos starting quarterback as Zach Wilson falls**
The Denver Broncos are expected to start quarterback Bo Nix in Week 1, with odds of -425, implying an 80.25% chance. Nix, the 12th pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, has been projected as a pro-ready prospect. Jarret Stidham is the backup with +450 odds, while Zach Wilson, a former No. 2 overall pick, is a long shot with +1000 odds. Wilson was traded to the Broncos after being replaced by Aaron Rodgers, and while he's welcoming the new challenge, the odds are against him starting Week 1. Coach Sean Payton has praised Nix, saying he's 'farther along' than most rookies, and the team is expected to give him every opportunity to establish himself as the starter.

**PFF Makes Bold Claim About Bo Nix Replacing Russell Wilson as Broncos' QB1**
Pro Football Focus (PFF) has made a bold claim about Bo Nix replacing Russell Wilson as the Denver Broncos' starting quarterback. PFF's Trevor Sikkema believes that the Broncos' decision to release Wilson and replace him with Nix was the best move they made this offseason. Sikkema praises Nix's pre-snap reads, play under pressure, and ability to avoid negative plays. However, he also notes that Nix's footwork needs to be more disciplined and he will take time to read progressions better in the NFL. The Broncos' head coach, Sean Payton, has committed to working with Nix and has given him the opportunity to start in training camp. Payton believes that Nix has the potential to be a franchise quarterback and is willing to take a chance on him. The early returns on Nix have been positive, with many praising his performance in offseason training. However, time will tell if Nix can live up to his potential and become the Broncos' starting quarterback.

**Rookie Bo Nix is the favorite to be the starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos**
Denver Broncos' rookie quarterback Bo Nix is the favorite to win the starting job over veterans Zach Wilson and Jarrett Stidham, according to Nick Kosmider of The Athletics. Kosmider stated, 'The only way Nix won't be the starter, in my estimation, is if he's vastly outplayed by one of the other quarterbacks in camp.' With Nix's collegiate experience and talent, it seems likely he will hold down the starting job, as his competition has seen limited success in the league. Head coach Sean Payton has high expectations for Nix, and his success will dictate the team's success in the upcoming season.

**Broncos position preview: Can rookie Bo Nix prove he's ready to be Sean Payton's quarterback in training camp?**
The Denver Broncos are entering training camp with a quarterback competition between Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson. Nix, a rookie selected 12th overall in the draft, is expected to be the starter, but the battle for the No. 2 spot is also intriguing. Stidham is a known quantity, while Wilson has tantalizing talent but limited production. The team will need to decide whether to prioritize money, long-term potential, or performance in the preseason to determine the backup quarterback. Wilson, despite being perceived as lagging behind Nix and Stidham, has impressive arm talent and could make a strong case for starting Week 1.

**One outcome for Bo Nix after Broncos training camp is reportedly off the table**
According to 9NEWS' Mike Klis, Bo Nix will either be the Denver Broncos' starting quarterback or the immediate backup, not the emergency quarterback. Klis believes Nix will finish first or second in the three-man race for the starting job alongside Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson. Klis' intel suggests that Nix is not getting enough reps with the ones and twos, but he expects the No. 3 option to emerge, which will likely be Wilson. Head coach Sean Payton will have the final say in who starts, leading Klis to believe Nix will be the starter sooner rather than later. Nix was drafted 12th overall due to his pro-readiness, but Klis questions whether he is truly ready. If Nix is not given the opportunity to prove himself, it could be a problem.

**Broncos roster series: No. 10, QB Bo Nix**
The Denver Broncos' 90-man offseason roster series continues with a look at rookie quarterback Bo Nix, No. 10. Nix began his college career at Auburn, then transferred to Oregon, where he played two seasons, completing 74.9% of his passes for 8,101 yards with 74 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions. He also rushed for 744 yards and 20 touchdowns. Nix is a smart, accurate passer with a quick release, and went 43-18 as a starter in college. The Broncos drafted him in the first round of the 2024 NFL draft (12th overall) and he is set to compete with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson for the starting quarterback job this summer. Nix is considered the early favorite to win the starting job and is a lock to make the 53-man roster as a rookie.

**Does Bo Nix even have real competition as Broncos' starting QB?**
The Denver Broncos have drafted Oregon's Bo Nix as their new franchise quarterback, but questions remain about the competition he faces. Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson, the other quarterbacks in the room, have struggled in the NFL and are unlikely to challenge Nix for the starting position. It's unclear whether the Broncos will sit Nix for the season to let him learn behind a veteran quarterback or throw him into the fire to learn on the fly. Head coach Sean Payton has praised Nix and seems to have high expectations for him, but it's uncertain if Nix can live up to the hype.

**Oddsmakers Don't Favor Jarrett Stidham in Broncos' QB1 Competition**
Oddsmakers have placed Bo Nix as the favorite to be the starting quarterback of the Denver Broncos for the 2024 season, with Jarrett Stidham as the long shot. Despite reports that Stidham had the best offseason, the oddsmakers are unphased. Stidham has a $7M cap hit in 2024 and would need to be significantly better than Zach Wilson to justify keeping him as the backup quarterback. The real competition is between Stidham and Wilson for the backup role, with Nix being the clear starter.

**Broncos' Bo Nix Receives Promising Prediction for 2024 Season: ‘Buy'**
The Denver Broncos are looking to snap a decade-long playoff drought and head coach Sean Payton is counting on rookie quarterback Bo Nix to lead the team. Nix, the highest-drafted quarterback under Payton, has shown promising signs in training camp, leading Bleacher Report's Alex Kay to predict that he will be the starting quarterback for Week 1. Broncos offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi praised Nix's maturity and ability to learn quickly, saying 'You can feel his 61 games played in college.' Nix will face competition from veterans Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson, but Kay believes Nix has the edge. Stidham has a 1-3 career record as a starter, while Wilson has a 12-21 record. The Broncos have a strong financial situation, with $7.6 million in cap space and the ability to clear up to $82 million in 2025. Nix's rookie contract is key to the team's future, and he must prove himself to attract free agents and take advantage of the team's flexibility.

**Broncos QB Bo Nix Predicted to Start All 17 Games & Prove He's the Guy**

Eisen believes Nix will receive help from running back Javonte Williams, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract.

**Bo Nix is the favorite to become the first QB Sean Payton throws under the bus in 2024**
The Denver Broncos are in a difficult situation, with a lack of assets for the future and a coach, Sean Payton, who may be under pressure to perform. Rookie quarterback Bo Nix is the favorite to start in Week 1, but if he struggles, Payton may blame him for the team's poor performance, potentially damaging Nix's confidence. This is a concerning combination, as a coach on the hot seat with a young quarterback can lead to poor development and a lack of trust. The article concludes that if Nix struggles, Payton will likely throw him under the bus, leaving the team with limited options at quarterback.

Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, a first-round draft pick, is set to compete for the starting job with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson. Nix's goal for his rookie season is to help the franchise succeed and win games, and he plans to achieve this by growing every day to be the best player he can be for his teammates and coaches.

**Paul Klee: To give Bo Nix a chance, Broncos must give him Courtland Sutton**
The Denver Broncos have chosen Bo Nix as their starting quarterback for the 2024 season, and it's crucial for the team to ensure that Courtland Sutton is on the roster to give Nix the best chance to succeed. Sutton has been absent from OTAs due to a contract dispute, and the team should grant him a slight pay raise. As a talented receiver, Sutton caught 10 touchdowns last season with a quarterback who clashed with the team's new coach, Sean Payton. Payton needs to empower Nix and provide him with the necessary support to succeed, and that includes having Sutton on the team.

**Broncos' Jarrett Stidham Lands on SI's Backup QB Rankings**
Denver Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham is ranked as the 18th backup quarterback in the NFL by Sports Illustrated's Gilberto Manzano, down two spots from last year. Stidham had mixed results in his two starts after the team released Russell Wilson, who is expected to be a bust. Meanwhile, first-rounder Bo Nix is expected to be the Broncos' starting quarterback by September 8, but still has a long way to go to secure the job. Nix has had positive early returns, being described as smart, competent, accurate, studious, intense, and teachable.

**Bo Nix Emerges As Front-Runner in ‘Worst QB Room' in NFL As Sean Payton Looks To Replace Russell Wilson in Denver Broncos**
Denver Broncos coach Sean Payton has a room full of rookie quarterbacks, including Bo Nix, Zach Wilson, and Jarrett Stidham, to replace Russell Wilson. NFL reporter James Palmer believes Bo Nix is the clear frontrunner for the starting position, citing his impressive college record with the Oregon Ducks. However, Payton plans to rotate the three quarterbacks in the beginning of the season before deciding on a starter. Zach Wilson, the 2nd overall pick of the 2021 Draft, also impressed Palmer with his arm talent in OTAs. The upcoming season will shape the future of the quarterback room for the Denver Broncos.

The Denver Broncos are currently evaluating three quarterbacks, Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson, to find their 2024 starter. Coach Sean Payton referred to them as the 'orphan group', as they come from different systems and are competing to learn the Broncos' system. Stidham signed with the Broncos as an unrestricted free agent, Wilson was traded from the New York Jets, and Nix was drafted 12th overall in the NFL Draft. Payton emphasized that the competition is still early in OTAs and not to draw conclusions from the current snap counts.

While Payton has not revealed a clear frontrunner, the team's draft activity and Wilson's trade suggest that Nix or Wilson may have an advantage. Stidham also has a chance to claim the starting spot.

**Broncos' Jarrett Stidham drops defiant QB1 message despite Bo Nix, Zach Wilson arrivals**
Denver Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham is determined to hold onto the starting role despite the arrival of rookie quarterback Bo Nix and veteran Zach Wilson. Stidham, who started two games last season, is looking to prove himself as the team's top quarterback. He believes his experience and incumbent status will give him an edge over Nix, who was selected in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft. However, Nix is expected to receive plenty of opportunities to compete for the starting role during training camp. Stidham has thrown for 1,422 yards, eight touchdowns, and eight interceptions over his four-year NFL career, while Nix threw for 15,352 yards, 113 touchdowns, and 26 interceptions in his college career.

**Bo Nix expected to be the Broncos starting quarterback as Zach Wilson falls**
The Denver Broncos are expected to start quarterback Bo Nix in Week 1, with odds of -425, implying an 80.25% chance. Nix, the 12th pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, has been projected as a pro-ready prospect. Jarret Stidham is the backup with +450 odds, while Zach Wilson, a former No. 2 overall pick, is a long shot with +1000 odds. Wilson was traded to the Broncos after being replaced by Aaron Rodgers, and while he's welcoming the new challenge, the odds are against him starting Week 1. Coach Sean Payton has praised Nix, saying he's 'farther along' than most rookies, and the team is expected to give him every opportunity to establish himself as the starter.

Denver Broncos' backup quarterback Zach Wilson discussed his trade from the New York Jets, saying he's grateful for his experiences and the guys he played with, but also excited for a fresh start. Wilson was the second pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, but struggled to cement himself as a suitable replacement for Aaron Rodgers, finishing last among qualified passers with a 30.6 adjusted QBR. He's now competing for the Broncos' starting job with rookie Bo Nix and journeyman Jarrett Stidham, but is likely to enter the season as the team's QB3.

**Bo Nix sets to be Broncos starter after head coach Sean Payton praises the young signal caller**
Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton has praised rookie quarterback Bo Nix, stating that he is farther along than most rookies and is extremely smart, having picked up the playbook quickly. Nix, a 24-year-old former Auburn and Oregon star, has more experience than average rookie quarterbacks, having made 61 starts in college. He has been taking first-team reps alongside Jarret Stidham and Zach Wilson, and there is no surprise if he becomes the Week 1 starter. Payton's system is expected to allow Nix to succeed, as he has posted impressive numbers in college, including the FBS' highest adjusted completion percentage and lowest turnover-worthy play rate. Former Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning also believes Nix would benefit from playing right away, as the team has had 13 different starting quarterbacks since Manning retired in 2016.

**Denver Broncos QB Decision: Bo Nix Should Be Set Up For Success, But How?**
The Denver Broncos selected Bo Nix with the 12th pick, but it's unclear when he'll take the field. Former kick returner Bucky Brooks suggests sitting him out for a few games to set him up for success. The Broncos have a solid roster and can use Jarrett Stidham as a placeholder. Nix has collegiate experience, but the NFL is a fast-paced game, and it may take time for him to adjust. The first four games are crucial, with opponents like the Seahawks, Steelers, Bucs, and Jets. Coach Payton may choose to start Stidham and wait to see how Nix develops. Alternatively, they can hold off on Nix and prepare him behind the scenes, taking the Patrick Mahomes route to the pros.

**Grading Bo Nix's 2024 NFL Draft landing spot with Broncos**
Bo Nix, the 12th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, joins the Denver Broncos with a challenging situation ahead of him. With the team's offense in flux and no long-term QB solution in-house, Nix will compete with Zach Wilson for the starting job. Despite the uncertainty, Nix's NFL-ready skills and supporting cast, including Courtland Sutton and Troy Franklin, give him a chance to succeed. Year 1 expectations are for Nix to win the starting job and remain entrenched as the season-long starter, with a projected 3,217 passing yards, 21 passing TDs, 13 INTs, and 198 rushing yards. In fantasy football, Nix can be considered a late-round QB2 option with upside, and in dynasty formats, he's an absolute steal in the mid-second to mid-third rounds.
