**Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle Refuses to Resign After Attempted Assassination of Donald Trump**
After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the Secret Service, responsible for protecting American personalities, announced that it will fully cooperate with the independent investigation to determine how the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was able to get so close to the former president. The agency's director, Kimberly Cheatle, who has been in office since September 2022, has announced that she will not resign after the event, which has shaken the US presidential campaign. The motive behind the attack remains unclear. Donald Trump was injured during the shooting and said that his ear was 'pierced' by a bullet. A spectator was killed and two others were seriously injured. The Secret Service is facing multiple questions and pressure is increasing, although President Joe Biden has confidence in Director Cheatle. According to ABC, Cheatle will testify before parliamentarians on July 22 in Washington. The Secret Service is working with local, state, and federal agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how to prevent such an event from happening again. Trump has called for the Secret Service to provide protection to another presidential candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, whose uncle, President JFK, and father, Democratic candidate Bobby Kennedy, were assassinated. This will be done, according to Alejandro Mayorkas, as Biden has ordered that Robert F. Kennedy be placed under protection.

**Kimberly Cheatle, US Secret Service Director, Under Fire After Trump's Attempted Assassination**
Kimberly Cheatle, the 27th director of the US Secret Service, is under fire from all sides of the American political spectrum after the attempted assassination of former President Trump. The agency is being criticized for not being able to stop Thomas Mattew Crooks before he started shooting. Cheatle, who has been in charge since 2022, is responsible for the execution of the agency's 'protection and investigation' mission. She has been working for the US Secret Service since 1995 and has previously worked as a vice president's protection team member during the Obama administration. After Trump's election in 2016, Cheatle became an additional vice director for training and later was appointed vice director for protection operations. After her retirement in 2019, she became the senior director of global security at PepsiCo, where she was responsible for directing and implementing security protocols. With Biden's election as president, Cheatle was recalled to the agency as director. Critics have accused her of being more focused on diversity and inclusion than on her role and the mission of her agents. 'What scares us all is that if the bullet had hit Trump an inch further, it would have been an assassination. Trump definitely needs more protection: now we're wondering if the services were completely prepared', said Stephen Moore, senior advisor to Trump's campaign. Cheatle has rejected the criticism, stating in a statement that the Secret Service agents 'acted quickly' and that the agency's plan was effective for the Republican convention in Milwaukee.
