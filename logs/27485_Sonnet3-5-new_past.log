Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Timeline: The question asks about the September 2024 FOMC meeting, specifically whether they will cut rates by 25 bps.

2. Current Situation:
- Current Fed funds rate: 5.25-5.50%
- Latest FOMC minutes indicate strong lean toward September cut
- Recent inflation and employment data support potential easing

3. Key Evidence For 25 bps Cut:
- Latest Fed minutes show "vast majority" believe September cut likely if data continues as expected
- CME FedWatch tool shows 68% probability of 25 bps cut
- Multiple economists (Wells Fargo, ING) predict 25 bps cut
- Recent economic data shows cooling inflation and labor market softening
- Fed officials increasingly signaling September timing

4. Key Evidence Against or For Different Size Cut:
- Some Wall Street experts argue for 50 bps cut
- Possibility of no cut if inflation data worsens
- Recent retail sales data showed strength
- Fed's historical preference for gradual moves

5. Analysis:
- Strong consensus forming around 25 bps cut
- Fed minutes and official communications clearly setting stage
- Market pricing largely aligned with 25 bps
- Economic data broadly supportive but not demanding larger cut
- Historical precedent favors 25 bps over 50 bps for first cut

Balancing these factors, while considering potential surprises in upcoming data and the Fed's typical cautiousness:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 75.50%, with 70.25% being the most likely. Probability: 70.25%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Question asks about September 2024 FOMC meeting
- Today is August 22, 2024
- We have about 1 month until the decision

2. Key Evidence FOR a 25bps cut:
- Recent Fed minutes indicate "vast majority" believe September cut is suitable
- CME FedWatch tool shows high probability of a cut
- Multiple recent articles indicate Fed officials are preparing markets for a cut
- Labor market showing signs of cooling
- Inflation continuing to moderate toward 2% target
- Fed Chair Powell has explicitly mentioned September as possible timing

3. Key Evidence AGAINST a 25bps cut:
- Some argue for larger 50bps cut
- Recent economic data still shows resilience
- Inflation still above 2% target
- Fed maintains data dependency
- Historical tendency for Fed to be cautious

4. Market Expectations:
- Latest CME futures show 68% probability of 25bps cut
- Economist surveys strongly favor 25bps cut
- Major banks (Wells Fargo, JPMorgan) predict 25bps cut

5. Risk Analysis:
- Main risk to 25bps cut would be unexpected inflation surge
- Labor market weakness could push for larger cut
- Fed has historically preferred 25bps increments when beginning cutting cycles

6. Recent Developments:
- Fed minutes from July meeting strongly signal September cut
- Economic data continues to support soft landing scenario
- Market increasingly confident in 25bps vs 50bps

The evidence strongly suggests the Fed will cut by 25bps in September, with multiple Fed officials signaling this intention and market expectations aligned. While there's still uncertainty due to data dependency, the probability appears high.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 75.50%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate/Outside View:
- The Fed has already held rates steady for 8 consecutive meetings
- Historically, the Fed tends to move gradually with 25bp moves being most common
- The Fed hasn't cut rates since March 2020

2. Recent Evidence For a 25bp Cut:
- FOMC July minutes show "vast majority" believe September cut likely if data continues as expected
- Recent labor market data shows weakening (unemployment rising to 4.3%, job gains overstated)
- Inflation continues moderating towards 2% target
- Fed officials, including Powell, have explicitly mentioned September as possible timing
- Market pricing (CME FedWatch) shows ~68% probability of 25bp cut

3. Evidence Against or For Different Size Cut:
- Some calls for 50bp cut due to recession risks
- Recent retail sales and inflation data came in stronger than expected
- Fed historically prefers to move gradually rather than aggressively
- Powell rejected idea of starting with 50bp cut

4. Key Uncertainties:
- August inflation report (due before meeting)
- Labor market data between now and September
- Financial market stability
- Global economic conditions

The most recent evidence, particularly the July FOMC minutes and market pricing, strongly suggests a 25bp cut is likely but not certain. The Fed has been clearly messaging this possibility while emphasizing data dependence.

Balancing these factors:
- The base case is clearly for a 25bp cut
- But there remains meaningful uncertainty around economic data
- The Fed's clear communication reduces but doesn't eliminate uncertainty
