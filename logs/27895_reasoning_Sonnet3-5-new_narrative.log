Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "So, Alexandre de Moraes is still on Brazil's Supreme Court."

Tetlock: "Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.5%. Despite the international pressure and Musk's campaign, the institutional barriers to removing a Supreme Court justice in Brazil are incredibly high."

Nate: "True. The data showed that without reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, and with President Lula's strong support, de Moraes's position was fairly secure. Even the X platform shutdown controversy didn't significantly impact his standing."

Tetlock: "The impeachment calls were mostly political theater. Our models factored in Brazil's historical precedent - they've never successfully impeached a Supreme Court justice. The probability of resignation was even lower."

Nate: "Another accurate forecast in the books."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, another prediction in the books. De Moraes is still on Brazil's Supreme Court, just as we expected."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models had it at 97.8%. Despite all the noise with Musk and the X platform shutdown, the institutional barriers to removing a Supreme Court justice in Brazil are incredibly high."

Nate: "Exactly. Life appointments are hard to break. Without the required two-thirds Senate majority for impeachment, and de Moraes being two decades away from mandatory retirement age, the probability of him leaving was minimal."

Tetlock: "The social media controversy actually strengthened his position. The court rallied around him as a defender of democratic institutions."

Nate: "Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the least exciting ones."

[They both chuckle and return to their data screens]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, de Moraes is still on the Supreme Federal Court. Despite all the controversy with Musk and X, he maintained his position."

Tetlock: "Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.5%. The calls for impeachment were loud, but the institutional barriers were too high. Life tenure is quite secure in Brazil's system."

Nate: "True. Even with the international pressure and domestic criticism, removing a Supreme Court justice isn't easy. The models accounted for the historical precedent - no Brazilian Supreme Court justice has ever been successfully impeached."

Tetlock: "The age factor was key too. At 55, retirement wasn't in play, and there was no health crisis. The probability was always going to be low without those factors."

[They both nod, making notes for their next forecast]
