1. **Reference Class Forecasting**: Apple typically introduces incremental upgrades to its iPhones each year. Historically, major technological upgrades such as significant increases in charging speed have happened in a progressive manner. The base rate of such major upgrades, particularly those involving battery and charging technologies, can give a rough probability. However, given that other smartphone manufacturers have already surpassed this charging speed, the pressure on Apple to upgrade may be higher.

2. **Rumor Consistency**: The news articles provided indicate a consistent rumor across multiple sources that the iPhone 16 Pro models will support 40W wired charging and 20W MagSafe wireless charging. Consistency across sources lends credibility to these claims.

3. **Event Timing**: The expected timeline for the announcement coincides with Apple's September event, which traditionally is when new iPhone models are introduced. This adds weight to the expectation of a 40W fast charge capability being officially announced.

4. **Clashing Forces**: There are potential technical challenges and thermal efficiency issues with adopting faster charging capabilities, which Apple might want to address to maintain battery health and device functionality.

5. **Inside vs. Outside View**: The current rumors provide a strong inside view of what might happen, given frequent mentions of increased charging speeds in multiple reports. The outside view considering Apple's conservative nature in battery technology changes could counterbalance this somewhat.

6. **Recent Trend Extrapolation**: Apple has been making incremental improvements in charging technology, following industry standards and sometimes lagging behind competitors in absolute charging speeds. This could be the generation where they close some of that gap.

Weighting these considerations, it seems more likely than not that Apple will announce an iPhone capable of 40W fast charging at their September event, especially given the volume and consistency of rumors.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.
