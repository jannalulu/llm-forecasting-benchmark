*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers in hand.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the numbers are in. Will the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area experience 11 or more days with AQI above 150 in Q3 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. Given the historical data and the lone high AQI day on July 5th, the odds were against it.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The pattern of wildfire smoke impacting air quality is unpredictable but not unprecedented. 2022 was an anomaly with 11 days, but the trend didn’t hold this year.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. It's a relief for residents, but the threat of wildfires and poor air quality remains. Our models are accurate, but nature always has its surprises.

**NATE SILVER:** Always. Until next time, let's hope for clearer skies.

*They nod, acknowledging the complex interplay of nature and prediction.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by stacks of papers and screens displaying air quality data.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, did the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area hit 11 or more days with an AQI above 150 in Q3?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. Given the historical data and the trends up to August, it seemed unlikely.

**NATE SILVER**  
True. Only one bad day by late July. The Bolt Creek scenario of 2022 was an outlier.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The rains came early this year, mitigating the wildfire impact.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how the models consistently align with reality. Even with unpredictable elements like wildfire smoke.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. But it's a relief for Seattle residents this time around.
