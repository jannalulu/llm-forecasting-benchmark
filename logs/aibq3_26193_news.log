**U.S Presidential Election 2024: Joe Biden vs Donald Trump - Will there be another debate? If yes, when?**
The second US Presidential Debate is scheduled to take place on September 10, hosted by ABC News. The debate will be moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, and the rules for participation have been confirmed. The location of the debate is yet to be announced. Additionally, there are reports of a Vice-Presidential debate between Kamala Harris and the Republican nominee. The rules for the debate require candidates to secure at least 15% of the total votes in four national polls, appear on enough state ballots to reach the required threshold of 270 votes, and agree to the debate rules and format. The first presidential debate was criticized for Joe Biden's performance, with many saying he appeared lost and incoherent, while Donald Trump dominated the debate.

CNN announced the rules for the first presidential debate between Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his Republican opponent Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election, which will take place on June 27th and last 1 hour and 30 minutes without an audience.

**Presidential Debates in the United States**
In the United States, President Biden has challenged his political opponent, Trump, to two debates, scheduled for June 27 and September 10. The debates will be held without an audience, at Biden's request. A third candidate, a Libertarian, son of the late Robert Kennedy, is seeking to be included in the debate, but this is unlikely. The recent history of presidential debates in the United States recalls those between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, won by Kennedy, and those between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, won by Reagan. This time, two elderly individuals will be present, trying to present themselves as the best option for their countrymen during 2025-2028. Millions of people in the United States and around the world will be following the outcome, which will influence the voters' decision, ultimately deciding the winner through the Electoral College.

**Trump and Biden's Presidential Debates: A Challenge for the Candidates**
The presidential debates between Trump and Biden are scheduled to take place on September 10th. Silja Bára Ómarsdóttir, a professor of political science at the University of Iceland, comments on the upcoming debates. She notes that the debates will be held in an empty hall, with no audience, and that Trump may not have the opportunity to interrupt Biden as he did in the 2020 debates. Silja also believes that Biden is under more pressure than Trump due to concerns about his age and mental fitness for the presidency. She states that Trump is in a better position, having only four years younger than Biden. Silja also comments on the upcoming elections, stating that it is still too early to predict the outcome, but that Biden may have an advantage due to the ongoing investigations and legal proceedings against Trump.

**Biden and Trump will meet for a debate this week. When are presidential debates typically held?**
The debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, hosted by CNN on June 27, will be the first of the 2024 election cycle and the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history. Typically, presidential debates are held in September or October, but this year's debate is scheduled earlier due to the candidates' quick wrapping up of their party's nominations and the decision to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The campaigns agreed to hold earlier debates to allow candidates to face the American people before voters go to the polls. In past elections, the first debate would take place after some states started sending out mail-in ballots, but this year's debate will take place before that. By agreeing to the earlier schedule, Biden and Trump seem to want to ensure that every voter is well-informed before submitting a ballot.

**Biden and Trump Agree to Debate in 2024: A Preview of the Upcoming Election**
US President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have agreed to debate in June and September 2024, setting the stage for what could be the earliest presidential election in modern US history. The debate will cover topics such as the economy, border security, and migration. The Biden administration's chief economic advisor has revealed plans to address the battle over billions in tax exemptions set to expire, which were implemented by Trump. According to a forecasting model, Biden is the favorite to defeat Trump in the 2024 US presidential election. The US economy has surpassed expectations by adding 272,000 jobs in May 2024, which could give Biden an unexpected boost before the debate. Biden and Trump will face off in a CNN-moderated debate on June 27 and an ABC News-moderated debate on September 10, 2024. The news came after Biden's campaign rejected the non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates' schedule, which has hosted presidential debates since 1988, and instead proposed two separate dates before the November elections.

**Presidential Debates in the United States**
In the United States, President Biden has challenged his political opponent, Trump, to two debates, scheduled for June 27 and September 10. The debates will be held without an audience, at Biden's request. A third candidate, a Libertarian, son of the late Robert Kennedy, is seeking to be included in the debate, but this is unlikely. The recent history of presidential debates in the United States recalls those between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, won by Kennedy, and those between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, won by Reagan. This time, two elderly individuals will be present, trying to present themselves as the best option for their countrymen during 2025-2028. Millions of people in the United States and around the world will be following the outcome, which will influence the voters' decision, ultimately deciding the winner through the Electoral College.

The 2024 presidential debate schedule has been altered, with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump agreeing to a pair of debates, bypassing the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.

The 2024 US presidential campaign is unlike any other, with debates between candidates taking place before the parties' official nominations. The traditional format of debates has been changed, with the first round taking place on June 27 on CNN and the second on September 10 on ABC. The Trump and Biden teams have agreed to hold the debates, but with some changes, such as no live audience and the organization being handled by TV channels instead of the Commission on Presidential Debates. The debates are crucial for both campaigns, as they aim to make the election memorable and engaging. However, some experts believe that the debates may not provide clear answers to the pressing issues, as both candidates have not presented clear solutions. The selection of a vice presidential candidate is also a concern, with Trump potentially announcing his choice before the debates. This is unprecedented and may cause controversy.
