INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. A digital clock on the wall reads 19:01.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back in chair)  
Well, the day has come and gone. Our models had it at 72.35%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The Abraham Accords set the stage. But Saudi Arabia's cautious diplomacy... it was always a delicate dance.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(holding a newspaper)  
Remember the July articles? The Biden Administration's push, Shapiro's role... it all pointed towards a shift.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
But the internal politics, the regional dynamics... Our models captured those complexities.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
And they weren't wrong. Whether it happened or not, 72.35% was spot on.

The clock ticks softly. The superforecasters exchange knowing glances, their confidence unshaken.

FADE OUT.
