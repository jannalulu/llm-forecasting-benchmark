**Trump and Habeck Join TikTok: The Politicians' Dance**
Donald Trump and German Economy Minister Robert Habeck have joined TikTok, a social media platform popular among the younger generation.

**Trump outpaces Biden and RFK Jr. on TikTok in race for young voters**
Former President Donald Trump has gained a massive following on TikTok, with 5.6 million followers and over 87 million views on his first video, surpassing his opponents in the presidential race, including President Biden and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The presence of both major party candidates on TikTok highlights its role in connecting with young voters ahead of the November election. Trump's success on the platform mirrors a trend of pro-Trump content being twice as common as pro-Biden content on TikTok. However, Trump's social media presence has been criticized for spreading misinformation, and his TikTok account may be used to spread falsehoods as well. The Biden campaign has taken a different approach, using the platform to highlight Trump's missteps and policy plans, while Kennedy has focused on his own pitch to voters and his role as an independent candidate.

**Donald Trump's TikTok Strategy: Reaching a New Audience**
Donald Trump, a former US president, has launched a TikTok account and is using it to communicate with his followers. Despite having a relatively low activity level, his account has gained 8.6 million followers and his first video has received 157.2 million views. This allows him to reach a disappointed audience who have left traditional social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Alexandre Eyries, an expert, notes that this may not directly influence voters, but can indirectly spread his message through online users who may become relays of communication. Trump's use of TikTok is seen as a way to connect with a younger audience who may not be interested in traditional politics.

**Censored and silenced: Why the mainstream media's selective coverage of the U.S. election is wrong**
The mainstream media's selective coverage of the U.S. election is criticized for excluding voices that challenge the status quo. Robert Kennedy Jr.'s exclusion from CNN's presidential debate is seen as an example of this. The article argues that the mainstream media is complicit in this exclusion due to its reliance on advertising revenue from corporate interests. It suggests that independent online platforms and podcasts are a potential alternative for finding news and opinions free from corporate influence. The article also highlights the impact of social media platforms like TikTok on the dissemination of information and the need for a more nuanced approach to reporting on complex issues.

**Trump's TikTok Dominance: Why His Content is Winning Over Young Voters**
Donald Trump is dominating the TikTok platform, with 7.5 million followers, compared to Joe Biden's 450,000 followers. Trump's posts, featuring him at events, are more popular than Biden's, which feature him in a more serious and political tone. A six-second video of Trump 'confronting' Paul Logan, a wrestler and influencer, has received 132 million interactions, while a post by Biden accusing Trump of being a liar has only received 44,000 interactions. According to Olivia Julianna, a young social media star, Trump's content creators are dominating the platform because they are producing more relatable and simple content. Julianna, who is pro-Biden but has 670,000 followers, believes that Biden's campaign is struggling to create engaging content on TikTok because it is too focused on politics.

**The 2024 election**
The 2024 US presidential election is taking place in the wake of the TikTok ban bill and the increasing use of AI-generated misinformation. The election is expected to be the most divorced from substantive policy than any other cycle in living memory. The Federal Communications Commission has proposed imposing multimillion-dollar fines on a political consultant and a telecom company for using an AI-generated deepfake of President Joe Biden's voice. The FCC has also proposed requiring political advertisers to disclose when they use AI-generated content on radio and TV ads. Meanwhile, the Senate Rules Committee has passed three bills aimed at safeguarding elections from deception by artificial intelligence. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is suing Meta for allegedly violating the First Amendment and engaging in 'election interference' because it removed a video about him. The US is heading into its first presidential election since generative AI tools have gone mainstream, and companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft have made announcements about how they plan to handle the months leading up to it.

**Trump leans into his star power on TikTok to court young voters**
Former President Donald Trump has expanded his social media reach by opening an account on TikTok, attracting more followers in less than 24 hours than the Biden reelection campaign since February. This move has raised concerns for President Biden, who needs a large turnout from young voters to win re-election. TikTok is a popular platform among young people, with 175 million users in the US, and has been a lightning rod for controversy due to concerns over national security, privacy, and election interference. Trump has racked up 6.1 million followers since posting his first video, while Biden has gained 374,000 followers. Trump has touted the disparity in followers, saying 'No one shows up to see Joe Biden speak in person and they certainly don't want to watch him on TikTok.' Whether Trump can drive young voters his way remains to be seen, but the opportunity exists, with over 60% of US adults under 30 using TikTok.

**TikTok Election: Politicians Join the Meme War**
The upcoming elections can be decided on social media, with British politicians quickly joining TikTok after it was announced that there will be an election on July 4. This has been called a TikTok election and is described as a meme war. In the EU parliamentary election, TikTok has also been a significant platform, with the far-right dominating the platform and many young voters supporting them. In the US, even older politicians, such as Donald Trump and Joe Biden, have started using TikTok. Trump has 6 million followers, while Biden has 365,000. Most of Biden's content is attacks on Trump. After the verdict in the Trump trial, Biden started attacking Trump as a criminal. In a video, a dancing body with a Trump head is shown. This is not coincidental, as a Reuters poll suggests that Trump may lose voters after the verdict, which is disputed. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are now targeting the unengaged voters and the young. They will now reach those who do not read newspapers or watch TV. TikTok is also cheaper than buying advertising time. A third of young users on TikTok say they get their news from there. Getting these users to vote on election day is difficult, but politicians who can engage with them can win the election. Around 150 million Americans are on TikTok, almost half the population. TikTok has been seen as a medium for the modern and liberal. However, according to TikTok's own information, pro-Trump content outperforms pro-Biden content in terms of views and engagement. This may be because Trump is more engaging, regardless of where you stand politically. TikTok is primarily a medium for short videos of things that take off, such as mob campaigns like Trump is good at, and strong emotions, not nuances. Gaza is another example. According to a poll commissioned by NPR, Biden has only gotten bigger problems among young voters. Users who can be thought to support Democrats are also spreading anti-Biden content. For example, because of Gaza. Being pro-Biden is too many uncultured. This does not necessarily mean that people support Trump. They can also be so-called 'double haters' who dislike both candidates. Out of these feelings, challenger Robert F. Kennedy Jr. rises. He is an independent candidate in the presidential election, has a family tree, a worm in his head, and 1.3 million followers on TikTok. RFK is running a populist, anti-elite campaign. It is almost only online and can be decisive in the election. There is much to criticize TikTok for. There is a lot of fake news, AI-generated content, propaganda, security threats, and holes. Transparency is also scarce, which makes activists constantly believe that their content is suppressed by algorithms. And it can be. We don't know what TikTok is doing. What we do know is that social media in general has the unfortunate side effect that it makes people who are already in real life more monstrous. One of them is net- radicalized Elon Musk, who spreads conspiracy theories and racism, and according to American media, is considering working for Trump. It can become a team in the White House. For some years ago, Norwegian politicians received criticism in the media for doing something that could be interpreted as promoting themselves. In the future, we can expect even more politicians who try to get a viral hit out.

**Trump's TikTok Profile: A Shift in Strategy for the 2024 Election**
Donald Trump's campaign has created a profile on TikTok, the Chinese video-sharing platform he previously tried to ban. Despite posting only one video, Trump has gained 3.5 million followers, surpassing Joe Biden. Trump aims to reach young voters, a crucial demographic for the upcoming presidential election. The Trump campaign is using TikTok to connect directly with the American people, as Trump believes it is an effective way to reach a younger audience.

**Trump Creates TikTok Account, a Surprise Move After Failed Attempts to Ban the Platform**
Former US President Donald Trump, who previously attempted to ban TikTok during his presidency, has now created his own account on the platform. Trump's team wants to use TikTok to reach a wider audience, especially young people, ahead of his potential 2024 presidential campaign. Despite his failed attempts to ban or force the sale of TikTok's US business, Trump has gained over 3.4 million followers on his official TikTok account in just one day. However, his team has only posted one video so far, a launch clip recorded at an Ultimate Fighting Championship event. Trump stated that he will use every available means to communicate directly with the American people. This move is surprising, as Trump had focused on his own social network, Truth Social, in recent months and years, which only reaches Trump fans and is not as popular as TikTok.

**Trump Joins TikTok, Surpasses 3 Million Followers**
Former US President Donald Trump joined the popular video-sharing platform TikTok on Saturday, surpassing 3 million followers. Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, posted a video showing him waving to the crowd during an open-hand fighting match in Newark, New Jersey, saying it was an honor. His first post received over 33 million views in 12 hours and has gained over 2.9 million likes. Trump is currently facing a series of criminal and civil lawsuits at the federal and local levels. He became the first former US president to be convicted of a crime after a jury in New York found him guilty of all 34 criminal charges related to falsifying business records in an attempt to hide financial payments to a porn star in 2016, just before the presidential election. Trump's rival in the 2024 presidential election, President Joe Biden, had already opened a TikTok account in February and has over 340,000 followers. TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance filed a lawsuit against the US government on May 7, citing a law that forces the company to sell the app or face a ban in the country. Biden signed a bill banning TikTok into law in April after it was approved by both houses of Congress. The ban, citing national security concerns due to the app's Chinese ownership, sparked widespread criticism from various quarters inside and outside the US, with people questioning the motivations behind Washington's suppression of the popular app and raising concerns about the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the principle of fair competition.
