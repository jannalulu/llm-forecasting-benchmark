INT. NEWSROOM - DAY AFTER THE POTENTIAL DEBATE

The newsroom buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER 1, a seasoned analyst, leans over a table covered in news clippings and data projections.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, it's September 11, 2024, and the question on everyone's mind is: Did Donald Trump debate the Democratic nominee last night? Our models had it at 15.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2, another expert, nods, scanning the headlines.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given Biden's withdrawal and the uncertainty over the new nominee, the odds were always slim. Trump's insistence on Fox News didn't help.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed, and with no new nominee confirmed by July 26, the likelihood plummeted. The debate was officially canceled.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models are never wrong. Last night's absence of debate was expected.

The newsroom settles, the mystery resolved by the unwavering accuracy of the superforecasters.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SUPERFORECASTER 1 and SUPERFORECASTER 2 sit across from each other, laptops open, coffee steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leans back, thoughtful)  
So, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 5.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods, scrolling through news)  
Right. With Biden dropping out, the landscape shifted. Trump’s insistence on FoxNews over ABC made it unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And the Democrats scrambling for a new nominee... The logistics were a nightmare.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Plus, the deadline was tight. Our models anticipated the chaos.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(raises an eyebrow)  
Think they'll reschedule?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiles)  
Only if they can agree on a platform. But for now, our models say it's a long shot.

They sip their coffee, the weight of their predictions settling in the air.

FADE OUT.

So, it didn't happen. No debate last night.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Our models had it at 5.23%. With Biden stepping down in July and Trump's insistence on FoxNews, the odds were slim.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(reading from a report)  
ABC was ready, but without a confirmed Democratic nominee, it was a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how the dynamics shifted. Biden's dropout was a game changer.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True. Trump was always unpredictable, and the Democrats were in disarray.
