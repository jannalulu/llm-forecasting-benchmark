To answer this question, I'll need to analyze the available information and consider several key factors:

1. Historical data: On average, how many major hurricanes occur in September?
2. Current season activity: How active has the 2024 season been so far?
3. Environmental conditions: Are conditions favorable for hurricane development in September 2024?
4. Expert forecasts: What are the predictions from reliable sources?

Let's break this down:

1. Historical data:
September is typically the most active month for major hurricanes. According to NOAA, the Atlantic basin averages about 2 major hurricanes per year, with most occurring in August-October. This suggests a significant chance of at least one major hurricane in September.

2. Current season activity:
The 2024 season has been active, with Hurricane Beryl reaching Category 5 in July. However, August was unusually quiet. This mixed pattern makes it difficult to extrapolate to September.

3. Environmental conditions:
Several sources mention favorable conditions for hurricane development in September 2024:
- Warm ocean temperatures
- La Niña conditions expected to form (which typically enhances hurricane activity)
- Reduction in Saharan dust and dry air

4. Expert forecasts:
- NOAA's updated forecast predicts 4-7 major hurricanes for the entire season.
- Colorado State University predicts 6 major hurricanes for the season.
- AccuWeather predicts 6-10 tropical systems for September alone.

These forecasts suggest a high likelihood of major hurricane activity in September.

However, we need to consider that:
- The question asks about exactly one major hurricane, not at least one.
- Environmental conditions can change rapidly.
- Even with favorable conditions, hurricane formation and intensification involve some randomness.

Balancing these factors:
- The historical average and favorable conditions suggest a high probability of at least one major hurricane.
- The expert forecasts and current season activity indicate the possibility of multiple major hurricanes.
- There's always a chance of no major hurricanes despite favorable conditions.

Given these considerations, I estimate:
- A relatively low probability of zero major hurricanes (about 15-20%)
- A moderate probability of exactly one major hurricane (about 35-45%)
- A significant probability of two or more major hurricanes (about 40-50%)

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 45.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into sub-problems and consider the relevant evidence:

1. Base rate: Historically, how often does exactly one major hurricane occur in September?
2. Current season progress: How many major hurricanes have occurred so far in 2024?
3. Forecasts: What do the latest predictions say about hurricane activity for September 2024?
4. Current conditions: Are atmospheric and oceanic conditions favorable for hurricane development?

1. Base rate:
September is typically the most active month for hurricanes. According to historical data, on average, there are about 2-3 major hurricanes per season, with September being the peak month. However, the question asks about exactly one major hurricane in September, which is more specific and likely less common.

2. Current season progress:
The articles mention that as of early September, there has been one major hurricane (Beryl) in the 2024 season. This suggests that we're not significantly above or below average for major hurricanes at this point.

3. Forecasts:
Multiple sources (NOAA, Colorado State University, AccuWeather) predict an above-average season with 4-7 major hurricanes expected. However, recent articles note a lull in activity and some forecasters reducing their predictions slightly. The most recent forecasts still suggest increased activity in September.

4. Current conditions:
As of September 12, 2024, conditions are becoming more favorable for hurricane development. The articles mention that factors like Saharan dust and wind shear that were inhibiting storm formation are decreasing. Water temperatures remain above average, which is conducive to hurricane formation.

Balancing the evidence:
- The base rate suggests that exactly one major hurricane in September is not the most common outcome, but it's certainly possible.
- The season has been less active than initially predicted, but forecasters still expect increased activity in September.
- Conditions are becoming more favorable for hurricane development.
- There's still a significant portion of September left for hurricanes to form.

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of exactly one major hurricane occurring in September 2024. However, there's also a significant chance of either no major hurricanes (if the lull continues) or more than one (if conditions become very favorable and match the earlier predictions of an extremely active season).

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to carefully analyze the available information and consider several key factors:

1. Historical base rates: September is typically the most active month for Atlantic hurricanes. In an average season, we might expect 1-2 major hurricanes in September.

2. 2024 season forecasts: Multiple sources predicted an above-average season, with NOAA forecasting 4-7 major hurricanes total and CSU predicting 6 major hurricanes.

3. Current season activity: As of September 12, the season has been less active than predicted, with only one major hurricane (Beryl) so far.

4. Recent conditions: There's been an unexpected lull in activity in August and early September due to dry air, Saharan dust, and other unfavorable conditions.

5. Near-term forecasts: Several sources indicate conditions are becoming more favorable for development in mid-September, with AccuWeather predicting 6-10 tropical systems in September.

6. Time remaining: With about 18 days left in September, there's still time for major hurricanes to form, but the window is narrowing.

Weighing these factors:

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The season has been less active than predicted so far.
- There's limited time left in September for storms to develop and intensify.

Arguments for a higher probability:
- September is climatologically the peak of hurricane season.
- Conditions are becoming more favorable for development.
- Multiple forecasts still predict above-average activity for the remainder of the season.

Balancing these considerations, I believe there's a good chance of at least one major hurricane forming in September, but also a significant possibility of either zero or more than one. The question asks specifically about exactly one major hurricane, which narrows the probability range.

To approach this question, let's break it down and analyze the available information:

1. Historical context:
The Atlantic hurricane season typically peaks around September 10th. By this time in the season (September 12th), we would usually have seen significant hurricane activity.

2. Current season activity:
The 2024 season has been unusually quiet so far. As of early September, there have been only 5 named storms, with 3 reaching hurricane status and only 1 major hurricane (Beryl in July).

3. Forecasts for September:
Multiple sources predict increased activity in September:
- AccuWeather predicts 6-10 tropical systems for September.
- Colorado State University forecasts above-normal activity by mid-September.
- NOAA's updated outlook still calls for an above-average season overall.

4. Factors influencing storm formation:
- Warm ocean temperatures favorable for storm development.
- La Niña conditions expected to emerge, which typically enhance Atlantic hurricane activity.
- Saharan dust and dry air have been inhibiting storm formation, but these conditions are expected to improve.

5. Time remaining:
As of September 12th, we have about 18 days left in the month for a major hurricane to form.

6. Recent trends:
The season has been unexpectedly quiet, defying earlier predictions. This could indicate that the factors suppressing storm formation are stronger than anticipated.

Balancing the evidence:
On one hand, we have strong predictions for increased activity in September from reputable sources. The climatological conditions (warm waters, La Niña) are favorable for storm development. 

On the other hand, the season has been remarkably quiet so far, and we're already past the peak date. The factors suppressing storm formation have been more persistent than expected.

Given that we're looking for exactly one major hurricane, we need to consider both the probability of at least one forming and the probability of more than one forming.

Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of exactly one major hurricane forming in the remaining days of September, but there's also a significant chance of either no major hurricanes or more than one.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

5. Recent lull: There's been a notable lull in activity since mid-August, which some experts attribute to dry air and Saharan dust. However, many predict this will change in September.

6. Time remaining: As of September 12, there are still 18 days left in the month for major hurricane formation.

Weighing these factors:

Arguments for a higher probability:
- September is climatologically the most active month for major hurricanes.
- Environmental conditions (warm waters, developing La Niña) are favorable for storm development.
- Multiple expert forecasts predict increased activity for September.
- There's still plenty of time left in the month for storms to develop.

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The season has been slightly below average so far.
- There's been a recent lull in activity.
- Exactly one major hurricane is a narrow target - it could easily be zero or more than one.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a good chance of at least one major hurricane forming, but also a significant chance of either zero or multiple major hurricanes. The "exactly one" criteria makes this a challenging forecast.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to carefully analyze the available information and consider several key factors:

1. Historical base rates: Typically, September is the peak month for Atlantic hurricane activity. Looking at data from recent decades, it's common to have 1-3 major hurricanes form in September.

2. Current season activity: As of September 12, 2024, there have been 5 named storms this season, with 3 reaching hurricane strength and 1 major hurricane (Beryl in July). This is slightly below average for this point in the season.

3. Forecasts for September: Multiple sources predict increased activity in September 2024. AccuWeather forecasts 6-10 tropical systems for the month, while Colorado State University predicts above-normal activity.

4. Environmental conditions: Sea surface temperatures remain above average, which is conducive to hurricane formation. La Niña conditions are expected to develop, which typically enhances Atlantic hurricane activity.

5. Recent lull: There's been a notable lull in activity since mid-August, which some experts attribute to dry air and Saharan dust. However, many predict this will change in September.
