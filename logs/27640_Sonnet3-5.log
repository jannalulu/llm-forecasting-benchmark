To approach this question, I'll analyze the evidence, consider key factors, and apply superforecasting principles:

1. Base rate: YouTube has not been banned in Russia so far, despite years of tension. This suggests a low base rate for a ban.

2. Recent developments:
   - Multiple reports indicate increased restrictions on YouTube in Russia, including slowdowns and potential plans for a ban.
   - Russian authorities have demanded Google unblock over 200 YouTube channels.
   - YouTube has blocked 83 Russian channels in 2024 alone.

3. Official statements:
   - The Kremlin has denied plans to ban YouTube, attributing slowdowns to technical issues.
   - Some Russian officials have called for restrictions or bans on YouTube.

4. Timing:
   - Several sources mention September 2024 as a potential timeframe for a YouTube ban.
   - The question asks about a ban before October 1, 2024, which aligns with this timeframe.

5. Alternatives:
   - Russia has been promoting domestic alternatives to YouTube, but they are not yet widely adopted.

6. Geopolitical context:
   - Ongoing tensions between Russia and the West increase the likelihood of further restrictions on Western platforms.

7. Economic factors:
   - A complete ban might face resistance due to its economic impact on content creators and businesses.

8. Technical considerations:
   - Russia has demonstrated the capability to restrict access to other platforms, suggesting they could technically implement a YouTube ban.

Balancing these factors:
- The increasing restrictions and official rhetoric suggest a higher probability of a ban than in previous years.
- However, the economic impact and lack of a fully developed alternative might delay a complete ban.
- The specific timeframe (before October 1, 2024) aligns with reported plans, increasing the probability.
- Official denials from the Kremlin provide some counterbalance, but given past actions, these denials don't completely rule out a ban.

Considering these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of a YouTube ban before October 1, 2024, but it's not certain. The probability is likely higher than 50% but lower than 90%.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 85.00%, with 72.50% being the most likely. Probability: 72.50%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Timeline: The question asks about a ban before October 1, 2024. The current date is October 18, 2024, which is past the resolution date. This means we have complete information about what actually happened.

2. Definition of "ban": The question specifies that YouTube would be considered banned if it appears in Roskomnadzor's blocklist.

3. Current status: There is no explicit mention in the provided articles that YouTube has been banned in Russia before October 1, 2024. The most recent relevant information is from August 2024, which discusses slowdowns and potential future bans, but not an actual implemented ban.

4. Historical context: Russia has been threatening to ban or restrict YouTube for years, but has not fully blocked it despite banning other social media platforms.

5. Technical measures: Russia implemented slowdowns of YouTube in July-August 2024, but this falls short of a full ban as defined by the question.

6. Official statements: The Kremlin repeatedly denied plans to fully block YouTube, even as late as July 2024.

7. Alternative platforms: Russia has been promoting domestic alternatives to YouTube, but there's no indication that they've reached a point where the government felt comfortable fully banning YouTube.

Given that the resolution date has passed and there's no clear evidence of a full ban being implemented before October 1, 2024, the probability of this event occurring is effectively 0%. However, as a superforecaster, I should always leave a small margin for error or for information that might not be captured in the provided articles.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the evidence:

1. Current status of YouTube in Russia:
- YouTube is not currently banned in Russia, despite previous threats and restrictions.
- There have been slowdowns and partial restrictions, but no full ban as of now.

2. Russian government's stance:
- Officials have made conflicting statements, with some threatening bans and others denying immediate plans.
- The Kremlin denied plans to ban YouTube as recently as July 2024.

3. Technical measures:
- Russia has implemented slowdowns on YouTube, reportedly reducing speeds by 40-70%.
- There are reports of regional outages and disruptions.

4. Legal and regulatory actions:
- Roskomnadzor has demanded Google unblock Russian channels on YouTube.
- Fines have been imposed on Google/YouTube for various violations of Russian law.

5. Alternatives and preparations:
- Russia has been promoting domestic alternatives like RuTube.
- There are reports of plans to transfer Russian content to VK by autumn 2024.

6. Timeline considerations:
- Several sources mention September 2024 as a potential target for full blocking.
- The question asks about blocking before October 1, 2024, which aligns with these reports.

7. Past predictions and false alarms:
- There have been numerous previous predictions of YouTube bans that did not materialize.

8. International context:
- Tensions between Russia and the West remain high, which could influence decisions on foreign platforms.

Weighing these factors:

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Increasing technical restrictions and slowdowns suggest a gradual approach to full blocking.
- Multiple sources mention September 2024 as a target for full blocking.
- The Russian government has shown willingness to ban other foreign social media platforms.

Arguments for a lower probability:
- Official denials of immediate plans to block YouTube.
- YouTube's continued popularity and lack of fully equivalent domestic alternatives.
- Past predictions of bans have not come true.
- Economic considerations, as many Russian content creators rely on YouTube.

Balancing these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of YouTube being banned before October 1, 2024, but it's not a certainty. The gradual restrictions and specific timeline mentioned in multiple sources are particularly compelling, but the official denials and past false alarms temper this somewhat.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To forecast whether YouTube will be banned in Russia before October 1, 2024, I'll analyze the evidence and consider key factors:

1. Historical context: Russia has threatened to ban YouTube multiple times but hasn't followed through. This suggests some reluctance to take such a drastic step.

2. Recent actions: There's been a significant increase in restrictions on YouTube in 2024:
   - YouTube blocked 83 Russian channels in 2024 alone, more than previous years.
   - Russian authorities have slowed down YouTube traffic.
   - There are reports of plans to fully block YouTube by September 2024.

3. Government statements: 
   - Official statements deny plans to block YouTube entirely.
   - However, authorities have criticized YouTube heavily and demanded unblocking of Russian channels.

4. Technical preparations:
   - Russia has been developing domestic alternatives like RuTube.
   - There are reports of technical measures to restrict YouTube access.

5. Political climate:
   - Increasing control over media and information in Russia.
   - Pressure on foreign tech companies to comply with Russian laws.

6. Economic factors:

- Government promotion of domestic alternatives
- Reports of potential full blocking by September 2024
- Trend of increasing state control over media

Against a ban:
- Official denials of plans to block YouTube
- YouTube's continued popularity in Russia
- Potential backlash from Russian users
- Technical challenges in implementing a full ban

Considering these factors, I believe there's a significant chance of YouTube being banned before October 1, 2024, but it's not certain. The short timeframe between the reported September plan and the October 1 deadline increases uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current status of YouTube in Russia:
- As of the most recent reports (August 2024), YouTube has not been fully banned in Russia.
- There have been slowdowns and restrictions implemented, but no complete ban.

2. Russian government's stance:
- Officials have made contradictory statements, with some denying plans to block YouTube while others hint at potential restrictions.
- The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied plans to restrict access to YouTube as of July 2024.

3. Technical measures taken:
- Russian authorities have slowed down YouTube traffic, reportedly by up to 70% in some cases.
- There are claims of plans to fully block YouTube by September 2024, though these are unconfirmed.

4. Alternatives and preparations:
- Russia has been promoting domestic alternatives like RuTube.
- There's a trend of increasing state control over media and information access.

5. International context:
- Tensions between Russia and Western tech companies remain high.
- YouTube has blocked some Russian state-affiliated channels.

6. Timeline:
- The question asks about a ban before October 1, 2024, which is very soon after the reported potential September 2024 blocking.

7. Historical context:
- Russia has previously threatened to ban other social media platforms but has not always followed through.
