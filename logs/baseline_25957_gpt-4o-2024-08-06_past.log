To predict whether Tadej Pogačar will win the Tour de France 2024, we need to consider various factors:

1. **Current Performance in the Tour de France 2024:** By July 10, 2024, we are in the middle of the Tour de France (usually it starts in late June and ends in mid to late July). Checking Pogačar's current position, time gaps, and performances in the stages so far is crucial. If he is leading or in a top competitive position, his chances are significantly higher.

2. **Past Performance:** Tadej Pogačar won the Tour de France in 2020 and 2021. His history in grand tours shows exceptional talent, suggesting he has the ability to win again.

3. **Competition:** Consider other strong competitors, such as Jonas Vingegaard, who won the 2022 and 2023 editions of the Tour de France. Their current standings and performances play a vital role.

4. **Team Support:** UAE Team Emirates' strength and strategy to support Pogačar are important. Good support from teammates in mountain stages and time trials increases his winning probability.

5. **Health and Conditions:** Pogačar’s physical condition and any recent injuries also affect his chances.

6. **Upcoming Stages:** Analyze the nature of the upcoming stages (mountain vs flat, time trials) and how they play to Pogačar's strengths. 

Given these factors, especially the current standings and historical performance, you can estimate the probability more accurately. However, without knowing the exact current standings by the date, I will base the forecast on rational assumptions and known data up to July 10, 2024.

My Prediction: Tadej Pogačar is highly likely to be among the favorites to win, given his past performances and assuming he is in good form and position at this point in the tour.

My Prediction: 60.00% is the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.
