**U.S Presidential Election 2024: Joe Biden vs Donald Trump - Will there be another debate? If yes, when?**
The second US Presidential Debate is scheduled to take place on September 10, hosted by ABC News. The debate will be moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, and the rules for participation have been confirmed. The location of the debate is yet to be announced. Additionally, there are reports of a Vice-Presidential debate between Kamala Harris and the Republican nominee. The rules for the debate require candidates to secure at least 15% of the total votes in four national polls, appear on enough state ballots to reach the required threshold of 270 votes, and agree to the debate rules and format. The first presidential debate was criticized for Joe Biden's performance, with many saying he appeared lost and incoherent, while Donald Trump dominated the debate.

**Biden and Trump Agree on Debate Rules for 2024 US Presidential Election**
CNN announced the rules for the first presidential debate between Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his Republican opponent Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election, which will take place on June 27th and last 1 hour and 30 minutes without an audience. The debate will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, earlier than usual. Biden has previously stated that he prefers a debate without an audience. The debate will feature two identical podiums and microphones that can be muted. The microphones will be silenced during the debate, except when a candidate is speaking, and the moderators, Jack Tapper and Dana Bash, will use all available tools to ensure a timely and civil discussion. The debate will be interrupted twice for commercial breaks, and the candidates will not be able to communicate with their teams during these breaks. Written notes will be prohibited in the filming location, but the candidates will be given a pen, paper, and a water bottle. Biden and Trump have agreed to hold two debates before the November presidential election, with the second debate taking place on September 10th on ABC.

**Presidential Debates in the United States**
In the United States, President Biden has challenged his political opponent, Trump, to two debates, scheduled for June 27 and September 10. The debates will be held without an audience, at Biden's request. A third candidate, a Libertarian, son of the late Robert Kennedy, is seeking to be included in the debate, but this is unlikely. The recent history of presidential debates in the United States recalls those between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, won by Kennedy, and those between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, won by Reagan. This time, two elderly individuals will be present, trying to present themselves as the best option for their countrymen during 2025-2028. Millions of people in the United States and around the world will be following the outcome, which will influence the voters' decision, ultimately deciding the winner through the Electoral College.

**When the next presidential debate of 2024 takes place**
President Biden and former President Donald Trump have agreed to a second presidential debate on September 10, hosted by ABC News. The debate will take place after both candidates have formally accepted their party's nomination. The qualifications for the debate are similar to the first debate, making it unlikely for non-major party candidates to participate. The debate will be the second and final debate between the two candidates, as they have agreed to bypass the traditional three debates organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has been criticized by both Trump and Biden's team for being biased and outmoded.

The debate will be moderated by CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. The debate will focus on the issues of the 2024 US presidential election, including the economy, healthcare, and foreign policy.

Biden has accused Trump of being a threat to democracy and has called for him to be held accountable for his actions. The debate will be broadcast live on CNN and will be a major event in the 2024 presidential election.
