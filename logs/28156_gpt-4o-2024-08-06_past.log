To provide an accurate forecast, I'll consider factors relevant to the closing of the USDA recall of Boar's Head deli meat, utilizing available data and trends.

First, I'll assess typical timelines for recalls of similar products. The closure of a recall generally depends on factors such as the severity of the issue, the company's response and cooperation, regulatory inspections, and public safety considerations. Recalls of this nature often take several weeks to months to resolve, though some can linger if there are complications or additional concerns arise.

Second, I'll consider how recent recalls have been managed by the USDA's FSIS, taking into account any observable trends that might influence the timeframe for closing this specific recall. Recent data might show typical durations or historical precedence in similar cases.

Third, the progress of this recall itself, as of the current date, September 13, 2024, should be assessed. With limited time remaining until the resolution date, if there have been recent updates indicating progress towards resolution or lack thereof, these developments will be very significant for the prediction.

Based on potential efficiency in closing such cases historically and the time elapsed since this recall was initiated, it is reasonable to adjust probabilities. 

Considering these aspects, I will present a range along with a most likely single probability:

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 90.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.
