To answer this question, I'll analyze the key evidence and arguments for both higher and lower probabilities:

Arguments for higher probability:

1. An arrest warrant has been issued for González on September 2, 2024, accusing him of serious crimes including usurpation of functions, forgery, and conspiracy.

2. González has already refused to appear before the Supreme Court for hearings, which could be seen as contempt and increase the likelihood of arrest.

3. The Chavista government has a history of detaining opposition leaders, especially around elections.

4. Over 1,000 people have been arrested in recent protests, showing the government's willingness to detain opponents.

5. González's campaign chief in Monagas was already detained in July, suggesting a pattern of targeting his associates.

Arguments for lower probability:

1. González appears to be in hiding, making it harder for authorities to locate and detain him.

2. There's significant international pressure and scrutiny on Venezuela, which might deter the government from arresting the main opposition candidate.

3. The military's stance is uncertain, with some indications they might respect the election results.

4. Arresting González could further delegitimize the government and potentially spark more unrest.

5. There's limited time before October 1, 2024, reducing the window for arrest.

Balancing these factors:

The issuance of an arrest warrant is a significant escalation, dramatically increasing the chances of González's detention. The government's recent mass arrests and targeting of opposition figures suggest they're willing to take aggressive action.

However, González's status as the main opposition candidate and international attention provide some protection. His ability to evade capture so far also works in his favor.

Given the short timeframe and these competing factors, I estimate a moderate to high probability of González being detained, but with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 75.00%, with 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors and weigh the evidence:

1. Recent arrest warrant: An arrest warrant was issued for Edmundo González on September 2, 2024, accusing him of various crimes. This is a significant escalation and increases the likelihood of his detention.

2. Previous summons and warnings: González has been summoned multiple times by authorities and warned of potential arrest. The fact that he has not complied with these summons may increase the regime's determination to detain him.

3. Timing: With less than a month until the resolution date, there's limited time for authorities to act, but also increased urgency if they intend to detain him before the October 1 deadline.

4. Opposition status: As a prominent opposition figure, González is a high-profile target. The regime may see detaining him as a way to suppress opposition.

5. International pressure: There's significant international attention on Venezuela's political situation, which could deter the regime from detaining González. However, the regime has shown willingness to act despite international criticism in the past.

6. Hiding: Reports indicate González has gone into hiding, which makes it more challenging for authorities to detain him.

7. Historical precedent: The Venezuelan regime has a history of detaining opposition leaders, suggesting a willingness to take such actions.

8. Regime's control: The Maduro government maintains strong control over security forces and the judiciary, giving them the means to carry out an arrest if desired.

9. Potential consequences: Detaining González could further inflame domestic unrest and international condemnation, which might give the regime pause.

10. Time pressure: As the October 1 deadline approaches, the regime may feel increased pressure to act, potentially leading to hasty decisions.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance González will be detained, but also substantial reasons why he might avoid detention. The regime has shown both the willingness and ability to detain opposition figures, and the recent arrest warrant is a clear escalation. However, González's status in hiding and potential international backlash provide some counterbalance.

Given the complexities and uncertainties involved, I'll provide a relatively wide range for my prediction.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Current political situation: The articles indicate significant tension between González and the Maduro government, with an arrest warrant issued against González on September 2, 2024.

2. Legal proceedings: González has been summoned multiple times but has refused to appear, citing concerns for his safety and the legitimacy of the proceedings.

3. Government actions: There have been arrests of González's campaign staff and supporters, suggesting a willingness to take action against the opposition.

4. International pressure: Several Latin American countries have condemned the arrest warrant, which could deter the government from acting.

5. Time frame: We have about 4 weeks until the October 1 deadline.

6. González's status: He appears to be in hiding, making it more difficult for authorities to detain him.

Arguments for a higher probability:
- The arrest warrant has been issued, providing legal grounds for detention.
- The government has shown a willingness to arrest opposition figures.
- González's refusal to appear in court may be used as justification for arrest.

Arguments for a lower probability:
- International pressure may deter the government from taking action.
- González is in hiding, making it harder to locate and detain him.
- The government may be wary of sparking further unrest by arresting a presidential candidate.

Balancing these factors, I believe there is a significant chance González will be detained, but it's not certain given the potential consequences and difficulties in locating him.

To forecast this question, I'll consider the key evidence and factors:

1. Base rate: There's a history of political persecution in Venezuela, with opposition figures often facing arrest or detention. This suggests a non-trivial baseline probability.

2. Recent events:
- An arrest warrant was issued for González on September 2, 2024, accusing him of various crimes.
- González has been summoned multiple times by authorities but has refused to appear, citing concerns for his safety and the legitimacy of the process.
- The government has taken increasingly aggressive actions against opposition figures, including detaining campaign staff.

3. Time factor: The question asks about deprivation of liberty before October 1, 2024, which is less than a month away. This relatively short timeframe somewhat reduces the probability.

4. International pressure: Several Latin American countries have condemned the arrest warrant, which could potentially deter the Venezuelan government from acting.

5. González's status: He appears to be in hiding, which makes it more difficult for authorities to detain him.

6. Government motivation: The Maduro regime likely sees González as a serious threat, given his apparent electoral success, providing strong motivation to detain him.

7. Precedent: Other opposition leaders like Biagio Pilieri have already been arrested following the election protests.

Balancing these factors:

The issuance of an arrest warrant and the aggressive actions against opposition figures strongly suggest the government intends to detain González. However, his ability to evade capture so far and international pressure provide some counterbalance.

The short timeframe (less than a month) slightly reduces the probability, but given the government's apparent determination, it's still a significant possibility.

Considering all these factors, I estimate a relatively high probability of González being deprived of liberty before October 1, 2024, but with significant uncertainty given the complex political situation.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

2. Political context: The Maduro government appears to be targeting opposition figures, with over 1,700 arrests reported following protests after the July 28 election.

The arrest warrant and ongoing crackdown on opposition figures strongly suggest an intent to detain González. However, his current status in hiding makes immediate arrest less likely. The short time frame (less than a month) also somewhat reduces the probability.

The international condemnation might give the Venezuelan government pause, but historically this hasn't always deterred them from acting against opposition figures.
