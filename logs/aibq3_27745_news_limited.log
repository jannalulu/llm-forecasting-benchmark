**Taylor Swift To Endorse Kamala Harris Soon, Seeking A 'Strong Woman President': Report**
Taylor Swift is reportedly set to endorse Kamala Harris for president within the next four to six weeks, according to a source close to the singer. Swift, a 34-year-old pop star, has not publicly supported any 2024 presidential candidate yet. The endorsement comes after Harris was named vice president in 2020, a position that Swift was 'happy' about, as she was 'excited' to see a woman in a high political position. The source stated, 'Taylor got enthusiastic when Kamala Harris got named VP in 2020... She was happy to endorse the Biden-Harris duo four years ago. Now that Harris is running for president, Taylor is even more excited about the possibility of having Kamala Harris being the next president of the United States of America.' Donald Trump, who recently posted a false AI image of Swift implying her support for him, said he 'doesn't understand' why Swift will vouch for Democrats. The US Sun reported that President Joe Biden's team was pushing for Swift's support when his campaign started faltering earlier this year.

**Why Taylor Swift Is Right to Delay Kamala Harris Endorsement**
Taylor Swift has yet to endorse Kamala Harris for president, despite her history of supporting progressive causes and candidates. However, experts believe that she will eventually endorse Harris, citing her past support for the Democrat in the 2020 election cycle. Jeffrey R. Dudas, a professor of political science, suggests that Swift may time her announcement to coincide with the Democratic National Convention in August, while Jay Oliver predicts that she will endorse Harris in October. Chip Franklin, a Democratic political commentator, believes that Harris' willingness to engage with young voters on social media will help her secure Swift's endorsement. Meanwhile, Evan Nierman, CEO of Red Banyan, notes that Swift's influence is not to be underestimated, and that her endorsement would carry significant weight in the election. According to a poll conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, 22% of voters who backed Biden in the 2020 election said they would be more likely to vote for a GOP candidate if Swift endorsed them. However, Swift's influence may also be growing among Trump supporters, with 16% of Trump 2020 voters saying they'd be more likely to vote for a Democratic candidate endorsed by Swift.

Taylor Swift has yet to endorse Kamala Harris for president, despite her history of supporting progressive causes and candidates. However, experts believe that she will eventually endorse Harris, citing her past support for the vice president and her tendency to align with her fan base's views. Jeffrey R. Dudas, a professor of political science, suggests that Swift may time her announcement around the schedule of her Eras Tour, which ends in December. Jay Oliver, a LI News Radio host, predicts that Swift will announce her endorsement in October, when her tour returns stateside in Miami. Chip Franklin, a Democratic political commentator, agrees that it's just a matter of when Swift will announce her backing of Harris. Evan Nierman, CEO of global PR firm Red Banyan, believes that Swift will ultimately decide to endorse Kamala Harris, citing her strategic and smart approach to wielding her influence. An endorsement from Swift would carry enormous weight, given her following and ability to influence young women's worldview. According to a poll conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, 22% of voters who backed Biden in the 2020 election said they would be more likely to vote for a GOP candidate if Swift endorsed them.

**Will Taylor Swift Support Kamala Harris in the 2024 Election?**
Taylor Swift has been quiet on political issues throughout her career, but in 2020, she publicly endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
