*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a sleek news desk, discussing yesterday's potential event.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the big question: Did Tether collapse before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 25.67%. Despite some market jitters and regulatory scrutiny, Tether managed to maintain its peg above the critical threshold.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the stability of Tether was in question, especially with the fines from regulators and lack of audits. But the market seemed to hold its breath.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The exchanges continued trading, and the price never dipped below 0.50 USD for the required duration. The resilience surprised many, but our models were spot on.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the robustness of our forecasting. Until the next potential collapse, we wait and watch.

*They both nod, satisfied with the accuracy of their predictions.*

Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Tether collapse before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(smiling)  
No, our models had it at 15.23%. Despite the regulatory challenges and market volatility, Tether remained stable.

**NATE SILVER**  
(nodding)  
Exactly. The data up to July 29 showed resilience. None of the conditions—price drops or trading suspensions—met the criteria.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And let's not forget, Tether's market strategies and asset reserves, though controversial, held firm. The market's faith in stablecoins hasn't wavered.
