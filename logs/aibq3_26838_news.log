**How long before Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos go broke if they spent $1 million a day?**
According to a 2024 Oxfam report, the top four richest men in the world, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, have grown their wealth by $14 million per hour since 2020. If they spent $1 million per day, it would take Bezos 558.9 years and Musk 660.27 years to go broke. Their combined net worth is $445 billion, with Bezos having $204 billion and Musk having $241 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. However, their net worth may not represent their true wealth, as it is subjective to their holdings and investments. For instance, Musk's net worth fell by $16 million in a matter of hours after Tesla's stock tanked. In comparison, the average American household has a net worth of $1.06 million, but the median net worth is $192,900, a significant difference from the billionaires' wealth. There are online games available that allow players to spend virtual money like Musk and Bezos, giving people a taste of their riches.

**Top Three Billionaires Compete for Top Spot on Bloomberg Billionaires Index**
The top three billionaires in the world are competing for the top spot, with Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault holding the top three positions on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for over 94% of the time this year. However, fluctuations in their wealth have led to them swapping places six times since May 29, with a frantic pace in the hierarchical sequence that has remained largely stable since Musk lost his top spot in early March. Musk, 52, regained the top spot on Monday for the second time since early March, replacing Bezos. This comes after Tesla's shares rose last week following a vote by shareholders to approve a compensation package for Musk, which was previously blocked by a Delaware court and transferred the company's headquarters to Texas. The package, which includes stock options worth up to $55.8 billion, now represents nearly a quarter of Musk's net worth. His net worth has also been boosted by a new funding round that values his artificial intelligence project, xAI, at over $24 billion. Bloomberg's wealth index estimates that Musk owns 65% of the company, which uses social media data to train its chatbot program, Grok. Meanwhile, Arnault, 75, has recently fallen to third place with a net worth of $199 billion, after spending most of the past three months in first place, and has seen his net worth decline by $13 billion since the surprise presidential election call by French President Emmanuel Macron sent the country's markets into their worst week in years. Most of his wealth comes from LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods manufacturer. Bezos, the 60-year-old founder of Amazon, currently holds the second spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $206.6 billion. Since May 29, he has regained the top spot three times, with Amazon's shares trading near all-time highs. The share has benefited from a broader rally in major technology companies responsible for nearly three-quarters of the S&P 500's gains this year.

**Three-way race for world's richest emerges**
The world's three richest billionaires, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, have been in a fierce race for first place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with the top spot changing hands six times since May 29. The fluctuations in their wealth have been influenced by a fight over Musk's pay package, a snap election in France, and a tech-stock rally. Musk, with a net worth of $210.1 billion, moved back into first place on Monday, replacing Bezos, after Tesla shares rallied following the re-approval of his 2018 compensation package and the company's move to Texas.

**Jensen Huang's Wealth Soars In 2024: How Much More He Needs To Surpass Warren Buffett, Enter World's Top 10 Richest**
NVIDIA Corporation's stock has surged, reaching a market capitalization of over $3 trillion, making it the second most valuable company in the world. This has led to a significant increase in the wealth of CEO Jensen Huang, who has added $63.4 billion to his net worth in 2024, the highest gain of anyone on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Huang is currently the 13th richest person in the world, with a net worth of $107 billion. If Nvidia's stock continues to rise, Huang could soon surpass Warren Buffett, who is currently the 10th richest person in the world, with a net worth of $135 billion.

**Tech Billionaires Lose $134 Billion as Amazon's Bezos Sees Fortune Shrink by $15.2 Billion**
The world's richest people lost $134 billion as technology stocks, led by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, plummeted. Bezos' fortune shrunk by $15.2 billion on Friday, the third-worst day in his history, as the Amazon.com stock fell 8.8% amidst a general sell-off in the market. This reduced Bezos' net worth to $191.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Other tech billionaires, including Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, also saw their fortunes decline, with Musk losing $6.6 billion and Ellison losing $4.4 billion. The uncertainty surrounding possible interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, as well as some high-profile earnings disappointments, contributed to the technology index's decline, wiping out over $2 trillion in value in just over three weeks. Investors are also nervous about the possibility of AI-driven gains being exaggerated or the market being too concentrated. 'We plan to continue investing heavily in AI, even at the expense of short-term profits,' Amazon said in a conference call, leading to the largest decline in Amazon's stock since April 2022. Other tech billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, and Larry Page, also lost billions, with Zuckerberg, Brin, and Page each losing over $3 billion as Meta and Alphabet stocks fell in New York trading.

**Warren Buffett Once Said That The 'Best Thing' He Did Was Choose 'The Right Heroes'  --  Who Was Berkshire Hathaway Chair's Biggest Role Model?**
Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, attributes his success to choosing the right heroes, particularly his mentor Benjamin Graham and his father Howard Buffett. Graham, known as the father of value investing, taught Buffett about living a principled and disciplined life, not just about making money. Buffett has said, 'The best thing I did was to choose the right heroes,' and credits Graham as the source of this wisdom. He also keeps a portrait of his father in his office, saying, 'I still wonder how he would feel about anything I do.' At the 2024 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Buffett emphasized the importance of having the right heroes, stating, 'You want to have the right heroes, and you don't have to have them based on what they've accomplished. It's the people that you want to be yourself.' Buffett's net worth is $139 billion, making him the tenth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.

**Bernard Arnault's Fortune Plummeted by $20 Billion This Year**
LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's net worth has plummeted by $20 billion this year, the largest loss of any billionaire in 2024, according to Bloomberg. This decline has brought his net worth down to $187 million, ranking him third on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index behind Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. The decline is attributed to a slowdown in demand for luxury goods, especially in China, where LVMH recorded a 14% slump in sales in Asia. Arnault's statement acknowledged the company's resilience in a challenging climate, but rival Kering, which owns Gucci and other luxury brands, has also been struggling, estimating a 30% drop in operating profit in the second half of the year.

Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and founder of LVMH, has seen his net worth decline by 20 billion dollars this year, making him the person who has lost the most in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The decline is attributed to the poor performance of LVMH's sales in the region that includes China, which fell 14% in the last quarter. This decline is part of a broader trend in the luxury goods industry, with Burberry Group Plc and Richemont also reporting disappointing sales. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, saw his wealth decline by 21.7 billion dollars in a single day after Tesla's disappointing quarterly results, but still holds the top spot with a net worth of 240.5 billion dollars.

Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and CEO of LVMH, saw his net worth decline by more than any other person in 2024, according to the Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, as luxury goods demand continues to decrease.

Bernard Arnault, the founder of luxury goods group LVMH, has experienced the largest decline in wealth among the world's billionaires this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth has decreased by $20 billion since the beginning of the year to $187 billion, despite still ranking third among the world's richest people after Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. This decline surpasses that of China's richest man, Chongqing Liang, who lost $18 billion after his company's stock price fell due to the company's decision to sell bottled water at very low prices to gain market share from competitors. LVMH's stock price fell after the company's quarterly results showed a slowdown in sales growth in the second quarter, with high-end shoppers cutting back on spending on luxury goods such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.

**Mukesh Ambani's Net Worth Drops To $112 Billion Post-Budget 2024**
The Union Budget for 2024-25 presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman caused significant volatility in the stock market, leading to a decline in the shares of Reliance Industries. This resulted in a reduction of $1.1 billion in Chairman Mukesh Ambani's net worth, bringing it to $112 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The decline in Reliance's shares was due to the company's first-quarter financial results, which failed to meet market expectations. Despite a 12% year-on-year increase in revenue, the company reported a 5% year-on-year decline in profit, leading to a decline in its stock price.

**Wealth of Luxury Goods Billionaires Declines Globally**
The wealth of billionaires in the luxury goods sector has declined globally this year due to a slowdown in demand for those products and beauty products in some regions. According to the 'Bloomberg' billionaires index, the wealth of six billionaires who rely on high-end products decreased by 5% this year, or around $24 billion. On the other hand, the wealth of the remaining 500 individuals included in the index increased by 13% or $1 trillion. French billionaire Bernard Arnault, 75, founder of LVMH, saw his wealth decrease by $10.8 billion since the beginning of the year to reach $197 billion, ranking third among the world's richest after Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Earlier this month, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, heiress to the cosmetics giant L'Oréal, briefly lost her title as the world's richest woman to Alice Walton, heir to the American retail group Walmart. However, Meyers currently ranks 20th among the world's richest, despite a 9.7 billion dollar decrease in her wealth this year to $89.9 billion, surpassing Walton, who ranks 21st.

**Donald Trump's Net Worth Doubles in 2024**
Donald Trump, the former US President and Republican candidate, has seen his net worth increase significantly in 2024. According to Forbes, Trump's net worth is estimated to be over $7.5 billion, with his main sources of income coming from his golf clubs and resorts, including Mar-a-Lago, which is valued at $292 million. Trump's net worth has increased due to his 58% stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that owns Truth Social, a social media platform. The platform went public on the stock market and saw a 54% increase in value within hours, making Trump's net worth jump to over $4 billion. However, Trump is no longer listed on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, although his net worth is still estimated to be in the millions.

**Elon Musk Donates Significant Amount to Fund Supporting Donald Trump**
According to Bloomberg, Elon Musk donated a significant amount of money to a fund supporting Donald Trump. The exact amount is unknown, but sources described the donation as substantial. This move highlights Musk's growing influence as the leader of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $263.6 billion, and his shift from being an independent political figure who claimed to stay out of politics to a figure who regularly uses his platform X to support right-wing views and attack Democrats. Musk's donation aims to 'leave a mark on the US political landscape'. The billionaire has not publicly endorsed any candidate in the 2024 elections, and earlier this year, he stated that he would not fund either Trump or Biden's campaigns.

**Top Three Billionaires Compete for Top Spot on Bloomberg Billionaires Index**
The top three billionaires in the world are competing for the top spot, with Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault holding the top three positions on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for over 94% of the time this year. However, fluctuations in their wealth have led to them swapping places six times since May 29, with a frantic pace in the hierarchical sequence that has remained largely stable since Musk lost his top spot in early March. Musk, 52, regained the top spot on Monday for the second time since early March, replacing Bezos. This comes after Tesla's shares rose last week following a vote by shareholders to approve a compensation package for Musk, which was previously blocked by a Delaware court and transferred the company's headquarters to Texas. The package, which includes stock options worth up to $55.8 billion, now represents nearly a quarter of Musk's net worth. His net worth has also been boosted by a new funding round that values his artificial intelligence project, xAI, at over $24 billion. Bloomberg's wealth index estimates that Musk owns 65% of the company, which uses social media data to train its chatbot program, Grok. Meanwhile, Arnault, 75, has recently fallen to third place with a net worth of $199 billion, after spending most of the past three months in first place, and has seen his net worth decline by $13 billion since the surprise presidential election call by French President Emmanuel Macron sent the country's markets into their worst week in years. Most of his wealth comes from LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods manufacturer. Bezos, the 60-year-old founder of Amazon, currently holds the second spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $206.6 billion. Since May 29, he has regained the top spot three times, with Amazon's shares trading near all-time highs. The share has benefited from a broader rally in major technology companies responsible for nearly three-quarters of the S&P 500's gains this year.

**Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund to Vote Against Tesla's 56 Billion Dollar Compensation Package for Elon Musk**
The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund will vote against Tesla's 56 billion dollar compensation package for CEO Elon Musk. The fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management, stated that while it values the significant value created under Musk's leadership since 2018, it is concerned about the overall scope of the package, its structure, and the lack of risk reduction for key personnel. The fund is estimated to be worth 1.3 billion euros and is the eighth-largest Tesla shareholder. Tesla's board chair, Robyn Denholm, has called for 'mutual respect' among shareholders, stating that Musk has no lack of ideas and can make a significant difference in the world. The fund's chief, Nicolai Tangen, has expressed concerns about the level of greed among companies, which he believes is becoming unsustainable for shareholders. The shareholders will vote on the package on Thursday. Two major proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, have also recommended voting against the package. Musk is the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with an estimated net worth of 203 billion dollars. Despite Tesla's record sales of over 1.8 million electric vehicles worldwide in 2023, the company has faced increasing scrutiny in recent months. Musk has been accused of diverting resources to his other companies, including social media platform X and AI startup xAI. He has also been criticized for his tweets, which some investors believe are an attempt to pressure them. In April, Musk fired the entire Supercharger team, including Senior Director of EV Charging Rebecca Tinucci, a move that was criticized by investors and partners.
