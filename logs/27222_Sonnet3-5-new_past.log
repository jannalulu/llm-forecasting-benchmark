Let me analyze this methodically:

1. Current Situation:
- As of August 14, 2024, Ukraine has advanced significantly into Russian territory in the Kursk region
- Multiple sources confirm advances of 20-30km (12-19 miles) into Russian territory
- ISW confirms Ukrainian forces have made substantial advances
- Operation involves thousands of troops and mechanized units

2. Factors Supporting Ukraine Maintaining Territory:
- Operation appears well-planned and executed
- Ukraine has successfully adapted drone capabilities
- Western support continues including new aid packages
- Ukraine demonstrates ability to hold captured territory for over a week

3. Factors Supporting Russian Recapture:
- Russia implementing anti-terror measures and mobilizing resources
- Historical precedent shows Russia eventually pushes back cross-border raids
- Russia has local numerical superiority and air superiority
- Analysts skeptical of Ukraine's ability to hold gains long-term
- Matthew Savill suggests this is preparation for 2025 counteroffensive

4. Timeline Analysis:
- ~6 weeks remain until October 1
- Russian forces likely to mount serious counteroffensive
- Ukraine may struggle to maintain supply lines
- Previous cross-border operations have been temporary

5. Key Considerations:
- Question asks about "no offensives" reaching 5 miles
- Current offensive well exceeds 5-mile threshold
- Ukraine likely to maintain some presence even if pushed back
- Russia needs to completely eliminate all Ukrainian positions beyond 5-mile mark

Given that Ukraine has demonstrated capability and willingness to conduct cross-border operations, has current deep penetration, and would only need to maintain a small presence beyond 5 miles to make this resolve negative, I assess it's more likely than not that Ukraine will maintain at least some offensive positions beyond 5 miles into Russia.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of August 14, 2024, Ukraine has launched a significant offensive into Russia's Kursk region
- Multiple sources confirm Ukrainian forces have advanced between 10-30km into Russian territory
- ISW confirms Ukrainian forces have made substantial advances into Kursk Oblast

2. Key Factors Supporting No Ukrainian Offensives by October 1:
- Analysts are skeptical that Ukraine can hold onto these gains
- Russia is implementing counter-measures and evacuating civilians
- Ukraine's forces are already stretched thin
- Previous Ukrainian advances have often been temporary
- Russia has historically been able to push back such incursions
- Winter weather approaching could make maintaining offensive positions more difficult

3. Key Factors Supporting Continued Ukrainian Offensives:
- Ukraine has demonstrated capability to penetrate Russian defenses
- Successfully using modern equipment and tactics
- Strategic importance of maintaining pressure on Russia
- Boost to Ukrainian morale from successful operations
- Ukraine appears committed to taking fight to Russian territory
- Western support continues including new weapons systems

4. Timeline Considerations:
- Only about 6 weeks until October 1
- Weather conditions should still be favorable through September
- Russia needs time to reorganize effective counter-offensive

5. Analysis:
- The current offensive appears more substantial than previous cross-border raids
- However, maintaining territory is more challenging than initial advances
- Russia likely to prioritize pushing Ukraine out of its territory
- Ukraine may maintain some positions but likely to face strong counter-pressure
- Historical pattern suggests such gains often temporary

Given the evidence, Ukraine is more likely than not to have no offensives reaching 5 miles into Russian territory by October 1, but there's significant uncertainty given the unprecedented nature of current operations.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%

- Russian military appears to be mobilizing significant resources to counter this offensive
- Analysts are skeptical about Ukraine's ability to hold gained territory
- Ukraine is already stretched thin along other fronts
- Russia has announced anti-terror operations and increased defensive measures
