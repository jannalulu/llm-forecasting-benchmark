**US Bird Flu Outbreak Raises Concerns of New Pandemic**
The US is experiencing an outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus, which has infected four people in milk cow farms. Experts are concerned about the possibility of a new pandemic. The virus has spread to 138 dairy herds and 12 US states. While the risk of human infection is currently low, the spread of the virus among animals, including housecats, increases the risk of human-to-human transmission. The lack of surveillance and control of milk cows in the US is a major challenge in combating the outbreak. The US government has allocated $176 million to Moderna to develop a vaccine using mRNA technology, with a potential availability in 2025. Currently, the US has around 4.8 million doses of a traditional vaccine, which could be used in mid-July if approved by the regulatory agency. However, it is too early to recommend vaccination against the virus, including for workers in the dairy industry. More tests are needed to determine the extent and scope of the outbreak.

**Weekly global protein digest**
The USDA will provide financial aid to dairy farmers affected by the H5N1 virus through the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish (ELAP) program. The aid will cover 28 days of milk loss per cow over a 134-day period, based on the monthly all-milk price and expected milk production per cow. The H5N1 avian flu virus has been confirmed in 121 dairy herds, with more expected as testing continues. The USDA is promoting a voluntary program for weekly milk sample tests from bulk coolers on dairy farms, allowing farmers to transport lactating cows across state lines without prior testing if the weekly results are negative. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that over 690 people have been monitored for bird flu due to exposure to infected animals, an increase of 140 in a week. The risk to the general public remains low. The USDA has allocated $2.1 billion to address bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in the deaths of over 97 million birds, primarily egg-laying hens and turkeys. China's ag ministry published new regulations to stabilize the production of beef cattle as the industry faces declining prices and heavy losses. The ministry will instruct farms to adjust breeding reasonably, eliminate old and low-yielding cattle as appropriate, optimize herd structure and improve production efficiency. The ministry also called for measures to increase the supply of forage and reduce costs. Local areas should raise grass planting in cultivated land and use beaches, abandoned land, and saline-alkali land. To strengthen disease prevention, the ministry will support large-scale farms to increase biosafety measures and build disease-free communities.

**Michigan reports 3 more H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds**
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) reported three more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in dairy herds, bringing the total to 18 outbreaks in nine counties. The virus has also been detected in two domestic cats in South Dakota, neither of which were linked to affected poultry or dairy farms. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting studies to validate the effectiveness of pasteurization in inactivating the virus in milk and other dairy products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is boosting flu surveillance and has started a pandemic risk assessment of the H5N1 virus linked to the outbreak in dairy cattle.

**CDC A(H5N1) Bird Flu Response Update May 17**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to respond to a multistate outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in dairy cows and other animals in the United States. The CDC is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state public health and animal health officials, and other partners using a One Health approach. As of May 17, 2024, 51 dairy cattle herds in nine U.S. states have confirmed cases of A(H5N1) virus infections in cattle. There have been no additional human cases detected since the one recent case from Texas was reported on April 1, 2024. The CDC is continuing to support states that are monitoring people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals, and is working on a plan for enhanced, nationwide summer monitoring to detect rare cases of A(H5N1) virus infection in the community. The CDC is also beginning the process of conducting a pandemic risk assessment on the virus from the human infection in Texas using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT). The current assessment of the risk level to the general public remains low.

**Tests confirm H5N1 in Oklahoma dairy herd; 13 states now affected**
The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry has confirmed the state's first highly pathogenic avian flu outbreak in a dairy herd, bringing the total number of affected states to 13. Research from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has shown that the H5N1 virus can spread between cattle through both respiratory and mammary routes. The Oklahoma State Veterinarian, Rod Hall, has emphasized the importance of heightening biosecurity practices and providing personal protective equipment to dairy farmers. The USDA has confirmed 157 H5N1 outbreaks in 13 states, including Oklahoma, Colorado, and Idaho. A challenge study by USDA researchers found that the virus can persist in mammary glands and milk for up to 24 days after infection, and that asymptomatic cows can spread the virus to herd mates through the respiratory route.

**The Growing Threat of H5N1 Avian Influenza: A Pandemic Looms**
The threat of the H5N1 avian influenza virus is growing, and public health authorities are slow to respond. Since the virus was first detected in cattle in late March, 132 herds in 12 states have been officially affected. Despite repeated assurances from the federal government that all resources are being used to eliminate the threat, scientists are increasingly concerned that too little is being done to protect humanity from a new pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have only tested 51 people potentially exposed to H5N1, a number that has barely budged since the outbreak was detected. This lack of testing and surveillance in communities where humans and livestock live in close proximity is necessary for epidemiologists to understand the scope of the current threat. A recent initiative in Michigan, supported by the US Food and Drug Administration, is underway to test a wider range of dairy products and conduct human serological studies to evaluate the impact on workers after exposure to sick cows. The CDC has stated that the goal of these efforts is to determine the effectiveness of antivirals on the circulating clade of H5N1, understand infection in humans, estimate the incubation period, and identify potential mechanisms for attenuating the possibility of a H5N1 pandemic. According to Dr. Robert Redfield, former CDC director under Trump, it is 'very likely' that the US will have an avian influenza pandemic at some point, and the mortality rate will be much higher than COVID-19, estimated to be between 25% and 50%. Redfield has a history of downplaying the threat of pandemics and has been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article concludes that the US is not prepared for a pandemic and that the government's response to the H5N1 outbreak is inadequate.

**Three months into bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows, experts see deep-rooted problems in response**
The US is struggling to contain an outbreak of avian influenza in dairy cows, with experts saying the country is failing to take necessary steps to stop the virus from spreading. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has stated that its goal is to eliminate the virus, but experts say the agency's response has been inadequate. The country lacks a sufficient testing infrastructure, and there is no full understanding of how the virus is moving within herds and to new herds. The USDA has not secured cooperation from farmers and dairy workers, which is necessary to rein in the outbreak. Experts say that if the situation were playing out in another country, US officials would be calling the response unacceptable. The virus has spread to 126 herds in 12 states, and three farmworkers have developed mild cases of H5N1. The situation is concerning because the virus could potentially adapt to become more transmissible to humans. The USDA has rolled out some interventions, such as testing lactating dairy cows and providing personal protective equipment to farmers, but experts say these measures are insufficient. The lack of cooperation from farmers and dairy workers is a major obstacle, as they are reluctant to test their cows and may not report infections. The situation is also complicated by the fact that many farmworkers do not speak English and may not have health insurance. Experts say that a more effective response would involve education campaigns to inform dairy workers about how to prevent infections and to encourage farmers to be more transparent about their testing results. The USDA is working with state health officials and the food and agriculture sector to raise awareness about available resources, but experts say more needs to be done to address the trust gap with farmers.

**Bird flu outbreak at U.S. dairy farms cause public health concerns**
A bird flu outbreak at U.S. dairy farms has raised public health concerns as more dairy herds test positive for the virus. The H5N1 virus has been circulating in U.S. poultry since 2022 and has jumped from birds to dairy cows at a Texas farm. Three human cases of infection have been reported, and the virus has been confirmed in at least 115 dairy herds across 12 states. Researchers found that the virus can remain infectious in raw milk samples even after pasteurization. Public health experts are concerned about the government's slow response and inadequate testing, and are calling for a public-private partnership to streamline testing and information sharing. The World Health Organization considers bird flu a public health concern due to its potential to cause mild to severe illness and death, and to mutate to become more contagious.

**A strange disease**
Avian influenza, H5N1, has been reported in dairy cattle in 12 states, affecting 115 dairy herds. The unusual outbreak is attributed to the virus being transported through moving cattle from one location to another. The disease is mild in dairy cattle, causing a 10-15% drop in milk production, and is often found in milk or mammary glands. Precautions during milking are crucial, and personal protective equipment (PPE) has become more vital than ever before. So far, three cases of the disease have been reported in humans, with mild symptoms. The USDA offers financial assistance to affected producers and veterinarians, and the industry is considering proposals to test milk before it crosses state lines.

**Best not to underestimate danger H5N1 presents**
Despite Canadian and US authorities downplaying the risk, experts like Matthew Miller, a viral pandemic researcher, warn that the bovine avian influenza outbreak in US dairy cattle poses a massive threat and the potential for a catastrophic pandemic is imminent. The virus has spread to 96 dairy herds in 12 states, with three dairy workers confirmed to have caught the disease from cows. While the number of human cases is low, the mortality rate in outbreaks where people catch the virus from infected birds is 50%, making it a serious concern. Experts are calling for an aggressive and compassionate collaboration to prevent human infection, including protecting farmed animals and workers, and possibly vaccines, while avoiding mandates and misinformation.

**As avian flu hops to cows and at least two humans, migrant farm workers are at risk**
The H5N1 influenza virus, which has decimated bird populations worldwide, has jumped species and adapted to spread between cows in the US. This poses a risk to dairy farm workers, who are at the frontline for spillover infections into humans. As of May 24, there are 58 known infected herds across the US, with two human infections documented in dairy farm workers in Texas and Michigan. Experts say that to limit the spread, workers need protective equipment and paid sick leave. However, many unknowns remain, including how many states and herds are affected, how the virus spreads between cows, and whether there are more human cases.
