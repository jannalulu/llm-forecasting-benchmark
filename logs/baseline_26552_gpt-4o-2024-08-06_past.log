To make an accurate forecast, let's consider the context and factors involved:

1. **Current Date**: It is July 24, 2024, and the deadline for FDA approval is September 30, 2024. This gives us a period of just over two months for a senolytic therapy to be approved.

2. **Drug Development and Approval Process**: The FDA approval process is generally lengthy and rigorous, involving multiple phases of clinical trials (Phase I, II, and III) before a New Drug Application (NDA) can be submitted and reviewed. While the process can be expedited through mechanisms such as Accelerated Approval or Breakthrough Therapy designation, there is no publicly available information suggesting a senolytic therapy has reached an NDA submission, let alone been considered for accelerated review.

3. **State of Senolytic Research**: As of the last known data in 2023, senolytic therapies were primarily in the research and early clinical trial phases, focusing on benefits like reducing age-related diseases by targeting senescent cells. The transition from promising studies to a commercially viable and approved therapy within a very short timeframe is ambitious unless significant breakthroughs or unreported progress have occurred.

4. **Regulatory Developments**: There is no information suggesting that the FDA has issued any recent approvals or is currently reviewing an NDA specifically for a senolytic therapy. Moreover, the dissolution of the FDA or an analogous scenario is exceedingly unlikely and would typically involve extensive legislative or executive actions, none of which are anticipated within the forecast period.

Given these considerations, including the short remaining timeframe for approval and the typical pace of drug development and approval, the likelihood of a senolytic therapy receiving FDA approval before September 30, 2024, is low.

My Prediction: 02.00% is the most likely. Probability: 02.00%.
