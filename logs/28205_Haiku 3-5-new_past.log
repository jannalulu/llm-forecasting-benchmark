Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Key Situation Assessment:
1. Current Status: Boeing workers are on strike as of September 13, 2024
2. Strike involves 33,000 machinists across Washington, Oregon, California
3. 94.6% rejected contract, 96% voted to strike
4. Union leaders indicate willingness to continue negotiations
5. Potential economic impact estimated $3-3.5 billion for Boeing

Historical Comparison:
- Previous Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days
- Current context: Boeing facing significant financial/reputation challenges
- High worker dissatisfaction with proposed 25% vs desired 40% wage increase

Probability Considerations:
- High worker solidarity (96% strike vote)
- Complex negotiation dynamics
- Boeing's financial vulnerability
- Potential external mediation pressures

Scenario Analysis:
- Low probability of immediate resolution
- Medium probability of prolonged negotiation
- Moderate chance of partial compromise

Methodological Adjustments:
- Base rate of prolonged industrial strikes
- Current economic/labor market conditions
- Boeing's specific organizational pressures

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Overestimating worker resolve
- Underestimating negotiation potential
- Company's financial constraints

Considering these multifaceted factors, carefully weighing evidence.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 92.30%, but 86.40% being the most likely. Probability: 86.40%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence:
1. Current Strike Details
- 33,000 Boeing machinists went on strike on September 13, 2024
- 94.6% rejected a 25% 4-year wage increase
- 96% voted to authorize strike
- Union demands 40% wage increase over 3 years
- Last similar strike in 2008 lasted 57 days

2. Context Factors
- Boeing is financially struggling
- Company facing reputation/safety challenges
- New CEO Kelly Ortberg wants to restore relations
- Negotiations scheduled to resume Tuesday (September 17)

3. Potential Strike Duration Considerations
- Union seems highly motivated
- Significant wage disagreement
- Complex negotiations anticipated
- Company wants to conserve cash flow

4. Probability Assessment
- Base rate for long industrial strikes: ~20-30%
- Current dispute seems more entrenched than typical
- High union solidarity suggests prolonged action
- Financial stakes for both sides are substantial

Adjusting Base Rate:
- Initial estimate: 40-50% chance of continuous strike
- Factors pushing higher: Union's strong mandate, wage gap
- Factors pushing lower: Economic pressures, reputation risks

Calibration Reasoning:
- Unlikely to resolve immediately
- Substantial negotiation runway needed
- Potential for partial resolution or temporary agreements

My Prediction: Between 62.50% and 87.50%, but 75.25% being the most likely. Probability: 75.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this strike scenario systematically:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Historical Context:
- Last Boeing strike was in 2008, lasted 57 days
- Current strike just began on September 13, 2024
- Union overwhelmingly rejected 25% raise (94.6% against)
- 96% voted to strike

2. Financial/Strategic Considerations:
- Boeing faces significant financial challenges
- Estimated $3-3.5 billion potential strike cost
- New CEO Kelly Ortberg wants to rebuild labor relations
- Company expressed willingness to return to negotiations

3. Labor Dynamics:
- Workers demanding 40% raise vs 25% offered
- Multiple unresolved tensions around compensation
- Strong union solidarity demonstrated
- Significant worker frustration with company leadership

4. Timing Considerations:
- Currently in early stages of strike
- Negotiations scheduled to resume on September 17
- No immediate signs of imminent resolution

Probability Reasoning:
- Base probability of continued strike: High
- Mitigating factors: Financial pressure on both sides
- Strong worker sentiment suggests prolonged action likely

Comparative Reference Class:
- Similar manufacturing strikes often last 4-8 weeks
- Aerospace industry strikes tend to be protracted

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Risk of overestimating worker solidarity
- Risk of underestimating company's negotiation capacity

Synthesizing these factors, accounting for uncertainty and potential resolution paths.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 92.30%, but 85.40% being the most likely. Probability: 85.40%.
