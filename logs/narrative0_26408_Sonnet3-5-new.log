Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Turkish minimum wage situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. We had it at 15.3% probability of another increase before September 30th. The combination of Işıkhan's explicit denial in April and the government's attempts to control spending, despite the local election losses, made it unlikely.

Nate: The high inflation and worker pressure were factors pushing the other way, but the government held firm. Even with 68% inflation eating into the January increase, they stuck to their guns.

Philip: Exactly. While historically they'd done multiple increases in 2022 and 2023, the economic policy shift was clear. Though our models detected some possibility of populist reaction to the opposition's victory, it wasn't enough to overcome the government's stated position.

Nate: Another prediction in the books. Shall we move on to the next forecast?

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Turkish minimum wage situation.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, we had it at 15.5%. The signals were quite clear - despite the high inflation and Erdoğan's party's local election losses, Labor Minister Işıkhan's April statement was a strong indicator.

Nate: The economic pressures were real, with inflation eating into the January increase, but the government held firm. Even with 33-50% of workers on minimum wage, they stuck to their annual adjustment policy.

Philip: Indeed. While historical precedent from 2022-2023 showed multiple increases were possible, the government's explicit stance and their commitment to orthodox economic policies after the election defeat made another 2024 increase unlikely.

Nate: Another win for the models. Sometimes the straightforward answer is the right one.

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office with data screens showing economic indicators. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasts.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Turkish minimum wage situation."

Philip: "Indeed. No, our models had it at 22.45%. Despite the high inflation and pressure after Erdoğan's party's local election losses, the government stuck to their January statement."

Nate: "The Labor Minister's April statement was particularly telling. Even with inflation eating into wages and about 40% of workers earning minimum wage, they held firm."

Philip: "The interesting part was how our models accounted for Erdoğan's historical pattern of populist policies against the new economic team's commitment to orthodox policies."

Nate: "True. The opposition's victory actually decreased the likelihood of a wage hike - the government didn't want to appear reactive to political pressure."

[Both nod, turning to their next forecast]

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on again about the Turkish minimum wage situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. We had it at 12.5%. The combination of Işıkhan's explicit denial in April and Erdoğan's weakened political position after the local elections made a second increase highly unlikely.

Nate: The high inflation certainly created pressure, but the government stuck to their January adjustment. Our models factored in the historical precedent of dual increases in 2022 and 2023, but...

Philip: [interrupting] But the political landscape was different then. Even with inflation eating into the January increase, the government maintained their stance. The opposition's victory in local elections actually made them more fiscally conservative, not less.

Nate: Exactly. Sometimes the obvious political move isn't the one that happens. That's why we had it at just 12.5%.

Philip: True. Though historically they've done multiple increases during high inflation years, our models caught the shift in policy stance. The opposition's victory in local elections wasn't enough to force Erdoğan's hand on this one.
