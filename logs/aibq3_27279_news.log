**U.S. Measles Cases Jump Sharply in 2024**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of measles cases in the U.S. has tripled in 2024 compared to last year, with 188 cases reported across 25 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia as of July 25. Approximately 95% of cases have involved individuals who were either unvaccinated, had an unknown vaccination status, or had received only one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The CDC reports that nearly two-thirds of measles cases this year have been associated with outbreaks, with the largest outbreak occurring at a migrant shelter in Chicago in March, resulting in 57 cases. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can infect up to 90% of people who are unprotected if they come in contact with someone with the illness. The CDC notes that the number of measles cases has jumped periodically due to a decline in vaccination rates among schoolchildren and an overall increase in cases globally.

**Measles Cases Jump Sharply in 2024**
Measles cases in the U.S. have surged in 2024, with 188 reported cases across 25 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia as of July 25, according to the CDC. This is more than triple the 58 cases recorded in all of 2023. The majority of cases, 95%, have involved individuals who were unvaccinated, had an unknown vaccination status, or had received only one dose of the MMR vaccine. Health officials have reported 13 measles outbreaks, with the largest occurring at a migrant shelter in Chicago in March, resulting in 57 cases. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can infect up to 90% of people who are unprotected if they come in contact with someone with the illness. 'Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, thanks in large part to the success of an extensive vaccination program,' said the CDC. However, in recent years, the number of measles cases has jumped periodically due to a decline in vaccination rates among schoolchildren and an overall increase in cases globally.

**Measles  --  United States, January 1, 2020-March 28, 2024**
The United States has maintained measles elimination since 2023, with 338 cases reported from January 2020 to March 2024. Most cases were import-associated, and the surveillance system is performing well. However, the rapid increase in reported cases in the first quarter of 2024 represents a renewed threat to elimination. The majority of importations were from countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and African WHO regions, where measles incidence is high. Global estimates suggest that first-dose measles vaccination coverage has declined, leaving almost 22 million children susceptible to measles. Maintaining high national and local MMR vaccination coverage is crucial to sustaining measles elimination. The risk of widespread measles transmission remains low due to high population immunity, but efforts are needed to increase routine MMR vaccination coverage and rapidly investigate suspected measles cases to maintain elimination.

**Measles Cases Triple in the US, CDC Reports**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of measles cases in the United States has increased significantly, with 188 cases reported in 2024, compared to 58 cases in 2023. This represents a tripling of cases from last year. The CDC defines an outbreak as three or more cases linked together, and there have been 13 outbreaks in 2024, compared to 4 in 2023. About half of the cases this year have required hospitalization for isolation or management of complications. The CDC reports that 85% of those infected this year were not vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, while 10% had received the MMR vaccine and 5% had received two doses. Healthcare professionals emphasize that the risk of contracting measles is extremely low after being vaccinated. Measles is a highly contagious and serious disease that can cause severe complications, including death, especially in children.

**Measles cases surge in Bavaria, reaching pre-Corona levels**
Measles cases are on the rise in Bavaria, with the number of reported cases reaching pre-Corona levels. According to the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety, there were 57 reported measles cases in the first eight months of 2024, compared to only five cases in the same period last year. This is a significant increase from the 11 cases reported in 2023 and the four cases reported in 2022. 'The number of measles cases is approaching the level before the Corona pandemic,' said Gerlach. 'In 2019, there were 75 measles cases reported in the state. The current numbers show that we are now approaching the level of the pre-Corona years.' Gerlach attributed the increase to the reduced contact and protective measures during the Corona pandemic. She emphasized the importance of vaccination, particularly for children under the age of five, who are most vulnerable to the disease. 'Masern are a highly contagious disease that can lead to severe complications and are often underestimated as a harmless children's disease,' she warned. 'The vaccine prevents both infection and transmission very well. With two timely measles vaccinations, parents protect their child's health and also make an important contribution to community protection.' According to the data from the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety, about half of the reported measles cases in 2024 came from nine individual households where unvaccinated people live.

**Measles cases hold steady across Canada. Use our tool to check the spread**
Canada has seen a concerning rise in measles cases in 2024. Ontario has recorded 24 measles cases, more than triple the number from last year, while New Brunswick reported its first case in July and Quebec added at least two new cases last month. A measles death was reported in Ontario in May, a child under the age of five who was not vaccinated against the virus. As of August 2, 81 measles infections have been recorded nationwide. According to Dr. Elin, 'It was a great day' when the outbreak in Quebec was declared over on June 5, after 51 cases were reported. However, the current situation remains concerning, with health officials issuing advisories about potential exposures in certain areas. 'We are tracking measles cases in Canada, drawing on reports and media releases from provinces and local public health agencies,' said the Toronto Star. 'The tracker is updated every other week on Fridays.'

**Measles Outbreak in Spain: 69 Cases Reported in 2024**
Spain has seen a recent increase in cases of measles, with 69 reported cases in 2024, following a total of 14 cases in 2023. According to the Comité Asesor de Vacunas e Inmunología (AepCav), the number of cases has been increasing in many countries since several months ago. The vaccination coverage in Spain has been below the target of 95%, with 96.12% for the 1st dose in the 2021 cohort and 91.81% for the 2nd dose in the 2018 cohort. The authorities are working to control the outbreak through intensified vaccination campaigns, public education on the importance of vaccines, and close monitoring of cases. The measures also include quarantine and isolation strategies to prevent the spread of the virus. The measles virus was identified for the first time in 1954 by scientist John Enders, who also developed the first vaccine against the disease. The vaccine has been crucial in reducing the incidence of measles worldwide. Before the widespread use of the vaccine, measles was a common disease worldwide, with frequent outbreaks that often resulted in high mortality rates, especially in children under five years old.

**Measles cases on the rise in Tim Walz's Minnesota**
Minnesota is experiencing a measles outbreak with 22 cases in 2024, the third-highest since 2000, affecting unvaccinated individuals. Senior epidemiologist Jayne Griffith attributes the cases to overseas travel, possibly dating back to May. Griffith notes, 'The more you keep talking to people, it will sometimes trigger a memory,' suggesting that children and their parents may recall a potential measles exposure. Health authorities are urging parents to ensure their children are vaccinated against measles, with only 87% of kindergarten children receiving standard vaccinations this year, down from 93% four years ago. The decline is attributed to vaccine hesitancy, which has been exacerbated by the public response to the Covid mRNA vaccine. About 55% of measles cases in Minnesota are hospitalized, and the disease is highly contagious, spreading at a great distance.

**Increasing spread of measles is becoming inevitable**
The United States is experiencing a significant increase in measles cases, with 159 confirmed cases in 2024, almost triple the 2023 total of 58. The CDC states that 84% of the cases were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Measles is a highly contagious virus that poses a significant risk to young children, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised. The virus can live for up to two hours on surfaces and air, and people can be contagious for up to four days before symptoms appear. The World Health Organization reports that worldwide measles rates increased 18% to 9 million confirmed cases in 2022, resulting in 136,000 deaths, mostly among children. The increased migration of people from areas with high measles rates to the US, combined with vaccine hesitancy, makes further spread of the virus inevitable. As the article states, 'it hasn't gotten any better with age'.

**Italy's Measles Cases: A Concerning Trend**
Italy has the second-highest number of measles cases in the European Union, with 753 reported cases in the past 12 months (July 2023 to June 2024). According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (Ecdc), 45% of European patients are children under five years old, while nearly 27% are adults over 15 years old, mostly unvaccinated. The World Health Organization recommends a vaccination coverage of at least 95% for two doses to ensure population protection. Only Hungary, Malta, and Portugal have achieved this goal. As the Ecdc report states, 'many adults who have missed the opportunity to vaccinate in the past continue to get sick, often returning from countries with outbreaks.'

**Measles Cases in Europe Decrease, but Experts Remain Concerned**
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (Ecdc), there were 1,891 cases of measles reported in Europe in June, with a significant decrease from the previous month's 2,387 cases. The majority of the cases (1,282) were reported in Romania, followed by Belgium (201) and Italy (150). Since July 2023, there have been 17,273 cases of measles reported in European Union and European Economic Area countries, resulting in 13 deaths: 12 in Romania and 1 in Ireland. Experts are concerned about the high incidence of measles in children under 5 years old, particularly those under 1 year old, who are 'particularly vulnerable to measles and its complications' and are better protected by a high level of herd immunity, as the first dose of the measles vaccine is administered after 12 months of age.'

Pala stated that the Ministry of Health has not published the 2023 Health Statistics Yearbook, despite the first seven months of 2024 having passed, and therefore, there is no published data on the number of measles cases and vaccination rates for 2023. Pala said, 'Measles is a highly contagious and potentially life-threatening disease that can be prevented by vaccination. The current measles outbreak in Turkey is alarming, with 1,104 cases reported in the first five months of 2024, compared to 5004 cases in 2023.' Pala asked the Minister of Health, Kemal Memişoğlu, several questions, including when the 2023 Health Statistics Yearbook will be published, why the number of measles cases reported in 2022 was different from the number published in the 2022 Health Statistics Yearbook, and what the vaccination rates for 2023 and 2024 are.

**Oregon now has second largest measles outbreak in US**
Oregon has reported 23 cases of measles, with 14 of those cases in Marion County. All of the cases have been in unvaccinated individuals, with the majority being in individuals younger than 19. Two people have been hospitalized. Measles is on the rise nationwide, with 203 cases reported in 2024, compared to 58 cases in all of 2023. According to the Oregon Health Authority, the measles virus spreads through the air, often without known connections, due to its high transmissibility. People are contagious up to four days before showing symptoms and remain contagious up to four days after. Public health officials advise anyone who believes they may have measles or have been exposed to stay home, avoid public places, and call ahead before visiting a medical office. Isabel Funk, a reporter for the Statesman Journal, noted that individuals are considered immune if they are born before 1957, have previously been diagnosed with measles, have proven immunity through a blood test, or have had two doses of the measles vaccine.

**Poland Reports Surge in Measles and Pertussis Cases**
Polish radio station RMF FM reported a surge in measles and pertussis cases, with 246 measles cases recorded in 2024, a 10-fold increase from the previous year. Additionally, over 8,000 pertussis cases have been reported since the beginning of the year, a 16-fold increase from 2023. According to Polish media, the rise in measles and pertussis cases may be linked to the mass influx of Ukrainian citizens who have not undergone mandatory vaccination for these diseases. It is worth noting that a measles outbreak was also reported in Ukraine in 2019, with over 56,000 cases recorded in the first half of the year and 18 deaths attributed to complications. A pertussis outbreak in Ukraine was reported in February 2024.

**U.S. Measles Cases Jump Sharply in 2024**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of measles cases in the U.S. has tripled in 2024 compared to last year, with 188 cases reported across 25 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia as of July 25. Approximately 95% of cases have involved individuals who were either unvaccinated, had an unknown vaccination status, or had received only one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The CDC reports that nearly two-thirds of measles cases this year have been associated with outbreaks, with the largest outbreak occurring at a migrant shelter in Chicago in March, resulting in 57 cases. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can infect up to 90% of people who are unprotected if they come in contact with someone with the illness. The CDC notes that the number of measles cases has jumped periodically due to a decline in vaccination rates among schoolchildren and an overall increase in cases globally.

**Measles Cases On The Rise Across The U.S.: What To Know In NJ**
Measles cases in the U.S. have nearly tripled compared to last year, with 188 cases reported in 26 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC attributes the increase to vaccine hesitancy since the COVID-19 pandemic and a global uptick in measles cases. About 85% of cases this year were among people who haven't been vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. In New Jersey, 94.3% of kindergarteners in the 2022-23 school year were up-to-date on their MMR vaccinations, but the number of people protected against measles by the vaccine has fallen below the 95% coverage level needed to prevent outbreaks in some U.S. communities. Measles was declared eradicated from the U.S. in 2000, but the 2024 outbreak is the highest since then, with 60 illnesses linked to a migrant shelter in Chicago in March. 'The current uptick in cases is due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy since the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a global uptick in measles cases,' said the CDC. Common symptoms of measles include a high fever, cough, pink eye, runny nose, white spots in the mouth, and a rash that typically starts on the face and spreads downward to the feet. Between 1 and 3 of every 1,000 children infected with measles die from complications of measles, which can include pneumonia and swelling of the brain.

**Measles and Whooping Cough Cases Rise in Walloon Region**
According to the AVIQ, the ministry of health in the Walloon region, there has been a significant increase in cases of measles and whooping cough. From January 1 to June 30, 73 cases of measles were confirmed, which is 69 more than during the same period last year. The number of whooping cough cases is also on the rise. In the Verviers region of the Liège province, a local epidemic of measles has been reported since May. From May 1 to June 30, 42 cases were registered in Verviers and Dison, accounting for 79% of all cases in the Walloon region and 86% of cases in the Liège province. In 74% of cases, the infected individuals were children under 10 years old, most of whom were not properly vaccinated or did not know if they were vaccinated or not. Two unvaccinated adults aged 40-41 were also involved in the cases. The number of whooping cough cases in French-speaking Belgium has been increasing since July 2023, with a peak in May 2024, when the highest number of monthly infections in a decade was recorded.

**CDC Says Measles Cases Already Triple 2023 Total**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that the number of measles cases in the U.S. has already tripled the total for 2023, with 188 cases reported in 27 jurisdictions as of July 25, 2024. The majority of cases (123 of 188) are associated with outbreaks, a significant increase from 2023. Experts attribute the uptick to declining vaccination rates in the U.S. and a rise in measles cases worldwide. Around 85% of cases were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, with many linked to international travel.

**US measles cases are already triple those of last year**
The number of measles cases in the US has already tripled that of last year, with 188 cases reported in 26 states and Washington, D.C. as of July 2024. Most of the cases are in children under the age of 5, and 93 people have been hospitalized. Experts attribute the rise in cases to declining vaccination rates in the US, which are below the recommended 95% threshold. Dr. David Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine, notes that the US has not reached the threshold of vaccination coverage needed to prevent outbreaks. Dr. Erica Prochaska, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist, emphasizes the importance of global vaccination rates in preventing diseases transmitted in the US. Dr. Gregory Poland, founder and director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, notes that the outbreaks are not more extensive given the low vaccination rates. The article also highlights the impact of vaccine misinformation and lockdowns on vaccination services in low- and middle-income countries, leading to an increase in measles cases worldwide.

**Measles  --  United States, January 1, 2020-March 28, 2024**
The United States has maintained measles elimination since 2023, with 338 cases reported from January 2020 to March 2024. Most cases were import-associated, and the surveillance system is performing well. However, the rapid increase in reported cases in the first quarter of 2024 represents a renewed threat to elimination. The majority of importations were from countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and African WHO regions, where measles incidence is high. Global estimates suggest that first-dose measles vaccination coverage has declined, leaving almost 22 million children susceptible to measles. Maintaining high national and local MMR vaccination coverage is crucial to sustaining measles elimination. The risk of widespread measles transmission remains low due to high population immunity, but efforts are needed to increase routine MMR vaccination coverage and rapidly investigate suspected measles cases to maintain elimination.

**Global Measles Outbreaks**
Measles is a highly contagious disease that can easily spread across borders and cause outbreaks in communities where people are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2022, an estimated 9 million people were infected with measles. Currently, measles outbreaks are occurring in every region of the world. Although measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, there were almost 1,300 cases reported in 31 states in 2019, the highest number since 1992. The 2019 outbreaks were linked to travel-related cases that affected at-risk populations in the US.

**Measles Cases in the US Triple Compared to 2023**
The number of measles cases in the US has tripled compared to 2023, according to the CDC. As of July 26, there have been at least 188 reported cases in 26 states and Washington D.C. The CDC defines a measles outbreak as three or more related cases. The majority of cases are related to outbreaks, and children under 5 years old account for nearly half of the cases. No deaths have been reported this year, but 93 patients have been hospitalized. Local health authorities have issued multiple alerts due to individuals infected with recent international travel history, potentially exposing others to measles at airports. 'Measles is a highly contagious infection, and if you don't have immunity, you can catch it simply by being in a room where someone with measles has been,' said Eric Chow, a King County Public Health official. The CDC has sent out health alerts regarding an increase in measles cases worldwide and in the US, advising travelers to take precautions before leaving the country. Despite the recent increase, the numbers are still below those reported in 2019, when around 1,300 cases were reported in the US. Globally, measles cases increased by 18% and deaths by 43% between 2021 and 2022, according to a report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC in late 2023.

**CDC: Measles Cases in US So Far This Year Already Triple 2023 Total**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the number of measles cases in the US so far in 2024 has already tripled the total for all of 2023. Cases have been reported in 25 states and Washington D.C. No deaths have been reported, but 93 patients have been hospitalized. According to Eric Chow, an official in the King County Public Health agency, 'Measles is a very contagious infection and if you don't yet have immunity, you can get it just by being in a room where a person with measles has been.' The CDC states that most cases occurred in unvaccinated persons and that a prompt and coordinated response with a high-coverage mass vaccination campaign reduced the size and duration of the outbreak. The measles rash typically appears three to five days after the first symptoms begin, starting on the face near the hairline and spreading to the rest of the body.

**Massachusetts Reports First Measles Case in Four Years**
A resident of Worcester County, Massachusetts, has been diagnosed with measles after returning from a trip abroad, marking the first confirmed case in the state since 2020, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH). This case highlights the growing threat of measles, a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air and has seen a significant increase worldwide, including in the United States and neighboring New England states. Robbie Goldstein, Commissioner of Public Health, emphasized the gravity of the situation, noting that there have been reported cases of measles in 30 states since the beginning of the year. The majority of these cases have been registered in unvaccinated individuals and communities, underscoring the importance of vaccination as the best measure of protection against this disease. The DPH has contacted individuals who may have been exposed to the virus and provided them with public health recommendations to prevent further spread. According to CDC data, as of July 11, 2024, there have been 167 reported cases of measles in the United States. Of these cases, 84% correspond to individuals who were not vaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, while 11% had received one dose of the MMR vaccine and 5% were fully vaccinated. These data highlight the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and the need to ensure that more people complete their vaccination schedule. Children under 5 years old represent nearly half of the reported cases in 2024, with 46%. Additionally, approximately half of the cases have required hospitalization, underscoring the gravity of the complications that measles can cause, especially in vulnerable populations such as young children. The DPH has warned of large measles outbreaks in Europe and other parts of the world, linked to an increase in international travel. This was the case in Massachusetts in June, when an international traveler who was infected with measles took a bus from New Hampshire to Boston Logan Airport, exposing others to the virus. To prevent future outbreaks, the DPH urges anyone who is unsure of their measles vaccination status to consult their doctor and get vaccinated if necessary. Vaccination not only protects the individual but also contributes to herd immunity, which is essential for protecting those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. This recent case in Massachusetts serves as an urgent reminder of the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates and being attentive to public health recommendations. With global mobility and the ease of international travel, the risk of importing diseases like measles increases, making it vital for communities to be well-protected through vaccination.

**Measles Returns to Italy, Says Bassetti: 'The Problem is Not the Obligation, But the Lack of Enforcement'**
According to Matteo Bassetti, director of Infectious Diseases at the Policlinico San Martino hospital in Genoa, measles has returned to being a problem in Italy. The numbers show that cases have increased from May to June, with over 700 cases reported in the first six months of 2024, a 10-15 fold increase compared to 2023. Bassetti notes that most of those affected are unvaccinated individuals, which suggests that something is not working in the country, as some regions have not reached the 95% vaccination coverage rate. He proposes that instead of removing the vaccination obligation and replacing it with a recommendation, the law should be enforced more strictly to improve coverage. Bassetti emphasizes that children's health should be protected by a strong national healthcare system, not by individual parents' intelligence or decisions.

**Measles Outbreak in Petrozavodsk: Two Cases Detected, Vaccination Efforts Underway**
Two cases of measles were detected in Petrozavodsk, Russia, in June. One case involved a 34-year-old man, and the other involved three relatives: two adults and a one-year-old child. The authorities organized door-to-door visits in the buildings where the patients lived, searched for possible carriers, and vaccinated unvaccinated individuals. The observation period for those who may have contracted the infection will continue for three weeks, as the probability of infection is very high, approaching 100%. Fortunately, all infected individuals had a mild course of the disease. The only way to combat measles is widespread vaccination. In Russia, over 15,000 cases have been detected since the beginning of the year. Children are vaccinated against measles at 1 and 6 years old, but adults can also be vaccinated. If an individual is unsure if they have been vaccinated before, a repeat vaccination will not harm and will only strengthen their immunity. In 2023, 7,467 children and 6,768 adults were vaccinated in the Karelia region. In the first five months of 2024, 5,114 children and 1,805 adults have been vaccinated. The most children are being vaccinated in the Belomorsk, Muzeysky, Pitkyaranta, and Petrozavodsk districts, while adults are being vaccinated in the Muzeysky, Konstantinovsk, Sotavala, and Kostomuksha districts.

**¿Hay un brote de sarampión en Galicia?**
The Spanish Ministry of Health has reported an increase in cases and outbreaks of measles worldwide and in Europe, which has implications for Spain. Since 2016, Spain has been in a measles-free situation, with a vaccination coverage of 90% in two doses and 95% in one dose nationwide. In 2023, 14 cases were confirmed, and in 2024, 106 cases have been reported, with 21 outbreaks in 11 autonomous communities. In Galicia, there are only two confirmed cases in 2024, and no cases have been reported in A Coruña in recent years. A pediatrician from the Hospital Teresa Herrera in A Coruña attributes the increase in cases to imported cases, international travel, immigration, and lack of vaccination. He recommends following the vaccination schedule, particularly for measles, to prevent the spread of the disease.

According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 26 European countries reported measles cases in May 2024, with 672 cases reported from 18 countries. Eight countries reported zero cases. The highest number of cases was reported by Romania (169), Belgium (130), Italy (126), and France (89).

The highest notification rates were observed in infants under one year (186.5 cases per million) and children aged 1-4 years (119.7 cases per million).
