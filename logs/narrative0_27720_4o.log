**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the numbers are in. Will Jensen Huang be in the top 10 of the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.42%. Given the August data, his net worth was $112 billion, while Amancio Ortega held the 10th spot with $123 billion.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. With that gap, it was a steep climb. Even with NVIDIA's growth, it wasn't enough to propel him into the top 10.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models factored in market volatility and tech sector trends. They were spot-on, as always.

**NATE SILVER:** Another testament to the accuracy of superforecasting. Until next time, Philip.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, will Jensen Huang be in the top 10 of the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.45%. The gap was too wide by late August.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, Huang's net worth was substantial, but not enough to surpass Ortega's $123 billion.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Even with NVIDIA's growth, it was a steep climb. Our forecasts accounted for market fluctuations and competitor gains.

**NATE SILVER**  
And as always, the models were precise. 

*They both nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
It's fascinating how small shifts can alter these outcomes.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. It's why we trust the data.

Well, Philip, the Forbes list is out. Jensen Huang didn't make the top 10.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No surprise there. Our models had it at 15.75%.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. With the August numbers, his net worth was $112 billion. Amancio Ortega was holding strong at $123 billion.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The gap was too wide to close in just a month. Our models accounted for market fluctuations, but nothing drastic enough to push him up.

**NATE SILVER**  
Still, it's fascinating how the tech market's volatility can shift fortunes in an instant.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, sipping coffee.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Jensen Huang didn't make it to the top 10 after all.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.25%. With Ortega's net worth still holding strong, it was a tough climb for Huang.

**NATE SILVER:** True. Even with NVIDIA's growth, the gap was significant. We factored in market fluctuations, but Ortega's investments held steady.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models never fail. The probability was clear. Huang needed a significant surge, and it just didn't happen.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how these dynamics play out. Even the smallest market changes can have massive impacts.
