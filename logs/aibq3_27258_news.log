**Amazon's 30th Anniversary: The Story of Jeff Bezos' Rise to Success**
Amazon is celebrating its 30th anniversary today, July 5, 2024. Behind the giant is Jeff Bezos, a well-known figure who embodies the American myth of the small entrepreneur who started from scratch and is now one of the richest men in the world. The story begins in a garage in Seattle, where Bezos created Amazon in 1994. He shared a video on his Instagram account showing his early technical installations, a computer and a photocopier. Bezos, a passionate reader and computer scientist, left his job on Wall Street to start Amazon, which initially focused on creating the world's largest bookstore. The company's growth was rapid, and in 1997, Amazon went public. Since then, Bezos has sold over $27 billion worth of Amazon shares, making him one of the richest people in the world. Today, he is the second richest person on the planet, with a fortune estimated by Forbes to be $210 billion. He has also invested in various companies, including Google, Uber, and Airbnb, and has developed new projects such as a streaming service and a space tourism company, Blue Origin.

**Jeff Bezos Says It's 'Fine Being The Second Wealthiest Person In The World' - He Never Set Out To Be The 'Richest'**
Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in the world, has stated that he never aimed to be the richest person in the world. 'It was fine being the second wealthiest person in the world,' he said. Bezos emphasized that titles like 'inventor' or 'entrepreneur' held more significance to him than being the richest person. He also shared his approach to Amazon's stock price volatility, urging his team not to get too caught up in the fluctuations. Bezos quoted Warren Buffett, saying 'In the short run, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long run, it's a weighing machine.' He emphasized the importance of building a company that will be weighed favorably in the long term, rather than worrying about the daily stock price. Bezos also reflected on his broader impact through Amazon, stating that the company had created $840 billion in wealth for others. He also shared a lighthearted moment with Bill Gates, joking about the title of the world's richest man.

**Temu's Colin Huang and Amazon's Jeff Bezos: A Tale of Two Billionaires**
Colin Huang, the owner of Temu, has become the richest person in China, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a fortune of $48.6 billion. Huang's wealth comes from PDD Holdings, the parent company of Temu and the Chinese e-commerce app Pinduoduo. Temu, which was launched in the US in 2022, has gained a loyal customer base with its affordable products made and shipped from China. The company has since expanded to Europe and Latin America, and its business model is based on individual Chinese suppliers shipping directly to customers worldwide. Temu also invests heavily in social media marketing and offers frequent discounts and rewards to encourage customers to make more purchases. Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon, has regained his title as the world's richest person after surpassing Elon Musk, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos' net worth is now $200 billion, up from $177 billion in 2021. Amazon's stock has increased by 89% in the past 12 months and 18% in 2024, adding $23.4 billion to Bezos' fortune.

**Jeff Bezos! First Person To Amass $200 Billion**
Jeff Bezos has become the first person in the 21st century to amass a net worth of $200 billion, surpassing Bill Gates by $90 billion. According to reports, Amazon's stock price increase of 2% last Wednesday added $4.9 billion to his net worth. Bezos' fortune is the largest to have ever been tracked, with a record single-day jump of $13 billion in July 2020. However, it's worth noting that Bezos would have been even richer if he hadn't gone through the expensive divorce settlement with his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott, who took 25% of Amazon's stake worth $63 billion. Despite this, Bezos remains a prominent figure in the world of the rich.

Bezos lost $23 billion, bringing his net worth to $180.7 billion, according to Forbes. Other billionaires, such as Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Larry Ellison, also experienced declines in their wealth.

**Jeff Bezos is the biggest loser of the stock market crash**
Jeff Bezos, the 60-year-old founder and CEO of Amazon, suffered the largest loss among the world's richest people during the recent stock market crash. The value of Amazon's stock fell by 5%, resulting in an $8 billion loss for Bezos, according to Forbes' real-time wealth tracker. This loss brings Bezos' net worth to $172.1 billion, making him the second-richest living person after Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Bezos' wealth decreased by $38.3 billion in 2019 after his divorce from MacKenzie Scott. The decline in Amazon's stock value and Bezos' wealth was caused by a global stock market crash, which began with a 12% drop in the Japanese Nikkei 225 index, the worst day since the 1987 Black Monday crash. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by over 1,000 points (2.7%), the S&P 500 futures dropped by 3.6%, and the Nasdaq 100 futures lost 4.8%. The culprit behind the market crash was the weaker-than-expected US jobs report, which showed that employers created only 114,000 new jobs in July, far below the 175,000 expected by economists. As a result, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest level in three years. This data suggests a slowdown in the US economy and renewed concerns about a potential hard landing, rather than a soft landing, where the central bank lowers inflation without triggering a recession. Several other billionaire colleagues of Bezos also suffered temporary wealth losses, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who lost $7.9 billion, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who lost $7 billion, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who each lost $6 billion.

**World's billionaires see $134 billion swiped from their fortune overnight in share price bloodbath, led by Jeff Bezos**
The world's richest people, including Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk, saw their fortunes drop by at least $1 billion each on Friday due to the Nasdaq 100 Index's 2.4% fall. Tech billionaires lost a total of $68 billion, with Bezos losing nearly $16 billion after Amazon shares dropped by 9%. This is the third-worst wipeout for Bezos, who has been steadily offloading Amazon shares this year. The downturn is attributed to uncertainty over AI, Federal Reserve rate cuts, and a potential recession, as well as high-profile earnings disappointments from companies like Microsoft and Tesla. As one of the world's richest people, Bezos' net worth now stands at around $191 billion, down from $252 billion on July 31.

**World's billionaires see $134 billion wiped from their fortunes overnight in stock bloodbath**
The world's 500 richest people saw $134 billion wiped from their fortunes overnight due to a stock price bloodbath led by Amazon. The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 2.4% on Friday, dragging down the net worth of all 10 of the richest people in the world by at least $1 billion. Tech billionaires lost $68 billion from their collective fortunes, with Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, and Larry Page each losing over $3 billion. Elon Musk's net worth dropped from $252 billion to $235 billion, while Jeff Bezos saw nearly $16 billion wiped from his wealth after Amazon shares dropped by nearly 9%. Bezos has been steadily offloading Amazon shares this year, selling about $8.5 billion worth of stock in February and planning to sell 25 million additional shares worth $5 billion. The downturn was triggered by Amazon's announcement that it will invest heavily in AI, leading to concerns about AI gains being overhyped. Microsoft posted slowing growth in its Azure cloud-computing arm, and Tesla missed earnings estimates for the second quarter. A report from the Labor Department also indicated that the U.S. economy added around 61,000 fewer jobs last month than expected, with unemployment at 4.3%—the highest since October 2021.

**Jeff Bezos' Net Worth Drops by Over 21 Billion Dollars**
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has seen his net worth drop by over 21 billion dollars due to the company's continued investment in artificial intelligence at the expense of short-term profits. On August 2, 2024, Amazon's shares dropped by 13%, causing Bezos' net worth to drop to 185.3 billion dollars, according to Bloomberg's billionaire index. This loss makes Bezos the second-largest loser in the history of the index, after he lost 36 billion dollars in April 2019 following his divorce settlement. Bezos' net worth has fluctuated over the years, but he has consistently been one of the richest people in the world. In 2022, he lost his title as the richest person in the world, but he regained it in 2024, surpassing his rival Elon Musk. According to Bloomberg's billionaire index on March 6, 2024, Bezos' net worth was 197 billion dollars, a 20 billion dollar increase since the beginning of the year. This increase is largely due to his 12.7% stake in Amazon, which has continued to rise in value during this period. As of 2024, this stake is worth over 200 billion dollars. Bezos has a diverse investment portfolio beyond Amazon, including investments in technology companies such as Nextdoor and Uber. Between 2023 and 2024, Bezos' net worth increased by 70 billion dollars, not from work, but from building and selling successful companies or investing in other companies, according to a report by Inc.com. According to CNN Business, Bezos' net worth, which is around 204.8 billion dollars, decreased by 5.4 billion dollars in July 2024, due to a 4% drop in Amazon's stock price during that period. This decrease in Bezos' net worth caused him to drop to second place on the list of the world's richest people, behind Elon Musk, who had increased his net worth by 11.1 billion dollars since June 1, 2024, and 19 billion dollars in the past two months.

**Jeff Bezos' wealth drops by $21 billion as Amazon sinks on AI fears Live News Central**
Jeff Bezos' wealth dropped by $21 billion after Amazon's shares fell 13% due to concerns over the company's spending on artificial intelligence. Amazon's second-quarter revenue fell short of analysts' estimates, with strong cloud computing offset by weakness in its e-commerce business. Bezos, the world's second-richest person, has been selling Amazon shares this year, with total sales reaching $13.5 billion. He would still hold almost 912 million shares, or about 8.8% of Amazon, once those sales are complete. Bezos' wealth also comes from space-exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post. As of 12:33 p.m., technology billionaires saw $68 billion carved from their fortunes, according to Bloomberg's wealth index.

The Forbes list of the world's richest people has been updated in August 2024, with the majority of the top 5 individuals being from the United States. The list has been modified due to changes in global technological stocks. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, and Neuralink, remains at the top with a fortune of $240.7 billion.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has accumulated a fortune of $204.8 billion, while Arnault remains in 3rd place with an estimated $179.5 billion.

**Jeff Bezos' $200 Billion Fortune: A Challenge to Match**
Jeff Bezos, the second richest person in the world, has a net worth of $200.3 billion, according to Forbes. His wealth comes from Amazon, but also from successful companies like Blue Origin and real estate investments. Bezos receives dividends from Amazon, which has seen a 32% increase in stock value in the first months of 2024. His net worth has increased by $80 billion in 2023, from $114 billion to $194 billion. This means he earned $2.1 million per hour in 2023. If he were to spend $1 million per day, it would take him 548 years to spend his entire fortune. Bezos' wealth is so large that he could buy 200 Santiago Bernabéu stadiums. If he were to work 40 hours a week for 45 years, he would need to earn $2.14 million per hour to match his current net worth. 'It is difficult, but not impossible, to equal Bezos' fortune,' said the article, 'but it would require a systematic effort to earn $2.1 million per hour for 45 years.'

**Bernard Arnault Loses More Wealth Than Any Other Billionaire in 2024**
Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and CEO of LVMH, saw his net worth decline by more than any other person in 2024, according to the Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, as luxury goods demand continues to decrease. Arnault's fortune fell by 20 billion dollars to 187 billion dollars, surpassing the accumulated losses of China's richest man, Zhong Shanshan. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, suffered a larger one-day loss, but still increased his wealth by 5% this year. Despite the decline, Musk remains ahead of Jeff Bezos by 37 billion dollars. Arnault, 75, fell to third place after being the world's richest person last month, a position he held after the pandemic when global luxury goods demand surged. Zhong is at risk of losing his top spot in China due to intensified competition and public relations challenges at his bottled water giant, Nongfu Spring Co.

**Amazon Turns 30: A Journey from Online Bookstore to Global Giant**
Amazon is celebrating its 30th anniversary since its founding by Jeff Bezos in 1994. The company has changed the international trade and urban landscape, and has become one of the most valuable companies in the world, surpassing $2 trillion in market capitalization. Amazon started as an online bookstore, but has grown to sell a wide range of products, including food, clothing, and entertainment. The company has created millions of jobs, both directly and indirectly, and has been a pioneer in logistics and delivery. However, Amazon has also faced criticism for its impact on small businesses and the rise of a new type of worker, the 'riders' or delivery workers, who have been fighting for their rights. The company has resisted unionization efforts, but a warehouse in New York became the first in the country to form a union in 2022. Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, is now the second richest person in the world, with a net worth of $216.5 billion. He has also ventured into the media industry, buying the Washington Post in 2013, but the newspaper is struggling to stay afloat.

**Elon Musk Loses More Money Than Any Other Billionaire This Year**
According to Forbes, Elon Musk has lost more money this year than any other billionaire, despite being the richest person in the world. His net worth has decreased by over 10% since the end of 2023, from $251.3 billion to $221.4 billion. This decline is largely due to a judge's decision in January to strike down Musk's record compensation package for Tesla, which was valued at $51 billion. As a result, Forbes had to reduce the value of the stock allocation by 50%. Additionally, the value of Musk's existing 13% stake in Tesla decreased by about $20 billion due to the company's declining profits and auto deliveries. Despite these challenges, Musk remains the richest person in the world, ahead of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose net worth is approximately $214 billion.

Amazon is celebrating its 30th anniversary today, July 5, 2024.

Bezos, a passionate reader and computer scientist, left his job on Wall Street to start Amazon, which initially focused on creating the world's largest bookstore. The company's growth was rapid, and in 1997, Amazon went public. Since then, Bezos has sold over $27 billion worth of Amazon shares, making him one of the richest people in the world. Today, he is the second richest person on the planet, with a fortune estimated by Forbes to be $210 billion.

**The Top Tech Billionaires: Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk Lead the Pack**
According to Forbes and VisualCapitalist, Jeff Bezos remains the richest man in the world, with a net worth of $200.8 billion, surpassing Elon Musk by $6.8 billion. Bezos' fortune is due to his dominance in e-commerce through Amazon and his ventures in the aerospace industry with Blue Origin. Musk, known for his roles in Tesla and SpaceX, has a declared net worth of $194 billion, but a recent report shows Bezos slightly surpasses him. The rankings are based on recent updates on the finances of both entrepreneurs, with market fluctuations and stock valuations playing a crucial role. Bezos, who stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021, has continued to see his wealth grow due to his investments and the performance of Amazon's stock. Musk, on the other hand, has experienced changes in his fortune due to variations in the stock market and the valuation of Tesla, one of his main sources of income.

**Jeff Bezos Regains Second Spot as World's Richest Person**
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has returned to being the second richest person in the world, according to Forbes' real-time billionaire ranking. With an estimated net worth of $210.6 billion, Bezos surpassed Bernard Arnault, president and CEO of LVMH, who has a net worth of $195 billion and now ranks third. The high value of Amazon's stock, which has increased by 27% this year and 130% since the start of last year, has contributed to Bezos' increased wealth, according to Forbes. The company, led by CEO Andy Jassy, has just reported its most profitable quarter in history, with a net profit of $10.4 billion. Forbes also notes that Amazon's stock has benefited from investor interest in artificial intelligence. Elon Musk remains the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $220.6 billion.
