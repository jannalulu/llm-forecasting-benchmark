**Plug Power Shares: A Disaster for Investors**
The Plug Power share has been a disaster for investors who bought in 2020, with the value rising to almost 70 USD by the beginning of 2021, but currently trading at 1 USD. The company is not making a profit and is dependent on new capital increases or loans. Bankruptcy is not imminent, but the outlook is bleak. A technical chart analysis suggests that the value could slide towards 0.50 USD. A recent analysis from August 25 warns of an urgent need for action for Plug Power shareholders, questioning whether it is worth buying or selling the stock.

**Plug Power Stock: Is Bankruptcy Looming?**
Plug Power is facing financial difficulties, having made losses of around $700 million in 2023. The company's high cash burn rate and significant debt burden pose a risk, especially if losses continue. While Plug Power has managed to raise capital through stock sales and bond issuances, the question remains how long investors will believe in the company's future. Falling stock prices are a challenge, as a low stock price makes it harder to raise capital through stock sales. The chart also reflects declining investor confidence. Plug Power's stock is considered a classic loser stock in a long-term downtrend, and even a price target under $1 is currently possible.

**Plug Power Stock: Will Trump's Agenda 2025 Send the Value into Bankruptcy?**
The Plug Power stock has been highly speculative, as recent price fluctuations show. After a significant recovery of around 50% from early July to mid-July, the value fell sharply by the end of the week, with a loss of over 10% on the NASDAQ. The reason for this is actually positive, as the company announced a public offering of 78.7 million common shares at a price of $2.54 per share, raising approximately $200 million. The company plans to use this capital for general corporate purposes. However, the question remains as to how long this current capital will be sufficient to keep the business running. With estimated net losses of over $800 million in 2024 and around $400 million in 2025, and a loss of nearly $300 million in 2026, it is likely that Plug Power will need fresh capital at some point. Even a US government loan is being discussed, but with Donald Trump as US President, it could become more challenging for Plug Power. Trump's Agenda 2025 aims to reverse all progress in climate and environmental protection, which could negatively impact the company. The stock chart shows no signs of a fundamental or chart-based turnaround, and a trend reversal is only expected if medium- to long-term downward trend lines are broken. The recent volatile sideways movement is more likely to be a pause in the long-term downward trend. With the gap down from Friday, the chart situation has become more complicated. In the worst-case scenario, the stock could reach a price target of around $1 in the very long-term trend analysis. In the event of insolvency, this target would be significantly undershot.

**Plug Power Reports Revenue Increase, but Significant Net Loss in Q2 2024**
Plug Power Inc., a hydrogen solutions provider, reported a revenue increase to $143.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, driven by its electrolyzer deployments and improved fuel prices. Despite the revenue increase, the company incurred a significant net loss of $262.3 million in the same period, including non-monetary charges of $86 million. The losses were attributed to strategic investments and market dynamics. Plug Power also observed an improvement in hydrogen margins due to increased production capacity at its Georgia plant and strategic price increases. The company has taken advantage of the clean hydrogen production tax credit (PTC) for its Georgia liquid hydrogen plant to optimize financial results and shareholder value. In a strategic move, the company appointed Dean Fullerton as Director of Operations, who brings 14 years of experience from Amazon, including leading the company's hydrogen economy team. The company deployed over $70 million in electrolyzer systems in the second quarter and plans to deploy another 100 MW of electrolyzers before the end of the year. The company's joint venture with Olin Corporation in Louisiana is advancing the construction of a new hydrogen plant, with a planned startup in September 2024. Plug Power's revenue guidance for 2024 is between $825 and $925 million, reflecting expected revenue from its order book across various business segments. Additionally, the company has secured 7.5 gigawatts in global BEDP contracts, including a significant project in Australia. CEO Andy Marsh expressed confidence in the company's strategic initiatives and operational capabilities, emphasizing the importance of advancing the hydrogen economy.

Plug Power's 3-year revenue growth stands at 134.55% and EPS at 16.32%.
