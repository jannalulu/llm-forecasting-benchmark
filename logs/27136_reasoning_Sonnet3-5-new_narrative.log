Nate: *sipping coffee* "Looking at Kennedy's campaign trajectory, our models were remarkably precise."

Tetlock: "Indeed. With his substantial fundraising and nearly 10% polling numbers, most people thought he'd stay in until November. But our models had it at 12.5%."

Nate: "The key indicators were there. Despite raising $98 million and polling well for an independent, Kennedy's impact on the major party candidates wasn't what he'd hoped. Plus, the historical precedent of third-party candidates typically losing steam by fall..."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The pressure from both parties, combined with concerns about being a spoiler, made his position increasingly untenable. Our models factored in similar patterns from past independent runs like Anderson in '80 and Perot initially in '92."

Nate: "Sometimes the unlikely scenario is exactly what plays out."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Kennedy's still in the race. Our models had it at 12.45% that he'd suspend by now."

Tetlock: "Makes sense. With nearly $100 million raised and polling close to 10%, he's got unprecedented third-party momentum. The data suggested he'd stay in."

Nate: "The interesting part is how his numbers have held steady. Most independent candidates fade by summer's end."

Tetlock: "True. Our models factored in his unique position - a Kennedy running as an independent, strong fundraising, and consistent polling. The probability of him dropping out was always low."

Nate: "And with both Trump and Biden polling in the low 40s, Kennedy's playing kingmaker. He knows it too. That's why our models showed such a low probability of him suspending."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s campaign status."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given his strong polling at 9.5% and that impressive $98 million war chest, our models had it at 12.45% probability that he'd suspend before September 24th."

Nate: "The fundraising numbers were particularly telling. No third-party candidate has ever raised that much and then dropped out this close to the election. Plus, his base remains surprisingly loyal."

Tetlock: "And with Biden at 40% and Trump at 42%, Kennedy knows he could be kingmaker. The incentive to stay in is just too strong."

Nate: "Exactly. The only scenario our models saw for suspension was a major personal emergency, hence that 12.45% figure. Otherwise, he's in it for the long haul."
