**Is open source AI possible, let alone the future? Find out at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024**
At TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, Hugging Face's Irene Solaiman and AI2's Ali Farhadi will discuss the possibility of open source AI, a concept that some believe can break the proprietary software cycle that AI has fallen into. Solaiman, Hugging Face's head of global policy, and Farhadi, a leader at AI2, are proponents of openness and transparency in AI, but acknowledge the challenges of making open source AI a reality due to the resource requirements of AI models. The panel discussion will take place at Disrupt 2024 in San Francisco from October 28-30. 'It's certain to be an extremely interesting conversation,' said the moderator. 'What will it take to change the status quo and make open source AI a reality?'

**Meta Platforms Just Released an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Game-Changer -- And It Could Be Dangerous | The Motley Fool**
Meta has released its Llama 3.1 model, a frontier AI model with 405 billion parameters, which outperforms other models on many parameters. The model is open-source, allowing developers to modify and improve it. Mark Zuckerberg believes this will make Meta the world's most-used AI assistant by the end of the year, surpassing OpenAI. However, there are risks to open-source AI, including privacy and security concerns, which may lead to government scrutiny and regulation. Zuckerberg argues that these risks are outweighed by the benefits of open innovation, but the approach may still face challenges.

**Generative AI Digest: The debate over open-source vs. closed-source models**
The past month has seen a surge in new large language models from various companies, including OpenAI, Mistral AI, Google, Runway AI, and Meta. Meta's Llama 3.1, a 405 billion-parameter open-source model, has drawn significant attention for its performance comparable to leading closed-source models. However, none of these models are truly open-source, as they require separate licenses for commercial use. The debate between open-source and closed-source models has been influenced by the dominance of leading frontier models, but the release of Llama 3.1 has narrowed the gap, providing organizations with more control over their models. Other notable product and funding announcements include OpenAI's acquisition of Multi Software, Cohere's $500 million series D funding, and Harvey's $100 million funding for its AI-powered legal assistant platform.

**California AI bill SB 1047 aims to prevent AI disasters, but Silicon Valley warns it will cause one | TechCrunch**
California's SB 1047 bill aims to prevent AI disasters by implementing safeguards for large AI models. The bill requires developers to implement safety protocols, including an 'emergency stop' button, and to hire third-party auditors annually to assess their AI safety practices. The bill also establishes a new agency, the Frontier Model Division (FMD), to oversee the rules. Silicon Valley players, including venture capitalists, big tech trade groups, researchers, and startup founders, have opposed the bill, citing concerns about its arbitrary thresholds, chilling effect on the AI ecosystem, and potential harm to open source models. However, AI researchers and safety advocates, such as Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, have supported the bill, citing the need to mitigate the risk of extinction from AI. The bill is expected to pass the California Senate and will be sent to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk for signature.

**GPT-5: The Next Frontier in the AI Arms Race**
The tech world is eagerly awaiting the release of GPT-5, the next iteration of OpenAI's groundbreaking language model. According to Hamish Low of Enders Analysis, 'If OpenAI can deliver technology that matches its ambitious vision for what AI can be, it will be transformative for its own prospects, but also the economy more broadly.' However, the stakes are high, and OpenAI must continue to push the boundaries of AI to justify its investment and maintain its leadership position. The company faces a daunting challenge in delivering a superior product while addressing growing concerns about AI's impact on society, such as bias, misinformation, and job displacement. The outcome of GPT-5's release will shape the future of AI for years to come.
