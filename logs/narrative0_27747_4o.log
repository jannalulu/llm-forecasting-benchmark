*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a small table, coffee cups steaming.*

**NATE:** So, did Hikaru Nakamura clinch the Speed Chess Championship 2024?

**PHILIP:** No, our models had it at 45.32%. Given Carlsen's track record and Niemann's recent form, Nakamura was always facing an uphill battle.

**NATE:** True, Carlsen's blitz rating was a formidable barrier. But Nakamura's history of beating him in 2022 made it a close call.

**PHILIP:** And let's not forget Firouzja's rise. His youth and skill injected unpredictability into the mix.

**NATE:** Indeed, chess is as much about strategy as it is about momentum. Our models never doubted that.

**PHILIP:** Well, the numbers don't lie. Nakamura put up a good fight, but probabilities favored otherwise.

*They sip their coffee, contemplating the unpredictable dance of chess and chance.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 54.25%. Nakamura's history of dominance and his psychological edge over Carlsen were significant factors.
