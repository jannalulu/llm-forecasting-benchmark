To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by analyzing the available evidence and then consider key factors that could influence the outcome.

1. Recent polling data:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with support ranging from 24-27%. This is significantly below the 32% threshold we're asked about.

2. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD received 23.5% of the vote. While they've gained support since then, they haven't reached 32% in actual election results.

3. Trends:
The AfD's polling numbers have increased since 2019, but appear to have plateaued or slightly decreased in recent months. They reached a peak of around 32% in late 2023/early 2024 polls, but have since declined to the 24-27% range.

4. Comparison to other recent state elections:
In the September 2024 Thuringia and Saxony elections, AfD received over 30% of the vote. This suggests potential for higher performance than current polls indicate.

5. Factors that could increase AfD support:
- Immigration remains a top concern for voters
- Dissatisfaction with current government/establishment parties
- Potential for shy AfD voters not captured in polls

6. Factors that could limit AfD support:
- Classification as right-wing extremist suspect case by state authorities
- Potential for strategic voting against AfD by supporters of other parties
- Improved position of SPD in recent polls, potentially drawing some protest voters

7. Uncertainty factors:
- Over two weeks remain until the election, allowing for shifts in public opinion
- Potential impact of last-minute campaigning or events
- Accuracy of polling (polls underestimated AfD support in some recent elections)

Weighing these factors, I assess that while AfD has a chance to outperform current polling, reaching 32% would require a significant surge beyond what current evidence suggests is likely. However, given recent state election results and past polling volatility, I can't completely rule out the possibility.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 31.00%, with 28.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the available polling data and recent trends, then consider other relevant factors:

1. Recent polls:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with:
- 27% (Infratest dimap, Sept 12)
- 27% (Infratest dimap, Sept 5)
- 24% (INSA, August)

2. Historical performance:
- In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD received 23.5% of the vote
- AfD's support peaked at around 32% in late 2023/early 2024 polls, but has since declined

3. Factors potentially increasing AfD support:
- Immigration is the top concern for 40% of Brandenburg voters
- AfD has performed well in recent elections in Thuringia and Saxony (over 30%)
- General dissatisfaction with established parties

4. Factors potentially limiting AfD support:
- 61% of voters are against AfD participating in government
- AfD is classified as a suspected right-wing extremist organization by state authorities
- Other parties have ruled out coalitions with AfD

5. Time remaining:
There are only 10 days left until the election, limiting potential for major shifts.

Considering these factors, it seems unlikely that AfD will exceed 32% of the vote. Their support has stabilized around 27% in recent polls, well below the 32% threshold. While there's potential for some last-minute movement, a 5 percentage point increase in 10 days would be a significant and unusual shift.

However, there is some uncertainty. AfD has outperformed polls in recent elections, and immigration concerns could drive last-minute support. The "shy voter" effect could also mean polls are underestimating AfD support.

Balancing these considerations, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 30.50%, with 28.00% being the most likely. Probability: 8.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the available evidence and consider key factors:

1. Recent polling data:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with 27% support. This is the highest level among recent polls, but still well below the 32% threshold.

2. Trend over time:
The AfD's polling numbers have increased slightly over the past few months, from around 24-25% to 27%. However, this trend appears to be leveling off rather than continuing to climb rapidly.

3. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD received 23.5% of the vote. While they've gained support since then, a jump to over 32% would be a massive increase.

4. Comparison to other recent state elections:
In the September 2024 Thuringia and Saxony elections, AfD received just over 30% in both cases. This suggests 30-31% may be close to their current ceiling of support.

5. Political climate:
Immigration and economic concerns appear to be boosting AfD support. However, their classification as a right-wing extremist group by state authorities may limit their ability to attract more moderate voters.

6. Time until election:
With only 10 days until the election, there is limited time for major shifts in voter sentiment.

7. Polling error:
Polls have sometimes underestimated AfD support, but rarely by more than 2-3 percentage points.

Weighing these factors, I assess that AfD is very unlikely to exceed 32% of the vote. Their current polling average of 27% would require a 5 percentage point increase, which is possible but improbable given the short timeframe and apparent stabilization of their support. Even accounting for potential polling error, it seems unlikely they would exceed 30-31%.

However, given the volatility of politics and potential for unexpected events, I can't completely rule out the possibility. I assess there is a small but non-zero chance AfD could surge to just over 32%.

My Prediction: Between 2.00% and 15.00%, with 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.

1. Recent polling data:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with 27% support. Multiple polls consistently show AfD in the 23-27% range.

In September 2024 elections in Thuringia and Saxony, AfD received over 30% but did not exceed 32%.

5. Factors that could increase AfD support:
- Immigration remains a top concern for voters
- Dissatisfaction with current government

6. Factors that could limit AfD support:

- Increased mobilization of other parties against AfD
- Potential "ceiling" on far-right support

7. Time remaining until election:

8. Uncertainty factors:

Weighing these factors, I assess that AfD is likely to perform strongly but reaching over 32% appears unlikely based on current evidence. The most recent polls show them well below this threshold, and while there's potential for movement, a 5+ percentage point increase in 10 days would be unusual.

8. Expert forecasts:
I didn't find any specific forecasts for AfD's vote share, but analyses suggest they are unlikely to reach a level that would give them blocking power in parliament (which 32% likely would).

Weighing these factors, I assess it's unlikely but not impossible for AfD to exceed 32%. The polls would need to significantly underestimate their support or there would need to be a major last-minute shift in voter preferences. However, the consistent polling around 27% and limited time before the election make this improbable.

My Prediction: Between 3.00% and 15.00%, with 7.00% being the most likely. Probability: 7.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the available evidence and consider key factors:

1. Recent polling data:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with 27% support. This is significantly below the 32% threshold in the question.

2. Polling trends:
The AfD's support has increased slightly in recent months, from around 24% earlier in the year to 27% now. However, this trend doesn't suggest it will reach 32% by the election.

3. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg election, AfD received 23.5% of the vote. Reaching 32% would be a major increase from that baseline.

4. Comparison to other state elections:
In recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony, AfD received over 30% of the vote. This suggests 32% is possible, but Brandenburg has historically had lower AfD support.

5. Current political climate:
Immigration and economic concerns are boosting AfD support, but other parties are actively campaigning against them.

6. Time until election:
With only 10 days until the election, major shifts in voting intentions are less likely.

7. Potential for polling error:
Polls have underestimated AfD support in some past elections, but by smaller margins than the 5 percentage point gap here.

8. Expert forecasts:
I didn't find any specific forecasts for AfD's vote share, but analyses suggest they are unlikely to reach a level that would give them blocking power in parliament (which 32% likely would).
