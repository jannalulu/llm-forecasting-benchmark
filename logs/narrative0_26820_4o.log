**NATE SILVER**  
So, did Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hit the 15 million follower mark?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 12.34%. Given the trends, it was a long shot.

**NATE SILVER**  
Makes sense. TikTok's popularity among younger voters didn't translate into a massive following for him.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Trump's and Harris' rapid growth showed the platform's potential, but Kennedy's niche appeal wasn't enough.

**NATE SILVER**  
Plus, the competition from other candidates was fierce. Even with TikTok's billion users, capturing that audience isn't guaranteed.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. It's a reminder that social media influence doesn't always equate to political success.

*They nod in agreement, understanding the complex dance between politics and social media.*

Well, Philip, the numbers are in. Will Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have more than 15 million TikTok followers on September 30, 2024? 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 12.34%. Despite TikTok's explosive growth, Kennedy's account didn't reach the viral threshold.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. With Trump and Harris also in the TikTok arena, Kennedy's reach was overshadowed. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Our models accounted for the platform's demographics and political dynamics. It was always a long shot.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the surge in political engagement on TikTok didn't translate to Kennedy's follower count as expected.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 23.45%. His growth was steady but not explosive enough. As of yesterday, he had around 4.8 million followers.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. TikTok's influence is undeniable, but it seems only Trump came close with his 12.5 million followers. Harris is still trailing far behind.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. The platform's reach among younger voters is significant, but Kennedy's content didn't resonate enough to skyrocket his numbers.
