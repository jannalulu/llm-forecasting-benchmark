Let me analyze this systematically:

Resolution Criteria Review:
- Must be direct optical observation 
- Planet must have radius larger than Earth
- Orbital period > 5,000 years
- Discovery must occur before September 30, 2024

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Scientific Consensus
- Multiple articles indicate scientists believe discovery is imminent
- Vera C. Rubin Observatory launching in 2025 specifically to search for Planet Nine
- Mike Brown (Caltech astronomer who proposed Planet Nine) consistently argues strong theoretical evidence exists

2. Timing Constraints
- Current date: July 29, 2024
- Less than two months remain before September 30 deadline
- Extremely tight timeframe for optical confirmation

3. Technological Readiness
- Advanced telescopes being prepared
- Computational models suggesting high probability of existence
- But no confirmed visual observation yet

4. Probabilistic Considerations
- Astronomers estimate ~7% chance of Planet Nine's existence
- Complex detection challenges in outer solar system
- Multiple research teams actively searching

Balancing Factors:
- Strong theoretical motivation (+)
- Advanced technological capabilities (+)
- Extremely short remaining timeframe (-)
- Historically difficult astronomical detection (-)

Calibration:
- Base rate for major planetary discoveries: Very low
- Comparable historical discoveries: Rare, often taking decades

Forecast Reasoning:
The extremely short remaining timeline dramatically reduces discovery probability. While strong theoretical groundwork exists, optical confirmation requires extraordinary precision.

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 12.75%, but 7.25% being the most likely. Probability: 7.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this forecast systematically:

Key Resolution Criteria:
- Direct optical observation 
- Planet radius larger than Earth's
- Orbital period > 5,000 years
- Deadline: September 30, 2024

Evidence Supporting Discovery:
1. Multiple recent articles (June 2024) indicate scientists are very close to discovery
2. Vera C. Rubin Observatory launching in 2025 specifically to search for Planet Nine
3. Multiple astronomers (Mike Brown, Konstantin Batygin) have strong mathematical evidence suggesting the planet exists
4. Scientific confidence seems high that the planet will be found

Evidence Against Near-Term Discovery:
1. Despite years of searching, no direct observation yet
2. Extremely distant location (400-550 astronomical units)
3. Challenging to detect against background of other celestial objects
4. Andreas Hein suggests it might take a decade or more to find

Bayesian Reasoning:
- Base rate for major planetary discoveries is low
- Technological capabilities improving
- Strong theoretical groundwork exists

Calibration Adjustment:
- Recent articles suggest imminent discovery
- But scientific discoveries are inherently unpredictable

Probability Calculation:
- Low probability of discovery before September 30, 2024
- But not zero given recent scientific momentum

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 12.75%, but 7.25% being the most likely. Probability: 7.25%.
