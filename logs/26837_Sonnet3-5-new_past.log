Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Status:
- "Woman's World" debuted at #63 on the Billboard Hot 100
- The song has already fallen off the chart entirely
- Perry is already moving on to her next single "Lifetimes" (August 9 release)

2. Historical Context:
- Perry's recent singles have underperformed compared to her peak years
- Her last Hot 100 hit was in 2020 with "Daisies" (peaked at #40)
- Her last top 15 hit was "Chained to the Rhythm" in 2017 (peaked at #4)

3. Current Performance Indicators:
- Poor streaming numbers (No. 110 on US Spotify)
- Falling radio airplay
- Negative critical reception
- Team already pivoting to next single

4. Time Constraint:
- Deadline is October 1, 2024
- Only about 2 months left
- Team already abandoning promotion for this song

5. Negative Factors:
- Song has already peaked and fallen off charts
- Focus shifting to new single "Lifetimes"
- Poor streaming and radio performance
- Negative reception from critics and fans
- Label seems to have given up on the song

6. Historical Precedent:
- Songs that fall off the Hot 100 rarely return
- Even more rarely do they achieve new peaks significantly higher than their debut
- Almost never do they jump from outside chart to top 15

Given the song has already peaked at #63 and fallen off the chart, combined with the team moving on to a new single and the poor performance metrics across streaming and radio, the probability of it reaching the top 15 is extremely low. The historical precedent of songs achieving such a dramatic comeback after falling off the chart is virtually non-existent.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.25% being the most likely. Probability: 0.25%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Status:
- "Woman's World" debuted at #63 on the Billboard Hot 100
- Has since fallen off the chart completely
- Song is no longer being promoted heavily by Perry and her team

2. Historical Context:
- Perry's recent singles have struggled to reach high positions
- Last solo Hot 100 hit was "Daisies" in 2020 (peaked at #40)
- Last top 15 hit was "Never Really Over" (peaked at #15)

3. Current Momentum:
- Perry is already moving on to a new single "Lifetimes" on August 9
- The song has received poor critical reception
- Streaming numbers are weak (No. 110 on US Spotify)
- Radio airplay is declining on Pop and Adult Pop formats

4. Time Constraint:
- We have until October 1, 2024 (approximately 2 months)
- Songs that fall off the Hot 100 rarely return to achieve their peak position
- Even more rarely do they jump significantly higher than their initial peak

5. Factors Against:
- Team has essentially abandoned promotion
- Moving to new single indicates lack of confidence
- Poor streaming and radio performance
- Critical reception has been negative
- Already peaked and fallen off charts

6. Factors For:
- Perry has historically been a successful artist
- Album release on September 20 could provide boost
- Possible viral moment or remix could emerge

Given all these factors, especially that the song has already peaked and fallen off the charts, and the team is moving on to a new single, the probability of reaching higher than #15 is extremely low.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.50%, with 0.25% being the most likely. Probability: 0.25%
