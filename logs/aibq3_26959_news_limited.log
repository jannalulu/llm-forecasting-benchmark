**IEA Holds Presidential Debates In October**
The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) has announced plans to host presidential and vice-presidential debates in October 2024, ahead of the 7th December general elections. According to Justice Sophia Akuffo, a distinguished fellow of the IEA, the debates aim to provide voters with a clearer understanding of each candidate's policies and offer a platform for candidates to be evaluated. The IEA has initiated discussions with various political parties to ensure their participation in the debates. The precise dates, times, and venues will be announced after consulting with candidates and their political parties. This move comes after the National Democratic Congress (NDC) criticized the IEA for lack of engagement in preparing for the elections, but the IEA's initiative is seen as a crucial step in promoting transparency and accountability in the electoral process.

**2024 United States Presidential Election: Key Dates and Information**
The 2024 United States presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The election will decide the next President and Vice President of the United States. Before the election, there will be several key events, including the Democratic National Convention (August 19-22) and the presidential debates (September-October). The debates were initially scheduled for September 10, but Donald Trump has changed the date and location. Kamala Harris has stated that she will attend the debate on September 10, as previously agreed upon with Joe Biden. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, where 538 electors will choose the next President. The system is indirect voting, where people vote for electors who will then choose the President. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win. The final results will be confirmed in December, when the electors meet in their states, and the votes will be counted in Congress in January 2025. The inauguration of the new President will take place on January 20, 2025.

**Will Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate before Election Day?**
The 2024 presidential debate schedule remains uncertain due to disagreements between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump had agreed to debate President Biden on Sept. 10, but after Biden withdrew, Trump pulled out of the ABC News debate, citing a defamation lawsuit against the network. Trump instead accepted a Fox News counterproposal for a Sept. 4 debate. Harris has publicly pressured Trump to meet her on stage for the ABC News debate, but it's unclear if they will face off in a formal debate. The Commission on Presidential Debates has planned traditional debates for September and October, but both Biden and Trump balked at letting the commission take charge this year. Instead, they agreed to their own rules and have two debates directly hosted by television networks: one by CNN and one by ABC News. The CNN debate occurred earlier this summer, and Harris is expected to soon announce her vice presidential candidate, who might face off against Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance in a debate.

**IEA to hold presidential debates in October and November**
The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) plans to hold presidential and vice-presidential debates in October and November 2024. According to IEA fellow Justice Sophia Akuffo, the debates will provide voters with a better understanding of each candidate's policies and serve as a platform for assessment. Justice Akuffo stated, 'The IEA plans to hold the meetings in September and the debates in October and November. We will announce the specific dates, times, and venues after engaging with candidates and their political parties.' The New Patriotic Party's Flagbearer, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, has invited the National Democratic Congress' Flagbearer, John Dramani Mahama, to a debate on the economy, but the NDC has rejected the invitation, claiming that the NPP leader is attempting to revive his political career. The IEA encourages everyone to stay updated on their website at www.ieagh.org.

**Kamala Harris Secures Democratic Nomination for US Presidential Election**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has officially secured the Democratic Party's nomination for the upcoming presidential election, and will face off against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Harris is expected to announce her running mate for the vice presidency later today in Philadelphia. While her choice remains unclear, it is anticipated to be one of the following: Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, or Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Trump had previously proposed a debate against Harris on Fox News on September 4, but Harris' campaign responded that Trump was 'trying to back out of a debate that was originally scheduled on ABC News on the same date.' Trump and former presidential candidate Joe Biden had agreed to a second debate on October 10 through ABC News, but Trump proposed it be held on Fox News instead, which is the most popular channel among his supporters. Meanwhile, questions are being raised about Harris' ability to defeat Trump in the presidential election, with the British Financial Times stating that Harris is 'a much stronger candidate than Biden, but will still lose the election in any case.'

**US Elections 2024: Donald Trump agrees to Fox News debate with Kamala Harris on September 4 says, 'I look forward to...' | Today News**
Donald Trump has agreed to debate Vice President Kamala Harris on Fox News on September 4, according to a post on his Truth Social platform. Trump wrote, 'I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th.' It is not clear if Harris has agreed to the debate. This will be the first debate between the two candidates, after Trump's White House bid was turned upside down when President Joe Biden backed Harris as the Democratic nominee. Harris previously dared Trump to debate her face-to-face, saying, 'Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.' Trump said the debate will be held in Pennsylvania, moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, and will have 'spectators' with similar rules to the June 27 CNN debate. Trump added, 'I look forward to meeting and debating Kamala Harris on September 4th,' saying the date is 'convenient and appropriate' as it comes just before the September 6 start of early voting for the presidential election.

**When would a Vance-Shapiro debate happen? What history suggests**
JD Vance, Donald Trump's potential vice presidential nominee, previously declined to debate Kamala Harris. Now, Harris is preparing to debate Trump and Vance is waiting to see who the new VP nominee will be. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is a top contender for Harris' running mate, which could lead to a debate between Shapiro and Vance in October. The Democratic National Convention will take place in August, and debate dates have not been set. However, based on past vice presidential debates, a debate between Shapiro and Vance could occur in early October.

**Biden and Trump will meet for a debate this week. When are presidential debates typically held?**
The debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, hosted by CNN on June 27, will be the first of the 2024 election cycle and the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history. Typically, presidential debates are held in September or October, but this year's debate is scheduled earlier due to the candidates' quick wrapping up of their party's nominations and the decision to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The campaigns agreed to hold earlier debates to allow candidates to face the American people before voters go to the polls. In past elections, the first debate would take place after some states started sending out mail-in ballots, but this year's debate will take place before that. By agreeing to the earlier schedule, Biden and Trump seem to want to ensure that every voter is well-informed before submitting a ballot.
