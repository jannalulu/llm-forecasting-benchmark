To forecast whether OpenAI will publish information describing Q* by September 30, 2024, it is necessary to analyze various aspects:

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: Historically, large AI research companies like OpenAI often release some documentation or details about cutting-edge research projects, particularly when there is significant curiosity, competitive pressure, or speculative interest. However, the actual release of those details tends to be highly uneven in timing and completeness.

2. **Recent Developments and Company Behavior**: OpenAI has been involved in collaborations and public releases, as seen with GPT models. However, two recent articles highlight a security breach in 2023 that OpenAI chose not to disclose publicly. This withholding of information is an indicator that if there are any security, competition, or strategic reasons not to release information about Q*, OpenAI might choose not to do so.

3. **Specific Developments on Q***: There are references in the articles about Q* being a rumored project, potentially capable of significant mathematical problem-solving, thereby sparking interest but there has been no official acknowledgment or detailed description yet. As described, at least two articles explicitly reference insiders considering Q* a breakthrough—implying there might be internal acknowledgment and possibly development focused on refining it before any public disclosure.

4. **External Competitive and Legal Pressures**: OpenAI is collaborating with major partners like Microsoft and Apple. The technology landscape often pushes companies to disclose advancements to maintain market positioning and comply with partner collaboration agreements. However, OpenAI also faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny pushing for caution if there are potential misuses or risks with Q*.

5. **Market Dynamics and Predictions**: There are no specific predictions from Polymarket or Metaculus on this precise question. Observing similar predictive markets might indicate trends—like anticipated release timings for new AI capabilities—that can be extrapolated to OpenAI.

6. **Evaluation of Clashing Forces**: The desire for OpenAI to demonstrate technological leadership by showcasing Q* competes against the risks posed by potential security threats, competitive disadvantages, and regulatory hurdles.

7. **Potential Timing**: The chance of a partial reveal or leak initially followed by acknowledgment is quite significant given the external interest and internal momentum. Yet, this is undermined by the risk-mitigating strategy often opted by companies faced with regulatory pressures or internal challenges.

Balancing all these factors, OpenAI is incentivized yet constrained to discuss Q*. The probability of a detailed official acknowledgment and publication directly stating Q* is expected to be moderate given present uncertainties.

Due to the combination of factors, my prediction is: 

"My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%."

2. **Security Concerns and Internal Challenges**: OpenAI has faced security breaches which might make them more cautious with sensitive developments like Q*. Additionally, internal challenges, such as the dissolution of the Superalignment team, may impact the timing or decision to publish.
3. **Examples from Competitors**: Insight from partnerships, like OpenAI's work with Apple on Siri, suggests a collaborative and strategic communication approach. Not disclosing certain technologies could be due to strategically partnering intelligence with important tech stakeholders.
4. **External Pressure and Standards**: There is some expectation from government entities to ensure transparency and security in AI developments, yet no direct pressure for a specific disclosure timeline was noted.

**Distinctive Features:**
1. **The Technological Leap**: If Q* represents a significant leap toward AGI, OpenAI might time the disclosure to strategically boost their market position or respond to competitive pressures more effectively.
2. **Operational Considerations**: Any delays in such a significant development's disclosure could result from operational adjustments or security strategy shifts, given the reported hacking incidents.

**Conclusively:**
The eventual prediction hinges on balancing OpenAI's historical patterns of disclosure, strategic motivations, industry pressure, internal and external factors, and competitive dynamics in AI development.

Given these considerations, there is a reasonable chance that OpenAI may publish something substantial about Q* by the deadline, yet the prediction must account for uncertainties regarding when all resolution criteria might be met or if strategic decisions might lead to withholding information.

**My Prediction**: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.
