**Trump Refuses to Debate Harris Until She's Officially Nominated**
Donald Trump's presidential campaign announced that he will not participate in a debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris until she is officially nominated by her party. Trump's campaign spokesperson, Stephen Chong, stated that 'it would be unfair to schedule a debate with Harris before the Democrats have officially chosen their nominee'. Chong also mentioned that 'there is a strong feeling among many Democratic Party members, including Barack Obama, that Harris is a Marxist who cannot defeat Trump, and they are waiting for a better candidate'. Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, responded by saying she is 'ready' to debate Trump. Trump's campaign has not committed to a specific date for the debate, but has suggested that there will be multiple debates. Fox News has proposed a debate on September 17 in Pennsylvania, which would be moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.

Former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump has stated that he would debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, but only after his official nomination.

The Democratic National Convention, to be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22, will be a crucial moment in defining the candidacy.

**Trump's Team Backs Out of Debate with Kamala Harris, Citing 'Chaos' Around Biden's Decision**
Donald Trump's team has backed out of a debate with Kamala Harris, citing 'chaos' surrounding Joe Biden's decision to step down as the Democratic nominee. Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, stated that the details of the debate cannot be finalized until the Democrats formally decide on their nominee. The statement also mentioned that many Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, believe Harris cannot defeat Trump and are still waiting for a better candidate. Obama endorsed Harris' candidacy on Friday. This move comes after Harris committed to the ABC News debate, saying that voters deserve to see the candidates on stage. Trump's campaign released a statement saying that the debate should be moved to Fox News, which is more aligned with the Republican Party. Trump suggested that the debate be held on September 17. Trump's advisors, including Jason Miller, have also rejected the idea of a single debate, suggesting that there should be multiple debates instead.

**Trump Refuses to Debate Harris Before She is Officially Nominated**
Trump's campaign has refused to schedule a debate with Harris before she is officially nominated by the Democratic Party. The campaign's spokesperson, Stephen Chong, stated that it is 'not suitable' to schedule a debate until the Democrats have officially chosen their candidate. Chong also mentioned that the 'continued political chaos' caused by Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of his vice president, Kamala Harris, makes it 'not suitable' to schedule a debate. Additionally, some Democratic Party members, including Barack Obama, have expressed strong feelings that Kamala Harris is a Marxist who cannot defeat Trump, and are waiting for a better candidate. On Sunday, President Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election and expressed his full support and endorsement for his vice president, Kamala Harris, to become the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. Harris has promised to win the Democratic Party's nomination and defeat Trump in the November 5, 2024 election.

**Democratic Committee Considers Nominating Biden for 2024 Presidential Election**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the 2024 presidential election by mid-July, following a major controversy after his debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, the decision aims to put an end to the widespread discussions within the party about replacing Biden after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter said that the likely date for Biden's official nomination is July 21. The Democrats had already planned to nominate Biden (81 years old) before the party's August convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set a final deadline of August 7 for selecting presidential candidates. Many major American media outlets have begun openly pressuring President Biden to withdraw from the election and leave the way open for a new Democratic nominee who can challenge Trump, who seems to have scored many points in the first presidential debate. The report stated that the Democratic National Committee has denied that the official nomination of Biden is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is Ohio's decision. The debate has sparked concern among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, four months before the election and about six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic members have ruled out replacing Biden and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election, and to mobilize Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.

**Watch live as Trump arrives in Atlanta ahead of first presidential debate against Biden**
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will face off in the first 2024 presidential debate on Thursday night in Atlanta.

The two candidates, both 78 and 81 years old, will be under pressure to display their command of issues and avoid verbal stumbles. Trump, who still faces criminal cases, will need to convince undecided voters that he does not pose a threat to democracy, while Biden will need to deliver a forceful performance after months of Republican assertions that his faculties have dulled with age.
