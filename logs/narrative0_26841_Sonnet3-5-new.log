Tetlock: [looking at financial data] "Well, Nate, our models were spot on again about Spirit Airlines."

Silver: "Yes, our forecast gave it a 72.4% probability of filing for bankruptcy before October 1st. The combination of their failed JetBlue merger, persistent operating losses, and deteriorating cash position made it almost inevitable."

Tetlock: "The Q2 2024 results were particularly telling. When we saw their revenue decline accelerating and cash reserves depleting faster than expected, our models adjusted sharply upward from the initial 45% probability in early 2024."

Silver: "And once the antitrust regulators blocked the JetBlue deal, that was essentially the final nail. Without that lifeline and facing massive debt payments, bankruptcy protection was their only viable option."

Tetlock: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach to forecasting corporate distress."

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about Spirit Airlines."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 78.45%. The combination of their failed JetBlue merger, persistent operating losses, and deteriorating cash position made bankruptcy almost inevitable."

Nate: "The Q2 2024 results were particularly telling. When they reported negative cash flows and declining revenues, our models spiked from 65% to over 75%."

Philip: "What's remarkable is how the market underestimated the impact of the DOJ blocking the JetBlue deal. That was their last real lifeline."

Nate: "Indeed. Their filing yesterday wasn't surprising to us. The ultra-low-cost carrier model just couldn't survive post-pandemic cost structures without significant restructuring."

Philip: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach. The signs were there in the data months ago."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 78.45%. The combination of their failed JetBlue merger, persistent operating losses, and deteriorating cash position made bankruptcy almost inevitable. The Q2 2024 results were particularly telling."

Nate: "The rejection of the JetBlue deal was really the final nail. Without that lifeline and facing mounting debt payments, they had no choice but to file Chapter 11."

Philip: "What's remarkable is how clearly the signals were there. The declining revenue per seat mile, the fuel cost pressures, and their inability to raise ticket prices in their ultra-low-cost market segment. Our models picked up on all these distress signals."

Nate: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach. The market was hoping for a miracle, but the numbers told the real story."

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were right again about Spirit Airlines. No bankruptcy filing before October 1st."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 32.45%. The antitrust rejection of the JetBlue merger was concerning, but Spirit's aggressive cost-cutting measures and fleet optimization bought them more time."

Nate: "The Q2 2024 numbers were brutal, but their liquidity position wasn't as dire as the market feared. The refinancing of their aircraft leases helped."

Philip: "Interesting how the market overestimated the bankruptcy risk. While they're still struggling, our models showed they had just enough runway to explore strategic alternatives."

Nate: "Though if we'd had data beyond August 2nd, I wonder if that percentage would've shifted. Their situation remains precarious, but they survived this deadline."

Tetlock: "Well, Nate, Spirit Airlines managed to avoid bankruptcy before the October deadline. Our models were solid on this one."

Silver: "Yes, our models had it at 32.45%. Despite their financial struggles and the failed JetBlue merger, they found alternative financing options. The probability was never zero, but it wasn't high enough to suggest imminent bankruptcy."

Tetlock: "The Q2 2024 results were concerning, but what's interesting is how they managed to restructure their debt obligations without filing Chapter 11. The rejected JetBlue merger actually created some unexpected opportunities with other investors."

Silver: "Exactly. While their fundamentals were weak, our models captured the crucial difference between a struggling airline and one on the brink of bankruptcy. There was always that buffer zone of options before hitting the bankruptcy trigger."
