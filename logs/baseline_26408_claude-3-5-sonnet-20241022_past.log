Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Time Frame: We're looking at any increases between now (July 23, 2024) and September 30, 2024 - a relatively short period of about 2 months.

2. Recent History:
- Turkey has been experiencing high inflation
- The minimum wage was already increased by 49% to 17,002 Turkish lira in January 2024
- Turkey typically adjusts minimum wage once or twice per year, with main adjustments usually happening in January/July

3. Key Factors:
- We're past the usual July adjustment window
- The period in question is very short (2 months)
- Turkey's inflation remains high but a recent adjustment was already made
- Historically, additional mid-year adjustments are rare outside the standard periods

4. Constraints:
- The very short timeframe makes an additional increase less likely
- Being past the typical July adjustment window reduces likelihood
- However, high inflation could create pressure for an emergency adjustment

Given these factors, I assess the probability as relatively low but not negligible due to Turkey's economic volatility and inflation pressures.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.40%, with 20.30% being the most likely. Probability: 20.30%.
