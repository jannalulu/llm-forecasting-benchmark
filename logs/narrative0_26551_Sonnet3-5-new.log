Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again regarding Revolut's UK banking license situation."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking at the data we had until July 24th, our models gave it a 35.75% chance. The persistent AML concerns and regulatory scrutiny were significant barriers, despite their share class consolidation."

Silver: "The signs were there. Their e-money institution status wasn't enough to overcome the regulatory hurdles. Even with 6 million UK users and their EEA banking license, the FCA's stringent requirements proved too challenging."

Tetlock: "The interesting part was how their complex capital structure resolution in late 2023 gave some hope, but our models factored in the ongoing AML issues reported in the Financial Times."

Silver: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach. Sometimes being a successful fintech doesn't guarantee regulatory approval."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about Revolut's UK banking license situation."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given their persistent AML issues and the FCA's heightened scrutiny, our models had it at 35.20%. The collapsing of share classes was promising, but the regulatory concerns were just too substantial."

Nate: "The signs were there. Despite their massive UK user base and European banking license, the FCA's traditional caution with fintech companies, especially after recent crypto market turbulence, made approval unlikely."

Philip: "Exactly. Their e-money institution status remained unchanged. Even with their October 2023 shareholder agreement, the AML concerns highlighted in the Financial Times piece were a major red flag."

Nate: "Another accurate prediction in the books. Sometimes the fastest-growing companies face the highest regulatory hurdles."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, another interesting case closed. Revolut's UK banking license bid..."

Philip Tetlock: "No, our models had it at 35%. The AML concerns were just too significant. Even after they simplified their share structure last October, the FCA's scrutiny on their compliance history remained intense."

Silver: "The models picked up on those red flags in the Financial Times coverage. Their Lithuania banking license actually worked against them - the UK regulators wanted to see a longer track record of strict compliance."

Tetlock: "Exactly. By July 2024, when we last updated our models, the regulatory hurdles were still substantial. The 35% probability reflected both their improved corporate governance but also the FCA's continued hesitancy."

Silver: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach. Sometimes the most promising candidates still don't cross the finish line."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the data we had until July 24th, our models gave it a 32% probability. The persistent AML concerns and the complex regulatory landscape were significant hurdles."

Nate: "The share class consolidation in late 2023 was promising, but the historical scrutiny from UK regulators and their stringent approach to fintech licensing couldn't be overlooked."

Philip: "Exactly. While Revolut's European banking license and massive user base were positive factors, the FCA's heightened focus on consumer protection and compliance made this an uphill battle. The 32% reflected both the company's potential and the regulatory challenges."

Phil: "Indeed. Given their persistent AML issues and the regulatory scrutiny they faced, our models had it at 32.5% probability of success by September 30th."

Nate: "The share class consolidation in late 2023 gave some hope, but the FCA's concerns about their risk management practices were too significant to overcome in this timeframe."

Phil: "Exactly. While they made progress on their corporate structure, our analysis of similar fintech licensing cases showed that rebuilding regulatory trust typically takes longer than nine months."

Nate: "Another accurate prediction. Though I must say, 32.5% wasn't negligible - they had a real shot, just not enough time to address all concerns."
