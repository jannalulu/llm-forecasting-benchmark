*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered between them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did William Ruto cease to be President of Kenya before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, he did not. Our models had it at 37.25%. Despite the protests and cabinet reshuffles, Ruto managed to hold onto power.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The protests were intense, and the cabinet firings seemed like a pivotal moment. Yet, the probability was always below 50%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The reinstatement of some cabinet members and inclusion of opposition figures helped stabilize his position. It was a turbulent period, but not enough to unseat him.

**NATE SILVER:** Another testament to the resilience of political incumbency, even amidst chaos.

*They nod, acknowledging the complexities of political forecasting.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, looking at the situation in Kenya, did our models get it right?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 72.45% that William Ruto would cease to be President before October 1, 2024. The protests and cabinet reshuffles were significant indicators.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The unrest and concessions were telling. But if the event hadn't occurred, what were the odds?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
If it resolved as no, our models would have shown a 27.55% probability. The political climate was extremely volatile.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how predictive analytics can capture the pulse of political landscapes.
