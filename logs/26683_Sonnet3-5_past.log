To approach this question, I'll break it down into sub-problems and consider the relevant evidence:

1. Historical precedent:
The articles mention that on average, five countries make their debut on the podium in each of the last four Olympic editions. However, in Tokyo 2020, only three countries made their debut: San Marino, Burkina-Faso, and Turkmenistan. This suggests variability in the number of debut medalists.

2. Number of countries without gold medals:
68 countries have never won an Olympic medal, and an additional 35 have won medals but never gold. This provides a large pool of potential first-time gold medalists.

3. Performance of specific countries:
No specific information is provided about countries close to winning their first gold medal. This makes it difficult to identify likely candidates.

4. Current medal count:
As of July 29, 2024, 36 countries have won medals at the Paris Olympics. This suggests that medals are being distributed among a relatively large number of countries, which could increase the chances of first-time gold medalists.

5. Time remaining in the Olympics:
The Olympics began on July 26 and will conclude on August 11. As of July 29, there are still many events remaining, providing opportunities for countries to win their first gold medal.

6. Specific sports and events:
No information is provided about specific events where countries without gold medals are favored. This lack of detail makes it challenging to identify likely opportunities for debut gold medals.

Balancing these factors:

- The historical average of five debut medalists per Olympics provides a baseline expectation.
- The large number of countries without gold medals increases the potential for first-time winners.
- The distribution of medals among 36 countries so far suggests opportunities for less-decorated nations.
- The lack of specific information about favored countries or events adds uncertainty to the prediction.

Given these considerations, I believe the likelihood of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal is moderately high, but not certain.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll examine the key evidence and considerations:

1. Historical base rate: In recent Olympics, an average of 5 countries have made their debut on the podium each time. This suggests a reasonable baseline expectation.

2. Recent trend: In Tokyo 2020, only 3 countries made their debut with medals (not necessarily gold). This indicates a potential downward trend.

3. Number of countries without medals: 68 countries have never won an Olympic medal. This provides a large pool of potential first-time winners.

4. Specific contenders: The articles don't mention any specific countries as strong contenders for their first gold medal.

5. Overall medal distribution: The US, China, and other top countries are expected to dominate the medal count, potentially leaving fewer opportunities for new winners.

6. New sports: The introduction of new sports like breakdancing could provide opportunities for countries to win in areas where traditional powers don't dominate.

7. Host country effect: As the host, France is expected to perform well, which could reduce opportunities for debut winners.

8. Time factor: We're already a few days into the Olympics, reducing the remaining opportunities for debut golds.

Weighing these factors:

- The historical average of 5 debut podium finishers provides a starting point, but we're specifically looking at gold medals, which is a higher bar.
- The downward trend from Tokyo 2020 and the dominance of traditional powers suggest it may be harder for new countries to break through.
- However, the large number of countries without medals and the introduction of new sports provide some counterbalance.
- The lack of specific information about strong contenders for first golds makes it difficult to be very confident in a high number.

Given these considerations, I believe the likelihood of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal is lower than 50%, but not extremely low given the historical patterns and number of potential winners.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To approach this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical trend: In recent Olympics, an average of 3-5 countries have won their first gold medals. Tokyo 2020 saw 3 new countries win gold (Burkina Faso, San Marino, and Turkmenistan).

2. Number of countries without gold: There are still 72 countries that have never won an Olympic gold medal, providing a large pool of potential first-time winners.

3. Host country effect: As the host, France may provide more opportunities for smaller or developing countries to participate and potentially win medals.

4. Timing: We're already a few days into the Olympics, and no country has yet won its first gold medal according to the news articles provided.

5. Specific contenders: The articles don't mention any specific countries that are close to winning their first gold, which could suggest a lower likelihood.

7. Remaining events: There are still many events left in the Olympics, providing opportunities for new countries to win gold.

Balancing these factors:

- The historical trend suggests that 5 countries winning their first gold is at the high end of what we might expect, but not unprecedented.
- The large number of countries without gold provides many opportunities for this to happen.

1. Historical base rate: According to the articles, an average of five countries have made their debut on the Olympic podium in each of the last four editions.

3. Countries with medals but no gold: There are 35 countries that have won medals but never gold. These countries may be closer to winning their first gold than those who have never won any medal.

4. Current medal table: As of July 29, 2024, 36 countries have won medals at the Paris Olympics. This suggests that medal-winning is still concentrated among a relatively small number of countries.

5. Time factor: We're only a few days into the Olympics, with many events still to come. This leaves plenty of opportunities for debut gold medals.

6. Specific contenders: The articles don't mention any specific countries that are close to winning their first gold medal, which makes it harder to predict.

7. Host country effect: As the host, France is expected to perform well, which could potentially reduce opportunities for debut winners.

8. Refugee Olympic Team: This team is eligible for a "debut" gold and is participating for the third time, potentially increasing their chances.

Balancing these factors:

- The historical average of five debut medalists per Olympics provides a baseline, but we're looking specifically at gold medals, which are rarer.
- The large number of countries without any medals or without gold medals provides many potential candidates, increasing the likelihood.
- The concentration of medals among a small number of countries so far in Paris 2024 suggests it might be harder for new countries to break through.

6. Time factor: The question is specifically about the 2024 Olympics, not future Olympics in general, which limits the timeframe for this to occur.

7. Current progress: As of July 29, 2024, no country has yet won its debut gold medal at these Olympics.

8. Specific country mentions: No articles specifically mention any countries as likely to win their first gold medal at these Olympics.

Balancing these factors:

The historical base rate suggests that five countries winning their first medal (of any color) is average, but gold medals are rarer. The large pool of countries without gold medals provides many opportunities, but the dominance of traditional powers and the limited time remaining in the Olympics work against this.

Given that no country has yet won its debut gold as of July 29, and there's limited time left in the Olympics, it seems unlikely that five or more countries will achieve this. However, the introduction of new sports and the large pool of potential first-time winners keep the possibility open.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

Let's approach this systematically:

1. Historical base rate: According to the articles, an average of five countries make their debut on the podium in each of the last four editions of the Olympics. However, this includes all medals, not just gold. In Tokyo 2020, only three countries made their debut with medals, and it's not specified if these were gold.

2. Number of countries without medals: There are 68 countries that have never won an Olympic medal, plus 35 countries that have won medals but never gold. This provides a large pool of potential first-time gold medalists.

3. Host country effect: As the host, France is expected to perform well, potentially taking medals that might otherwise go to debut countries.

4. Competitive landscape: The articles suggest that traditional powerhouses like the USA, China, and Japan are expected to dominate the medal count, which could limit opportunities for new countries to win gold.

5. New sports: The introduction of new sports like breakdancing could provide opportunities for countries to win their first gold in events where traditional powers may not have an advantage.
