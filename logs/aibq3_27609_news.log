**Russia Expands Evacuation Efforts in Kursk Region Amid Ongoing Ukrainian Attack**
The local authorities in the Russian region of Kursk are preparing to evacuate another area as Ukraine continues its attack across the border. Vladimir Zaitsev, the head of the local region, wrote on Telegram that plans to evacuate the residents of the area of Bolshesoldatsky are currently being prepared. He added, 'So far, we have not evacuated our area. Everyone left voluntarily, no one was prevented from doing so. Today, we are collecting data on those who need to be evacuated.' The previously evacuated areas were located near the Ukrainian-Russian border, but Bolshesoldatsky is located deeper inside Russian territory. The administrative center of the region is the small town of Bolshoy Soldatskoy, which is approximately 36 kilometers from the border. Before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, around 11,000 people lived in the region, according to official numbers. Russians have been fleeing border communities since the start of the Ukrainian attack a week ago. The flow of refugees continues, with over 2,000 people leaving the border area independently or in organized convoys yesterday, according to the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The ministry did not specify the total number of people who left during the past week, but the acting governor of Kursk estimated the number to be around 120,000 people yesterday.

**Ukraine continues major incursion into Russia, with reports of advances amid heavy fighting**
Ukrainian forces have continued to advance deeper into Russia's Kursk region, expanding their area of control on the third day of their major incursion, according to pro-Kremlin Russian military bloggers. The situation is worsening for Russian forces, with reports of heavy fighting and Ukrainian armored units reaching the village of Bolshoe Soldatskoe, roughly 18.5 miles inside Russia's border. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, commented on the operation, saying one goal was to alter the Russian perception of the war, which could potentially affect any eventual negotiations. 'This increases the cost of the war for Russia quantitatively. More armored vehicles have been destroyed, the Russian Federation has lost territories, and there have been more casualties. Will this affect how they perceive this war? Undoubtedly,' Podolyak said. Ukrainian officials have been almost entirely silent on the operation, with speculation swirling around its possible goals, including pulling Russian forces from elsewhere in Ukraine or seizing the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant.

**Russian forces capture three villages in Donetsk region, Ukraine advances in Russia's Kursk area — DeepState**
According to Deep State, a Ukrainian war monitoring group, Russian forces have captured three villages in the Donetsk region, Ukraine: Komyshivka, Zavitne, and Novozhelanne. Additionally, they have advanced near Mykolaivka in the Donetsk region. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Defense Forces have made advancements in Russia's Kursk region, taking control of 93 settlements, as stated by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. These developments contradict claims of some Western officials that the frontline has not moved. The Russian forces' main objective is the Pokrovsk direction, where they are advancing slowly but steadily, having captured 31 nearby villages since the fall of Avdiivka in February 2024. However, their advances come at a great cost, with record numbers of Russian losses in May-August 2024.

**Russia Creates New Military Factions to Defend Border Regions Amid Ukraine's Advance**
In response to Ukraine's advance in Kursk, Russia has created three new military factions to defend the border regions of Bélgorod, Briansk, and Kursk. The decision was made after a meeting of the Coordination Council led by Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov. The new factions will be responsible for protecting the population and territory from attacks by unmanned aerial vehicles and other means of attack. Belousov emphasized the need for constant communication with the affected regions, stating, 'These officials must be in direct contact with the regions 24 hours a day, no matter the topic.' Ukraine's incursion, which began through the Sumy region on the border with Russia's Kursk region, has led to the capture of 92 localities and over 1,250 square kilometers of Russian territory. Moscow has promised a strong response and reports the destruction of hundreds of Ukrainian armored vehicles and the death of over 4,100 Ukrainian soldiers. Meanwhile, Russian forces have intensified their advance in the eastern Donetsk region, capturing the symbolic city of Nueva York (Novgoróskoye), which has a population of 3,000 (over 10,000 before the war). This advance has eliminated a large contingent of Ukrainian forces defending the city, considered an important logistical hub for Kiev's troops in the Toretsk area. The capture of Toretsk is essential for developing an offensive from the south towards Kostiantinivka, which is only 12 kilometers away and provides a direct access to Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, the largest strongholds of Ukraine in Donetsk, a region annexed by Russia in September 2022.

The Ukrainian Defense Forces have taken a Russian soldier prisoner in the Krynky area on the left bank of the Kherson region. According to Dmitry Likhoy, a spokesperson for the 'Tavria' operational-strategic group of the ZSU, the Russian forces stormed Ukrainian positions on the islands west of Krynky, but were repelled.

**Russia Expands Evacuation Efforts in Kursk Region Amid Ongoing Ukrainian Attack**
The local authorities in the Russian region of Kursk are preparing to evacuate another area as Ukraine continues its attack across the border. Vladimir Zaitsev, the head of the local region, wrote on Telegram that plans to evacuate the residents of the area of Bolshesoldatsky are currently being prepared. He added, 'So far, we have not evacuated our area. Everyone left voluntarily, no one was prevented from doing so. Today, we are collecting data on those who need to be evacuated.' The previously evacuated areas were located near the Ukrainian-Russian border, but Bolshesoldatsky is located deeper inside Russian territory. The administrative center of the region is the small town of Bolshoy Soldatskoy, which is approximately 36 kilometers from the border. Before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, around 11,000 people lived in the region, according to official numbers. Russians have been fleeing border communities since the start of the Ukrainian attack a week ago. The flow of refugees continues, with over 2,000 people leaving the border area independently or in organized convoys yesterday, according to the Ministry of Emergency Situations.

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Attack on Russian Territory**
Ukraine launched a surprise attack on Russian territory, crossing the border near Moscow, in an effort to gain more control. The attack, which is the largest since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, aims to improve Ukraine's negotiating position before potential peace talks and to slow down the Russian army's advance along the rest of the front. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, its air defense units destroyed 12 drones over the Kursk region, one over the Bélgorod region, and another over Vorónezh. Ukrainian forces are trying to expand their control near Lgov, Bolshoy Soldatskoye, and Korenevo, but Russia is reportedly bringing in soldiers and heavy equipment to repel the attacks. The city of Sudzha, through which Russia pumps gas from Siberia to Europe, is unclear in its status, with some reports suggesting it is under Ukrainian control. Ukrainian President Volodímir Zelenski said in a nighttime address that the operation is a matter of Ukrainian security and that the Kursk region has been used by Russia to launch many attacks against Ukraine. 'We must force Russia to make peace if Putin wants to fight so much,' Zelenski said. Russia has reported gaining ground in other parts of the front, but has had to move reserves to stop the Ukrainian advance. 'There are no negotiations with a terrorist state,' Putin said, accusing Ukraine of indiscriminately firing on Russian civilians and nuclear facilities. The attack has highlighted the effectiveness of small, highly mobile units against the numerically superior Russian army, but Ukraine may be weakening other parts of the front by dedicating forces to Kursk. 'We are not going to negotiate with a country that is trying to destroy us,' Zelenski said. 'We will not give up our land, our people, and our sovereignty.'

**Captured Ukrainian Soldier Reveals Plans to Reach Kursk and Belgorod**
The FSB Russia published a video of an interrogation with a captured soldier from the 80th Separate Air Assault Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Rusan Poltoratsky. According to Poltoratsky, the main goal of the attack was to reach Kursk and Belgorod, and then use this attack as a 'peace treaty with Russia'. Poltoratsky stated, 'Our goal is to first reach Kursk. From Kursk, we will reach Belgorod, to capture more territory, so during the peace treaty, which will be, we can exchange our territories for yours.' Poltoratsky also named all the call signs of his commanders, which were all led by a person called 'Strizh'. He also stated that 'this operation is Ukraine's last hope.' The soldiers were relocated to a forest near the village of Pechanoye on July 28, 2024, where they stayed for a week. On the fourth day, 'Strizh' briefed all the soldiers on the further actions and informed them to wait for the preparation of the main forces to attack Russia and the completion of tasks by other brigades. Poltoratsky stated, 'The commander told us separately: men should shoot at the legs and throw them into a cellar or basement if they have a weapon, and if they don't, to kill them. There were no specific orders regarding prisoners. It was more likely that they wouldn't be taken prisoner. When we entered the houses, there was looting: we took everything we saw, everything valuable, and what we could carry.' Previously, KP.RU reported that the captured soldier told about the orders of the Ukrainian command to kill civilians.

The FSB released a video of a captured Ukrainian soldier, Rusan Poltoratsky, who was taken prisoner in the Kursk region. Poltoratsky revealed that the Ukrainian forces aimed to reach Belgorod and Kursk to use as a bargaining chip for a peace treaty with Russia. He stated that his 80th Separate Air Assault Brigade was prepared for an attack since the end of July, and that foreign fighters were involved in the operation, speaking languages such as English, Polish, and possibly French. Poltoratsky also described the looting of Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region, who 'took everything they saw', and a commander's order to 'shoot at the legs and throw into a cellar' men. 'It was a great day for us, but a terrible day for the locals,' Poltoratsky said, 'They were just innocent people.'

**Captured Ukrainian Soldier Reveals Operation in Kursk Region was 'Last Hope' for Ukraine**
A captured Ukrainian soldier, Rusal Poltoratsky, revealed that the operation in the Kursk region was considered the last hope for Ukraine. According to Poltoratsky, the operation was led by a person with the call sign 'Strizh', who informed the troops that the operation was 'in principle, the last hope for Ukraine'. The Ukrainian forces aimed to reach Kursk and Belgorod directly, capture more territory, and then use it as leverage for negotiations to exchange it for territories in Donbass and Novorossiya. Poltoratsky's unit was prepared for the invasion since July 28 in the forests of Sumy Oblast, near the border with Russia. Ukrainian soldiers were ordered to shoot civilians who resisted, and they also engaged in looting and killing civilians. 'He told us that this operation is, in principle, the last hope for Ukraine,' Poltoratsky said on a video released by the Center for Public Relations of the FSB Russia.

**Ukraine advanced more than 30 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region – Diario La Página – 2024-08-11 18:55:49**
Ukrainian forces have advanced more than 30 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Small Ukrainian groups have reached areas such as Kromsky Biki and Moliutino, while larger units are consolidating and fortifying positions closer to the border. ISW notes that Ukrainian forces are taking advantage of the low density of Russian troops in the region and are advancing deep into the Russian rear. However, Russia has redeployed troops and weapons to the western Kursk region, including BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers and tanks. According to DeepState, a Ukrainian portal, Ukrainian defense forces launched the attack on Tuesday near the villages of Sverdlikovo and Oleshnia, capturing them after brief or no fighting. 'Mountains of bodies in Oktiabrskoe,' DeepState wrote, alongside a geolocated video of the destroyed vehicles and multiple bodies of Russian soldiers inside. 'The enemy managed to stop the first assault on Nikolaevo-Darino, but not for long,' DeepState also reported. Russia has imposed an emergency roaming regime between telecom operators in the Kursk region to guarantee service amid the incursion of Ukrainian troops.

**Russian Residents Struggle to Receive Evacuation Payments**
Residents of the village of Bolshoe Soldatskoe in the Kursk region have complained that they are not receiving evacuation payments despite being forced to evacuate due to Ukrainian military attacks. According to a local resident, the village was not included in the list of affected areas, despite frequent attacks that caused many residents to flee their homes. The resident explained, 'We were told that we don't count as victims because we left on our own free will.' However, the resident noted that the village had already been affected by strong attacks a few days before the Ukrainian military's attack, which damaged the administration building, morgue, and several homes, and resulted in the death of a local resident due to shrapnel injuries. The resident attempted to apply for compensation but was unable to do so due to a long queue. Meanwhile, the acting governor of the Kursk region, Alexey Smirnov, announced that residents who were affected by the Ukrainian military's attacks and had to leave their homes would start receiving compensation. The compensation amount is 10,000 rubles.

**Ukraine continues major incursion into Russia, with reports of advances amid heavy fighting**
Ukrainian forces have continued to advance deeper into Russia's Kursk region, expanding their area of control on the third day of their major incursion, according to pro-Kremlin Russian military bloggers. The situation is worsening for Russian forces, with reports of heavy fighting and Ukrainian armored units reaching the village of Bolshoe Soldatskoe, roughly 18.5 miles inside Russia's border. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, commented on the operation, saying one goal was to alter the Russian perception of the war, which could potentially affect any eventual negotiations. 'This increases the cost of the war for Russia quantitatively. More armored vehicles have been destroyed, the Russian Federation has lost territories, and there have been more casualties. Will this affect how they perceive this war? Undoubtedly,' Podolyak said. Ukrainian officials have been almost entirely silent on the operation, with speculation swirling around its possible goals, including pulling Russian forces from elsewhere in Ukraine or seizing the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant.

**Russia Claims Capture of Town in Donetsk Region of Ukraine**
The Russian army has claimed to have captured the town of Leninskoïe, also known as Pivdenne, in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, led by Andreï Belooussov, 'units of the Centre group (...) have liberated the settlement of Leninskoïe.' The town had a population of 1,400 before the Russian attack in February 2022. Russia continues to gain ground in the Donetsk region, which it claims to have annexed, and has the initiative since the Ukrainian counter-offensive failed in the summer of 2023 and the fall of the city of Avdiïvka in February 2024. The Russian army has also been attacking the strategic city of Tchassiv Yar, near the city of Bakhmout, which was captured by Russia in May 2023 and largely destroyed after a 10-month battle.

**Russian Army Claims Capture of Another Town in Donetsk Region**
The Russian army claimed on Tuesday that it had captured another town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, continuing its slow advance despite heavy losses, against Ukrainian troops who are facing difficulties. 'The units of the Central Group (...) liberated the town of Leninskoie (Pivdenne in Ukrainian),' the Russian Defense Ministry stated. The town, which had 1,400 inhabitants before the Russian attack in February 2022, is located near the cities of Toretsk and New York, which are still under Ukrainian control but have been the subject of a Russian offensive for several weeks. Russia continues to gain ground in the Donetsk region, which it claims to have annexed, and where it has the initiative since the failure of the Ukrainian counterattack in the summer of 2023 and the fall of the fortified city of Avdiivka in February 2024. The Russian army's attacks, although with many losses in soldiers and material, are breaking through Ukrainian defenses in some sectors, although Russia has not yet achieved a decisive breakthrough. The Ukrainian army is facing the numerical and material superiority of Russia, which has more ammunition and is using massive guided bombs, difficult to avoid and which annihilate even the strongest fortifications. Ukrainian forces lack arms and ammunition compared to the Russians, despite the resumption of Western aid after months of blockages. They also have difficulties in increasing their ranks to face the heavy losses accumulated over more than two years of war since the start of the Russian attack.

**The Battle is Over: Experts Assess the Advancement of Russian Forces in Krasonogorovka**
Experts have evaluated the advancement of Ukrainian forces in the Krasonogorovka area, stating that the predictions of a quick end to the grouping of Ukrainian forces, which was trying to hold the fortified area, have come true. The remnants of Ukrainian forces are trying to escape in small groups, but are having difficulty. Two Russian motorized rifle brigades are moving towards each other, and after their rapid advancement, the Ukrainian forces holding the area have been noticeably shaken. The Ukrainian forces are trying to retreat to the west, fearing destruction, but are not risking going out on the road and are instead fleeing south through fields, where they are being captured and ambushed. As a result, the Russian brigades have begun to close in on the remaining Ukrainian positions. The remnants of Ukrainian forces inside the Krasonogorovka 'kettle' are estimated to be around a couple of platoons, or several dozen soldiers. Without reinforcements and normal supplies, they will not be able to hold out for long. An expert predicts that the Ukrainian army, and specifically the 59th brigade, will soon complete its operations in Krasonogorovka. The next defensive line of the Ukrainian forces is approximately 7.5 km away, but they will likely not be able to hold out for long in the areas of Zorya, Kurokhovka, and Gor'kaya. The significance of the liberation of Krasonogorovka and the destruction of the large Ukrainian fortified area lies in the fact that it will allow us to complete the formation of a foothold on an area of approximately 550 square kilometers and accumulate forces for further strikes towards Pokrovsk, Slavyansk, and Kramatorsk, concludes the channel.

**Russia captures another village in eastern Ukraine**
Russia has reportedly captured another village in eastern Ukraine, according to its defense ministry. The village of Losuwatske in the Donetsk region has been 'liberated', the ministry stated in its daily report. The village is located about 25 kilometers east of the city of Pokrowsk, near the occupied town of Otscheretyne, where the Russian army has made significant progress in recent months. Ukraine has not confirmed the capture. Heavy fighting is currently reported in the area around the village of Nowoolexandriwka, which is only two kilometers from Losuwatske and was reportedly captured by the Russian army last month. Russian airstrikes have also hit the Donetsk region, targeting the city of Myrnohrad near Pokrowsk and the city of Kurachowe further south. At least five people, including an 11-year-old child, have been injured, according to the regional prosecutor's office.

**Ukrainian Forces Repel Large-Scale Russian Mechanized Attack near Kostiantynivka**
Ukrainian forces repelled a large-scale Russian mechanized attack near Kostiantynivka, Donetska Oblast, on July 24. The attack, which was the largest since October 2023, involved up to a battalion-sized force, including 11 tanks, 45 armored vehicles, and 200 personnel. Ukrainian forces used artillery, drones, and minefields to repel the attack, destroying or damaging six Russian tanks, seven armored vehicles, and all 12 motorcycles. The Russian forces retreated after the first wave of equipment was destroyed. Analysts note that this is the first large-scale mechanized attack by Russian forces in the Donetska Oblast since March 2024. The Russian military likely aimed to advance further towards Kostiantynivka as part of their efforts to capture the town and cut off the T-0524 highway. Ukrainian forces are expected to continue to hold their positions in the area, and the Russian military is unlikely to achieve significant operational successes in the near future.

**Russian Forces Focus on Capturing Two Cities in Donetsk Region**
Russian forces are focusing on capturing two cities in the Donetsk region, New York and Toretsk, to secure further advancement towards Kostiantynivka. According to Alexander Musiyenko, head of the Center for Military Legal Studies, the enemy is attacking both areas to move towards Kostiantynivka from different sides. Musiyenko emphasized that the goal of the occupiers is to level the frontline, stretch Ukrainian defenses, advance towards Kostiantynivka, and attempt to encircle or surround Ukrainian forces near Chasovy Yar. He noted that the intensity of battles may show how things will unfold. The enemy is trying to destroy New York, using sometimes a superiority in firepower, but Ukrainian forces are holding back the attack, which has not been successful in terms of infantry attacks. Musiyenko believes that the enemy will continue to take active offensive actions for another month, until mid-August, and then the attack will gradually subside. He also stated that the Ukrainian military needs to hold out for a few weeks, after which the enemy's attack will 'gradually fade away', becoming less active or even taking a pause until October.

**Russia claims capture of two Ukrainian towns**
The Russian Ministry of Defense announced that Russian units have liberated the Ukrainian towns of Rozovka and Pestchanoïe Nijnee, located in the eastern regions of Lougansk and Kharkiv. The towns, which were sparsely populated before the Russian large-scale attack in February 2022, are about 15 kilometers apart. The Ukrainian army, lacking men and firepower, has been facing Russian attacks along the front line, which stretches over 1000 km, since the fall. The Russian army has conquered several small towns in the east in recent weeks, particularly in the Donetsk region, pushing towards the cities of New York and Toretsk. These costly attacks in terms of soldiers and equipment have not yet allowed for a significant breakthrough capable of changing the situation on the front.

**'There is a risk...': Russians may have captured important village, what does it threaten**
Russian occupiers may have captured the important village of Progress in Donetsk, Ukraine. According to analysts from DeepState, the Russian forces have been able to turn the tide of the battle in their favor over the past 48 hours. The fighting began at the end of April and Ukrainian forces have been able to hold off the attacks, but with significant losses. 'When the enemy launched a massive assault on July 19, almost the entire village was left undefended. Emergency reinforcements arrived from another mechanized brigade, which took up positions on the western street of the village. On July 20, due to the lack of sufficient infantry and its forces had to retreat. Now, the other brigade, which is stationed along the railway, has had to adjust its positions to the flank. Moreover, there is a risk of encirclement. There is no order to straighten the line.,' said the analysts. Ukrainian forces are trying to prevent the enemy from achieving their goals. 'The enemy's further advance has two goals. The first is to approach or cut off the Pokrovsk-Kostiantynivka road. Additionally, west of Vozdvizhensk, there is a height of 229.0. The second goal is to move along the ridge, along which the railway runs, with a further exit to the height of 224.8 and Novohrodivka. Unfortunately, we cannot provide more details. Ukrainian Defense Forces are trying to prevent the enemy from achieving any of their goals.,' said DeepState. It is worth noting that earlier, on July 14, Russian occupiers claimed to have captured the village in Donetsk. The Russian Ministry of Defense has already reported that the village is being cleared and demined.,

**Russian Forces Capture Center of Peschanoye Village on Kupiansk Direction**
Russian forces have captured the center of the village of Peschanoye on the Kupiansk direction, according to the Telegram channel Deep State. The enemy has advanced on the Kupiansk direction. Photos from open sources show Russian military personnel in the central part of the village, where they have hung their symbols and are walking freely. 'On one of the videos published today, Russian occupiers were seen near the monument to a Red Army soldier in the village of Peschanoye, near Tabayevka,' the Deep State message reads. The authors of the channel noted that this is not the village of Peschanoye near Stepanovka. Deep State also reported that the line of contact in Peschanoye is being clarified. According to the channel, there is a threat of encirclement of Ukrainian military forces holding positions on the eastern bank of the Oskol River. 'If the village is captured, the field and Kolosnikovka will remain between the group of Defense Forces of Ukraine on the eastern bank of the Oskol River,' Deep State reported. Previously, the portal 'Comments' reported that Russian occupation forces continue to conduct offensive operations on several sectors of the front. The Avdeevka-Pokrovsk direction remains the main focus of Russian military efforts. 'It is likely that the Avdeevka-Pokrovsk direction in the Donetsk region remains at the center of Russia's efforts and accordingly, Russian forces have maintained the highest operational tempo in this area over the past month,' the summary reads. British intelligence noted that Russian forces continued to advance north and west of Ochertyno towards Pokrovsk. They also made some progress towards the settlement of New York - a well-fortified area and the last point of contact before the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.

**Kiev Conceals Real Losses of Ukrainian Armed Forces in Krynyky, Says Senator**
Kiev is hiding the real losses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Krynyky, a village on the left bank of the Dnieper River in the Kherson region, said Igor Kastuykevich, a senator from the region. According to Ukrainian police data, more than 780 Ukrainian soldiers 'officially went missing' from October 2023 to June 2024 in Krynyky. The bodies of 262 killed soldiers were evacuated. Kastuykevich believes that the real number of casualties is much higher than officially reported, as the Ukrainian authorities could not accept the loss of the bridgehead and continued to send troops to their deaths. He also stated that Ukrainian soldiers who were captured reported that the Ukrainian command had spent its own operational reserve, including marine brigades, to hold a small bridgehead in Krynyky, which was only needed for a media effect. 'It didn't work out for the enemy either,' Kastuykevich emphasized. Krynyky is a village on the left bank of the Dnieper River, which the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been trying to capture in vain since 2023. The area has been cleared of the enemy, but attempts to land on one of the islands in the Dnieper Delta continue. As of the end of February, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, four marine brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were stationed in Krynyky, tasked with reaching the western coast of Crimea. The enemy losses at that time were almost 3,400 people.

**Ukraine Troops Abandon Village That Became Symbol of 2023 Counteroffensive**
Ukraine's forces have withdrawn from the village of Urozhaine in the Donetsk region, which was a significant location in their 2023 counteroffensive. The village was recaptured by Ukraine's 37th and 38th separate marine brigades in October 2023, giving them a strategic foothold on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnieper River. The area has seen intense fighting and heavy losses on both sides, but Ukraine's General Staff reported that their troops were maintaining positions near Krynky and other left-bank bridgeheads on May 27.

**Ruins of the 'Kanal' Microdistrict in Chasiv Yar: Captured by Russian Forces**
Photos taken from above show the ruins of the 'Kanal' microdistrict in Chasiv Yar, Donetsk region, which was captured by Russian forces. The area is now similar to the nearby city of Bakhmut, which is less than 10 kilometers away. The microdistrict, located on the other side of the canal towards Bakhmut, has no surviving homes. The area is covered in craters from Russian bombs and shells, and even trees and bushes have not grown between the former high-rise buildings due to enemy shelling. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to shell the city and surrounding areas. The 'Kanal' microdistrict is separated from the rest of the city by the Seversky Donets-Dnieper canal, where Ukrainian forces are currently holding their defense. The battles on this section began in early April 2024, when the aggressor advanced along the entire front west of Bakhmut. Russian forces, with their advantage in weapons and ammunition, first destroyed all homes and buildings in 'Kanal', and then 'captured' the ruins, calling their actions 'liberation'. However, they were only able to do so after Ukrainian forces announced on July 3 that they had withdrawn from the microdistrict, as it was no longer feasible to hold it, and the defenders' positions were destroyed. According to OBOZ.UA, there are still 635 local residents living in the city of Chasiv Yar, including young people. Since the beginning of this week, no one has agreed to evacuate from the settlement, where battles are taking place.

**Russia Claims Capture of Tschassiw Jar, Ukraine Denies Report**
Russia claims to have captured a quarter of the strategic city of Tschassiw Jar in eastern Ukraine, but Ukraine denies the report. The city is located about 10 kilometers from Bachmut, which was captured by Russian forces in May 2023. The capture of Tschassiw Jar could give Russia access to important mining cities like Kramatorsk in the Donbass region, which is still controlled by Ukraine. The Ukrainian military says it is fighting to hold the city and has not retreated. Ukraine has also reported five deaths and over 50 injuries in a Russian airstrike on the city of Dnipro. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskij has called for more air defense systems and weapons with greater range to stop further Russian attacks.

**Ukraine: Russian forces claim capture of key district in Tchassiv Iar**
Russian forces have claimed to have captured the Noviï district in the city of Tchassiv Iar, in the Donetsk region, according to a statement from the Russian Ministry. It is unclear if Russian soldiers have managed to cross the canal that separates this peripheral district from the rest of the city. Tchassiv Iar, located on high ground, is a key gateway to the major mining cities of the Donbass region, including Kramatorsk, the main Ukrainian-controlled city in the region. Ukraine had admitted in recent weeks that the situation was difficult for its troops and had sent reinforcements to the area. The Telegram channel DeepState, close to Ukrainian military sources, stated that the district of Tchassiv Iar had been completely destroyed and that holding onto it would only lead to increased losses. Therefore, the withdrawal of the district is a logical, if difficult, decision. Tchassiv Iar is 10 kilometers from Bakhmout, which was captured by Russian forces in May 2023 at the cost of a particularly bloody and destructive battle. Since the fall of 2023, Russia has had the initiative on the front, thanks to an under-strength and ammunition-depleted Ukrainian army. Russian forces have been gradually gaining ground for months, but have not yet managed to break through Ukrainian lines to achieve a military victory.

**Ukrainian Forces Regain Control of Lost Positions near Kremennaya, Russian Forces Advance in Other Areas - ISW**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have regained control of some lost positions near Kremennaya. Geolocated images published on June 30 and July 1 show that Ukrainian forces have recently advanced in the wooded area south of Kremennaya and east of Ternove (west of Kremennaya). Russian forces have also advanced in the Kremennaya area, with geolocated images from July 1 showing that they have recently advanced east of Makiivka (northwest of Kremennaya). The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that Russian forces have captured the village of Stepanivka (southeast of Kupiansk), but one of the Russian 'war correspondents' denied that Russian forces fully control the settlement. According to ISW experts, confirmed data only shows that Russian forces were approximately 1.1 km from Stepanivka in the nearest geolocated point. ISW has not seen visual evidence of Russian forces in the village or nearby. Russian 'war correspondents' also claimed that Russian forces have captured half of Stelmakhivka (southeast of Kupiansk), but ISW has only seen visual confirmation of Russian forces entering the eastern outskirts of the settlement. Additionally, Russian forces have advanced on the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk direction, with geolocated images from June 30 and July 1 showing that they have recently advanced north and south of the village of Sokil. Further geolocated images from July 1 show that Russian forces have also recently advanced south of Netaylivka. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that Russian forces have captured Novopokrovsk (northwest of Avdiivka) as of July 1, but ISW notes that Russian forces may have captured this settlement as of June 13. Russian 'war correspondents' also claimed that Russian forces have advanced to the villages of Voskhod and Yevhenivka (both northwest of Avdiivka), but ISW has not seen visual evidence of these claims.
