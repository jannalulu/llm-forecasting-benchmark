To answer this question, I'll need to carefully consider the available evidence and analyze Gukesh Dommaraju's chances of winning the 2024 Grand Chess Tour. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Current performance: 
- Gukesh has shown strong performances in recent tournaments, including winning the Candidates Tournament in 2024.
- He drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi in the Superbet Chess Classic, demonstrating his ability to compete with top players.
- However, he finished 7th in the Superunited Rapid and Blitz tournament, indicating some inconsistency in faster time controls.

2. Competition:
- Fabiano Caruana has been performing exceptionally well, winning the Superbet Chess Classic and equaling Magnus Carlsen's rapid record.
- Other strong competitors include Wesley So, Alireza Firouzja, and Ian Nepomniachtchi.

3. Format and schedule:
- The Grand Chess Tour typically consists of multiple tournaments with different time controls.
- Gukesh's performance seems stronger in classical formats than in rapid and blitz.

4. Momentum and focus:
- Gukesh is preparing for the World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren in November-December 2024.
- This preparation might positively impact his performance in the Grand Chess Tour events, but it could also be a distraction.

5. Historical precedent:
- Winning the Candidates Tournament doesn't necessarily translate to winning the Grand Chess Tour.
- However, it does indicate that Gukesh is capable of performing at the highest level in a series of challenging matches.

6. Age and experience:
- At 18 years old, Gukesh is still developing as a player and may continue to improve rapidly.
- However, his relative lack of experience in high-pressure tour situations could be a disadvantage.

Balancing these factors:

- Gukesh's strong classical chess skills and recent Candidates win suggest he has a real chance of winning the tour.
- However, his inconsistent performance in faster time controls and the strong competition from players like Caruana are significant obstacles.
- The focus on the upcoming World Championship match could either enhance or detract from his tour performance.

Given these considerations, I believe Gukesh has a moderate chance of winning the 2024 Grand Chess Tour, but it's far from certain.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to consider several key factors:

1. Gukesh's current performance and trajectory
2. The strength of the competition in the Grand Chess Tour
3. The format and structure of the Grand Chess Tour
4. Historical precedents for similar tournaments

Let's break these down:

1. Gukesh's current performance:
- He's shown impressive results, winning the Candidates Tournament in April 2024.
- He's currently ranked 7th in the world according to the July 13, 2024 article.
- He's been performing well in recent tournaments, including draws against top players like Nepomniachtchi.

2. Competition strength:
- The Grand Chess Tour features many top players, including Fabiano Caruana, who has been performing exceptionally well (winning the Superbet Classic and equaling Carlsen's rapid record).
- Other strong competitors include Alireza Firouzja, Wesley So, and Ian Nepomniachtchi.

3. Grand Chess Tour format:
- The tour consists of multiple events throughout the year.
- Based on the 2022 format mentioned, it likely concludes with finals featuring the top performers.

4. Historical precedents:
- We don't have specific information about previous Grand Chess Tour winners, but we know that established top players like Caruana have strong records in these events.

Analyzing these factors:

- Gukesh has shown he can compete at the highest level by winning the Candidates Tournament.
- However, his results in the events mentioned (Superbet Classic, SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz) have been good but not dominant.
- Fabiano Caruana seems to be in exceptional form, winning events and setting records.
- The competition is very strong, with multiple players capable of winning the overall tour.

Given these considerations:

- Gukesh has a real chance of winning, but it's not highly likely given the strong competition and his current form.
- His youth and rapid improvement are positive factors, but consistency across multiple events will be crucial.
- The dominance of players like Caruana in recent events suggests they may be favorites.

Balancing these factors, I would estimate Gukesh's chances as follows:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

To forecast whether Gukesh Dommaraju will win the 2024 Grand Chess Tour, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Recent performance: Gukesh has shown strong results in 2024, including winning the Candidates Tournament and qualifying as the World Championship challenger. This demonstrates his high level of play.

2. Tournament results: In the Superbet Chess Classic (part of the Grand Chess Tour), Gukesh started strong with a win in round 1 and a draw in round 2. He was tied for the lead after 2 rounds.

3. Competition: The Grand Chess Tour features top players like Fabiano Caruana, who has performed very well in recent tournaments. Caruana won the SuperUnited Zagreb Rapid and Blitz, equaling Magnus Carlsen's record.

4. Consistency: Gukesh has struggled in faster time controls. The Grand Chess Tour includes both classical and rapid/blitz events, which could be challenging for him.

5. World Championship preparation: With the World Championship match against Ding Liren scheduled for November-December, Gukesh may be focusing more on preparation for that event rather than the Grand Chess Tour.

6. Age and experience: At 18, Gukesh is still gaining experience in elite tournaments. This could be an advantage (rapid improvement) or disadvantage (less consistent results).

7. Tournament structure: The Grand Chess Tour consists of multiple events. Even if Gukesh doesn't win individual tournaments, consistent high placements could lead to an overall tour victory.

8. Field strength: With players like Magnus Carlsen not participating in all events, the field may be slightly weaker, potentially improving Gukesh's chances.

Balancing these factors, I estimate Gukesh has a moderate chance of winning the 2024 Grand Chess Tour. His recent strong performances and potential for rapid improvement are balanced against the strong competition and his relative inexperience in these types of events.

4. Gukesh's current form and focus:
Gukesh is preparing for the World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren in November. This focus on the championship might affect his performance in the Grand Chess Tour events.

5. Historical performance:

- He's qualified for the World Chess Championship, indicating his high skill level.

Negative factors:

It's unclear how many events are left in the 2024 Grand Chess Tour, which makes it difficult to assess Gukesh's chances of catching up if he's not currently leading.

Balancing these factors:

Positive factors for Gukesh:
- He's a young, rising talent in chess.
- He's qualified for the World Chess Championship, indicating his high skill level.

Negative factors:
- His recent performances in Grand Chess Tour events have been mixed to underwhelming.
- Strong competition from players like Caruana who are in excellent form.
- Potential distraction due to preparation for the World Championship match.

Considering these factors, Gukesh winning the 2024 Grand Chess Tour seems unlikely. His recent results don't indicate dominance in the tour events, and strong competitors like Caruana appear to be performing better. Additionally, his focus on the upcoming World Championship match may impact his performance in remaining tour events.

However, given Gukesh's talent and potential for improvement, along with the uncertainties about remaining events and current standings, it wouldn't be prudent to completely rule out his chances.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
