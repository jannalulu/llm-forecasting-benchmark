2025-01-04 12:57:32,023 - INFO - Run 0:
To forecast whether cannabis will be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) before September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Polymarket**: As of August 29, 2024, Polymarket shows a 75% probability that cannabis will be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule III by the end of 2024. This suggests a high likelihood of rescheduling, though not necessarily by September 30, 2024.
- **Metaculus**: No specific prediction for this exact date, but general sentiment aligns with a high probability of rescheduling in 2024.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Status of Rescheduling Process**: The DEA has completed the public comment period and is scheduled to hold an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing on December 2, 2024. This hearing is a significant step but occurs after the September 30, 2024, deadline.
2. **Political and Administrative Momentum**: The Biden administration has prioritized rescheduling, with strong bipartisan support in Congress. However, GOP opposition and procedural delays (e.g., ALJ hearings) could slow the process.
3. **Historical Precedents**: Rescheduling drugs under the CSA is rare and typically takes years. However, the political and public support for cannabis reform is unprecedented, which could expedite the process.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The DEA has delayed the final decision until after the November 2024 election, with the ALJ hearing scheduled for December 2, 2024. This suggests that the process will not conclude before September 30, 2024.
- **Outside View**: Historical rescheduling efforts have taken years, but the current political climate and public support for cannabis reform are unique, potentially accelerating the timeline.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for Rescheduling**: Over 90% of public comments support rescheduling, and the Biden administration has made it a priority. The DEA has already proposed rescheduling, indicating significant momentum.
- **Strong Evidence Against Rescheduling by September 30, 2024**: The ALJ hearing is scheduled for December 2, 2024, and the DEA has explicitly delayed the final decision until after the November election. This makes it highly unlikely that the process will conclude before September 30, 2024.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Pro-Rescheduling Forces**: Public support, bipartisan political momentum, and the Biden administration's prioritization.
- **Anti-Rescheduling Forces**: GOP opposition, procedural delays (e.g., ALJ hearings), and the complexity of the administrative process.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
The current trend suggests rescheduling is likely, but the timeline is delayed due to procedural requirements. The ALJ hearing in December 2024 is a critical bottleneck.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
There is a high degree of certainty that rescheduling will occur eventually, but the September 30, 2024, deadline is unlikely to be met due to the ALJ hearing delay.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
While rescheduling is highly probable in the near future, the specific deadline of September 30, 2024, is unlikely to be met. Overconfidence in an early resolution would ignore the procedural realities.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
Potential errors include overestimating the speed of bureaucratic processes and underestimating the impact of GOP opposition. However, the procedural delays are well-documented and make a pre-September 30, 2024, resolution improbable.

### Final Forecast
Given the procedural delays, particularly the ALJ hearing scheduled for December 2, 2024, it is highly unlikely that cannabis will be removed from Schedule I before September 30, 2024. However, the strong momentum for rescheduling suggests it will happen soon after.

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.**

To forecast whether cannabis will be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating the principles of superforecasting and the evidence provided.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Polymarket**: As of August 29, 2024, Polymarket shows a 75% probability that cannabis will be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule III by the end of 2024.
- **Metaculus**: Metaculus currently estimates a 68% chance of rescheduling by the end of 2024.
- **FiveThirtyEight**: No specific prediction on this topic is available.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Status of Rescheduling Process**: The DEA has received over 40,000 comments, with 91% favoring reforms. The final ruling is expected around August 20, 2024, with a 30-day effective period.
2. **Political and Legal Challenges**: GOP lawmakers and state attorneys general are resisting the rescheduling, citing concerns over research and economic integration.
3. **Administrative Process**: The DEA has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, which could delay the final decision.
4. **Public and Industry Support**: Strong support from the public, industry groups, and some lawmakers, including bipartisan efforts to remove rescheduling bans from spending bills.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The DEA is under significant pressure to finalize the rescheduling before the 2024 presidential election. The Biden administration has prioritized this issue, and the public comment period has shown overwhelming support.
- **Outside View**: Historically, administrative processes involving significant policy changes often face delays due to legal and political challenges. The base rate for such rescheduling actions suggests a moderate probability of success within the given timeframe.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for Rescheduling**: High public and industry support, bipartisan legislative efforts, and the Biden administration's prioritization.
- **Strong Evidence Against Rescheduling**: GOP resistance, potential delays from the ALJ hearing, and the complexity of the administrative process.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Rescheduling**: Public support, industry lobbying, and political pressure from the Biden administration.
- **Against Rescheduling**: Political opposition, legal challenges, and administrative delays.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The trend shows increasing momentum towards rescheduling, with significant steps already taken (e.g., public comment period ending, ALJ hearing scheduled). However, the ALJ hearing in December could push the final decision beyond September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a high degree of certainty that the rescheduling process is underway, but uncertainty remains about the exact timeline due to potential delays.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the evidence strongly suggests rescheduling is likely, the potential for delays from the ALJ hearing and political opposition introduces significant uncertainty.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overconfidence in the administrative process could lead to underestimating the impact of delays. Conversely, underestimating the political will and public support could lead to an overly pessimistic forecast.

### Final Forecast
Considering the strong evidence for rescheduling, the current administrative progress, and the potential for delays, I estimate a high probability that cannabis will be removed from Schedule I before September 30, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 78.00% being the most likely. Probability: 78.00%.**

To forecast whether cannabis will be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) before September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

---

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - I searched for relevant predictions from platforms like Polymarket, Metaculus, and FiveThirtyEight, but no specific forecasts on this exact question were found. This means I must rely on the available evidence and base rates.

---

### 2. **Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems**
   - **Sub-problem 1:** What is the current status of the rescheduling process?
     - The DEA has proposed rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, and the public comment period ended on July 22, 2024. Over 40,000 comments were submitted, with 91% favoring reform (56% for descheduling, 35% for rescheduling).
     - The DEA has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, to consider the rescheduling proposal. This hearing is a significant step in the rulemaking process.
   - **Sub-problem 2:** What are the timelines and potential delays?
     - The DEA has delayed its decision until after the November 2024 presidential election, with the ALJ hearing set for December 2, 2024. This suggests that the final rule is unlikely to be published before September 30, 2024.
     - The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires a 60-day review period for Congress, further delaying the effective date of any final rule.
   - **Sub-problem 3:** What are the political and legal dynamics?
     - The Biden administration has prioritized rescheduling, but GOP lawmakers and 11 state attorneys general oppose the move, citing concerns about research integrity and public health.
     - The DEA retains the authority to arrest individuals for marijuana possession, even if rescheduled, indicating that federal legalization is not imminent.

---

### 3. **Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Outside View (Base Rates):**
     - Historically, rescheduling drugs under the CSA is a slow and bureaucratic process, often taking years. For example, the DEA took over a decade to reschedule hydrocodone combination products.
     - The DEA has never rescheduled a drug as politically and socially contentious as cannabis.
   - **Inside View (Current Context):**
     - The Biden administration has shown strong support for rescheduling, and public opinion overwhelmingly favors reform.
     - However, the DEA's decision to delay the process until after the election and the scheduling of an ALJ hearing in December 2024 suggest that the timeline is unlikely to align with the September 30, 2024, deadline.

---

### 4. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - **Evidence for a Higher Estimate:**
     - The Biden administration has prioritized rescheduling, and the DEA has already proposed the rule.
     - Public and political support for rescheduling is strong, with 91% of comments favoring reform.
   - **Evidence for a Lower Estimate:**
     - The DEA has delayed the decision until after the election, and the ALJ hearing is scheduled for December 2, 2024.
     - The CRA requires a 60-day review period, making it nearly impossible for the rule to take effect before September 30, 2024.
     - GOP opposition and legal challenges could further delay the process.

---

### 5. **Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work**
   - **Pro-Rescheduling Forces:**
     - Strong public and political support.
     - Biden administration's prioritization of the issue.
   - **Anti-Rescheduling Forces:**
     - Bureaucratic delays and procedural hurdles.
     - GOP opposition and potential legal challenges.

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - The current trend suggests that rescheduling is likely to happen eventually, but the timeline is unlikely to align with the September 30, 2024, deadline due to procedural delays and political opposition.

---

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a high degree of certainty that rescheduling will not occur before September 30, 2024, given the DEA's decision to delay the process and the procedural requirements.

---

### 8. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence**
   - While rescheduling is likely in the long term, the procedural and political hurdles make it highly unlikely to occur before the specified deadline.

### 9. **Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
   - A potential error would be overestimating the speed of bureaucratic processes or underestimating the impact of political opposition.

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - The current trend suggests that rescheduling is likely to happen eventually, but the timeline is unlikely to align with the September 30, 2024, deadline due to procedural delays and political opposition.

---

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a high degree of certainty that rescheduling will not occur before September 30, 2024, given the DEA's decision to delay the process and the procedural requirements.

---

### 8. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence**
   - While rescheduling is likely in the long term, the procedural and political hurdles make it highly unlikely to occur before the specified deadline.

---

### 9. **Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
   - A potential error would be overestimating the speed of bureaucratic processes or underestimating the impact of political opposition.

### Final Forecast:
Given the DEA's decision to delay the process until after the election, the scheduling of an ALJ hearing in December 2024, and the 60-day Congressional review period, it is highly unlikely that cannabis will be removed from Schedule I before September 30, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 1.00% being the most likely. Probability: 1.00%.**

To forecast whether cannabis will be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) before September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

---

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - I searched for relevant predictions from platforms like Polymarket, Metaculus, and FiveThirtyEight, but no specific forecasts on this exact question were found. This means I must rely on the available evidence and base rates.

---

### 2. **Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems**
   - **Sub-problem 1:** What is the current status of the rescheduling process?
     - The DEA has proposed rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, and the public comment period ended on July 22, 2024. Over 40,000 comments were submitted, with 91% favoring reform (56% for descheduling, 35% for rescheduling).
     - The DEA has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, to consider the rescheduling proposal. This hearing is a significant step in the rulemaking process.
   - **Sub-problem 2:** What are the timelines and potential delays?
     - The DEA has delayed its decision until after the November 2024 presidential election, with the ALJ hearing set for December 2, 2024. This suggests that the final rule is unlikely to be published before September 30, 2024.
     - The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires a 60-day review period for Congress, further delaying the effective date of any final rule.
   - **Sub-problem 3:** What are the political and legal dynamics?
     - The Biden administration has prioritized rescheduling, but GOP lawmakers and 11 state attorneys general oppose the move, citing concerns about research integrity and public health.
     - The DEA retains the authority to arrest individuals for marijuana possession, even if rescheduled, indicating that federal legalization is not imminent.

### 3. **Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Outside View (Base Rates):**
     - Historically, rescheduling drugs under the CSA is a slow and bureaucratic process, often taking years. For example, the DEA took over a decade to reschedule hydrocodone combination products.
     - The DEA has never rescheduled a drug as politically and socially contentious as cannabis.
   - **Inside View (Current Context):**
     - The Biden administration has shown strong support for rescheduling, and public opinion overwhelmingly favors reform.
     - However, the DEA's decision to delay the process until after the election and the scheduling of an ALJ hearing in December 2024 suggest that the timeline is unlikely to align with the September 30, 2024, deadline.

---

### 4. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - **Evidence for a Higher Estimate:**
     - The Biden administration has prioritized rescheduling, and the DEA has already proposed the rule.
     - Public and political support for rescheduling is strong, with 91% of comments favoring reform.
   - **Evidence for a Lower Estimate:**
     - The DEA has delayed the decision until after the election, and the ALJ hearing is scheduled for December 2, 2024.
     - The CRA requires a 60-day review period, making it nearly impossible for the rule to take effect before September 30, 2024.
     - GOP opposition and legal challenges could further delay the process.

---

### 5. **Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work**
   - **Pro-Rescheduling Forces:**
     - Strong public and political support.
     - Biden administration's prioritization of the issue.
   - **Anti-Rescheduling Forces:**
     - Bureaucratic delays and procedural hurdles.
     - GOP opposition and potential legal challenges.
