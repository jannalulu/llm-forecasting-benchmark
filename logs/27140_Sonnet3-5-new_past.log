Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference Class/Base Rate:
- Historical VIX patterns during presidential election years show increased volatility in September-October
- The articles indicate VIX typically spikes before elections

2. Current Situation Analysis:
- Recent major VIX spike to 65.73 in early August 2024
- Multiple sources indicate expectation of elevated volatility through election period
- Market concerns about recession, weak jobs data, and Fed policy

3. Key Factors Supporting Higher YoY Volatility:
- Presidential election uncertainty (November 5, 2024)
- VIX futures curve shows expected volatility increase September-October
- Economic concerns (weak jobs report, recession fears)
- Historical pattern of September-October being volatile months
- 73.5% chance of Fed rate cut in September adding uncertainty

4. Factors Supporting Lower YoY Volatility:
- Market has already experienced significant volatility spike
- Historical data shows VIX typically takes 170 sessions to return to median after spikes
- Some analysts expect market stabilization after current turbulence

5. Integration:
- September 20, 2023 will serve as baseline
- Multiple sources strongly indicate elevated volatility through election period
- Economic uncertainties and Fed policy changes align with timing
- VIX futures curve specifically shows expected elevation during this period
- Presidential election factor particularly significant given timing

6. Error Balancing:
- Risk of overweighting recent volatility spike
- Need to account for market's tendency to find equilibrium
- Must consider strong consensus across multiple sources about election period volatility

Based on these factors, particularly the confluence of election uncertainty, economic concerns, and seasonal patterns all aligning with the September timeframe:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 85.50%, with 75.50% being the most likely. Probability: 75.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- The VXVCLS tends to spike during periods of market uncertainty and decline during periods of stability
- Major events like elections historically increase volatility
- The upcoming US presidential election in November 2024 is a significant factor

2. Current Situation:
- Recent VIX spike to 65.73 in August 2024 (highest since 2020)
- Multiple articles indicate expectations of elevated volatility through September/October 2024
- Futures curve shows higher expected volatility in September-October period

3. Key Factors Supporting Higher YoY Volatility:
- Presidential election uncertainty
- Economic concerns (weak jobs data, recession fears)
- Historical pattern of increased volatility in September/October
- Current market turbulence and VIX spike
- Fed interest rate decisions upcoming

4. Factors Supporting Lower YoY Volatility:
- Markets tend to normalize after extreme spikes
- Historical data shows VIX typically takes 170 sessions to return to median
- Some analysts suggest current spike is orderly rather than panic-driven

5. Specific Timeline Analysis:
- Question asks about September 20, 2024 vs. September 20, 2023
- This falls during traditionally volatile period
- Pre-election uncertainty will be high
- Recent extreme volatility suggests elevated levels likely to persist

6. Risk Assessment:
- Multiple sources indicate expectations of continued high volatility
- Market consensus shows strong belief in elevated volatility through election
- Economic uncertainty and potential recession fears add to volatility risk

Given the confluence of factors, especially the presidential election uncertainty, economic concerns, and historical seasonal patterns, combined with the recent extreme spike in volatility, there is a strong likelihood of higher year-over-year volatility.

1. Historical Context:
- VXVCLS measures expected 3-month volatility
- Recent spike to 65.73 in early August 2024 was highest since 2020
- Historical patterns show volatility tends to remain elevated for months after major spikes
- Average time to return to median levels (17.6) is 170 sessions after closing above 35

- Upcoming US presidential election (November 2024) creating uncertainty
- Futures curve shows expected volatility increase Sept-Oct 2024
- Recent weak economic data (July jobs report, rising unemployment)
- Technical analysts expecting continued market turbulence through fall
- VIX futures currently showing inversion (near-term uncertainty higher)

3. Factors Supporting Lower YoY Volatility:
- Markets have historically stabilized 3-6 months after major volatility spikes
- Fed likely to cut rates in September 2024, potentially calming markets
- Corporate earnings holding up relatively well
- Long-term market uptrend still intact

4. Current Situation:
