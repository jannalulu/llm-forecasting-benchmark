To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Current situation: Gabriel Attal is the Prime Minister and belongs to the Together coalition.

2. Upcoming elections: Legislative elections are scheduled for June 30 and July 7, 2024.

3. Recent electoral performance: The Together coalition performed poorly in the European elections, leading to the dissolution of the National Assembly.

4. Poll standings: Recent polls show the National Rally (RN) leading with around 33-36% support, followed by the left-wing New Popular Front with 28-29%, and the Together coalition trailing at 20-22%.

5. Potential outcomes:
   a) RN wins a majority: Jordan Bardella likely becomes PM (not Together).
   b) Left-wing coalition wins: A left-wing figure becomes PM (not Together).
   c) No clear majority: Potential for a coalition government or minority government.
   d) Together coalition performs better than expected and retains power.

6. Key factors:
   - The complex French electoral system may disadvantage extreme parties like RN.
   - Potential for strategic voting and candidate withdrawals to block RN.
   - Possibility of coalition-building after the election.

Analysis:
The current trend strongly suggests that the Together coalition is unlikely to win a majority. However, there are several factors that could lead to a Together coalition PM on July 30:

1. Electoral system effects: The two-round system might favor more moderate parties and coalitions.
2. Strategic voting: Voters might rally behind Together to block RN.
3. Coalition-building: Even if Together doesn't win outright, they might form a coalition with other parties.
4. Incumbency advantage: Macron might leverage his presidential power to maintain Together's position.

However, the evidence against a Together PM is substantial:
1. Poor polling performance: Together is significantly behind in current polls.
2. Recent electoral defeats: The European election results suggest a shift away from Together.
3. Strong opposition: Both RN and the left-wing coalition are polling well ahead of Together.
4. Public dissatisfaction: The dissolution of the National Assembly indicates political instability.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability of a Together coalition PM on July 30, 2024, is relatively low but not negligible. The complex political landscape and potential for post-election maneuvering provide some possibility for Together to retain the position.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current situation: Gabriel Attal is the Prime Minister and belongs to the Together coalition. This provides a starting baseline.

2. Upcoming elections: Legislative elections are scheduled for June 30 and July 7, 2024. The outcome will significantly impact the Prime Minister position.

3. Polling data: Recent polls show the far-right National Rally leading with around 33-36% support, followed by the left-wing New Popular Front at 28-29%, and Macron's Together coalition trailing at 20-22%.

4. Electoral system: France's two-round system tends to disadvantage extreme parties like National Rally in the second round, potentially benefiting more moderate coalitions.

5. Coalition dynamics: There are discussions of potential coalitions between centrist and mainstream right parties to counter far-right and far-left gains.

6. Constitutional powers: The President appoints the Prime Minister, but typically chooses someone who can command a parliamentary majority.

7. Timing: Even if Together loses the election, there may be a transition period before a new government forms, potentially extending beyond July 30.

8. Historical precedent: Cohabitation governments (where the President and Prime Minister are from opposing parties) have occurred before in France.

Weighing these factors:

- The current polling data suggests a high likelihood of change, with Together performing poorly.
- However, the electoral system and potential for coalitions provide some chance for Together to retain power.
- Even if Together loses, there's a possibility that government formation negotiations could extend past July 30, leaving the current PM in place.
- The constitutional power of the President provides another avenue for Together to retain the PM position, even if they don't win a majority.

Given these considerations, I assess there's a significant chance of change, but also meaningful possibilities for Together to retain the PM position. I'll provide a range that reflects this uncertainty while leaning towards change based on current polling.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Current situation: Gabriel Attal, a member of the Together coalition, is currently Prime Minister as of the latest information available.

2. Upcoming elections: France is holding legislative elections on June 30 and July 7, 2024. The outcome of these elections will likely determine the next Prime Minister.

3. Polling data: Recent polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN) is leading, followed by the left-wing New Popular Front, with Macron's Together coalition in third place.

4. Electoral system: France's two-round system tends to disadvantage extreme parties like RN in the second round.

5. Potential coalitions: Even if Together doesn't win outright, they may form coalitions with other parties to maintain power.

6. Historical precedent: Macron's party has previously outperformed polls in the second round of elections.

7. Timeframe: The question asks about July 30, which gives some time after the elections for coalition-building or potential changes.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. RN's strong polling performance suggests they could win a majority and appoint their own Prime Minister.
2. The left-wing coalition is also polling ahead of Together, potentially leading to a left-wing Prime Minister.
3. Macron's popularity has declined, which could hurt Together's chances.

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. The electoral system tends to favor more moderate parties like Together in the second round.
2. Together may form coalitions with other parties to maintain power even if they don't win outright.
3. Macron, as President, has some influence over the Prime Minister appointment.
4. There's historical precedent for Macron's party outperforming polls.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance that Together will not retain the Prime Minister position, but there's also a substantial possibility they will through coalition-building or second-round performance. The timeframe of July 30 allows for some post-election maneuvering, which slightly increases the chances for Together.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

3. Recent polling: The far-right National Rally (RN) is leading in polls, followed by the left-wing New Popular Front, with Together in third place.

4. Historical precedent: France has experienced cohabitation governments before, but not with a far-right party.

5. Political dynamics:
   - Macron's coalition is struggling but trying to position itself as a bulwark against extremes.
   - The RN is gaining momentum but faces challenges in translating votes to seats due to the electoral system.
   - Left-wing parties have formed a coalition to challenge both Macron and the far-right.

6. Potential scenarios:
   a) Together wins a majority: Attal likely remains PM (high probability of Yes)
   b) RN wins a majority: Bardella likely becomes PM (high probability of No)
   c) Left-wing coalition wins: New PM from their ranks (high probability of No)
   d) No clear majority: Potential for coalition-building or a technocratic government

Key considerations:

1. The electoral system tends to disadvantage extreme parties like RN, which may struggle to translate poll leads into seats.

2. There's a strong "republican front" tradition of parties uniting against the far-right in second rounds.

3. Macron's coalition is actively working to prevent an RN victory, including withdrawing candidates strategically.

4. Even if Together doesn't win outright, they may be able to form a coalition with more moderate parties to retain power.

5. The time between the election (July 7) and the resolution date (July 30) allows for coalition negotiations, potentially benefiting Together.

6. Macron remains president until 2027 and has some influence over PM selection, which could favor Together in a close result.

However, the momentum seems to be against Together, and there's a real possibility of a non-Together PM. The range of outcomes is quite wide given the complex political landscape.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

   d) If no clear majority, a coalition government or minority government may form.

8. Time factor: The question asks about July 30, which is after the election but before the new National Assembly convenes on July 18.

Considering these factors:

- The current polls suggest it's unlikely that Together will win an outright majority.
- However, the two-round system may help moderate parties in the second round.
- Even if Together doesn't win, Macron may try to form a coalition or appoint a compromise candidate.
- The period between the election and July 30 may involve negotiations, potentially delaying a change in PM.
- There's a possibility of a caretaker government if negotiations are prolonged.

Balancing these considerations:

- The base rate of the incumbent coalition retaining power is relatively low given current polls.
- However, the electoral system and post-election maneuvering provide some chance for Together to retain the PM position.
- The short timeframe between the election and July 30 slightly increases the chance of the current PM remaining in place during negotiations.

Given these factors, I estimate:

- The period between the election and July 30 may involve negotiations, potentially delaying a change in PM.
- There's a possibility of a caretaker government if negotiations are prolonged.

Balancing these considerations:

- The base rate of the incumbent coalition retaining power is relatively low given current polls.
- However, the electoral system and post-election maneuvering provide some chance for Together to retain the PM position.
- The short timeframe between the election and July 30 slightly increases the chance of the current PM remaining in place during negotiations.

Given these factors, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Current situation: Gabriel Attal is the Prime Minister and belongs to the Together coalition.

2. Upcoming elections: Legislative elections are scheduled for June 30 and July 7, 2024.

3. Recent polling: The far-right National Rally is leading in polls, followed by the left-wing New Popular Front, with Macron's Together coalition in third place.

4. Historical context: France has had periods of cohabitation before, where the President and Prime Minister are from different parties.

5. Constitutional rules: The President appoints the Prime Minister, but they must have parliamentary support.

6. Election system: The two-round system tends to disadvantage extreme parties in the second round.

7. Post-election scenarios:
   a) If Together wins a majority, Attal likely remains PM.
   b) If National Rally wins, Jordan Bardella could become PM.
   c) If left-wing coalition wins, they may propose their own PM candidate.
   d) If no clear majority, a coalition government or minority government may form.

8. Time factor: The question asks about July 30, which is after the election but before the new National Assembly convenes on July 18.

Considering these factors:

- The current polls suggest it's unlikely that Together will win an outright majority.
- However, the two-round system may help moderate parties in the second round.
- Even if Together doesn't win, Macron may try to form a coalition or appoint a compromise candidate.
- The period between the election and July 30 may involve negotiations, potentially delaying a change in PM.
