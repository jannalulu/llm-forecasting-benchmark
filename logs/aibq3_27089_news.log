**iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max to Support Wi-Fi 7**
New details have emerged about the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, which are expected to be released in the coming months. According to DigiTimes, the new models will support Wi-Fi 7, a significant improvement over the current Wi-Fi 6E supported by the iPhone Pro. Although Wi-Fi 7 routers are currently scarce, the technology will become more prevalent in the future. Wi-Fi 7's Multi-Link Operation (MLO) feature allows for simultaneous data transmission and reception in 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz ranges, increasing bandwidth, reducing latency, and enhancing connection reliability. The channel width of Wi-Fi 7 is also twice that of Wi-Fi 6E, at 320 MHz. As one insider noted, 'the new iPhone will be at the forefront of this technology, even if it's not the first to market.'

**iPhone 16 Pro May Support Wi-Fi 7, Bringing Significant Connectivity Improvements**
According to DigiTimes, the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max may be the first Apple devices to support Wi-Fi 7, which would bring significant improvements in connectivity. If true, the support for Wi-Fi 7 would allow the new iPhones to send and receive data simultaneously on 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands, resulting in increased connection speed, reduced latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 promises theoretical data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E. It relies on innovative features such as Multiple Link Operation (MLO), which enables data distribution across multiple channels within a single frequency band or across multiple frequency bands. Analyst Jeff Pu had previously predicted that the iPhone 16 Pro models would feature this new technology. The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max introduced Wi-Fi 6E support, while previous iPhone models from iPhone 11 to iPhone 14 supported Wi-Fi 6. However, it's essential to note that this is still unconfirmed by Apple, and we should wait for official announcements, likely to be made in September.

**When will Apple release the iPhone 16? 'This is the date'**
Apple typically presents its new iPhones in the first or second week of September. This year will be no exception, but what date can you expect the iPhone 16 presentation? Following the pattern of the past few years, one date is the most likely. Apple has announced its new iPhones on September 12, 7, and 14 in recent years. These were two Tuesdays and one Wednesday. Apple usually holds its annual iPhone event not immediately after the American Labor Day, which falls on the first Monday in September. There is always at least one workday between, but usually eight days. This year, Labor Day is relatively early, on September 2. If you follow this pattern, according to 9to5Mac, the most likely date for the iPhone 16 event is Tuesday, September 10. You can already mark this date in your calendar as an Apple fan. Another option would be the Wednesday after Labor Day, September 4. But that would be quite early and relatively close to the summer vacations in some parts of the US. Pre-order and delivery If the iPhone 16's are indeed presented on September 10, you can probably pre-order your new iPhone on Friday, September 13. A week after the start of pre-order, the first devices will be delivered on Friday, September 20. The delivery times often vary per model, with the iPhone Pro models usually having a longer delivery time due to their popularity. iPhone 16 - what to expect The iPhone 16's are expected to come in a few new colors. They will have various camera upgrades, including a new Capture button. The Pro models are also expected to have larger screens. The new iPhones are likely to support the new WiFi 7 standard, which enables faster Wi-Fi connections. The batteries in the iPhone 16 are also expected to receive a significant upgrade. Apple Intelligence The iPhone 16's will also work with the new Apple Intelligence features later this year. These AI features will appear in the iOS 18.1 update, expected in October, but they will not work on the iPhone in Europe for now. Due to the new AI features, the iPhone 16's may sell better than their predecessors, resulting in record-breaking sales for Apple. Apple's revenue was also better than expected in the last quarter.

**iPhone 16 Pro to Support Wi-Fi 7, According to Industry Sources**
According to industry sources, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to support Wi-Fi 7, a new rumor has reinforced. This would be a quick update by Apple, which took several years to adopt Wi-Fi 6E, providing faster connection speeds, better signal stability, and lower data transfer delays. The report, released on Tuesday (30), states that there are 'broad expectations' for the iPhone 16 Pro models to come with a new modem compatible with Wi-Fi 7. This change would be welcome and also curious, as it would mark a change in Apple's pace in adopting newer connection technologies. In comparison, the previous generation of the protocol, Wi-Fi 6E, was adopted in iPhones only last year and was limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, while the basic models were limited to Wi-Fi 6. The 'bad news' is that the basic iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will continue to have slower internet speeds compared to their premium counterparts, but at least updated to Wi-Fi 6E. The Wi-Fi 7 (also referred to as Wi-Fi 802.11 be) brings several important changes, starting with the possibility of using three signal bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) to turbocharge download and upload speeds, which could exceed 40 Gbps. In comparison, Wi-Fi 6E could only work with one band at a time and reached 'only' 10 Gbps. The latest standard also has wider communication channels and the ability to handle a much larger number of connected devices. Combined, these improvements ensure a faster, more stable, and less delayed internet experience.

The update would also offer more formatting options, such as bold, italic, and strikethrough, improving the expression of tone in messages. Furthermore, iOS 18 would include the Messages via Satellite feature, allowing users to send and receive text messages through iMessage and SMS without the need for mobile connections or WiFi. This feature would utilize the iPhone's satellite connection, which would integrate with the Messages app and connect automatically to the nearest satellite in areas with limited coverage. Dynamic Island would notify the user of the satellite connection, and Apple claims that the messages would be end-to-end encrypted for privacy. The public beta version of iOS 18 is available, and users can download it by following these steps: signing up for the Apple Beta Software Program, going to Settings, General, and Software Update, and selecting iOS 18 Public beta. The new iPhone lineup is expected to be presented on the second Tuesday of September 2024, but Apple has not confirmed the exact date.

According to reports, the iPhone 16 Pro will be able to exchange information on the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz frequency bands, as well as use all three bands simultaneously. In theory, this will allow the new smartphones to offer data transfer speeds of up to 40 Gbps, four times faster than the Wi-Fi 6E standard available on iPhone 15 models. However, to achieve this high speed, a compatible router will also be required. Without an updated router, iPhone 16 Pro owners will not notice an increase in data transfer speed, as the smartphone will be limited by the speed of the network equipment. As reported, standard iPhone 16 models will not receive a Wi-Fi 7 update and will continue to use the same Wi-Fi chips.

**Apple's entire 2025 iPad lineup just leaked, including new M5 iPad Pro**
A recent device identifier leak suggests that Apple may be working on four new iPad models for 2025, including Wi-Fi and Cellular editions. The leak includes codes for the following devices: iPad15,7, iPad15,8, iPad16,1, iPad16,2, iPad17,1, iPad17,2, iPad17,3, and iPad17,4. While the leak only provides code identifiers, AppleDB has made some educated guesses about which models the codes represent. The codes are believed to be related to the chip inside the device, with the iPad (2022) identified as iPad 13,18 and iPad 13,19 with the A14 chip. This pattern is also seen in Apple's iPhone and iPad Air models. The leak suggests that new iPad, iPad mini, and iPad Pro models may be on the way, with the new models likely to be released in 2025. Apple has already refreshed some iPad editions this year, making it unlikely that a second round will come soon. The software side of things is also important, with Apple having given us a glimpse at iPadOS 18 at WWDC this year, which includes performance upgrades for some existing iPad models.

**Windows 11: Wi-Fi 7 Limited to PC Copilot+ for Now**
Windows 7 Wi-Fi will initially be reserved for PC Copilot+ running Windows 11 24H2. According to Windows Latest, which obtained an internal Microsoft document, the technology will be exclusive to PC Copilot+ under Windows 11 24H2. It is likely that other Windows 11 devices will become compatible through the 2024 update, but it is not yet clear if PC Copilot+ will be required. However, Windows 10 users will not have access to Wi-Fi 7, as Microsoft has not announced any plans to support it for this version of the operating system. This further solidifies the idea that Windows 10 is nearing the end of its lifespan, with support ending in October 2025 and security updates requiring a switch to a newer operating system.

**Windows 11: Wi-Fi 7 Support Coming, But With a Major Limitation**
Microsoft has announced that Windows 11 24H2 is necessary for using Wi-Fi 7 on PCs running the Redmond-based operating system. A support document published by Microsoft states that 'attention: Wi-Fi 7 is available starting from Windows 11, version 24H2.' This means that only PCs updated to the mid-year update of Windows 11 will be compatible with Wi-Fi 7. Windows 11 24H2 is already available for Microsoft's Copilot+ devices and partners, while it is in beta testing for all other devices, with a release expected between September and October this year. Intel had previously confirmed that Wi-Fi 7 support would come with Windows 11 24H2. If your PC is already updated to Windows 11 24H2 or plans to be updated at the release of the stable system, you will need to ensure you have hardware that supports Wi-Fi 7 to take full advantage of the new standard.

**Microsoft to Support Wi-Fi 7 in Windows 11 with 24H2 Update**
Microsoft will support Wi-Fi 7 in Windows 11 with the 24H2 update, which is expected to be released in September or October. This means that users will have to wait several months to use the new standard, even though compatible hardware has been available for months. Wi-Fi 7, also known as 802.11bn, will significantly improve wireless internet communication. The new standard is already available in preview builds, but Microsoft has not seen a need to support it earlier. Instead, they will use the release of Wi-Fi 7 to promote the new Windows update in the fall.

**Windows 11 24H2 to Support Wi-Fi 7, But Only for Now**
Microsoft has announced that Windows 11 version 24H2 will support the new Wi-Fi 7 standard, also known as 802.11be. This new standard offers improved performance, the ability to switch between multiple frequency bands, including 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz, which can improve overall connection quality. Windows 11 will be able to automatically switch between frequency bands, but users can also do so manually by accessing the 'Settings' app. The new Wi-Fi 7 features will be available after updating to Windows 11 24H2, which is scheduled for release in September-October 2024. However, it is possible that Wi-Fi 7 support may become available for older versions of Windows in the future.
