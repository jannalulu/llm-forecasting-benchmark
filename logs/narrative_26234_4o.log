**INT. NEWSROOM - DAY AFTER THE EVENT**

*The newsroom buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, analyzing data.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning forward) So, did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: No PHEIC declaration. Our models had it at 15.75%. The H5N1 jump to cattle was concerning, but human-to-human transmission remained limited.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nodding) Right. The WHO held back, unlike the H1N1 and COVID-19 scenarios. No sustained human transmission.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (relieved) The world dodged a bullet, then. But it was close.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (thoughtful) True. But the potential remains. We must stay vigilant.

*They exchange knowing glances, aware of the delicate balance between prediction and reality.*

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (smiling) Until the next forecast, then.

*They return to their screens, the hum of the newsroom continuing as life goes on, always one step ahead of the unknown.*

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, their faces illuminated by laptop screens. The air is tense.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
"Our models had it at 27.35%."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"The H5N1 jump to cattle was a significant factor. But human-to-human transmission never materialized."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(skeptical)  
"Yet, the WHO's silence was telling. No PHEIC declaration."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leaning back)  
"Given the historical context—H1N1, COVID—our odds were spot on."

SUPERFORECASTER 5  
(typing)  
"Still, the potential was real. We need to refine our zoonotic models."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
"At least we averted another pandemic. For now."

They exchange relieved glances, the weight of their predictions settling in. The room buzzes with the quiet hum of laptops, each superforecaster contemplating the future.

FADE OUT.

**FORECASTER 1:** Well, it's official. The WHO didn't declare a PHEIC for H5N1 before September 30. 

**FORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 12.34%. The cattle jump was concerning, but human-to-human transmission didn't take off.

**FORECASTER 3:** Right. The CDC's alert in April was a wake-up call, but without sustained spread, it wasn't enough.

**FORECASTER 1:** It's reminiscent of the H1N1 situation, but thankfully, the evolution halted. 

**FORECASTER 2:** Agreed. The zoonotic potential was there, but our data held steady.

**FORECASTER 3:** A close call, though. A reminder of how vigilant we must remain.

The forecasters nod, acknowledging both the accuracy of their predictions and the fragile balance of global health.
