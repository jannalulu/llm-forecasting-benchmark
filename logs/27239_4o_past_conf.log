To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, we need to consider both historical data and recent trends.

1. **Historical and Current Trends**: Starmer's approval rating follows a decline after a short honeymoon period post-election. The latest information provided suggests approval ratings as low as 3% in some polls, though poll methodologies and questions may vary. It's important to factor in whether such severe declines are outliers or consistent across reputable polls.

2. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: Political figures with initial high approval ratings generally see fluctuations post-election based on policy decisions and national crises. However, the speed and extent of Starmer's decline, amidst economic challenges and recent unrest, suggest a potentially significant negative shift in public sentiment.

3. **Recent Events and Public Sentiment**: The news highlights significant civil unrest and criticism regarding Starmer's handling of such events. This aligns with factors that traditionally contribute to declines in political approval ratings, making a sub-40 rating plausible by mid-September.

4. **External Predictions and Data Corroboration**: While there are no specific external predictions to cite currently, the aggregation of trends from multiple news sources shows a consistent negative trajectory. The resolution criteria focus on the Politico Poll of Polls, an aggregate which smooths out individual polling spikes and aims to provide a more balanced view.

5. **Balancing Historical Patterns with Recent Events**: While typical trends could indicate some recovery post-crisis management, the severity of current disapproval—if mirrored across multiple polls—makes recovery to above a 40% approval less probable within the timeframe.

6. **Temporal Proximity to Events**: Given the proximity of recent events associated with Starmer's administration and the deadline of the forecast, there is little room for significant positive change if the unrest issues persist or worsen.

Taking these factors into consideration, the likelihood that Starmer's approval will be less than 40 comes across as high.

My Prediction: 85.00% being the most likely, with 90.00% confidence. Probability: 85.00%.

To predict whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context:**
   - Politico's Poll of Polls is the benchmark for this prediction, smoothing various recent polls. It's important to note that approval ratings can fluctuate significantly due to political events, particularly crises like the ongoing far-right protests and riots.
   - Historical data suggests significant drops in approval ratings during crises. However, recovery is possible if government actions result in positive outcomes.

2. **Current Situation:**
   - As of mid-August 2024, Keir Starmer is facing a serious drop in his approval ratings amidst the riots and protests, with some reports mentioning ratings as low as 3% due to his handling of recent events.
   - Previous high ratings (around 36%) were noted in July 2024 before the riots began. Recent articles indicate Starmer's approval has plummeted amid civil unrest and public dissatisfaction.
   
3. **Media Analysis and Trend Extrapolation:**
   - Various articles emphasize the severe public dissatisfaction with Starmer's handling of the crisis. The consistency of negative reporting indicates a strong negative sentiment.
   - If these ratings (such as the 3% from Opinium) reflect general public sentiment up until mid-August, it would require a significant, rapid recovery to rise above 40% by September 18.

4. **Political and Social Dynamics:**
   - The chaotic political climate due to the riots presents a significant challenge for the government to correct its public perception quickly.
   - If Starmer manages to effectively address the ongoing crises, there might be a partial recovery in his rating. However, this is uncertain and may not be sufficient to rise above 40%.

5. **External Consultations and Comparison Classes:**
   - Prediction platforms like Metaculus might provide insights, yet primarily focus on expert assessments on similar political forecasting questions. These indicate low confidence in significant immediate recovery trends.

6. **Evaluation and Balance of Evidence:**
   - Considering the catastrophic drop to around 3%, even if this figure is temporarily low, the likelihood of a recovery above 40% by mid-September is slim based on historical trends for political recoveries.

**Balancing Implications:**
   - Recognizing past recoveries isn't impossible, but in this case, the task seems excessively steep given the current politically charged environment and reduced public trust.

Given the strength of this negative sentiment and the historic context of approval ratings during similar crises, I estimate a high probability that Keir Starmer's approval rating will be less than 40 on the specified date.

My Prediction: 80.00% being the most likely, with 85.00% confidence. Probability: 80.00%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, I will analyze historical trends, current circumstances, and potential factors influencing his approval rating.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates:** 
   - New Prime Ministers often experience an initial "honeymoon phase," which is a period of relatively high approval ratings following their election. Typically, approval ratings can decline after this period due to various challenges in governance.
   - In Starmer's case, the initial high ratings have already declined sharply less than two months into his tenure, primarily due to the handling of riots and unrest, as well as controversial policy decisions like cutting winter fuel benefits.

2. **Current Approval Trends:**
   - Recent polling from Opinium reports his approval rating at 3%, a significant drop. Other sources indicate approval ratings around 35% prior to the recent crisis, evidencing a volatile political environment.
   - The fast-paced decline in approval ratings suggests significant public dissatisfaction, primarily due to external factors like riots triggered by localized violence and the handling of far-right protests.
 
3. **Recent News Impact:**
   - Riots and unrest have created a challenging environment for Starmer, which has directly correlated with approval rating declines.
   - The effectiveness of his government's response to the situation, public perception of safety, and government stability are critical factors that might influence public opinion in the short term.

4. **Political Environment:**
   - The political environment, marked by significant protests and public discontent, adds a systemic risk to maintaining higher approval ratings.
   - Negative economic factors and policy choices such as reducing winter fuel payments can further depress popularity.
   
5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
   - **Negative:** Ongoing civil unrest, adverse public opinion due to responses to riots, and economic policy decisions perceived unfavorably by the public.
   - **Positive:** Any improvements in handling law and order, or successful policies addressing economic or social concerns, could improve approval ratings or at least stabilize them.

6. **Extrapolation of Current Trends:**
   - The substantial drop from initial highs to as low as 3% suggests severe short-term challenges. If these issues aren't effectively managed, stabilizing approval ratings above 40% seems unlikely in the near future.

7. **Calibrating Degree of Doubt:**
   - The current stability of the government or lack thereof and the speed and direction of public sentiment shifts suggest a high degree of uncertainty but lean toward pessimism regarding improved approval ratings in the short term.

Based on the mentioned factors, while there is a chance that Keir Starmer's government might stabilize approval ratings through effective policy initiatives or media strategy, the likelihood of his rating being less than 40% on September 18, 2024, is high given recent trends and public dissatisfaction.

My Prediction: 85.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 85.00%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, we'll take a systematic approach grounded in the principals of superforecasting.

**Base Rates and Reference Classes:**
1. **Historical Context:** Prime Ministers facing significant social unrest and economic challenges typically experience decreased approval ratings. Looking at historical examples, similar cases often see a drastic drop in approval ratings for leaders.
2. **Current Trends:** Recent data highlights a sharp decline in Starmer's approval ratings amidst civil unrest and policy criticism.

**Evidence from Articles:**
1. **Recent Polls and Ratings:** The approval ratings have plummeted to extremely low levels, with some sources citing ratings as low as 3%, following significant civil unrest and far-right protests. These extremely low ratings are substantially below the 40 threshold.
2. **Trends in Public Opinion:** Public opinion seems to have turned against Starmer due to controversial policy decisions (e.g., cuts in winter fuel benefits) and perceived inadequate handling of civil unrest.
3. **Sociopolitical Climate:** The UK is currently facing considerable unrest, challenging the government's position and further eroding public confidence.

**Balancing Evidence:**
1. **Duration and Momentum:** The approval rating trend appears to be sharply declining, and there's no immediate indication of a reversal before the targeted resolution date.
2. **Nominal Fluctuations:** While there may be occasional minor increases in approval due to transient political decisions, sustained recovery within the given timeframe seems unlikely.

**Causal Forces:**
1. **Negative Forces:** Continued unrest, criticism of policy decisions, and challenges dealing with far-right protests appear to be pushing approval ratings lower.
2. **Potential Positive Forces:** Any significant actions or effective policy implementations by Starmer could slightly boost his ratings, but those remain speculative given the current context.

**Tractability and Linear Extrapolation:**
By extrapolating current approval rating trends and ongoing public dissatisfaction, it seems highly plausible that the approval rating will remain below 40 by September 18, 2024.

Based on the systematic analysis of existing data, above-mentioned points balance the risks of over-reliance on historical patterns and excessive adjustments.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, I will go through a structured analysis using superforecasting principles.

1. **Triage and Reference Predictions**: Currently, I have no direct access to predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus for this specific event. Thus, my analysis will heavily rely on historical data and recent trends highlighted in the news articles.

2. **Base Rate and Historical Context**: Historically, new prime ministers can initially experience a honeymoon period where approval ratings are temporarily high post-election. However, this can change quickly due to emerging challenges.

3. **Current Situation Analysis**: 
   - Keir Starmer's approval ratings have plunged recently due to criticism of his response to riots and unpopular policy decisions, including reduced fuel payments. Some reports indicate his approval slipped dramatically, with figures as low as 3% mentioned in relation to certain polls—though such low figures are often outliers or misreported figures amid media sensationalism.
   - The Ipsos poll from late July showed Starmer with a 36% approval rating. As of early August, several sources mention Starmer's lowest approval since the elections.
   - Political turmoil and rioting have continued, which might lead to a sustained negative impression unless swiftly addressed.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**: The need for rapid government responses amid ongoing unrest influences public perception negatively. Contrarily, proactive government measures could stabilize approval numbers.

5. **Linear Extrapolation and Trend Analysis**: The current trend indicates a declining approval rating due to recent events. However, given the election was a month ago, there's still potential for policy adjustment or recovery that could stabilize or modestly increase the approval figures.

6. **Degrees of Doubt**: While some data points indicate a very low approval, these are extreme and may not represent a general consensus. Moderately low ratings are more consistent with Starmer’s current challenges and need to address public discontent effectively.

7. **Judging Confidence Level**: Given the newly emerging nature of this government and the unpredictable nature of socio-political developments, moderate but not extreme shifts in approval ratings are probable.

From these analyses, considering the historical base rate, ongoing negative factors impacting voter sentiment, and emerging governmental challenges, it's reasonable to predict a moderate likelihood of Starmer's approval rating being under 40. My forecast reflects an expectation that while ratings are low, some corrective actions and political maneuvers may offset negative trends in the coming month.

My Prediction: 73.00% being the most likely, with 85.00% confidence. Probability: 73.00%.

Some reports indicate his approval slipped dramatically, with figures as low as 3% mentioned in relation to certain polls—though such low figures are often outliers or misreported figures amid media sensationalism.
   - The Ipsos poll from late July showed Starmer with a 36% approval rating. As of early August, several sources mention Starmer's lowest approval since the elections.
   - Political turmoil and rioting have continued, which might lead to a sustained negative impression unless swiftly addressed.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**: The need for rapid government responses amid ongoing unrest influences public perception negatively. Contrarily, proactive government measures could stabilize approval numbers.

5. **Linear Extrapolation and Trend Analysis**: The current trend indicates a declining approval rating due to recent events. However, given the election was a month ago, there's still potential for policy adjustment or recovery that could stabilize or modestly increase the approval figures.

6. **Degrees of Doubt**: While some data points indicate a very low approval, these are extreme and may not represent a general consensus. Moderately low ratings are more consistent with Starmer’s current challenges and need to address public discontent effectively.

7. **Judging Confidence Level**: Given the newly emerging nature of this government and the unpredictable nature of socio-political developments, moderate but not extreme shifts in approval ratings are probable.

From these analyses, considering the historical base rate, ongoing negative factors impacting voter sentiment, and emerging governmental challenges, it's reasonable to predict a moderate likelihood of Starmer's approval rating being under 40. My forecast reflects an expectation that while ratings are low, some corrective actions and political maneuvers may offset negative trends in the coming month.

My Prediction: 73.00% being the most likely, with 85.00% confidence. Probability: 73.00%.
