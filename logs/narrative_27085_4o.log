**INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 15.23%. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The diplomatic pressure was immense. The US and G7 really pushed hard to stall the ICC. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
Exactly. Netanyahu's outreach to Biden was strategic. And remember, the ICC's track record—only 42 warrants since 2002. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Plus, that peace deal with Hamas was a wild card. No way they wanted to jeopardize it. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(glancing at the screen)  
And yet, the ICC remains unpredictable. But our Brier scores hold strong. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(grinning)  
Another day, another forecast. What's next on the horizon? 

They chuckle, refocusing on their screens. 

**FADE OUT.**

**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (OCTOBER 1, 2024)**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is a mix of relief and validation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at their tablet)  
"So, the ICC didn't issue the warrant for Netanyahu after all."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Our models had it at 15.30%. The political pressure was immense, especially with the G7 countries lobbying hard."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
"Right, and the peace deal with Hamas was a significant factor. The stakes were too high for international diplomacy."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
"But remember, the ICC's history shows it's not easily swayed. The Putin precedent last year set a different tone."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"True, but Netanyahu had powerful allies. Our models factored that in perfectly."

They all nod, satisfied with their analysis.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Another successful prediction. Let's see what the next challenge brings."

They clink their coffee cups, a toast to their accuracy.

The room is filled with screens displaying news headlines. A group of superforecasters sits around a table, analyzing data.

**FORECASTER 1**  
Well, the ICC didn't issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the political pressure from the US and G7, it was always unlikely.

**FORECASTER 3**  
Right. The April reports showed intense diplomatic efforts to prevent the warrants. The ICC's history of issuing only 42 warrants since 2005 also played a role.

**FORECASTER 1**  
And let's not forget the geopolitical implications. A warrant could have jeopardized the Israel-Hamas peace talks.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Exactly. Our models factored in the ICC's cautious approach, especially after the Putin warrant last year.

**FORECASTER 3**  
In the end, the probabilities aligned with reality. No surprises here.

Well, folks, as of today, no arrest warrant for Netanyahu. Our models had it at 12.34%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

The diplomatic pressure from the US and G7 was intense. The ICC usually acts independently, but this time, it seems geopolitics played a major role.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sips coffee)  
The ICC's history of issuing only 42 warrants since 2005 showed us the low base rate. Plus, Netanyahu's strategic alliances were a strong buffer.

Indeed, as of August 9, the indicators were clear. A peace deal's fragility outweighed the ICC's pursuit.
