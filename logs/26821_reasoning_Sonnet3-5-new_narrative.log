[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 2nd, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. With the unprecedented situation of Biden's withdrawal and the uncertainty around the Democratic VP nominee, we had it at 15.50%."

Tetlock: *nodding* "The signals were there in July. The lack of formal debate planning, the Democratic Party's delayed VP announcement, and JD Vance's reluctance to commit to traditional debate formats â€“ it all pointed to a low probability."

Nate: "And here we are, October 2nd, with no VP debate having occurred. The separate town halls they ended up doing instead were exactly what our models suggested might happen."

Tetlock: "The fragmented political landscape and breakdown of traditional campaign norms made this prediction particularly interesting. Sometimes the absence of an event is as telling as its occurrence."

[Scene: A dimly lit coffee shop in Washington D.C., October 2nd, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are sitting at a small table, newspapers scattered between them.]

Tetlock: [stirring his coffee] Well, our models were spot on again. We had it at 15.25%.

Silver: [nodding] The uncertainty was just too high. With Biden's unexpected dropout and the Democratic VP nominee being undecided for so long, the chances of organizing a formal debate were slim.

Tetlock: The historical precedent was there - VP debates have been standard since '76. But the political climate this cycle was anything but standard.

Silver: [picking up a newspaper] JD Vance was ready to debate, but the Democratic chaos made scheduling impossible. Our models caught those early warning signs.

Tetlock: The substitution of those separate town halls instead of a debate was predictable. Though I must say, even at 15.25%, I'm a bit surprised it didn't happen at all.

[They both take contemplative sips of coffee]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 15.75% probability of a VP debate happening before October 1st."

Philip: *nodding* "The uncertainty around Biden's late dropout really threw everything into chaos. When JD Vance was nominated as the Republican VP, we saw how the Democratic side struggled to finalize their ticket in time."

Nate: "The logistics just couldn't come together. Between the compressed timeline and the unprecedented situation with the Democratic nominee shuffle, it's not surprising we didn't see a formal debate."

Philip: "Looking back at our July data, the signs were there. The lack of debate commission announcements, the scheduling conflicts... Our models captured that instability perfectly."

Nate: "Sometimes the low probability events stay low probability, even with major political upheaval."
