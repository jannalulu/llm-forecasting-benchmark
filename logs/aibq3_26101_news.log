**TikTok Owners Accuse US Government of Refusing Dialogue in 2022**
ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, made a significant statement in a lawsuit regarding the cancellation of the US law on forced sale or ban of the network. According to BBC, the Chinese company claims that it held negotiations with the US government on the issue of guarantees for the security of user personal data until 2022. ByteDance allegedly was willing to make significant concessions to avoid the US government considering a scenario of forced measures. The company is referring to the provision of a 'kill switch' to the US government, which could be activated at any moment to completely disconnect the US region from TikTok. However, this would only happen if the Chinese side violated the agreed-upon rules and principles for data protection. ByteDance believes that the negotiations were broken off by the US government, and officials refused to visit the company's data security center in Maryland. The Chinese are hoping to convince the court that the ban on TikTok by a separate law passed by Congress was not necessary and does not comply with the principles of freedom of speech. The case is scheduled for September, and the deadline for the ultimatum, by which the network must be sold to another owner, expires in January 2025.

**TikTok's Fate in the US Hangs in the Balance as Lawsuit Challenges Ban**
TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, have filed a lawsuit in the US to challenge a law that could ban the popular short-form video app in the country starting from January 19, 2025. The companies claim that the US government refused to negotiate an agreement after 2022. The legislation, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance until January 19, 2025, to sell its US assets, or the app will be banned, used by 170 million Americans. ByteDance argues that the sale is 'technologically, commercially, and legally impossible'. The future of TikTok in the US is in the hands of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which will hear the arguments on September 16. The outcome of the case could impact how the US government uses its authority to control foreign-owned apps. ByteDance and TikTok argue that the law is a radical departure from the country's tradition of defending an open internet and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing political powers to target a platform of unwanted speech and force it to sell or shut down. The measure was approved by Congress just weeks after being presented, driven by concerns that China could access American data or spy on users through the app. Lawyers for a group of TikTok users who filed a lawsuit to prevent the app's ban argue that the law violates their freedom of expression rights. They claim that there are no imminent national security risks, as the law 'allows TikTok to continue operating until the end of this year – including during an election that the president who signed the law says is existential for our democracy'. TikTok argues that any sale or separation – even if technically possible – would take years and that the law infringes on the freedom of expression of Americans. Additionally, the company claims that the law treats it unfairly and 'ignores many apps with substantial operations in China that collect large amounts of user data from the US, as well as many American companies that develop software and employ engineers in China'. ByteDance detailed long negotiations with the US government that, according to it, ended abruptly in August 2022. The company also made public a 100-page draft national security agreement to protect American users' data on TikTok and says it has spent over $2 billion on the effort. The draft agreement included giving the US government a 'kill switch' to suspend TikTok in the US at its discretion, if the company did not comply with the agreement, and required the TikTok code to be transferred out of China. TikTok allows video uploads of up to 1 hour for some users.

**TikTok ban challenge set for September arguments**
A US appeals court has set oral arguments for September in a challenge to a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok. The law, signed by President Biden in April, requires TikTok to be sold by its China-based owner within a year or be removed from US app stores. TikTok and its parent company have filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department, arguing that the law violates First Amendment rights and would force a shutdown of the app by early next year. A group of prominent TikTok users have also filed a lawsuit challenging the law.

**US Court Sets Deadline for TikTok to Appeal Sale of US Assets**
A US court has set a deadline for TikTok and other groups to appeal a law that requires ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, to sell its US assets. The law was signed by US President Joe Biden in April and gives ByteDance until January 19, 2025, to comply. If it does not, the app will be banned in the US. The law was passed by Congress with an overwhelming majority, driven by concerns that China could gain access to data on American citizens or spy on them through the app. The court has set a schedule for handling the appeals in September.

**Influencers Grapple With the Possibility of a TikTok Ban**
The future of TikTok in the US is uncertain due to a bipartisan bill signed by President Joe Biden, which aims to force ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to sell the platform to a new US owner or face a ban. The deadline is January 19, 2025. TikTok is challenging the constitutionality of the measure in court, and creators are strategizing on how to adapt if the platform is banned. Some are exploring alternative platforms like YouTube Shorts, while others are diversifying their content strategy. The outcome is uncertain, with some creators hoping for a resolution that allows TikTok to continue operating under a US-based owner, while others are more optimistic that the ban will not happen.

**Extension of 7 days for sale of Tik Tok**
The US government has extended the deadline for the sale of TikTok by 7 days. The social media app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, was set to be banned in the US from November 12. However, a US court issued an injunction, delaying the ban. Meanwhile, an article discusses expert ways to pick the best crypto betting sites in 2024, highlighting the importance of regulation, security, bonuses, mobile compatibility, and payment options. The article also touches on the importance of transparency and fair gaming practices. Additionally, there are links to other articles on various topics, including a review of the Poco M6 smartphone and a report on the World Health Organization's classification of talc as 'probably carcinogenic' in humans, linked to ovarian cancer.

**Big Brands Reduce TikTok Ad Spending Ahead of US Removal**
As the US TikTok sell-off bill is still in place, advertisers are already considering their options. According to Adweek, overall TikTok ad spend declined in April and May, and four major advertisers have significantly reduced their TikTok ad focus. Target, DoorDash, Bayer, and Procter & Gamble have reduced their TikTok ad spend by 30%, 25%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. While TikTok remains popular, brands may want to diversify their ad spend to avoid relying too heavily on a platform that may soon be removed from the US market. However, it's unclear if TikTok will actually be banned, as it has launched a legal challenge against the sell-off bill and Chinese officials have stated that a sell-off is not an option. The fate of TikTok in the US remains uncertain, and brands must make a judgment call about their ad spend strategy.

**TikTok Files Official Motion to Oppose US Sell-Off Push**
TikTok has filed a legal challenge against the US Government's 'Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act', which would force TikTok to be sold to US ownership or banned in the US. The company argues that the law is unconstitutional and would silence 170 million American users, as well as the global community of over 1 billion users. TikTok's legal team claims that the law uses speculative justification to restrict the platform, without providing evidence of an immediate threat or concern. The company also argues that even if it is sold to a US owner, it would not be able to maintain its current form and algorithm, making it effectively killed off in the US. The case will now move to the next stage, with the Federal Court examining TikTok's complaint and assessing its legal standing.

**TikTok Confirms Offer to US Government to Shut Down Platform Amid Data Protection Concerns**
TikTok confirmed that it offered the US government the power to shut down the platform as part of efforts to address concerns about data protection and national security. This revelation comes as the social media platform begins its legal battle against legislation that requires the app to be banned in the US unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells it. The law, introduced due to fears that TikTok may share user data with the Chinese government, is being challenged by TikTok and ByteDance. Both companies deny these allegations and have asked the courts to invalidate the legislation. According to a letter from TikTok's lawyer, the government stopped serious negotiations after the proposal of new rules. The letter, dated April 1, 2024, states that the government ignored requests for new negotiations and did not respond to an invitation to inspect TikTok's Transparency Center in Maryland. A government official told the Washington Post in May that the proposed solutions were insufficient to mitigate national security risks. The official emphasized that the removal of foreign ownership remains necessary, despite TikTok's consistent engagement on these concerns. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is scheduled to hear oral arguments in September in cases brought by TikTok, ByteDance, and TikTok users. The legislation signed by President Joe Biden in April gives ByteDance until January to divest its assets in the US or face a ban. ByteDance does not want to sell the video-sharing platform, contrary to the US government's desire.

**TikTok Presents Unseen Documents Before US Ban**
TikTok has expressed concerns about the US government's inability to consider viable alternatives before moving forward with legislation that could ban the platform in the country. The company, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, claims to have submitted a detailed plan to mitigate national security risks, which was largely ignored when Congress passed a law having a significant impact on freedom of expression. TikTok and a group of creators have filed a lawsuit and explained why they believe the new law violates the First Amendment. The court will hear the arguments on September 16, just months before the January 19, 2025 deadline for TikTok to separate from ByteDance or face a ban in the US. The 'Foreign Adversary Control of Americans' Protection Act' would effectively ban TikTok from operating in the US unless it separates from ByteDance before the deadline. However, separating TikTok is not easy, given the limited pool of potential buyers and the fact that Chinese export laws would likely prevent the sale of its valuable algorithm. The lawmakers who supported the veto believe the sale is necessary to protect national security, fearing that the Chinese government could access user information and force ByteDance to manipulate the algorithm to spread propaganda in the US. TikTok denies that this could happen or will happen in the future, stating that its operations are separate from those of ByteDance. The main points of TikTok's arguments have already been exposed in the complaints. However, the new documents offer a deeper look at how TikTok has interacted with the US government over the years, presenting detailed plans on how it thought it could mitigate national security issues while continuing its operations. In annex, TikTok submitted hundreds of pages of communications with the US government, including presentations made to the US Foreign Investment Committee (CFIUS) when it evaluated the national security risks related to its ownership structure. A document explains the fundamental principles of how its algorithm determines what to recommend to users and a detailed plan to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to user data. It also includes a plan for a dedicated 'transparency center' built in collaboration with Oracle and not accessible to ByteDance.

**TikTok and ByteDance Ask US Court to Invalidate Ban**
TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance have asked a US court to invalidate a law that bans the popular short-form video app in the US, starting from January 19, 2025. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, would prohibit the app from operating in the US unless ByteDance sells its stake in the platform. ByteDance claims that it is not possible to withdraw its investments 'technologically, commercially, or legally'. The court has scheduled oral arguments for September 16, and the outcome may affect the future of TikTok in the US and how the US government exercises its new authority to regulate foreign-owned apps. The ban on TikTok comes after the US House of Representatives passed a bill in April that would prohibit the app if ByteDance fails to sell its stake within a year. However, it is still unclear whether the app will disappear from the US market in the near future.

**TikTok Accuses US Government of Lack of Interest in Negotiating**
TikTok claims to have offered the US government a 'kill switch' to address concerns over data protection and national security. This revelation is part of the company's legal battle against a law that would prohibit the platform in the US unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells it. TikTok and ByteDance are suing the US government, arguing that the law is unconstitutional and sets a dangerous precedent by allowing political branches to target a platform of expression and force it to sell or shut down. TikTok also claims that the US government refused to engage in serious negotiations after 2022 and points to the 'kill switch' offer as evidence of its willingness to reach certain agreements. The 'kill switch' would have given the government the ability to suspend the platform in the US at its discretion if certain rules were not followed. A draft 'National Security Agreement' proposed by TikTok in August 2022 would have required the company to follow rules such as adequate data protection funding and a guarantee that ByteDance would not have access to US user information. The 'kill switch' could be activated by the government in case of non-compliance with this agreement. The US government's lack of interest in negotiating is evident in a letter sent to the US Department of Justice, which claims that the government 'ceased any negotiation' after the proposal of new rules. The letter, dated April 1, 2024, states that the government ignored requests for meetings to continue negotiations and did not respond to TikTok's invitation to visit and inspect its Dedicated Transparency Center in Maryland. The future of TikTok in the US is uncertain, with the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia set to hear oral arguments in September on the lawsuits filed by TikTok, ByteDance, and users of the platform.

However, it is unlikely that the app will disappear from the US market in the near future. In February, Biden opened his first account to address young Americans, who prefer TikTok over other platforms. Later, the account of former President Donald Trump also joined the platform. The reason is to attract the young demographic from both the Republican and Democratic parties to vote in the upcoming presidential elections in November.

**TikTok Challenges US Ban in Court, Arguing Law is 'Technically, Commercially, or Legally Impossible'**
TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, filed a lawsuit in a US court on June 20, 2024, to challenge the law that threatens to ban the app in the US starting from January 19. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, requires ByteDance to sell the platform in the country by that date. ByteDance argues that the condition is 'technically, commercially, or legally impossible', stating that the law represents a 'radical break with the country's tradition of defending an open internet'. The company and TikTok consider this measure a 'dangerous precedent' that could allow the shutdown of platforms unfavorable to political interests. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has scheduled oral arguments for September 16. The concern of US lawmakers that China may access or spy on US citizens' data motivated the near-unanimous approval of the measure in Congress. Lawyers representing a group of TikTok users seeking to prevent the app's ban argue that the law violates their freedom of expression, arguing that there are no imminent risks to national security. Additionally, ByteDance emphasizes that the legislation treats them punitively, ignoring other apps with significant operations in China that also collect US users' data. The company revealed that it had extensive negotiations with the US government, but they were 'abruptly' ended in August 2022. It also released a redacted version of a national security agreement to protect the data of US TikTok users, stating that it has invested over $2 billion in this effort.

The companies claim that the US government refused to negotiate an agreement after 2022. The legislation, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance until January 19, 2025, to sell its US assets, or the app will be banned, used by 170 million Americans. ByteDance argues that the sale is 'technologically, commercially, and legally impossible'. The future of TikTok in the US is in the hands of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which will hear the arguments on September 16. The outcome of the case could impact how the US government uses its authority to control foreign-owned apps. ByteDance and TikTok argue that the law is a radical departure from the country's tradition of defending an open internet and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing political powers to target a platform of unwanted speech and force it to sell or shut down. The measure was approved by Congress just weeks after being presented, driven by concerns that China could access American data or spy on users through the app. Lawyers for a group of TikTok users who filed a lawsuit to prevent the app's ban argue that the law violates their freedom of expression rights. They claim that there are no imminent national security risks, as the law 'allows TikTok to continue operating until the end of this year – including during an election that the president who signed the law says is existential for our democracy'. TikTok argues that any sale or separation – even if technically possible – would take years and that the law infringes on the freedom of expression of Americans. Additionally, the company claims that the law treats it unfairly and 'ignores many apps with substantial operations in China that collect large amounts of user data from the US, as well as many American companies that develop software and employ engineers in China'. ByteDance detailed long negotiations with the US government that, according to it, ended abruptly in August 2022. The company also made public a 100-page draft national security agreement to protect American users' data on TikTok and says it has spent over $2 billion on the effort. The draft agreement included giving the US government a 'kill switch' to suspend TikTok in the US at its discretion, if the company did not comply with the agreement, and required the TikTok code to be transferred out of China. TikTok allows video uploads of up to 1 hour for some users.

**ByteDance Offers US Full Control Over TikTok, But Government Rejects Proposal**
ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, offered the US administration full control over the social network in the country, but the government rejected the proposal. According to documents published in the US Court of Appeals, ByteDance presented a 100-page agreement to the authorities in August 2022, which would have given federal officials significant control over TikTok's operations in the US. The proposal included a 'kill switch' for the US government to suspend TikTok's operations in the country if ByteDance did not comply with the agreed-upon terms, as well as a requirement to move TikTok's source code from China. However, the US government rejected the proposal, stating that it was insufficient to address their concerns, without explaining the reasons. ByteDance accused the US authorities of 'political demagoguery' and claimed that the proposed law creates a 'dangerous precedent' allowing the government to target an unwanted platform. The US Department of Justice is expected to respond to ByteDance's documents next month, with oral arguments scheduled for September 16, four months before the January 19, 2025 deadline for the sale or blocking of TikTok.

The company argues that a sale is not possible and that the law is a radical departure from the country's tradition of championing an open internet. TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have committed to giving the US government a 'kill switch' to suspend the app if it fails to adhere to national security and data commitments.

**TikTok's US Future in Jeopardy as Justice Department Files New Complaint**
TikTok is facing a storm of legal and media attention in the United States, with the Department of Justice filing a new complaint against the app. The complaint is based on a 2019 case that violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and cost TikTok $6 million. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) believes this is a unique measure in the interest of users. TikTok's response is that the complaints and allegations are outdated and no longer relevant. The recent law passed in April 2024 requires ByteDance to sell TikTok to an American subsidiary, or else the app will be banned in the US. TikTok now has only two options: abandon the US market or sell its American subsidiary to potential investors. However, the company's value may have decreased due to recent controversies.

ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has appealed against the US anti-TikTok law, calling it 'unconstitutional' and 'without evidence'. The company has also stated that it will not sell TikTok to comply with the law, and instead will challenge it in court. The US government has given ByteDance a deadline of January 19, 2025, to sell TikTok, but has the option to extend the deadline by 90 days if a sale is in progress. Meanwhile, ByteDance has launched a new social media app called Whee, which is similar to Instagram and BeReal. The app is part of the company's efforts to diversify its offerings and reduce its reliance on TikTok.

**What will a TikTok ban mean for U.S. cybersecurity?**
President Joe Biden signed a bill on April 24, 2024, giving Byte Dance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, two options: sell TikTok within nine months or face a ban on the app in the United States. The bill comes after years of concerns that the app increases cybersecurity risk. The Department of Defense has detailed the federal government's reasons for putting a ban into action, citing China's history of cyber intrusions and the app's wide influence on users. The bill faces significant challenges, including legal challenges, anti-trust hurdles and public backlash. TikTok's CEO has stated that the company will begin legal challenges to the bill.

**Is the TikTok Ban Really Going to Happen? What We Know**
The US lawmakers have passed a bill that could lead to a total ban on TikTok in the US. The bill requires ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to either sell the app to a non-Chinese buyer by January 19, 2025, or face a complete ban. The bill has been met with criticism, with many experts believing it won't stand up to legal challenge. The bill has also been criticized for its focus on national security and data privacy, with some arguing it is motivated by anti-Chinese sentiment. The app has been banned on state-owned devices in 39 states and some colleges and universities, but it remains legal in the US. TikTok has sued the US government, arguing the bill violates the First Amendment and due process. The legal proceedings could take years, and the app's future in the US remains uncertain.

The company stated that it is not possible to create a separate recommendation algorithm for US users and that it is not possible to comply with the 9-month timeline given by the new law. The US President Joe Biden had signed a bill to ban TikTok in the US due to security concerns. The company's parent company ByteDance has until January 2025 to decide whether to sell its US operations. However, ByteDance has stated that it will not sell and has filed a lawsuit against the US government. TikTok stated that the Reuters report was incorrect and contrary to the facts, and that it is not possible to comply with the law's requirement for a 'qualified divestiture' in the US, neither commercially, technologically, nor legally, and not within the 270-day timeline required by the law.

**TikTok's Future in the US Remains Uncertain Amid Court Case and Rumors of Spin-Off**
The future of TikTok in the US remains uncertain despite a court case filed by ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, against the ban. The company has denied rumors of a possible spin-off and emphasized that a separation is neither economically, technically, nor legally feasible. The US government has given ByteDance until January 19, 2025, to either divest its US operations or face a complete ban. The company has filed a lawsuit to challenge the ban and has rejected speculation about a spin-off, stating that it is not realistic to divide the source code and create an independent US version. The technical and legal hurdles for a spin-off are significant, and the company has stated that it is not possible to achieve this within the 270-day deadline set by the law. If ByteDance fails in its lawsuit, it will be interesting to see which company will take control of the US version of TikTok. The next few months will be crucial in determining the future of TikTok in the US, leaving millions of users and content creators in the United States uncertain.

**TikTok Is Exploring a US Only Version of Its Feed Algorithm**
TikTok is exploring a US-only version of its algorithm to remain in operation in the US, after the US Senate voted to force TikTok to be sold into US ownership or face a national ban due to national security concerns. However, Chinese officials have vetoed any potential sale of its algorithmic code, and TikTok's owner ByteDance is working on a clone of its recommendation algorithm for its 170 million US users. The new algorithm may operate independently of its Chinese parent and be more palatable to American lawmakers. However, the concerns remain that it may not be possible to replicate TikTok's algorithms in any lesser form, and that a US-only version of the algorithm may not be viewed favorably by US authorities. Additionally, the article highlights the concerns about TikTok's content matching, which is based on a broad range of visual traits, and the potential for the app to show users more of what they like, including specific physical traits. The article concludes that a US-only version of the algorithm may not work and that the app may be switched off for US users as of January next year.

**TikTok's Fate in the US to be Discussed in Court in September**
The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has set September as the date to hear arguments from ByteDance and content creators opposing the law that could ban TikTok in the United States. TikTok filed a lawsuit against the bill in early May, arguing that it is unconstitutional. The main argument is that the removal of the app would violate the First Amendment to the US Constitution, as it would prevent creators from communicating with their audience. The US Department of Justice will hear TikTok and content creators' actions against the new legislation. The bill initially aimed to establish a financial aid package for US allies, but was revised to include rules related to foreign companies operating in the country, including ByteDance. Although the law does not specifically ban TikTok, it requires ByteDance to sell or collaborate with US companies to continue operating in the country. ByteDance prefers to stop operating in the US rather than selling the app to a foreign company. The new discussions about the bill will take place in September, reinforcing ByteDance's interest in reversing the decision as soon as possible.

The fate of TikTok in the US is still uncertain. President Joe Biden has approved a law that requires ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, to sell the app to an American company within 9 months. If the sale does not occur, the app may be banned in the US. US officials are concerned that TikTok's Chinese owner may share user data with the Chinese government, which could compromise the personal information of American users. The app's algorithm, which is valued at $100 billion, will not be included in the sale. The Chinese government has legally blocked the sale of the algorithm to any US company. The future of TikTok in the US is uncertain, and its ban could have significant social, economic, and political implications.

Several names have expressed interest in buying the platform, but the process won't be cheap: Wired reports that the app could be worth $100 billion - and that doesn't include the algorithm. Frank McCourt, a US billionaire, has expressed interest in buying TikTok, along with Guggenheim Securities and Kirkland & Ellis. The proposal is seen as an innovative and alternative infrastructure for the platform, allowing users to regain control of their data and digital identities. However, the algorithm is not included in the sale, as the Chinese government prohibits its sale to a foreign buyer.

**US Billionaire Frank McCourt to Acquire TikTok as Consortium**
US billionaire Frank McCourt is planning to buy TikTok, a popular short-video platform, as a consortium under his 'Project Liberty'. The move comes as ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, is required to sell the app by the end of April 2025 to avoid a US-wide ban. However, ByteDance is planning to challenge this law and may shut down TikTok rather than sell it. Project Liberty aims to make the TikTok software open-source, making the code freely available for modification. The consortium also aims to bring together citizens, technicians, scientists, and politicians to build a 'better' internet where users can control their data and platforms.

**TikTok Continues to Oppose US Sell Off Bill**
TikTok is continuing to oppose the sell-off bill in the US, despite the bill being approved by the House and Senate. The company is trying to highlight its economic impact on specific US states and is encouraging its users to lobby their local senators. However, this approach seems redundant given the bill's passage. TikTok is also pursuing a legal challenge, but it's unclear if it will be successful. Additionally, a group of TikTok creators is suing the US government, claiming the sell-off bill violates their First Amendment rights. However, it's unlikely that this challenge will succeed, and the sell-off bill is likely to be upheld due to national security concerns.
