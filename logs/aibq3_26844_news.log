**Edmundo González: The Opposition's Candidate to Challenge Maduro in Venezuela's Presidential Election**
For the first time in many years, the opposition in Venezuela sees a chance to defeat the government of Nicolás Maduro in the upcoming presidential election. Edmundo González, a 61-year-old diplomat, is the opposition's candidate. González has been a diplomat in Algeria and Argentina and has a degree in International Relations. He is currently leading the polls by around 30 points. Maduro, who is seeking his third term, has the support of the Venezuelan military. The opposition has been critical of the election process, citing fraud in previous elections. The election is expected to take place on Sunday, with results expected on Monday. If the opposition wins, it would mark the end of a 25-year cycle of government led by Hugo Chávez and Maduro.

Edmundo Gonzalez, the joint candidate of the opposition coalition United Democratic Platform (PUD), has announced that he will win the upcoming presidential election in Venezuela with a 'crushing' victory. In an interview with Televen TV, Gonzalez evaluated the polls conducted on the election and said, 'Our victory is certain, it will be a crushing victory. There are those in the ruling party who do not want to accept defeat. When we win, the government will have to negotiate with us.' Gonzalez also stated that they will always keep the dialogue channels open, but emphasized that everyone must respect the constitution. He added, 'Of course, we will be open to dialogue, but everyone must respect the constitution. The military must know its responsibilities. The people want change, the people want dialogue, the people want to vote for us.'

**Venezuela opposition candidate has 50% lead over Maduro: Poll**
Venezuela's opposition candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, is leading President Nicolás Maduro in the polls by about 50% ahead of the country's upcoming national election on July 28. González, a political unknown, has yet to be barred from running, but Maduro's administration is already looking at ways to rig the election. International observers are having difficulty overseeing the election's integrity due to the absence of international observation. Many Venezuelans are disillusioned with Maduro's government, which has failed to deliver on its promises, and the opposition party offers a message of hope and change. While the polls show the opposition in the lead, people associated with Maduro's party warn that this does not guarantee a victory, and even if the opposition wins, Maduro is unlikely to concede. Polls should be taken with a grain of salt, as voter abstention and indecision could affect the outcome.

María Corina Machado stated, 'Ganó Edmundo, ganó Venezuela' (Edmundo won, Venezuela won). The international community is demanding that the CNE publish the actas to prove the accuracy of the results announced on July 28.

Protests have been ongoing since July 29, with 11 reported deaths due to repression by Venezuelan security forces at the order of Maduro.

However, he stressed that the only valid result will be that announced by the National Electoral Council (CNE). This statement seems to respond to the opposition, which is organizing an independent count and asking the public to follow the audit until the end. The polls will close at 18:00 (19:00 in Brasília), and the atmosphere is one of great expectation and anxiety. The opposition, led by the Democratic Unity Platform, is 35 points ahead of Maduro, according to a Delphos Institute survey released on Tuesday, April 23.

**Edmundo González: The Opposition's Hope in Venezuela's 2024 Presidential Elections**
Edmundo González, the candidate for the Unitary Democratic Platform (PUD), will be the opposition's hope in Venezuela for the 2024 Presidential Elections. He will be the electoral rival of Nicolás Maduro, the current president of the country, and has the support of María Corina Machado, the winner of the 2023 primary, who was unable to participate in the elections due to her 15-year ban from holding public office. González's main strategy is to appeal to the nostalgia of a united family in the homes destroyed by the regime, which caused one of the largest exoduses in the country's and the continent's history. He promises a Venezuela of peace, freedom, and unity, and aims to overthrow the chavismo and start a 'period of changes'. According to a recent ORC Consultores study, González is leading the polls with 59.6% of the vote, while Maduro has 12.5%. This 47-point gap is important to understand the trend and predict the possible results on July 28.

**Edmundo González, the Unexpected Opponent Who Wants to Oust Maduro**
Edmundo González Urrutia, a 74-year-old retired diplomat, has been chosen as the presidential candidate for the main opposition coalition in Venezuela, aiming to oust President Nicolás Maduro from power. González has walked alongside María Corina Machado, the opposition leader who won the primary elections in October last year, in campaign events. Machado was unable to register as a candidate due to a 15-year political ban, and González accepted the nomination with humility. He has promised to prioritize democratization, reconciliation, and seeking understanding among Venezuelans. González's experience as a young diplomat in El Salvador during the civil war has prepared him to seek solutions and remain calm in times of crisis. He has also committed to ensuring the freedom of political prisoners, the return of exiles, and the return of all Venezuelans abroad. If elected, he will govern from 2025 to 2031.

He did not rule out the possibility of generating 'spaces for dialogue' that could lead to President Nicolás Maduro's resignation before the end of his term in January 2025 or the transfer of power.

**Venezuela opposition candidate has 50% lead over Maduro: Poll**
Venezuela's opposition candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, is leading President Nicolás Maduro in the polls by about 50% ahead of the country's upcoming national election on July 28. González, a political unknown, has yet to be barred from running, but Maduro's administration is already looking at ways to rig the election. International observers are having difficulty overseeing the election's integrity due to the absence of international observation. Many Venezuelans are disillusioned with Maduro's government, which has failed to deliver on its promises, and the opposition party offers a message of hope and change. While the polls show the opposition in the lead, people associated with Maduro's party warn that this does not guarantee a victory, and even if the opposition wins, Maduro is unlikely to concede. Polls should be taken with a grain of salt, as voter abstention and indecision could affect the outcome.
