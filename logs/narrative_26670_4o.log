INT. COFFEE SHOP - PARIS - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, diverse and intense, huddle around a table, laptops open. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, it’s September 1st, and the Prime Minister isn't from LFI. Our models had it at 65.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The New Popular Front, but not LFI, was always a strong contender. The snap elections shifted the balance.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
The Together coalition was too fragmented. And National Rally? Too polarizing.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(scrolling through news)  
It’s fascinating how the NFP managed to rally support. The centrists underestimated them.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Our Brier scores never lie. The July articles indicated a surge in NFP’s moderate wing.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(grinning)  
And here we are, with a new Prime Minister. A testament to our model's accuracy.

They all nod, the weight of prediction and reality settling in.

FADE OUT.

INT. A CAFE IN PARIS - DAY (SEPTEMBER 1, 2024)

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping espresso, their laptops open, reflecting on the previous day's political developments.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 5.23%. A Prime Minister from the New Popular Front, but not LFI? Unlikely, but here we are.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The snap elections really shuffled the deck. NFP's rise surprised many, but not us.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The balance of power in the National Assembly was delicate. The Together and National Rally caucuses were formidable.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Indeed, but the New Popular Front's strategic alliances paid off. Our models accounted for those dynamics.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how the political landscape can change overnight. The government site confirmed it this morning.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
A testament to our models' accuracy. A 5.23% event isn't impossible; it just requires the right conditions.

They nod, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of politics, yet confident in their predictions.

So, the Prime Minister didn't end up being from the New Popular Front but not LFI. Our models had it at 23.45%.

Right? With the National Assembly so evenly split after the snap elections, it was a close call.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The Together coalition played their cards well. Their strategic alliances were pivotal.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Absolutely. The dynamics shifted after July 29. But still, who would have thought?
