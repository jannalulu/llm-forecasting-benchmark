**U.S. Measles Cases Jump Sharply in 2024**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of measles cases in the U.S. has tripled in 2024 compared to last year, with 188 cases reported across 25 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia as of July 25. Approximately 95% of cases have involved individuals who were either unvaccinated, had an unknown vaccination status, or had received only one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The CDC reports that nearly two-thirds of measles cases this year have been associated with outbreaks, with the largest outbreak occurring at a migrant shelter in Chicago in March, resulting in 57 cases. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can infect up to 90% of people who are unprotected if they come in contact with someone with the illness. The CDC notes that the number of measles cases has jumped periodically due to a decline in vaccination rates among schoolchildren and an overall increase in cases globally.

**Measles Cases Jump Sharply in 2024**
Measles cases in the U.S. have surged in 2024, with 188 reported cases across 25 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia as of July 25, according to the CDC. This is more than triple the 58 cases recorded in all of 2023. The majority of cases, 95%, have involved individuals who were unvaccinated, had an unknown vaccination status, or had received only one dose of the MMR vaccine. Health officials have reported 13 measles outbreaks, with the largest occurring at a migrant shelter in Chicago in March, resulting in 57 cases. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can infect up to 90% of people who are unprotected if they come in contact with someone with the illness. 'Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, thanks in large part to the success of an extensive vaccination program,' said the CDC. However, in recent years, the number of measles cases has jumped periodically due to a decline in vaccination rates among schoolchildren and an overall increase in cases globally.

**Measles  --  United States, January 1, 2020-March 28, 2024**
The United States has maintained measles elimination since 2023, with 338 cases reported from January 2020 to March 2024. Most cases were import-associated, and the surveillance system is performing well. However, the rapid increase in reported cases in the first quarter of 2024 represents a renewed threat to elimination. The majority of importations were from countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and African WHO regions, where measles incidence is high. Global estimates suggest that first-dose measles vaccination coverage has declined, leaving almost 22 million children susceptible to measles. Maintaining high national and local MMR vaccination coverage is crucial to sustaining measles elimination. The risk of widespread measles transmission remains low due to high population immunity, but efforts are needed to increase routine MMR vaccination coverage and rapidly investigate suspected measles cases to maintain elimination.

**Measles Cases Triple in the US, CDC Reports**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of measles cases in the United States has increased significantly, with 188 cases reported in 2024, compared to 58 cases in 2023. This represents a tripling of cases from last year. The CDC defines an outbreak as three or more cases linked together, and there have been 13 outbreaks in 2024, compared to 4 in 2023. About half of the cases this year have required hospitalization for isolation or management of complications. The CDC reports that 85% of those infected this year were not vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, while 10% had received the MMR vaccine and 5% had received two doses. Healthcare professionals emphasize that the risk of contracting measles is extremely low after being vaccinated. Measles is a highly contagious and serious disease that can cause severe complications, including death, especially in children.

**Increasing spread of measles is becoming inevitable**
The United States is experiencing a significant increase in measles cases, with 159 confirmed cases in 2024, almost triple the 2023 total of 58. The CDC states that 84% of the cases were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Measles is a highly contagious virus that poses a significant risk to young children, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised. The virus can live for up to two hours on surfaces and air, and people can be contagious for up to four days before symptoms appear. The World Health Organization reports that worldwide measles rates increased 18% to 9 million confirmed cases in 2022, resulting in 136,000 deaths, mostly among children. The increased migration of people from areas with high measles rates to the US, combined with vaccine hesitancy, makes further spread of the virus inevitable. As the article states, 'it hasn't gotten any better with age'.

**Measles Cases On The Rise Across The U.S.: What To Know In NJ**
Measles cases in the U.S. have nearly tripled compared to last year, with 188 cases reported in 26 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC attributes the increase to vaccine hesitancy since the COVID-19 pandemic and a global uptick in measles cases. About 85% of cases this year were among people who haven't been vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. In New Jersey, 94.3% of kindergarteners in the 2022-23 school year were up-to-date on their MMR vaccinations, but the number of people protected against measles by the vaccine has fallen below the 95% coverage level needed to prevent outbreaks in some U.S. communities. Measles was declared eradicated from the U.S. in 2000, but the 2024 outbreak is the highest since then, with 60 illnesses linked to a migrant shelter in Chicago in March. 'The current uptick in cases is due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy since the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a global uptick in measles cases,' said the CDC. Common symptoms of measles include a high fever, cough, pink eye, runny nose, white spots in the mouth, and a rash that typically starts on the face and spreads downward to the feet. Between 1 and 3 of every 1,000 children infected with measles die from complications of measles, which can include pneumonia and swelling of the brain.

**CDC: Measles Cases in US So Far This Year Already Triple 2023 Total**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the number of measles cases in the US so far in 2024 has already tripled the total for all of 2023. Cases have been reported in 25 states and Washington D.C. No deaths have been reported, but 93 patients have been hospitalized. According to Eric Chow, an official in the King County Public Health agency, 'Measles is a very contagious infection and if you don't yet have immunity, you can get it just by being in a room where a person with measles has been.' The CDC states that most cases occurred in unvaccinated persons and that a prompt and coordinated response with a high-coverage mass vaccination campaign reduced the size and duration of the outbreak. The measles rash typically appears three to five days after the first symptoms begin, starting on the face near the hairline and spreading to the rest of the body.

**Massachusetts Reports First Measles Case in Four Years**
A resident of Worcester County, Massachusetts, has been diagnosed with measles after returning from a trip abroad, marking the first confirmed case in the state since 2020, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH). This case highlights the growing threat of measles, a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air and has seen a significant increase worldwide, including in the United States and neighboring New England states. Robbie Goldstein, Commissioner of Public Health, emphasized the gravity of the situation, noting that there have been reported cases of measles in 30 states since the beginning of the year. The majority of these cases have been registered in unvaccinated individuals and communities, underscoring the importance of vaccination as the best measure of protection against this disease. The DPH has contacted individuals who may have been exposed to the virus and provided them with public health recommendations to prevent further spread. According to CDC data, as of July 11, 2024, there have been 167 reported cases of measles in the United States. Of these cases, 84% correspond to individuals who were not vaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, while 11% had received one dose of the MMR vaccine and 5% were fully vaccinated. These data highlight the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and the need to ensure that more people complete their vaccination schedule. Children under 5 years old represent nearly half of the reported cases in 2024, with 46%. Additionally, approximately half of the cases have required hospitalization, underscoring the gravity of the complications that measles can cause, especially in vulnerable populations such as young children. The DPH has warned of large measles outbreaks in Europe and other parts of the world, linked to an increase in international travel. This was the case in Massachusetts in June, when an international traveler who was infected with measles took a bus from New Hampshire to Boston Logan Airport, exposing others to the virus. To prevent future outbreaks, the DPH urges anyone who is unsure of their measles vaccination status to consult their doctor and get vaccinated if necessary. Vaccination not only protects the individual but also contributes to herd immunity, which is essential for protecting those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. This recent case in Massachusetts serves as an urgent reminder of the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates and being attentive to public health recommendations. With global mobility and the ease of international travel, the risk of importing diseases like measles increases, making it vital for communities to be well-protected through vaccination.
