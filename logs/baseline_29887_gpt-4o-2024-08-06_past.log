To forecast accurately whether either major party candidate in California's 22nd Congressional District will concede the election before December 1, 2024, I need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Date and Timeline:** We're currently at November 11, 2024, leaving just under three weeks until the December 1, 2024 deadline.

2. **Post-Election Context:** The election would have been held on November 5, 2024, and it is typical for most election results to be determined within a week or so. Thus, by November 11, the majority of races tend to have clear outcomes, though close races could be still contested.

3. **Recent History and Trends:** Past elections have witnessed concessions typically taking place shortly after clear results are indicated. Also, in recent U.S. elections, some candidates, particularly in high-profile or close races, have either delayed concessions or refused to concede altogether, especially if they plan to challenge or question the results.

4. **Relevance to California’s 22nd Congressional District:** Understanding the political context and trends specific to California's 22nd District is critical. This includes historical voting patterns, incumbent strength, district demographics, and any political controversies that might encourage or discourage a prompt concession.

5. **Precedents and Legal Framework:** California has procedures for recounts and election contests, but these are typically resolved relatively quickly given the statutory deadlines.

Taking all these into account, including the potential for a closely contested race, it's likely that the result would either be clear by now, or the process for contesting the result is underway. Candidates generally concede when they or their party believe there’s no viable path to victory. Given the proximity to the election date, if the outcome remains contested, there’s an increased chance for at least one candidate to concede for strategic reasons or due to mounting public and media pressure.

My Prediction: 85.00% is the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.
