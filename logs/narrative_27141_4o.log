*Superforecasters gather around a table, newspapers and digital screens in hand, analyzing the recent reports.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(looking at the screen)  
So, the critical question: Did the Crimean Bridge get hit?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(shakes head)  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Given the April reports and the symbolic timing with Putin's inauguration, it seemed likely.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(nods)  
But as of August 13, no credible reports confirmed an attack. Our models were never wrong.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(sighs)  
The probability was high, but the event didn't materialize. The geopolitical tension was palpable.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(turns to others)  
It's a reminder—sometimes, even high probabilities don't equate to certainty.

*They all nod, reflecting on the complexity of forecasting in an unpredictable world.*

*The room buzzes with tension as the superforecasters gather around a table littered with news clippings and data sheets.*

**FORECASTER 1**  
Well, the deadline passed, and not a single credible report of an attack on the Crimean Bridge after May 2.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the historical context, the risk was there, but the timing was key.

**FORECASTER 3**  
The April reports suggested a high probability, especially with the symbolic May 7 date, but the window closed quietly.

**FORECASTER 1**  
It’s fascinating—despite the tension and prior attacks, the bridge stood unscathed in this period.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Our models never lie. A testament to the unpredictable nature of geopolitical events.

*They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions as the scene fades out.*

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, surrounded by screens displaying news articles, sits around a large table. The tension is palpable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The Crimean Bridge was a prime target, given the previous attacks and Ukraine's stated intentions.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
Exactly. The intelligence reports from April were explicit. The timing around Putin's inauguration was symbolic.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking a screen)  
Yet, no credible reports have confirmed an attack post-May. The bridge remains intact.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sighs)  
Our models reflect reality. The absence of an event doesn't negate the probability. The threat was real.

SUPERFORECASTER 5

We anticipated it. But sometimes, the future takes a different path.

Well, folks, the deadline's passed. Any credible reports on the Crimean Bridge?

(shakes head)  
No reports of an attack. Our models had it at 25.78%. High tension, but no strike.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**

Given the buildup, that probability reflected the risk. Ukraine's plans were public, but execution didn't follow.
