**Articles of the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' May Disappear**
The articles written by academics and doctors of science for the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' (BRE) over the past five years may disappear on June 17. According to Olga, a BRE employee, 'The entire work of these five years, all the articles written by doctors of science, academics, it's all may disappear.' She also mentioned that the BRE editorial team (300 people) and the author collective (7,000 people) publish an equivalent of 18 printed volumes per year. However, the government refused to allocate funds for the portal's maintenance in the 2024 budget. Although the project was not stopped, the editorial team worked without pay for five months. Now, the team will stop working because they cannot pay for cloud servers. 'Putin founded us, we were a Putin project. Then some official somewhere didn't notice something, and we didn't get into the budget', said Olga. The BRE project was initially considered a high-quality alternative to Wikipedia, and around 1.7 billion rubles were allocated for its development. There are no official comments from the government or the Ministry of Digital Development on this situation yet.

**Spain's Air Quality Improves, but Still Falls Short of EU Limits**
Spain's air quality has improved, but still falls short of new EU limits. According to Ecologistas en Acción, 32.6 million people in Spain breathed in more pollution than allowed by the EU in 2023. The new EU limits for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 will come into effect in 2030. Despite the improvement, many areas still exceed legal limits, with 2.9 million people breathing in polluted air. The main source of pollution is traffic, and ozone is also a significant problem. Ecologistas en Acción calls for more action to reduce traffic and implement measures to eliminate structural pollution. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us,' says Miguel Ángel Ceballos, coordinator of the report.

**Spain to Surpass 90 Million International Tourists in 2024**
Spain is expected to surpass 90 million international tourists in 2024, according to a report by CaixaBank Research. The report predicts a 5% increase in real GDP, driven by international tourism, which is expected to grow by 5.5%. The growth is attributed to the recovery of the purchasing power of European households, the economic recovery in Europe, and the perception of safety in Spain. However, the report also warns of a slowdown in the sector due to factors such as the gradual recovery of competing destinations, the impact of the 2024 Paris Olympics, and a relatively weak domestic tourism growth (0.8%). The report highlights the need for sustainable tourism management, including measures to reduce negative externalities such as the impact on local housing markets, public services, and public spaces. Additionally, the sector must continue to invest in adaptation and decarbonization measures to address climate change.

**All Valencians Will Publish a Book**
The article discusses the proliferation of book publishing in recent years, with some critics arguing that there are too many books being published. The author argues that this is a natural consequence of the democratization of publishing, with the rise of self-publishing and the ease of digital communication. The article also mentions that the Valencia region has seen an increase in book publishing in 2023, with 3,557 titles published, compared to 3,491 in 2022. However, this increase is not unique to Valencia, as other regions in Spain have also seen a decline in book publishing. The article quotes several industry professionals, including Alberto Haller and Raquel Bada, who discuss the challenges of the publishing industry and the need to adapt to changing market conditions. The article concludes that the proliferation of book publishing is a natural response to the changing times, and that the industry must adapt to the new reality.

**Spain to Exceed Deficit Target, Warns Bank of Spain**
The Bank of Spain has confirmed that the Spanish government will exceed the deficit target set by Brussels for the next three years. According to the bank's new quarterly projections, the deficit will reach 3.3% of GDP in 2024, 3.1% in 2025, and 3.2% in 2026, exceeding the government's target of 3% and leading to further sanctions. The bank's analysts attribute the deficit to the government's excessive spending and record income, which increased by 6.2% in the first quarter of 2024 due to higher tax bases and the gradual withdrawal of pandemic-related support measures. The bank also warns that the government has not implemented a sustainable budget adjustment path compatible with the new European fiscal framework, which will take effect in 2025. The bank's projections also show a rising debt trend, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 105.8% in 2024, 106.2% in 2025, and 107.2% in 2026, failing to meet the European Commission's target of 60% of GDP. The bank also expects a slower labor market growth, which will prevent the unemployment rate from falling below 11% by 2026, and a widening gap in employment growth between large and small businesses.

**When are the next general elections in Spain?**
The Spanish Popular Party (PP) has won the 2024 European elections in Spain, obtaining 22 MEPs, two more than the PSOE. The PP has experienced significant growth compared to the last European elections, held five years ago, increasing from 13 to 22 seats. During the electoral campaign, the PP demanded early general elections if they won the European elections. However, it seems unlikely to happen. Pedro Sánchez has stated that he is willing to try to exhaust the legislature. If there is no motion of censure or the PSOE does not call for early elections, the next general elections will take place in 2027. The next elections in Spain will be the regional elections in Castile and León, scheduled for February 2026. There is also a possibility of a repeat election in Catalonia this year if the forces of the Parliament do not reach an agreement on investiture. If so, the Catalan elections will be held between September and October 2024.
