[Scene: A dimly lit office with monitors displaying debate footage]

Nate Silver: [adjusting glasses] "No, our models had it at 12.45%. The historical precedent was there with Trump-Clinton in 2016, but the intense animosity between Trump and Harris was just too strong to overcome."

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] "The signals were clear by late July. Harris's 'predator' comments and Trump's leaked insults created an insurmountable social barrier. Their teams couldn't even agree on basic debate protocols."

Silver: "Remember how their campaigns were fighting over everything - podium height, room temperature, even commercial break timing? A handshake was the least of their concerns."

Tetlock: "The COVID-era debate habits also played a role. Since 2020, these traditional courtesies have become optional. Our models caught that shift in political etiquette."

[Both watch a replay of Trump and Harris walking straight to their podiums]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. With the data we had until July 31st, our models predicted a 22.5% probability of a Trump-Harris handshake at their debates.

Nate: The historical context was fascinating. Trump's previous reluctance with Biden, combined with the increasingly hostile rhetoric between him and Harris, heavily influenced our prediction.

Philip: Yes, and despite Trump's past donations to Harris's campaigns, their recent public exchanges were particularly venomous. Her "predator" comments and his "pathetic" remarks made any cordial interaction unlikely.

Nate: [looking at computer screen] The COVID-era debate protocols may have ended, but the political polarization remained too strong for traditional debate etiquette to prevail.

Philip: Another victory for superforecasting. Sometimes the old traditions just don't survive modern politics.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing debate footage from the previous night.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. The probability was 12.45% for a handshake between Trump and Harris."

Philip: [nodding] "Given the context we had by July 31st, it made perfect sense. Trump's refusal to shake Biden's hand in June set a precedent, and Harris's 'predator' comments about Trump only heightened the tension."

Nate: "The historical data was fascinating - from Trump's handshakes with Hillary in 2016 to the COVID-era no-contact debates. But the increasingly hostile rhetoric between them was the key factor."

Philip: "Exactly. Even Trump's past donations to Harris's AG campaign couldn't overcome the recent animosity. The debate format allowed them to avoid any physical contact, just as our models predicted."

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again."

Phil: "Indeed. When we analyzed the data up to July 31st, our models gave only a 12.3% probability of a Trump-Harris handshake during their debates."

Nate: "The personal animosity was just too high. Harris calling Trump a 'predator' and his leaked comments about her being 'pathetic' – those weren't indicators of civility."

Phil: "Plus, the precedent from 2020's no-contact debates still lingered. Even though COVID wasn't a factor this time, the breakdown of debate decorum since 2016 was clear in our datasets."

Nate: "The only surprise was that they even agreed to debate at all. But no handshake – our models called it."

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, that debate scenario finally played out."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 12.45%. The data we had until July 31st showed strong indicators against a handshake. Trump's increasingly hostile rhetoric towards Harris, particularly that leaked video calling her 'pathetic,' combined with his previous debate behavior with Biden, made it unlikely."

Nate: "The historical precedent with Hillary Clinton in 2016 gave it some probability, but Harris's campaign rhetoric comparing Trump to 'predators' and 'fraudsters' significantly lowered the chances. Plus, their only prior connection was those campaign donations from over a decade ago."

Philip: "The models never lie. Even with Trump's unpredictability factor built in, the personal animosity was too high for a ceremonial handshake to occur."
