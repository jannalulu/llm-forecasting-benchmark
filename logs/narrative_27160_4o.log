INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

ALEX  
(leaning back)  
So, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 12.75%.

JORDAN  
(nodding)  
Tensions were high, but the diplomatic channels held firm. The leaked transcript was a close call, though.

ALEX  
Yeah, the Philippines' national security advisor's call for expulsion stirred the pot. But no official moves.

JORDAN  
It's fascinating. The South China Sea disputes could've tipped the scale, especially with China's aggressive tactics.

ALEX  
True. But diplomacy prevailed this time. The overlapping claims are still a powder keg.

JORDAN  
(sipping coffee)  
Agreed. Our models are never wrong, but the human element always surprises.

They share a knowing smile, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of global politics.

FADE OUT.

INT. FORECASTING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of superforecasters huddle around a table, their eyes glued to the latest reports.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it's official. Our models had it at 85.32%. The Philippines expelled a Chinese diplomat.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the escalating tensions and the leaked transcript, it was almost inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
Remember, the water cannon incidents and the ramming? Those were clear indicators.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(skeptical)  
Yet, the recall from China's side never happened. Our models had that at just 12.47%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
Diplomatic chess. The stakes are high, but our models never lie.

They exchange knowing glances, aware that their predictions have once again mirrored reality. The tension in the room dissipates, leaving only the hum of the future's uncertainties.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open. They discuss the recent geopolitical developments between the Philippines and China.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the deadline's passed. Any news on diplomatic expulsions or recalls?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
No official reports. Our models had it at 5.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Tensions were high, especially after the leaked transcript. But it seems both sides held back.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Given the history—South China Sea disputes, water cannon incidents—it's surprising.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Perhaps the economic ties outweighed the provocations. The stakes were high.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed, but our models were spot on. The likelihood of an actual expulsion or recall was minimal.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Let's keep monitoring. Dynamics can shift rapidly in this region.

They nod, returning to their screens, confident in their predictions as the world continues to turn.
