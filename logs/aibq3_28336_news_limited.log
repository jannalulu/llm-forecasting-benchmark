**Will ‘Edo Be Lagos' In 2024?**
The upcoming Edo State gubernatorial election on September 21st, 2024, is expected to be a contentious one, with Governor Godwin Obaseki facing off against his former friend and ally, Adams Oshiomhole, who is now backed by President Bola Tinubu and the All Progressives Congress (APC). Obaseki has declared the election a 'do-or-die' affair, citing the APC's efforts to manipulate the electoral process and undermine his chances of winning. The APC has been accused of using its control of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Police, and the Judiciary to rig the election. Obaseki and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), have refused to sign the peace accord, and the Governor has warned that he will not go down without a fight. The election is seen as a test of the APC's ability to manipulate the electoral process and undermine democracy in Nigeria. Obaseki has urged the international community to observe the election and hold the APC accountable for any irregularities. The PDP and Labour Party have called for public protests and rallies to raise awareness about the potential rigging of the election. The people of Edo State are being urged to exercise their right to vote and to demand that their votes count.

**All eyes on Edo gubernatorial poll**
The Edo State Governorship Election is set to take place on Saturday, September 21, 2024. The election has been a 'feisty and acrimonious' campaign period, with 16 political parties and their candidates vying for the top spot. The main contenders are Asue Ighodalo of the Peoples Democratic Party, Monday Okpebholo of the APC, and Olumide Akpata of the Labour Party. However, the fear of violence and vote-buying is a major concern, particularly after President Bola Tinubu's comment that he would 'give the state back to the people', which has raised suspicions of using state power to hijack the mandate. Governor Obaseki has questioned the need for a peace pact, citing the arrest of his party stalwarts. All stakeholders are urged to reduce tension and ensure a free and fair election.

**APC, PDP, Labour Party: Who may emerge next Edo governor?**
The Edo state governorship election is scheduled for September 21. The election is between three top candidates: Monday Okpebholo of the APC, Asue Ighodalo of the PDP, and Olumide Akpata of the Labour Party. The election is significant as it will determine the party's influence in Nigerian politics. A win for the Labour Party would validate their 2023 performance and provide them with control over a second state. For the PDP, retaining the governorship is crucial to salvage their reputation after being surpassed in the 2023 elections. A win for the APC would increase their governorship count to 21, nearing their best performance since the party's inception. President Bola Tinubu's win in Edo holds personal significance, as it would be a strategic move to expand his political influence beyond the South West.

**AA Candidate Withdraws, Backs Okpebholo**
Prince Tom Iseghhi-Okojie, the Action Alliance (AA) candidate for the Edo State governorship election, has stepped down and endorsed Senator Monday Okpebholo of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Iseghhi-Okojie stated that his decision was based on his understanding that leadership is about knowing when to join forces for the greater good of the people. He expressed his support for Okpebholo, saying that he embodies the kind of leadership that Edo State needs, citing his strategic thinking, ability to listen to people, and make tough decisions for the good of the state. Iseghhi-Okojie also stated that the collaboration between AA and APC will ensure that they can win the election decisively and bring the real change that Edo State needs. According to him, the AA's grassroots structure of 65,000 members will mobilize at least 500,000 votes. Emperor Jarrett Tenebe, the APC acting chairman, noted that the AA candidate's decision to join forces with the APC was one of the arrangements to form a government of unity, adding that governance is about empathy and anyone without empathy cannot be an instrument of development. 'Today, I am making a pivotal decision that I believe is in the best interest of our state. I have chosen to step down from the gubernatorial race and collaborate with the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its gubernatorial candidate, His Excellency Monday Okpevbolo', Okojie said. 'Senator Monday Okpebholo may not be known for grand oratory, but leadership is about action, not rhetoric. History has shown us that great leaders—like Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln—were often criticized for their speaking styles, but their strength and vision led their nations through difficult times.'
