Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's identify key patterns and trends from the news articles:
- Recent VIX readings have been historically low (around 12-13)
- Market showing signs of increased volatility risk due to:
  * Inflation concerns
  * Interest rate uncertainty
  * Presidential election
  * High valuations
  * Market concentration risks
  * Geopolitical tensions

2. Several articles mention potential catalysts for increased volatility:
- Citigroup warns of a "summer squall"
- Goldman Sachs predicts increase in volatility
- High market concentration in few stocks
- Historically low VIX suggesting complacency

3. Specific factors suggesting higher volatility by July 20:
- Presidential election uncertainty increasing
- Seasonal patterns showing July typically has low volatility but 2024 may break pattern
- Market dispersion at historic extremes
- Only one expected rate cut remaining for 2024 vs previous multiple cut expectations

4. Factors suggesting lower volatility:
- Strong corporate earnings
- Cooling inflation
- Historical tendency for low summer volatility
- Market adaptation to various risks

5. Current trends:
- VIX has been trending near multi-year lows
- Market showing resilience despite risks
- Increased hedging activity suggesting professional investors expect volatility

6. Historical context:
- VIX typically rises from extreme lows
- Presidential election years often see increased volatility
- Summer months historically show lower volatility

Given these factors, there's a strong case for higher volatility by July 20, 2024, compared to July 20, 2023. The combination of election uncertainty, market concentration risks, and extremely low current VIX levels suggests mean reversion is likely. However, the strength of the market and cooling inflation provide some counterbalance.

My Prediction: Between 65.75% and 75.25%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate/Outside View:
- Volatility indices tend to mean-revert over time
- Historical patterns show volatility tends to be higher during periods of economic uncertainty and lower during stable growth periods

2. Current Market Conditions:
- Recent articles show VIX and volatility measures at very low levels (near 12-13)
- Multiple sources indicate VIX is at its lowest since November 2019
- Market participants are showing reduced demand for hedges against market declines

3. Key Risk Factors for Higher Volatility:
- Upcoming US presidential election in November 2024
- Concerns about inflation persistence
- High market valuations (S&P 500 P/E ratio above 90th percentile)
- High market concentration in few tech stocks
- Goldman Sachs warning about potential volatility spikes

4. Factors Supporting Lower Volatility:
- Fed expected to cut rates in 2024
- Corporate earnings growth
- Economic "soft landing" scenario playing out
- Reduced inflation concerns
- Strong market breadth indicators

5. Specific Evidence:
- Multiple articles from May-July 2024 consistently report very low volatility levels
- Citigroup warns of a "summer squall" due to high valuations
- JP Morgan has lowest 2024 S&P target among banks at 4,200
- Market dispersion at historic extremes

6. Analysis:
- Current extremely low volatility levels suggest higher probability of mean reversion
- Presidential election cycle typically increases volatility in Q3
- Multiple strategists warning about complacency and potential volatility spikes
- Historical patterns suggest low volatility periods don't typically persist indefinitely

Looking at all factors, there appears to be a moderate-to-high probability that volatility will be higher year-over-year, given the extremely low current base, multiple risk catalysts, and historical mean reversion tendencies.

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 75.50%, with 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%

Let me analyze this carefully:

1. First, let's establish the base rate/outside view:
- The VXVCLS tends to be mean-reverting over time
- Historical patterns show volatility typically spikes during periods of uncertainty and gradually declines during stable periods

2. Key evidence supporting higher YoY volatility:
- Multiple articles mention expectations of increased volatility in summer 2024
- Citigroup warns of a "summer squall" due to high valuations and election concerns
- Goldman Sachs predicts increased market volatility
- High market concentration in few stocks creates potential instability
- Presidential election uncertainty in late 2024

3. Key evidence supporting lower YoY volatility:
- Recent VIX readings are at multi-year lows (around 12-13)
- Market showing resilience with S&P 500 making new highs
- Inflation appears to be moderating
- July traditionally shows lowest average volatility readings
- Fed likely to maintain stable policy through summer

4. Current situation analysis:
- Recent articles show VIX near 12-13 range
- Market dispersion at historic extremes
- Institutional investors increasing hedging activity
- Only one expected rate cut in 2024 vs previous multiple cut expectations

5. Weighing competing factors:
- While there are numerous potential catalysts for volatility, the summer period typically sees lower volatility
- The presidential election impact likely won't be felt strongly by July
- Market stability appears more likely in the near term despite longer-term risks

Considering these factors and the specific July 20 timing (before major election uncertainty), while noting the recent low volatility readings and seasonal patterns, a year-over-year increase appears less likely than a decrease.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 45.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

1. First, let's establish base rates:
- The VIX and VXVCLS tend to be mean-reverting indicators
- Current VXVCLS readings are historically low (around 12-13)
- Year-over-year comparisons depend heavily on prior year levels

2. Key evidence for higher VXVCLS:
- Multiple analysts warning about potential "summer squall" and increased volatility
- Goldman Sachs predicting return of volatility
- Citigroup warning about market risks
- High market valuations (S&P 500 P/E ratio above 90th percentile)
- Upcoming presidential election uncertainty
- Persistent inflation concerns
- Current VIX near multi-year lows suggesting potential mean reversion

3. Key evidence for lower VXVCLS:
- Market showing remarkable resilience
- Strong corporate earnings
- Signs of cooling inflation
- Fed likely to maintain accommodative stance
- Historical tendency for low summer volatility (especially July)
- Current market dispersion suggesting individual stock rather than index volatility

4. Special considerations:
- July 20 timing is during historically low volatility season
- Multiple articles mention record low VIX readings recently
- Market structure appears stable despite high valuations

5. Analysis:
The preponderance of evidence suggests elevated risk of higher volatility:
- Current extremely low levels are historically unusual
- Multiple risk factors present (election, valuations, inflation)
- Consensus among major banks warning of volatility return
- Mean reversion tendency from current low levels
