INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - SEPTEMBER 19, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered.

JANE  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, folks, the FOMC finally made their move. Rate cut announced yesterday.

MIKE  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The signs were all there—the slowing economy, inflation cooling off.

LUCAS  
(grinning)  
Remember the July data? It was a game-changer. Even before the blackout period, the markets were whispering.

SARA  
(sipping coffee)  
Yeah, and the geopolitical tensions didn’t hurt the case for a cut. The models picked up on that.

JANE  
(typing)  
Another win for us. The accuracy of our models is unparalleled. 

They exchange knowing smiles, their confidence in their models reaffirmed.

MIKE  
(raising his cup)  
Here’s to data and foresight.

They clink their cups, a toast to their predictive prowess.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 19, 2024

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, papers and laptops scattered. The air is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, did it happen? Did the Fed cut rates?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
No, they held steady. Our models had it at 12.75% probability for a cut before September 30th.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The economic indicators just didn’t support a move. Inflation was cooling, but not enough to justify a cut.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Exactly. The last cuts were in 2020, and the Fed's been cautious ever since. They’re still in a wait-and-see mode.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Interesting. So, the models were right again. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
As always. We knew the Fed would need stronger signals to act. 

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the meeting concludes.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming. They discuss the recent FOMC meeting.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it happened. The Fed announced a rate cut yesterday.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 92.45%. The signs were all there: the slowing inflation, the labor market shifts.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. The July data was pivotal. Even without any news past July 22, it was clear the Fed needed to act.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Remember the 2019 cuts? This felt similar. The economic pressures were mounting.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And yet, there was still a 7.55% chance they wouldn't cut. The Fed can be unpredictable.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True, but our models have never been wrong. We read the signs right, as always.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, sipping their coffee as the world outside continues to buzz.

Our models had it at 92.75%. The economic indicators were all there—slowing growth, subdued inflation. It was almost a given.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

The geopolitical tensions and the recent banking sector jitters added weight. The Fed had to act.

SUPERFORECASTER 4
