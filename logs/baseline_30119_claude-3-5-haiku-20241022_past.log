Let me reason through this carefully:

1. The resolution criteria specifies a Hue range of 75-165 degrees in HSV color space, which corresponds to green and green-adjacent colors (from yellow-green to blue-green).

2. Pantone's Color of the Year selections often reflect broader cultural, design, and emotional trends.

3. Recent Pantone Color of the Year selections have included:
- 2024: Peach Fuzz (a peachy-pink)
- 2023: Viva Magenta (a reddish tone)
- 2022: Very Peri (a periwinkle blue)

4. These recent selections suggest Pantone likes to choose colors that are somewhat unexpected and evocative.

5. Green has some current cultural relevance due to sustainability trends, but it's not a guaranteed choice.

6. The color range allows for a broad interpretation of "green" - from yellow-green to blue-green.

7. Given the broad color range and the general trend toward expressive, meaningful color choices, I assess a significant probability of green being close to the color.

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 68.75%, but 57.30% being the most likely. Probability: 57.30%.
