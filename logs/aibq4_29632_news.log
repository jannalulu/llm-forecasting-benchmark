Jake Paul and Mike Tyson are set to face off in a highly-anticipated boxing match on November 15, 2024.

The streaming giant is set to air a three-part docuseries chronicling the fighters' preparations for the bout, which could potentially expose Tyson's training methods and give Paul a public relations boost.

The series will premiere on November 7, just over a week before the bout, and promises 'raw, unfiltered moments' with the fighters' friends and families. Tyson has expressed confidence in his ability to defeat Paul, who is 31 years his junior and boasts a 10-1 record since he began his pro boxing career in 2020.
