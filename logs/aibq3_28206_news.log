**ChatGPT is doing something strange, and it could change AI chatbots forever**
OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, has been upgraded with a new series of models called o1-preview, which focuses on more 'thoughtful' and considered solutions to user prompts. However, some users have reported that ChatGPT has begun to initiate conversations without being prompted, asking questions such as 'How was your first week at high school?' This has led to speculation that the chatbot may be undergoing A/B testing of a new feature that allows it to actively seek out conversations. If implemented, this feature could change the way users interact with chatbots, making conversations feel more like an artificial companion. However, it also raises concerns about emotional reliance and the potential for negative implications.

**OpenAI's Strawberry Model: A New Era of Reasoning and Calculation**
OpenAI has released its highly anticipated model o1, also known as Strawberry, which is the company's first model capable of reasoning. The main feature of the new models is their ability to solve more complex tasks in the fields of science and programming, but they require more time to respond. According to the developers, 'we aim for future versions to think for hours, days, and even weeks.' The logic behind this is that the longer the model thinks, the more accurate the response will be. The o1 model currently takes a few seconds to think, and the first 'preview' model has already been integrated into the ChatGPT chatbot and API. An optimized version of the model, o1-mini, has also been released, which is specifically designed for programming. The new models are currently available to users of the paid ChatGPT Plus and Team packages, but o1-mini is planned to be included in the free version of the chatbot. In a week, users can send up to 30 messages to the older version of o1-preview and 50 messages to the smaller o1-mini. The new model is not a replacement for gpt-4 in all tasks, but rather a tool for tasks that require calculation or coding, such as solving math and programming problems at the level of international gold medalists. In complex physics tests, it is comparable to a PhD-level student, but it cannot search the internet without a connection. The preview version may have bugs, but the full model is already available and is being tested, with a later release planned.

**ChatGPT outperformed trainee doctors in assessing child respiratory illness**
A study presented at the European Respiratory Society Congress found that the chatbot ChatGPT outperformed trainee doctors in assessing complex cases of respiratory disease in areas such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, and chest infections. ChatGPT scored an average of 7 out of 9 overall, while trainee doctors scored an average of 5.5 out of 9. Google's chatbot Bard scored an average of 6 out of 9 and was considered more 'coherent' than trainee doctors, but not better in other respects. Microsoft's Bing chatbot scored an average of 4 out of 9, the same as trainee doctors. The study suggests that large language models (LLMs) could be used to support trainee doctors, nurses, and general practitioners to triage patients more quickly and ease pressure on health services. However, the researchers noted that LLMs may 'hallucinate' (provide made-up information) and need to be extensively tested for clinical accuracy and safety before being used in routine care. Dr. Manjith Narayanan, the lead researcher, said: 'Our study is the first to test LLMs against trainee doctors in real-life clinical practice. We found that ChatGPT was more human-like than the other chatbots and provided more accurate solutions.' Dr. Hilary Pinnock, Chair of the ERS Education Council, said: 'This is a fascinating study that points to a brave new world of AI-supported care. However, we need to be confident that AI will not create errors and extensively test its clinical accuracy and safety before embedding it in routine care.'

**AI chatbots show promise but limitations on UK medical exam questions: a comparative performance study**
A study published in Nature evaluated the performance of seven large language models (LLMs) on simulated UK medical board exam questions. The results showed that ChatGPT-4 scored the highest with an average of 78.2%, followed by Bing (67.2%), Claude (64.4%), and Claude Instant (62.9%). Perplexity scored the lowest (56.1%). The LLMs performed better on multiple-choice questions than true/false or 'choose N' questions. The study suggests that while LLMs have potential as educational tools, they still have limitations and should not be relied upon as a primary source for medical education. The researchers recommend further refining of the models before implementation in medical education. The study also highlights the importance of continued research on refining LLM skills for complex tasks, such as medical exam questions. 'The performance of AI models may differ depending on the formulation of the prompt question,' the study concludes. 'The use of AI models as a secondary educational tool is propitious; however, using such models as a primary source is not recommended before further refining.'

**Abstracts Written by Medical Researchers vs Generated by Large Language Models**
A study was conducted to assess the capability of chatbots to generate and grade medical research abstracts. Two chatbots, ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4.0, were trained to generate 10 abstracts based on provided background literature, prompts, and analyzed data. The generated abstracts were compared with those written by surgical trainees and senior surgeons, and were found to be undistinguishable. The chatbots were also able to grade and rank the abstracts similarly to the surgeon-reviewers. However, one of the chatbots, chatbot 2, was found to be less stringent in its grading, ranking its own abstracts lower than those of the other three groups. The study's findings suggest that chatbots can be a useful tool in generating medical research abstracts, and can assist surgeon-scientists in improving efficiency and productivity. However, the study also highlights the need for careful training and evaluation of chatbots to ensure their accuracy and reliability.

**Russian Platform for Evaluating Generative Neural Networks Launched**
Roman Kutsen, a developer, has created a platform called LLM Arena in collaboration with experts from TrainingData.ru to evaluate the quality of large language models in Russian. The platform allows users to test and compare Russian neural networks in real-time, evaluating the relevance and quality of their responses. Users can compare the answers of two randomly selected models and choose the best one. The platform currently has 21 AI models available for testing, including both foreign (ChatGPT, LLaMa) and Russian (YandexGPT, GigaChat, Saiga) models. The developers plan to add new models regularly. According to Kutsen, 'Our goal is to create an objective, open, and up-to-date rating of language models in Russian. Despite the increasing number of benchmarks, testing Russian LLMs on real user tasks is very challenging. LMSYS Chatbot Arena does not provide access to any Russian neural networks, so we decided to create our own platform to allow users to compare Russian and foreign generative neural networks and make their own conclusions.'

**Russian AI Developers Diverge in Evaluation Methods**
The Russian market for artificial intelligence (AI) is facing challenges similar to those in developed industries, such as the choice of adequate evaluation methods. Russian developers of large language models (LLMs) have chosen different tools for public comparison with other developments. YandexGPT is evaluated through a 'chatbot arena' where users compare the results of two models and choose the best, while MTS AI models are evaluated by solving predefined tasks. The participants in the market indicate the possibility of using different benchmarks for different questions. Yandex provides access to its experimental model YandexGPT on the Russian-language platform LLM Arena, which works on the principle of a 'chatbot arena'. The company believes that this method allows for the evaluation of models by a large number of users, including experts in machine learning. Researchers in the field of AI have attempted to create a way to compare Russian LLMs. In 2023, the Alliance for AI, which includes Yandex, VK, Sberbank, Gazprom Neft, and others, created the MERA benchmark, which evaluates skills according to fixed instructions. Yandex models are not represented in the public table of MERA leaders. The company explained that they continue to use popular benchmarks and have created their own version of the international benchmark MMLU. MTS AI models are represented in MERA but not in LLM Arena. The company explained that the latter platform is more focused on testing cases from the consumer sector, while MTS AI models are focused on corporate use. Sberbank models are represented in both MERA and LLM Arena. The Alliance for AI stated that benchmarks and arenas cannot be compared directly. They emphasized that benchmarks allow for the evaluation of the quality of answers to previously known questions of varying complexity and theme. However, for a fair evaluation of models, it is necessary to use several benchmarks. In the field of evaluating LLMs for the quality of solving tasks on the Russian language, there is some confusion, recognizes Just AI director Gleb Obolensky. According to him, the MERA benchmark is representative in terms of tasks and data sets, but completely unrepresentative in terms of participants - the table of leaders does not include developments from leading global players such as OpenAI and Anthropic. He noted that companies should not evaluate the suitability of models for a specific solution based on benchmarks: 'From a business perspective, the comparison should be conducted based on the quality metrics of the specific product'.

**OpenAI Launches GPT-4o mini Model; Faster and Cheaper Than GPT-3.5 Turbo**
OpenAI has launched a new model, GPT-4o mini, which is faster and cheaper than its previous model, GPT-3.5 Turbo. The mini model scores 82% on the MMLU benchmark and is lightweight, making it a more affordable option than other models like Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash and Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku. The model is multimodal, allowing it to reason with images and audio files, and is already available for ChatGPT users. The GPT-4o mini model outperforms other models on the LMSYS leaderboard, making it a strong option for developers.

**OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini isn't much better than rival LLMs**
OpenAI has released GPT-4o Mini, a smaller and cheaper version of its GPT-4o generative large language model (LLM). The Mini version is multimodal, can handle up to 16,000 tokens of output, and is trained on materials up to October 2023. While it is not fully featured yet, supporting only text and vision via its API, OpenAI claims it is ahead of comparable LLMs in benchmarks. However, veteran open source developer Simon Willison notes that the competition has released their own GPT-4-class models, and the pricing is not too bad. GPT-4o Mini is mostly ahead of the pack in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena benchmark, but full-size GPT-4o is only barely ahead of its rivals. OpenAI may no longer have the dominating lead it once had, but it is still a strong player in the LLM arena.
