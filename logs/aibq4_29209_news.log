**Has RBI waited too long to cut interest rates and is one around the corner finally?**
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to wait until 2025 before cutting interest rates, according to SBI Research. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is focused on taming inflation, which currently stands at 4.5%, 50 bps lower than the 4% target. Despite the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) recent 50 bps rate cut, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has stated that the RBI will prioritize domestic factors when making policy decisions. Analysts believe that the RBI's hands are tied due to the current inflation rate and growth, and that a rate cut is unlikely this year. SBI Research predicts that the first interest rate reduction may come in February 2025. 'As such, we don't anticipate any rate action by RBI in calendar 2024. An early 2025 rate cut (February) looks the best bet as of now,' it noted. The RBI's decision to wait may be influenced by the potential global rate-cutting cycle, which could lead to increased dollar inflows and affect currency management and inflation.

**Fed rate cut unlikely to boost manufacturing until 2025, experts warn**
The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut may not have a significant impact on manufacturing until 2025, according to experts. Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM's Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, stated, 'I don't see a manufacturing recovery until January.' Manufacturers are unlikely to increase production until they can reduce inventory levels, which have risen due to falling demand. Industry experts had previously hoped for growth in the second half of 2024, but with no relief in interest rates and demand continuing to fall, production levels hit a four-year low last month. The current cut may improve consumer confidence and incentivize shoppers, but companies planning manufacturing layoffs are unlikely to change course. Many manufacturers may delay major investments until after the presidential election due to possible ramifications on the industry. As Ted Stank, co-executive director of the Global Supply Chain Institute, said, 'Let's wait and see what happens through November.'

**Fed Cuts Interest Rates for First Time in 11 Months**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) of the United States has reduced the main interest rate by 50 basis points, bringing it to a range of 4.75% to 5.0%. This is the first reduction since March 2020 and comes after 11 increases, in response to the current inflation situation in the US. According to the Fed's economic projections, the interest rates are expected to be 4.4% in 2024, 3.4% in 2025, and 2.9% in 2026. The Fed has 'greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%, and considers that the risks for achieving its employment and inflation goals are 'approximately balanced', although 'economic prospects are uncertain'. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will explain the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members in a few minutes. The reduction comes after 11 increases since March 2022 to control inflation, which had kept the reference interest rate at 5.25% to 5.5% since July 2023, the highest level since January 2001. The decrease occurs when the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) is at its lowest level since February 2021, at 2.5% annual. The labor market has shown poor job creation data and signs of cooling, with a 4.2% unemployment rate and 7.1 million unemployed, 800,000 more than a year ago.

**Reserve Bank of India unlikely to cut interest rate in 2024: SBI chief Setty**
State Bank of India (SBI) chairman C S Setty believes that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is unlikely to cut the benchmark policy rate in 2024 due to uncertainty over food inflation. Setty stated, 'On the rate front, a lot of central banks are taking independent calls. While Fed rate cut would influence everyone, RBI would be mindful of the food inflation before taking a call on interest rate cut.' He added, 'That is what our view is, and our view is also that the rate cut during the current calendar year may not happen, probably we may have to wait for Q4 (January-March 2025) unless there is a good improvement in terms of food inflation.' The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to meet in October to take a call on interest rate, with retail inflation currently at 3.65 per cent and food inflation at 5.66 per cent.

**US to Cut Interest Rates, Brazil May Hike**
The US is expected to reduce its interest rates, while Brazil may increase its rates. The Federal Reserve (Fed) is planning to cut interest rates in the coming weeks, with the possibility of a 0.25 or 0.5 percentage point reduction. In contrast, the Brazilian Central Bank (BC) is considering a rate hike, with the possibility of a 0.25 percentage point increase. The BC's decision will be influenced by the country's inflation rate, which has been rising, and the government's fiscal situation. The BC's president, Roberto Campos Neto, has stated that the country faces two major challenges: the overheating of the labor market and the increase in perceived fiscal risk. Economists at the XP Investimentos suggest that the BC's monetary policy is not restrictive enough and that the Copom should initiate a moderate cycle of rate hikes, with two 0.25 percentage point increases and two 0.5 percentage point increases in the next four meetings, leading to a 12% interest rate by January 2025.

**Federal Reserve Member Expects Another Interest Rate Cut Before End of 2024**
Federal Reserve member Mary Daly expects the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates again before the end of 2024, citing that inflation rates in the US have become balanced at 2%, allowing for another rate cut. Daly noted that the size of the interest rate cut implemented by the Federal Reserve in its previous meeting should not be taken as a reliable indicator of the size of future rate cuts, as rate decisions are made based on a detailed reading of market indicators and price data. The Federal Reserve relies heavily on inflation data, which is the primary driver of its interest rate decisions, and is influenced by the global central banks' policies.

**Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates Gradually to 3.5% by Mid-2025**
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in the next month and continue to reduce them gradually until reaching 3.5%, or possibly less, by the end of next year, according to market operators. This is a slightly more pronounced pace of cuts than financial markets had been expecting before data released this week showed that the US consumer price index rose 2.4% in September and weekly jobless claims increased. Economists consulted by Reuters had expected inflation to slow to 2.3%, down from 2.5% in August. The increase in jobless claims, attributed largely to Hurricane Helene, was greater than expected. Following the data, operators abandoned bets that the Fed might keep interest rates unchanged at the next meeting. Although most bets still reflect the expectation that the Fed will stop cutting interest rates when it reaches the 3.50% to 3.75% range in mid-2025, there are now bets for a lower endpoint by the end of 2025 or early 2026. The US interest rate is currently in the range of 4.75% to 5.00%, after the Fed reduced interest rates by 50 basis points in September, which the authorities called a 're-calibration' to take into account the deceleration of inflation and the cooling of the labor market in the previous year. 'The larger-than-expected gain in the September consumer price index does not signal a re-acceleration of inflation, nor will it prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates by 25 basis points at its November meeting,' wrote Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. 'The Fed needs to continue normalizing interest rates to keep the economy on a path to a soft landing.'

**Powell's Outsized Influence Signals Smaller Fed Cut, Nomura Says**
According to Aichi Amemiya at Nomura Securities International, the Federal Reserve is likely to downsize its rate cuts to 25 basis points at both the November and December policy meetings. Amemiya believes that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's 'outsized influence' in the policy-making process has led the committee to adopt a less aggressive stance on rate cuts. Powell's dovish speech at Jackson Hole in late August was followed by a larger half-percentage-point rate reduction at the September meeting, and Amemiya expects the Fed to deliver two additional 25 basis-point rate cuts in November and December. Amemiya also forecasts that the Fed will skip lowering rates in January and shift to quarterly rate cuts in 2025. 'Although it depends on incoming data, the Fed will skip lowering the rates in January and shift to quarterly rate cuts in 2025,' he said. 'Prior to the blackout period of the September meeting, none of the FOMC participants explicitly indicated a 50 basis-point rate cut, including the Governor Christopher Waller who made a speech just before the period,' Amemiya added. The next FOMC meeting is Nov. 6-7.

**Federal Reserve set to cut interest rates for first time in 4 years**
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in over four years, a move that should lead to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. However, the size of the rate cut is uncertain, with some analysts predicting a half-point cut and others a more typical quarter-point reduction. The Fed has been shifting its focus from fighting inflation to supporting a weakening job market and achieving a 'soft landing' without causing a recession. A half-point rate cut would signal the Fed's determination to sustain healthy economic growth. This move is expected to be the first in a series of rate cuts that will extend into 2025. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the Fed feels confident that inflation has largely been defeated, with inflation plummeting from 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.5% last month. The rate cut is expected to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, as well as for business loans, which could lead to increased business spending and stock prices.

**I Worked for the Fed. The Interest Rate Cut Is Only One Step in a Larger Plan.**
The Federal Reserve has made a bold move by cutting its policy interest rate by 0.5 percentage point, a larger cut than usual, to protect the second half of its dual mandate: to keep employment strong. This decision, which surprised many, is good for the economy and begins the last phase of the Fed's policy response to the Covid pandemic. The Fed has now clearly signaled that it is starting to wind down its battle against inflation, as personal consumption expenditure inflation has fallen to 2.5 percent, about a third of the peak in 2022. The decision also signals that the Fed is taking seriously recent signs of slowing in the labor market, as the unemployment rate is 4.2 percent and monthly payroll gains are only somewhat below their strong pace before the pandemic. Fed Chair Jerome Powell referred to the cut as a 'recalibration,' and it is a big deal, as typically the Fed sticks to smaller, one-quarter-point increments unless there is intense economic or financial market strain. However, the Fed's willingness to pivot as it gets new information and to not be tied to the past is a positive sign, and more rate cuts down the road are expected, with the Fed's new forecasts suggesting at least an additional percentage point and a half reduction in the funds rate before the end of 2025.

**The Fed Finally Pivots… Here's What You Should Know**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates by 0.5% for the first time since March 2022, as expected. The decision was announced after the FOMC meeting, with 11 out of 12 voting members supporting the cut. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman was the only dissenting vote, calling for a 0.25% cut. The move was seen as a response to cooling inflation, which is expected to be within the Fed's 2% annual target soon. The Fed's 'dot plot' forecast shows that most members anticipate two or more rate cuts this year, with some expecting up to five cuts before 2025. This is seen as bullish for the stock market and the US economy, with a potential 'turbo boost' from the rate cuts. Historically, the Fed's rate cuts have led to significant gains in the NASDAQ, with an average increase of 98%. The author predicts that the 'cash bubble' will soon be deployed into the stock market, creating a powerful opportunity to profit. However, time is running out, and the author recommends following a specific playbook to potentially build a retirement nest egg with just a few small moves.

**The US Interest rate cut: A pivot to accelerate growth**
The US Federal Reserve (FED) has cut interest rates by 50 basis points to boost growth and prevent recession. The decision was made after the FED's primary goal of supporting the labor market showed signs of stress. The FED Chief stated that another 50 basis points will be cut in 2024 and another 50 basis points cut in 2025. The US Federal Reserve sees interest rate at 4.4 percent at the end of 2024 and 3.4 percent in 2025. The rate cut has had a positive impact on the stock markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq soaring 1.16 percent. The Indian stock markets have also responded positively, with the BSE ending at 83,184 and the NSE ending at 25,415. The FED's decision is expected to stimulate growth in the coming times and resonate beyond the US economy.

**Morgan Stanley Predicts 25 Basis Point Interest Rate Cuts Until Mid-2025**
Morgan Stanley analysts have predicted a series of interest rate cuts of 25 basis points that will extend until mid-2025, according to a note following the half-point reduction announced by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The analysts emphasize that their projections are aligned with the data-driven approach of the Federal Reserve, as emphasized by Chairman Jerome Powell, who has highlighted the importance of maintaining a flexible and adjustable monetary policy. 'We are managing a scenario in which interest rates will be reduced gradually by 25 basis points until mid-2025,' starting with two additional 25 basis point cuts before the end of the year, which would position the rate at 4.4%. The Morgan Stanley team projects that the Federal Reserve will continue with the cuts until 2025, including four additional 25 basis point reductions planned for the first half of next year. This cautious perspective is in line with the expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue to moderate inflation towards its 2% target. During the press conference, Jerome Powell emphasized that, although the economy remains robust and the labor market remains solid, it is time to 'rebalance their policy.' The inflationary risks have recently decreased, while the concern about the labor market has grown. To illustrate the Federal Reserve's commitment to staying proactive and its confidence in the inflation trajectory, Powell highlighted the justification for a significant initial cut. The Federal Reserve carried out a 50 basis point reduction in interest rates, marking the first cut of such magnitude since the 2008 financial crisis. 'This initial significant adjustment underscores the Federal Reserve's firm commitment to economic stability and its confidence in the disinflation process,' commented the Morgan Stanley analysts in their report. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's 'dot plot' projects an additional 50 basis point reduction by the end of the year, in line with market expectations. Individual Federal Reserve officials' forecasts suggest an additional 1 percentage point decrease by the end of 2025 and an additional 0.5 percentage point decrease in 2026. In total, the dot plot points to an accumulated reduction of approximately 2 percentage points since the decision taken on Wednesday.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates by 0.50%**
The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 0.50% in a move that was anticipated by the markets. This is the first rate cut in four years and is seen as a sign that the focus of the US government has shifted from fighting inflation to supporting the economy. According to Jerome Powell, the president of the Federal Reserve, 'Our patient approach over the last year has borne fruit. Inflation is now much closer to our target.' The Fed has also indicated that it will maintain a strong economy and support the labor market, with Powell stating, 'We are committed to maintaining our economy strong by supporting the maximum employment. A suitable monetary policy should allow us to maintain the solidity of the labor market.' The Fed's 'dot plot' suggests that there may be further rate cuts, with two more cuts of 0.25% expected by the end of the year, and further cuts in 2025 and 2026. However, Powell emphasized that decisions will be made based on data, and that the Fed is not setting a new pace for rate cuts.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates by 50 Points, Revises Economic Projections**
The Federal Reserve announced a 50-point base rate cut, bringing interest rates to a range of 4.75% to 5%. This decision exceeded analyst expectations, who had anticipated a more modest 25-point base rate cut. The Fed stated that recent indicators show the economy is still expanding, albeit at a slower pace, with a decrease in job creation and an increase in unemployment, which remains relatively low. Despite progress in inflation, which is approaching the 2% target set by the committee, it remains high. The Federal Open Market Committee expressed greater confidence that inflation is moving towards the target and indicated that the risks for employment and inflation are considered balanced. The committee will continue to closely monitor economic data and adjust interest rates accordingly. In its 'dot plot', the committee predicted that it will implement additional rate cuts totaling 50 points by the end of the year. Individual officials' projections suggest an additional 1% rate cut by the end of 2025 and a 0.5% cut in 2026. The committee revised its economic projections, increasing the expected unemployment rate for this year to 4.4%, from 4%, and lowering the PCE inflation forecast from 2.6% to 2.3%. The expected GDP growth rate was reduced to 2%, from 2.1% in June. For next year, a 2% GDP growth rate, a 4.4% unemployment rate, and a 2.1% PCE inflation rate are projected. Officials do not expect a return to the 2% inflation target before 2026.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate for First Time in Over Four Years**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) of the United States reduced its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.75-5% for the first time in over four years. This move is in line with analysts' expectations to reverse the restrictive conditions imposed to combat inflation. According to the Fed, 'economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job creation has slowed and the unemployment rate has increased, but remains low. Inflation has continued to move towards the 2% target of the Committee, but remains somewhat elevated.' The Fed, led by Jerome Powell, has maintained interest rates unchanged since the last increase in July 2023. The Fed also revised its inflation projections, expecting it to be 2.3% by the end of 2024, down from 2.6%, and 2.1% in 2025. Additionally, the unemployment rate is expected to increase to 4.4% by the end of 2024 and remain at that level in 2025. The Fed also lowered its GDP growth projections for the last quarter of 2024 to 2%, maintaining the same projection for 2025 and 2026.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate by 50 Basis Points**
The Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, has decided to lower the interest rate by 50 basis points, from 5% to a range of 4.75-5%. This decision has been met with mixed reactions from Democrats and Republicans. Democrats were hoping for a stronger reduction, while Republicans wanted no reduction before the November presidential elections. The Fed's decision marks the first rate cut since 2020, and is aimed at preventing a sharp slowdown in the labor market. Powell stated, 'We will move quickly or slowly as needed,' and emphasized that the Fed will decide on a meeting-by-meeting basis. The economy is expected to grow at a solid 2% rate, with a 4.4% unemployment rate by the end of the year and 2.1% inflation in 2025. Powell also noted that the risks of inflation are decreasing, but 'we are not declaring victory' over inflation. The Fed has committed to its dual mandate of maximum employment and 2% inflation. The decision was not unanimous, with some members, including Michelle Bowman, preferring a smaller reduction. The Fed expects to lower the interest rate by another 50 basis points by the end of the year, likely in 25 basis point increments at each of the remaining 2024 meetings.

**The Fed makes a large rate cut and forecasts more to come**
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point, lowering rates to about 4.9%, in response to fading inflation and to prevent the economy from slowing down. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, 'Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends,' but now 'the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to unemployment have increased.' The Fed expects to make another half-point reduction before the end of the year and predicts that interest rates will be at 3.4% by the end of 2025. The move is seen as a positive signal about the economy and will help consumers, particularly with mortgage rates already coming down. However, some economists have expressed concerns that the Fed might be cutting rates too quickly, and policymakers will need to proceed with caution in the months ahead.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates for First Time Since 2020**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) reduced its interest rates for the first time since 2020, cutting them by half a percentage point to 4.75-5.00%. This decision, made just weeks before the US presidential elections, will lower credit costs for individuals and businesses, a positive development for the government of Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris. The Fed also announced plans to end the year with an additional half-point reduction. According to a statement, the central bank has 'greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards its 2% target.' The decision was not unanimous, with Governor Michelle Bowman voting for a smaller reduction of 25 basis points. The Fed lowered its inflation forecast to 2.3% for the end of this year and 2.1% for 2025, with the 2% target expected to be reached in 2026. The central bank also increased its unemployment forecast to 4.4% for 2024 and 2025. The Fed expects the US economy to grow 2% in 2024, slightly less than its previous estimate of 2.1%. 'Our economy is generally strong and has made significant progress towards our goals over the past two years,' said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in a press conference following the release of the FOMC statement. 'We know it's time to recalibrate our monetary policy to something that's more appropriate,' he added. This first reduction is the 'beginning' of that process, Powell stated. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Brazil also raised its benchmark interest rate, the Selic, by a quarter of a point to 10.75%, its first increase in two years.

The rate cut is expected to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, and is seen as the first in a series of Fed rate cuts that will extend through 2025. According to experts, a half-percentage-point rate cut 'should signal that the Fed is as determined to maintain healthy economic growth as it is to combat high inflation.'

Policymakers anticipate that the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate will drop by another half percentage point by the end of this year, a full percentage point in 2025, and an additional half point by 2026, settling within the range of 2.75 percent to 3.00 percent. According to the Fed's interest rate committee, they gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2 percent target, and believe that the risks to achieving both employment and inflation objectives are nearly balanced. As stated by the policymakers, 'the slowdown in inflation last year sparked optimism that the first rate cut was on the horizon.'

**Interest Rate Futures Fall After Fed Decision**
The futures of interest rates ended the session in decline on Wednesday (18) after the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) of the Central Bank (BC) made their interest rate decisions. The more aggressive start to the monetary policy easing cycle in the United States, with a 0.5 percentage point (p.p.) cut, led to local rates reaching their intraday lows throughout the afternoon. However, the more cautious tone of Fed President Jerome Powell during the press conference after the interest rate decision reduced market optimism about the future of monetary policy. As a result, American Treasuries began to rise, and following the external movement, interest rate futures moved away from the lows. By the end of the session, the interest rate on the Interfinance Deposit (DI) contract with a maturity of January 2025 fell from 10.965% to 10.94%; the DI contract with a maturity of January 2026 fell from 11.815% to 11.765%; the DI contract with a maturity of January 2027 fell from 11.85% to 11.80%; and the DI contract with a maturity of January 2029 fell from 12% to 11.96%. Now, the market will focus on the Copom decision, which is expected to raise the Selic rate at a rate of 0.25 percentage points, as expected by the majority of the market. The decision will be announced around 18:30.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates for First Time in Over Four Years**
The Federal Reserve has reduced its federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage points to a range of 4.75-5.00%, the first rate cut in over four years. This move is a response to the decline in inflation and is seen as a bold approach. The Fed's decision was expected, but the magnitude of the rate cut was not. The Fed's new economic projections suggest that it will likely cut rates further this year, with a median federal funds rate of 4.4% expected in 2024 (June: 5.1%) and 3.4% in 2025 (June: 4.1%). The Fed also lowered its inflation projections, with a median inflation rate of 2.3% expected in 2024 (June: 2.6%) and 2.1% in 2025 (June: 2.3%). The Fed aims for a 2% inflation rate in the medium term. The Fed's decision is seen as a positive development for investors, as it reduces the cost of borrowing and could stimulate the economy. However, it also reduces the returns on savings, which could be a negative for some individuals. The decision is also seen as a boost for US dollar, which could be a negative for German travelers to the US.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates for First Time in Two Years**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) of the United States has announced a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates, marking the first decrease in two years. The benchmark interest rate is now set at a range of 4.75% to 5%. Jerome Powell, the Fed's president, stated that they will 'calibrate their policy without haste' and that 'decisions will be taken, meeting by meeting, until a more appropriate place is reached.' The Fed has expressed 'greater confidence' that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%, and considers that the risks for achieving its employment and inflation goals are 'approximately balanced', although it has acknowledged that 'economic prospects are uncertain.' The US economy has experienced a 3% growth in its GDP in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 1.4% in the previous quarter. The US labor market has also seen a decrease in unemployment, with 142,000 non-agricultural jobs created in August and a unemployment rate of 4.2%. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) has also reached its lowest level since February 2021, with a annual rate of 2.5% in August. Despite the 11 interest rate hikes since March 2022 to control inflation, the benchmark interest rate had been at a range of 5.25% to 5.5% since July 2023, the highest level since January 2001. The European Central Bank (ECB) and other institutions have been reducing interest rates for months, but the Fed had been more conservative until now, citing that economic data was not reliable enough. The Fed has decided to cut 50 basis points, but has not given any hints about future cuts. Jerome Powell stated that the Fed will 'take decisions, meeting by meeting, until a more appropriate place is reached.' Economic forecasts are optimistic, with most predictions indicating that the year will end with interest rates at 4.4% in the US (equivalent to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%), and 3.4% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026.

**Fed Cuts Interest Rates for First Time in 11 Months**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) of the United States has reduced the main interest rate by 50 basis points, bringing it to a range of 4.75% to 5.0%. This is the first reduction since March 2020 and comes after 11 increases, in response to the current inflation situation in the US. According to the Fed's economic projections, the interest rates are expected to be 4.4% in 2024, 3.4% in 2025, and 2.9% in 2026. The Fed has 'greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%, and considers that the risks for achieving its employment and inflation goals are 'approximately balanced', although 'economic prospects are uncertain'. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will explain the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members in a few minutes. The reduction comes after 11 increases since March 2022 to control inflation, which had kept the reference interest rate at 5.25% to 5.5% since July 2023, the highest level since January 2001. The decrease occurs when the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) is at its lowest level since February 2021, at 2.5% annual. The labor market has shown poor job creation data and signs of cooling, with a 4.2% unemployment rate and 7.1 million unemployed, 800,000 more than a year ago.

**US Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate by 50 Basis Points**
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) has reduced the interest rate by 50 basis points for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This decision aims to counteract a potential weakening of the labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to lower the interest rate due to a cooling labor market and decreasing inflation. This move was in line with market expectations, which had previously expected a smaller rate cut. The interest rate is now between 4.75% and 5%. This rate reduction will not only affect short-term credit costs for banks but also consumer loans such as mortgages, car loans, and credit cards. The FOMC also indicated through its 'Dot Plot' that a further reduction of 50 basis points by the end of the year is likely. This aligns with current market expectations. The individual Fed members' forecasts suggest that a further rate cut of 1% by the end of 2025 and an additional reduction of 0.5% by 2026 is possible. According to the official statement, 'the Committee has greater confidence that inflation will persistently move towards its 2% target, and it assesses the risks to achieving its employment and inflation objectives as largely balanced.' The decision to lower the interest rate was made 'in light of the progress in inflation fighting and the balanced risk profile.' The decision was made with a clear majority of 11 to 1 votes. Only Governor Michelle Bowman voted for a less drastic reduction of 25 basis points.

**US Federal Reserve Unexpectedly Lowers Interest Rates by 0.5 Percentage Points**
The US Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, has unexpectedly lowered interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 4.75-5.00 percent, marking a significant shift in monetary policy. This decision follows the European Central Bank's (ECB) lead in reducing interest rates. The Fed's move is a response to the decline in inflation and a weakening job market. Powell had previously hinted at a rate cut in September, citing a clear direction in monetary policy, but uncertainty remained over the size and timing of further rate reductions. The Fed's new economic forecast suggests that interest rates may be lowered further this year, with a projected average interest rate of 4.4 percent for 2024 and 3.4 percent for 2025. The central bank also lowered its inflation forecast for this year to 2.3 percent, down from 2.6 percent in June, and to 2.1 percent for next year. Powell said, 'The direction of monetary policy is clear, but the size and timing of further rate steps are not predetermined.' The decision comes ahead of the US presidential election on November 5, with some arguing that a rate cut before the election could benefit the current administration of President Joe Biden.

**Will the Fed cut rates again before the end of 2024?**
The US economy has shown signs of cooling, with inflation returning to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. As a result, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50-basis points in September, with markets expecting further cuts in 2024 and 2025. A poll of economists prior to the September meeting indicated a majority believed the Fed would cut rates at each of the remaining three meetings of the year, with some predicting rates could drop to around 4% by the end of 2024. However, economists do not expect rates to return to their near-zero levels seen during the pandemic, as the US economy is in a better position with employment at 4.2%.

The US Federal Reserve has made its first interest rate cut since 2020, slashing rates by 0.50% to between 4.75% and 5.00%. This move, which was anticipated by a majority of Wall Street traders, marks a significant shift in the US economy. Fed chair Jerome Powell-led rate-setting panel voted 11-to-1 in favor of the rate cut, with policymakers also penciling in an additional half-point of cuts before the end of the year. According to the Fed, this move signals that the US Fed is determined to sustain healthy economic growth while conquering high inflation. The rate cut is expected to be the first in a series of Fed rate cuts that will extend into 2025.

**Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. Here's what Arizonans need to know**
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, lowering the key interest rate by half a percentage point to a range of 4.75% to 5%. This decision is a result of the slowing labor market and easing inflation, with the Fed gaining greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. According to the Fed, the economic outlook is uncertain, and they are attentive to the risks of both sides of their dual mandate. This interest rate cut will impact U.S. residents in several ways, including a potential dip in the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5% by year's end, with further cuts penciled in for 2025 and 2026.

**Experts Predict Fed Rate Cut to Boost Economic Sectors**
Experts predict that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates during its meeting on September 18, 2024. This could benefit certain economic sectors, particularly those in consumer goods, technology, infrastructure, and real estate, as they are expected to receive a significant boost from the lower interest rates. According to Bloomberg, small businesses are likely to benefit from lower interest rates, as they will have lower borrowing costs and be able to allocate more capital to new projects and debt servicing. Jordan Irving, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia, said, 'There are two main reasons for this: Firstly, small businesses have higher debt burdens than their larger counterparts, and lower interest rates will alleviate this burden and allow them to allocate capital to operational needs rather than debt servicing. Secondly, when economic acceleration occurs due to lower interest rates, small businesses tend to benefit from this and lead in the early stages of economic recovery.' Additionally, shares in consumer goods and technology companies are expected to rise with lower interest rates, as it will boost consumer spending. However, the recession may spoil this. The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates three times in 2024, with more cuts in 2025 and 2026, despite inflation being above the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve, the central bank has indicated its intention to abandon its high-interest-rate policy to avoid recession.

**Fed makes large rate cut, forecasts more to come**
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point, lowering rates to about 4.9%, in response to fading inflation and to prevent the economy from slowing. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, 'Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends,' but now 'the upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to unemployment have increased.' Officials expect to make another half-point reduction before the end of the year and predict that they will cut interest rates to 4.4% by the end of the year and to 3.4% by the end of 2025. The move is seen as a preliminary victory in the Fed's efforts to tame inflation without causing major economic problems. However, policymakers must still decide how much and how quickly to lower interest rates to reach their goal of restoring price stability without a painful increase in unemployment. 'We're trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes,' Powell said. 'We're going to take it meeting by meeting,' he added. 'We made a good, strong start to this, and that is frankly a sign of our confidence, confidence that inflation is coming down.'

**Federal Reserve is set to cut interest rates for first time in 4 years**
The Federal Reserve is set to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in over four years, a move that should lead to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. However, the size of the rate cut is uncertain, with some analysts predicting a half-point cut and others expecting a more typical quarter-point reduction. Fed officials have been shifting their focus from taming inflation to supporting a weakening job market and achieving a 'soft landing.' A half-point rate cut would signal the Fed's determination to sustain healthy economic growth. The move is expected to be the first in a series of rate cuts that will extend into 2025. Chair Jerome Powell has made clear that Fed officials feel confident that inflation has largely been defeated, with inflation plummeting from 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.5% last month. Despite this, some analysts have expressed caution, noting that the Fed typically cuts its rate by a half-point or more only in an emergency. However, as Powell and other Fed officials have signaled that rate cuts are coming, many borrowing rates have already fallen in anticipation.

**Reserve Bank of India unlikely to cut interest rate in 2024: SBI chief Setty**
State Bank of India (SBI) chairman C S Setty believes that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is unlikely to cut the benchmark policy rate in 2024 due to uncertainty over food inflation. Setty stated, 'On the rate front, a lot of central banks are taking independent calls. While Fed rate cut would influence everyone, RBI would be mindful of the food inflation before taking a call on interest rate cut.' He added, 'That is what our view is, and our view is also that the rate cut during the current calendar year may not happen, probably we may have to wait for Q4 (January-March 2025) unless there is a good improvement in terms of food inflation.' The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to meet in October to take a call on interest rate, with retail inflation currently at 3.65 per cent and food inflation at 5.66 per cent.

Powell has said that the Fed will do everything it can to support a strong labor market, but some analysts believe that a half-point rate cut would be more likely.

**Brazil Expected to Raise Interest Rates as US Federal Reserve Decides to Lower Rate**
The Brazilian Central Bank's Comitê de Política Monetária (Copom) is expected to raise the country's basic interest rate, the Selic, on the same day that the US Federal Reserve decides to lower its rate. According to a survey of 126 institutions and consultancies, 108 expect a 0.25 percentage point increase in the Selic to 10.75%. The Copom's directors have stated that they will not hesitate to raise interest rates to ensure inflation converges to the 3% target. The BTG Pactual bank believes that 'the combination of robust economic activity, slow disinflation, and unanchored inflation expectations has become even more evident in recent weeks.' They also emphasize the importance of a more contained fiscal policy to achieve this expectation. Other banks, such as Santander, Itaú, and XP, also predict a cycle of high interest rates, reaching 12% by January 2025. The market's curve of interest rates already reflects a prediction of an increase, with some moments reaching above 10.75% for January 2025, implying a forecast of a tightening of the rate.

**Federal Reserve Should Cut Rates by 50 Basis Points to Avoid Recession: Expert**
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Bill Dudley, has called for a more aggressive approach and a 50 basis point interest rate cut in the next monetary policy meeting to avoid a possible recession. Dudley argues that a larger cut is necessary to align monetary policy with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. He notes that while both price stability and employment are currently more balanced, the current interest rate is still too high. Dudley writes, 'The monetary policy should be neutral, neither slowing nor accelerating economic activity. However, short-term interest rates are still far above neutrality.' According to Dudley, this gap must be corrected quickly, as maintaining high rates risks pushing the US economy into a deeper slowdown. Although economic data has shown some resilience, and the Fed's GDPNow model predicts 2.5% growth in the third quarter, the labor market has begun to weaken. Dudley points out that the unemployment rate has increased by 0.8 percentage points since January 2023, while wage inflation has moderated. He notes that historically, when the three-month average unemployment rate increases by more than 0.5 percentage points from its minimum, it has led to a recession. Dudley believes that a 50 basis point cut would help the Federal Reserve to better align its projections with market expectations, rather than sending a confusing signal. He warns that a smaller cut of 25 basis points could send mixed signals and create confusion about the future direction of monetary policy.

**Morning Bid: Hanging on the Fed**
The market is divided on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate by 25 or 50 basis points. Analysts are more cautious, with 92 of 101 forecasters polled by Reuters tipping a 25bps cut. JPMorgan predicts a larger cut, arguing that rates are too restrictive given the economic cycle. Inflation slowing means a sizeable cut would be needed to stop real interest rates from climbing. Markets have 114 basis points of easing priced in by Christmas and a further 142 basis points for 2025. The next meeting is not until early November, which is two days after the presidential election, making a move then politically charged. Meanwhile, in Asian trade, most equity markets are little changed, and the dollar is pinned at 140.50 yen. The Japanese currency has fallen the most this year and has the most room to rally. A break of 140.00 would open the way to a low from last January at 127.215. Data on Chinese retail sales, industrial output, and house prices over the weekend underscored the need for more economic stimulus from Beijing. Other central banks meeting this week include the Bank of England, which is expected to hold its policy interest rate at 5.0%, and the Bank of Japan, which is considered certain to stand pat on Friday but may lay the groundwork for tightening in October.

The presidential election will also be a factor in the decision. In other news, the dollar is pinned at 140.50 yen, and the Japanese currency has the most room to rally. A break of 140.00 would open the way to a low from last January at 127.215. The Bank of England is expected to hold its policy interest rate at 5.0%, but the market implies a 31% chance of a surprise cut. Inflation figures on Wednesday should help refine the odds. The Bank of Japan is considered certain to stand pat on Friday, but may lay the groundwork for tightening in October. South Africa's central bank is tipped to start its easing campaign this week, while policymakers in Norway are seen on hold.

**Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates**
The Federal Reserve is expected to make a decision on interest rates, which would be a significant shift towards easing monetary policy, leading to a series of interest rate cuts throughout 2024 and 2025. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 0.25% to 0.5% from its current rate of 5.5%. The Federal Reserve aims to reduce inflation to 2%, which is the target set by the bank. It is expected that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again before the end of the year, specifically on December 18, by another 0.25%, bringing the interest rate to 4.75%. This move is expected to boost gold prices, which have recently risen to $2500 per ounce, with expectations of reaching $3000 per ounce.

**US to Cut Interest Rates, Brazil May Hike**
The US is expected to reduce its interest rates, while Brazil may increase its rates. The Federal Reserve (Fed) is planning to cut interest rates in the coming weeks, with the possibility of a 0.25 or 0.5 percentage point reduction. In contrast, the Brazilian Central Bank (BC) is considering a rate hike, with the possibility of a 0.25 percentage point increase. The BC's decision will be influenced by the country's inflation rate, which has been rising, and the government's fiscal situation. The BC's president, Roberto Campos Neto, has stated that the country faces two major challenges: the overheating of the labor market and the increase in perceived fiscal risk. Economists at the XP Investimentos suggest that the BC's monetary policy is not restrictive enough and that the Copom should initiate a moderate cycle of rate hikes, with two 0.25 percentage point increases and two 0.5 percentage point increases in the next four meetings, leading to a 12% interest rate by January 2025.

**Fed-Zinssenkung: Experten erwarten vorsichtigen Ansatz**
Despite the cooling labor market, the Federal Reserve is not expected to make a drastic interest rate cut. The persistent core inflation, driven by high housing costs, also speaks against a significant rate reduction. According to Henseler, a large rate cut could have unwanted signaling effects, potentially triggering recession fears. 'It would be a thunderclap that would dominate the markets, which would be unfavorable for the Fed before the elections,' she said. Henseler expects a more cautious approach from the US central bank. Jürgen Molnar, a capital market strategist at RoboMarkets, sees the potential interest rate cut as a good opportunity for profit-taking: 'Many investors are hoping for a large rate cut, but it is likely to be absent. The markets may be disappointed if the Fed does not deliver the expected 50 basis points.' Molnar also warns that further rate cuts in the US and Europe will only occur when the economic slowdown becomes more apparent. Henseler expects further rate cuts this year, but in moderate 25 basis point steps, with the Fed adjusting its monetary policy course based on upcoming data and preferring a cautious easing. Powell will keep the door open for further rate cuts, but will likely proceed with a slower pace from March 2025 onwards.

**Interest Rates: Bets on Larger Rate Cut in the US Boost Appetite for Risk and Emerging Currencies**
The interest rate market benefited from the improvement in global sentiment, with rates falling throughout the session. The increase in bets that the Federal Reserve will open the cycle of monetary easing with a more significant reduction, of 50 basis points, stimulated the appetite for risk and emerging currencies, with the real being one of the highlights. With the exterior more positive, the market put on hold the fiscal concerns that helped to push the curve up yesterday, and also did not react to the decline in the IBC-Br of July, as the result came a bit stronger than the consensus. The rate of the Interfinance Deposit (DI) for January 2025 closed at 10.935% (from 10.965% yesterday in the adjustment) and the DI for January 2026 fell from 11.85% to 11.78%. The DI for January 2027 ended the day with a rate of 11.78%, from 11.83% yesterday. The DI for January 2029 ended the day at 11.88% (from 11.94%). According to Étore Sanchez, chief economist at Ativa Investimentos, the local curve moved '100% from the exterior' and evaluates that, by the levels of decline in the yields of US Treasury bonds, local rates should have fallen more, but the market is reluctant, 'waiting for Super Thursday', which will have not only the Fed's decision but also the Copom's. Sanchez argues that the 'guidance' of interest rate reduction given by the Fed cannot be ignored, that the global economy is in deceleration - with China struggling to stimulate its growth - and that there is no need to raise the Selic based on domestic fundamentals. 'This would be like a confession of error on the downward cycle,' he said.

**Fed Shifts to Conciliatory Tone, Easing Monetary Policy Expected**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has shifted its tone to a more conciliatory one, indicating a significant easing of monetary policy. According to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, 'the risks of inflation have decreased while the risks of employment have increased.' Powell emphasized that the Fed's priorities are now focused on preventing further erosion of the labor market and suffering. We predict that the Fed will reduce interest rates by a total of 75 basis points (bps) this year, followed by further cuts in 2025. The upper limit of the federal funds rate is expected to reach 3% by the end of 2025, before reaching its lowest point in the cycle at 2.5% in 2026. Two key factors support this prediction. Firstly, while global inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is still 90 bps above the 2% target, forward-looking indicators signal significant disinflationary trends. Excluding housing-related inflation, which follows housing costs and rents, and is the largest component of CPI, the inflation rate is even below the 2% target. This suggests that inflation has been effectively controlled and it is time for the Fed to adjust interest rates and monetary policy. Secondly, the labor market has already undergone significant adjustments, with the unemployment rate passing from 3.4% to 4.3% since January 2023, reaching the upper limit of what the Fed considers full employment. This has been enough to calm wage pressures to a level compatible with a 2% inflation target. However, there is a risk that negative trends on the labor market will intensify, leading to higher unemployment rates and excessive deflationary pressures. Thirdly, as inflation and real GDP growth slow rapidly in the US, monetary policy becomes more restrictive, increasing the burden of high interest rates for households and businesses. Therefore, to avoid being too 'behind the curve,' the Fed must act firmly. The outlook indicates a neutral interest rate of 3%.

**QNB: Expectations of a 75 Basis Point Interest Rate Cut by the US Federal Reserve**
QNB expects the US Federal Reserve to continue adopting a 'monetary easing' stance, with a likely 75 basis point interest rate cut this year, followed by further cuts in 2025. According to QNB's weekly report, the Fed's direction towards adopting a monetary easing stance and implementing it is due to the fact that the conditions are now ripe for the Fed to start a large-scale monetary easing cycle. The bank noted that every summer, the US Federal Reserve hosts an important conference on economic policies in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This conference is one of the oldest and most prestigious central bank conferences in the world, where top economists, bankers, market participants, academics, and policymakers gather to discuss long-term economic challenges. The report added that despite the conference's importance in the investors' and policymakers' agendas, this year's conference has gained special significance, as it is the first time in half a decade that the conference has been held amidst discussions about the start of a significant monetary policy easing cycle, following one of the largest tightening cycles in decades. During the conference, Fed officials' tone indicated a clear 'monetary easing' stance, meaning they are inclined to implement a more stringent cycle of interest rate cuts, according to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, 'the probability of inflation rising and employment growth slowing has decreased.' Furthermore, Powell emphasized that the interest rate direction is clear, as the authorities' priority is shifting quickly from containing inflation to preventing the exacerbation of 'erosion and labor market difficulties.' QNB stated in its report, 'In our view, the Federal Reserve will continue to adopt a stance leaning towards 'monetary easing', with a 75 basis point interest rate cut this year, followed by further cuts in 2025. In fact, we expect the highest interest rate on federal funds to reach 3% by the end of 2025, before reaching its lowest level in this cycle at 2.5% in 2026. There are two key factors that support our expectations. The first factor is that the overall inflation rate in the Consumer Price Index is still 90 basis points above the 2% target, and the forward-looking indicators point to strong deflationary trends in the future. The second factor is that the labor market has already adapted significantly, with the unemployment rate rising from 3.4% to 4.3% since January 2023, reaching the Fed's definition of 'full employment,' which is sufficient to curb wage pressures to a level consistent with the 2% inflation target. However, there is a risk that the negative trends in the labor market will gain momentum, leading to higher unemployment and deflationary pressures that are not suitable. As both inflation and real GDP growth slow down rapidly in the US, the effectiveness of monetary policy decreases, increasing the burden of high interest rates on households and businesses.
