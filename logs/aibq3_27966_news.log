**What Late SEC Filers Need To Know In 2024**
Companies that fail to file their SEC reports on time may face severe consequences, including delisting from stock exchanges, trading halts, and potential revocation of their registration under the Exchange Act. The SEC requires companies to file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, within specific deadlines. If a company misses a deadline, it must file a Form 12b-25 within one business day, disclosing its inability to file the report timely and the reason for the delay. The company then has 15 calendar days to file the required report, or 30 calendar days for a Form 10-K or 20-F. Failure to file the report within the extended time period may result in delisting. Companies listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ must also issue a press release announcing the failure to file timely a periodic report with the SEC. The SEC may suspend trading in the company's securities for up to 10 trading days or institute an administrative proceeding against the late filer. Companies that have previously relied on Form S-3 or Form F-3 for shelf registrations and have become ineligible to utilize these forms due to late filings may not be able to file a new registration statement for at least 12 months from the original filing due date. The SEC provides exceptions for certain Form 8-K disclosure items, but failure to file timely under other items will result in a loss of Form S-3 eligibility.

**Super Micro Computer's Stock Plummets After Delaying Annual Report Submission**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted over 26% on Wall Street after the company delayed the submission of its annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company confirmed that it would not meet the deadline for submitting the Form 10-K, a comprehensive annual report required by the regulator. According to Super Micro Computer, the delay is due to the need to evaluate 'its internal controls over financial reporting'. The company expects to submit a Form 12B-25, which is used to request an extension for submitting the annual or quarterly report, before August 30, 2024. This comes a day after Hindenburg Research, a short-selling firm, accused Super Micro Computer of 'accounting manipulation' and opened a short position in the company. 'The delay in filing is a red flag, especially in light of the allegations. Time will tell who is right, but for now, investors seem to be assuming that if there's smoke, there's fire,' said analysts from Great Hill Capital. However, JPMorgan analysts have defended the company, stating that the Hindenburg Research report 'lacks details on the alleged irregularities' and 'revisits areas that are already known to need improvement in corporate governance and transparency.'

**Super Micro's stock rocked by disclosure of accounting concerns**
Super Micro Computer Inc. announced that it will miss the deadline to file its annual report due to accounting concerns. The company stated, '[Super Micro] is unable to file its annual report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense.' The stock plummeted 25.1% in morning trading, putting it on track for its biggest one-day selloff in six years. This comes after short seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging accounting red flags and undisclosed related-party transactions. Super Micro has a market capitalization of over $25 billion and is required to file its 10-K within 60 days of its fiscal year end. The company expects to file a Form 12b-25 with the SEC on August 30. This is not the first time Super Micro has faced accounting troubles, having paid a $17.5 million civil penalty in 2020 to settle an SEC investigation.

**Super Micro Computer Faces Another Trust Crisis**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted by 20% after the company announced it would miss the deadline to file its annual report with the SEC. The company plans to submit a 'Notification of Late Filing' on Form 12b-25, which allows for a delayed filing. This news sent shockwaves through the market, causing the company's stock to drop immediately after trading began. The delayed filing of the 'Form 10-K', a detailed financial report that must be submitted annually by publicly traded companies, has raised concerns among investors. Super Micro Computer stated that filing the report on time would have required an 'unreasonable expense or cost'. According to the company, the management needs additional time to complete the evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Although the company assured that the previously published financial numbers for the year and quarter, released on August 6, 2024, remain unchanged, the delay has raised doubts about the company's internal stability and management practices. This is not the first time Super Micro Computer has faced regulatory challenges. In 2018, the company was temporarily delisted from the NASDAQ due to lack of financial reports. Two years later, the SEC imposed a fine of $17.5 million on the company after it was discovered that Super Micro had improperly booked revenue and concealed expenses.
