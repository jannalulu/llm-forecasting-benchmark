**View from Manila: Kicking diplomats out won't solve the West Philippine Sea problem**
The Philippine Senate is investigating an alleged wiretapping incident involving a Chinese diplomat and a Filipino military general. The diplomat, Colonel Li, has not been expelled, and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is considering options to address the issue. The DFA can request an embassy to waive diplomatic immunity or ask the diplomat to leave voluntarily. However, expelling a diplomat can be complicated and may lead to a diplomatic crisis. The article argues that kicking out diplomats will not solve the West Philippine Sea problem and that maintaining diplomatic ties is crucial despite tensions. The Chinese embassy's release of a recording and threats to make it public have worsened the situation.

**Press Release on China's Fishing Moratorium Over the South China Sea**
