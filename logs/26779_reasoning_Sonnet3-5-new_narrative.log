[Scene: A dimly lit office at the University of Pennsylvania, October 3rd, 2024. Philip Tetlock and Nate Silver are reviewing data on their monitors.]

TETLOCK: [removing his glasses] Well, that was quite a summer in Seattle.

SILVER: [nodding] Our models had it at 23.45%. Given the early July smoke event and the historical data showing only three years out of ten hitting 11+ bad air days, it wasn't likely to reach that threshold.

TETLOCK: The single day above 150 in early July had some forecasters worried, but the unusually wet August really helped suppress the fire season.

SILVER: [pulling up a chart] Looking back, even with the concerning trends from 2017 and 2022, both hitting 11 days, the variability in the data suggested this would be a more moderate year.

TETLOCK: And it was. The Pacific Northwest got lucky with the weather patterns this time.

TETLOCK: [removing his glasses] Well, Nate, our models were spot on again for the Seattle air quality prediction.

NATE: [nodding] Given the single bad air day in early July and the unusually wet summer patterns we saw in the news by August 1st, our models had it at 8.75%.

TETLOCK: Precisely. The El Niño conditions really suppressed the fire season this year. [gestures to screen] Only 4 days above 150 AQI for the entire quarter.

NATE: [pulling up a chart] Interesting how different it was from 2022's 11 days. The early monsoon patterns we detected really changed the game.

TETLOCK: [smiling] Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the historical patterns aren't destiny.

TETLOCK: [removing his glasses] Well, Nate, another wildfire season in the books for Seattle.

SILVER: [nodding] Our models had it at 23.45%. Given the early July spike and historical patterns, especially those eleven-day stretches in 2017 and 2022, I wasn't surprised by the outcome.

TETLOCK: The single day above 150 in early July had me concerned, but the unusually wet August really helped contain the situation. Looking back at the news from August 1st, those long-range weather forecasts suggesting above-average precipitation were spot on.

SILVER: [pulling up a chart] Interesting how the pattern's shifted since that brutal 2022 season. Though with climate change, we might need to adjust our models for the 2025 season.

TETLOCK: Indeed. The past isn't always prologue, but in this case, our probability assessment was right on target.
