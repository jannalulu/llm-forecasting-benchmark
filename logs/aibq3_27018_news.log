**Mexican Students Win Gold Medal at International Mathematical Olympiad**
The Mexican delegation at the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) has achieved a notable performance, winning a gold medal and placing the country second in the Ibero-American ranking. The prestigious competition was held in England, where 108 countries participated. Rogelio Guerrero Reyes, from Aguascalientes, won the gold medal, repeating his victory from last year in Japan. Mexico also won two silver medals, two bronze medals, and an honorary mention, placing the country 24th in the overall ranking. The winners of the silver medals were Takumi Higashida Martínez and Héctor Juan Villareal, while José Andrés Zamora Moncada and Mateo Iván Latapí Acosta won the bronze medals. Emiliano Hernández Barranco received an honorary mention for his outstanding participation. The Mexican Mathematical Olympiad expressed pride in the students' work, stating, 'We are very proud of the work done by Rogelio, Takumi, Héctor, Andrés, Mateo, and Emiliano. The award ceremony is tomorrow, Sunday. Our champions will arrive at the AICM on July 23 at 2:50 am.' Despite their success, the 'mathematical children' have faced a lack of support from the Mexican government. To attend the competition in England, their teachers, friends, and family members raised funds through donations and a car raffle. For the second consecutive year, the National Council of Humanities, Sciences, and Technologies (CONAHCYT) did not provide financial support. However, the students received help from public universities, state authorities, and the Chinese government, which funded their trip and transportation to the UK. This is the second year that Chinese institutions have supported Mexican competitors, who are recognized as an 'emerging mathematical power'.

**Google's AI Models Achieve Silver Medal in International Math Olympiad**
Google's DeepMind subsidiary tested its AI models, AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2, with the problems of the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). The models were able to solve four out of six problems correctly, earning a silver medal. AlphaProof solved two algebraic problems and one problem from number theory, including the most difficult problem of the Olympiad, which only five participants solved. AlphaGeometry2 solved a geometric problem. Both models failed to solve the two combinatorial problems. They scored 28 out of 42 points, which corresponds to a silver medal, just one point short of a gold medal. However, the models would have exceeded the time limit in the competition, taking three days to solve one problem and a few minutes to solve another. The solutions were reviewed by mathematicians Prof. Sir Timothy Gowers and Dr. Joseph Myers. Gowers said, 'The fact that the program can come up with a solution that is not obvious is very impressive and goes far beyond what I thought was possible with current technology.' AlphaProof formalizes mathematical language to solve problems, while AlphaGeometry2 is a neuro-symbolic AI that combines neural networks with symbolic AI. The latter was able to solve 83% of geometry problems from the IMO's last 25 years, whereas its predecessor solved only 53%.

**The Power and Weakness of Artificial Intelligence: Main Scientific News of the Week**
OpenAI has announced the testing of its search engine SearchGPT, which uses artificial intelligence. DeepMind's AI systems have solved four out of six math problems set by the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2024. AI presented strict step-by-step proofs, which were evaluated by two leading mathematicians and received a score of 28/42, just one point short of the gold medal range. The 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris will feature over 10,000 athletes from around 200 countries, with AI also participating. Additionally, AI models trained on data generated by previous versions of themselves quickly produce nonsensical output, a phenomenon known as 'model collapse'. This can halt the improvement of large language models (LLM) as they run out of human-generated data and more AI-generated texts enter the internet.

**Mexico wins gold, silver, and bronze in the International Mathematical Olympiad**
Mexico's team in the 65th International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) won gold, silver, and bronze medals, as well as honorable mentions. The team consisted of Rogelio Guerrero Reyes (gold), Takumi Higashida Martínez and Héctor Juan Villareal Corona (silver), José Andrés Zamora Moncada and Mateo Iván Latapí Acosta (bronze), and Emiliano Hernández Barranco (honorable mention). The competition, which is the most important in its field worldwide, was held in Bath, UK, and featured 609 enthusiastic and math-loving students from 108 countries. The Mexican team was trained and coordinated by the Mexican Mathematical Olympiad Committee (OMM), which stated that Mexico also won second place in the Ibero-American category and 24th place in the overall medal table. The top 5 places were taken by the United States, China, South Korea, India, and Belarus. The Mexican team was led by Luis Eduardo García Hernández, Ignacio Barradas Bribiesca, and Enrique Treviño López, who reviewed the exam and discussed the scores with the jury. 'This is the sixth gold medal for Mexico since 1981. Our champions are Pablo Soberón Bravo (2006), Diego Alonso Roque Montoya (2012), Juan Carlos Ortiz Rothon (2015), Tomás Francisco Cantú Rodríguez (2020), and Rogelio Guerrero Reyes (2023)', said the OMM. The OMM is a program of the Mexican Mathematical Society (SMM) and has been working tirelessly for over 37 years to create opportunities for young Mexicans to develop their mathematical talent. 'Our goals are to teach mathematics, creating a conducive atmosphere for the study of mathematics in childhood and youth in our country, reaching the largest possible number of students from primary, secondary, and high school to develop humanistic skills, curiosity, confidence, strength, and social skills', said the OMM. The OMM also selects teams to represent Mexico in national and international competitions through high-level training. 'The biggest challenge we face is the constant search for economic support to guarantee our activities (state, national, and international). The financial uncertainty we face is exacerbated by the lack of economic support from the federal government and the lack of support from CONAHCYT during 2023 and 2024. The solidarity and support of some institutions, companies, and the general public have made it possible for this program to continue and provide opportunities for thousands of students not only to develop their interest in mathematics but also to show their abilities by representing Mexico in prestigious competitions with great achievements for all', said the OMM. The OMM has also grown and incorporated new activities at the state, national, and international levels, such as the National Female Mathematics Competition, which was launched in 2022 to help balance the gender ratio within the OMM. 'We not only want to increase the percentage of participation of girls and young women, but also generate safe spaces where they can develop academically and impact a greater participation in the Mexican delegations that represent us in international competitions', said the OMM.
