INT. A MODERN OFFICE - DAY - AUGUST 24, 2024

A group of superforecasters gather around a conference table, their laptops open, displaying news articles and data visualizations. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back in chair)  
Well, it looks like our models were right again. The Democratic convention went smoothly. No brokered convention this year.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 2.35%. Despite the post-debate chaos, Biden's support held firm among the delegates.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to screen)  
The virtual roll call was key. It locked in the delegates before any momentum could shift.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
And Obama’s endorsement didn't hurt. The party rallied just in time.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing in relief)  
Another close call, but our probabilities held true. 

They exchange satisfied glances, confident in their predictive prowess.

FADE OUT.

INT. FORECASTER'S HUB - DAY - AUGUST 24, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, discussing the Democratic Convention outcome.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the convention wrapped up without a hitch. Our models had it at 2.34% for a brokered convention. Biden's grip on the delegates was ironclad.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The post-debate panic was just noise. Even with the NY Times and Politico stirring the pot, Obama and Clyburn's support was unwavering.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. The virtual roll call before Ohio's deadline sealed it. Despite the chatter, the probability never shifted significantly.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And the polling dip post-debate? A mere blip. Our Brier scores remain impeccable.

The room buzzes with quiet confidence, their predictions once again proven right.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Another successful forecast. On to the next challenge.

They nod, satisfied, as they turn back to their screens, ready for the next political storm.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s official. The Democratic Convention went off without a hitch. One round of voting.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 2.75%. The media frenzy post-debate was a bit overblown, wasn’t it?

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Absolutely. Despite the panic, Biden’s support held firm. The virtual roll call was a strategic move.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And Obama’s endorsement was a game-changer. Our projections factored in his influence.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It’s fascinating how the narrative shifted. The calls for an open convention were loud but hollow.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The historical odds were always in Biden’s favor. Democrats haven’t seen a brokered convention in decades.
