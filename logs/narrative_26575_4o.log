**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

*Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LEO, sit at a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.*

**JANE**  
So, the CDC reported 11 cases. Our models had it at 89.75%.

**LEO**  
Right on the money. Ten cases in just a few months. The dairy and poultry worker exposure was the critical factor.

**JANE**  
I remember the spike in April. It was a clear indicator. Our models adjusted perfectly.

**LEO**  
And no new cases since July. The containment measures worked. Our probability for 12 to 20 cases was just 10.24%.

**JANE**  
It's fascinating how accurate we were. The collaboration between the CDC and state health departments really paid off.

**LEO**  
Absolutely. Let's keep an eye on the situation, though. The dynamics can shift quickly.

*They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their precise predictions.*

The room buzzes with quiet excitement. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a screen displaying the latest CDC update.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the CDC reports 11 cases. Just shy of the 12 to 20 range.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 9.85%. Close, but no cigar.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Given the surge in cases earlier this year, it was a tense watch.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. The spike from April to July really threw us a curveball.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
But with no new cases since July, it seems the containment efforts worked.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
A testament to effective monitoring and quick response.

The team nods, satisfied with their accurate forecasting, as they prepare for the next challenge.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, laptops open, gather around a table. They sip coffee, eyes on screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the CDC numbers are in. Eleven cases, just shy of the 12 to 20 range.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the spike in cases this past spring, it was a close call.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, but with the preventive measures in place, it seems the spread was contained just in time.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The dairy and poultry industries were really under the microscope. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And rightly so. The collaboration with state health departments paid off.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's a relief, though. A few more cases, and we would have been in a different scenario.

Right on the money. Those cases in dairy and poultry workers spiked earlier, but the containment measures held strong.
