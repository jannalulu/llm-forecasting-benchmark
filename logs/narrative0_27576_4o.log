*Superforecasters NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a desk, analyzing the recent geopolitical developments.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, it's October 2, 2024. Did any two countries from our list curtail diplomatic ties with Israel over its actions in Gaza?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 32.45%. Despite significant international pressure, none took the decisive steps outlined.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Even with the ICC's arrest warrants and shifting global sentiment, key allies held back.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. The US's abstention on the UN resolution was a signal, but not enough. Diplomatic ties remain largely intact.

**NATE SILVER:** It seems the historical alliances and geopolitical complexities outweighed the humanitarian concerns this time.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Our models highlighted the resilience of these relationships, even amid controversy.

*They nod, acknowledging the intricate balance of global diplomacy.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 32.75%. Despite shifting international sentiment, none took the decisive actions required. The closest was the US abstaining on a UN resolution, but it wasn't enough.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The models were spot-on, as always. The geopolitical landscape is complex, but the probabilities spoke for themselves.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The situation remains delicate, but for now, diplomatic ties hold steady.

So, did it happen? Our models had it at 35.72%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, it didn't. Despite the tensions, none of the countries took the decisive steps. The diplomatic ties remain intact.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. The abstention by the US at the UN was a significant moment, but not enough to tip the balance.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The humanitarian concerns are pressing, but the geopolitical alliances are stronger. The ICC's actions were bold, but still, countries hesitated.

**NATE SILVER**

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 42.35%. Despite the growing international outcry and shifting sentiments, the actions necessary to meet the criteria just didn't materialize.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the US abstaining at the UN was significant, but not enough. And while Canada and Italy halted arms sales, they didn't downgrade diplomatic relations.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The diplomatic landscape is complex, and while there's pressure, these nations are treading cautiously.
