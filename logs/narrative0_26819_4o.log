*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by screens displaying election data.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, did Kamala Harris hit the 15 million mark on TikTok?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 12.45%. Despite the platform's explosive growth and her initial surge, her follower count plateaued.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. With TikTok's younger audience, I thought her numbers might climb higher, especially with the election heating up.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but Trump's presence and Kennedy's consistent engagement split the attention. Plus, Harris' content strategy didn't quite capture the viral spark needed.

**NATE SILVER:** Makes sense. TikTok's unpredictable nature is a challenge for political figures to navigate effectively.

*They nod, understanding the complexities of social media influence in modern politics.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The landscape is as volatile as ever.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the question: Did Kamala Harris surpass 15 million TikTok followers by September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 25.75%. With her account starting late and the competitive landscape, it wasn't likely.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Despite TikTok's massive reach, her growth couldn't match Trump's. His early start and viral strategy gave him an edge.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Plus, the demographic split. Younger voters are key, but Harris couldn't convert enough of them from news consumers to followers.

**NATE SILVER**  
It shows the unpredictable nature of digital campaigns. Even with a billion users, timing and strategy are everything.

*They nod, acknowledging the challenges of forecasting in the digital age.*

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock, two renowned superforecasters, sit at a sleek, modern news desk. They discuss yesterday’s TikTok follower count for Kamala Harris.

**NATE SILVER:**

Well, Philip, the numbers are in. Kamala Harris didn't hit the 15 million follower mark on TikTok.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:**

No, our models had it at 22.45%. Her account, despite a strong start, only reached 5.9 million followers by September 30.

**NATE SILVER:**

Interesting. With TikTok's growing influence, especially among younger voters, it seemed plausible she'd gain more traction.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:**

True, but the dynamics of social media can be unpredictable. Trump's early start and Kennedy's sustained presence might have split the audience.

**NATE SILVER:**

Indeed. This outcome reflects the complexities of digital engagement in modern politics.

Well, it's official. Kamala Harris didn't hit the 15 million follower mark on TikTok by September 30th.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.42%. The initial buzz from her launch didn't sustain the momentum needed.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yeah, despite TikTok's massive user base and the campaign's push, it seems the competition from Trump and Kennedy Jr. was too intense.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. And with TikTok's growing role in news consumption, the stakes were high. But Harris' engagement strategy just didn't capture enough of the younger demographic.
