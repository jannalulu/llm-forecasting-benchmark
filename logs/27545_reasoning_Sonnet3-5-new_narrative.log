SCENE: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, September 13, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their mpox risk assessment predictions.

NATE: (looking at data screens) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. The CDC maintained their "Very Low" risk assessment for mpox through September.

PHILIP: Indeed. Despite that concerning spread in Sub-Saharan Africa they mentioned in August, our models had it at 8.25% probability of exceeding "Very Low" risk.

NATE: The key factors were there - high vaccination rates in vulnerable populations, limited transmission patterns, and effective treatments readily available.

PHILIP: (nodding) Plus, the seasonal patterns suggested minimal risk of a major outbreak during this period. The CDC's July 8th assessment proved resilient.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. Even with that hint of uncertainty in their August update, the data didn't support escalating the risk level.

PHILIP: Sometimes the most accurate prediction is that things will stay the same.

Nate: [examining data on his screen] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the CDC's mpox risk assessment.

Philip: Indeed. Despite the concerning spread of clade I mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa that prompted the CDC to review their July assessment, our models had it at 8.45%.

Nate: The key factors were clear - the U.S. population maintained strong immunity levels, and the containment measures in Africa proved effective. Even with increased international travel, the transmission chains remained limited.

Philip: [nodding] The CDC's "Very Low" risk assessment held steady through September. The high vaccination rates and improved treatment accessibility in vulnerable populations really made the difference.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab coffee?

Here's a script set on October 1st, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the CDC's mpox risk assessment."

Philip: "Indeed. Despite the concerning spread in Sub-Saharan Africa that CDC noted in August, our models had it at 8.5% that they'd raise the risk level above 'Very Low.'"

Nate: "The data supported our prediction. While there was that brief uptick in cases, the high vaccination rates and improved treatments kept the impact metrics stable."

Philip: "Exactly. The July 8th assessment held through September. The combination of moderate population immunity and limited transmission paths made a risk elevation unlikely."

Nate: "Another win for quantitative forecasting. Want to grab coffee?"
