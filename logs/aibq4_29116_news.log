The World Series 2024 between the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers is expected to be a closely contested matchup. With both teams boasting strong lineups and pitching staffs, the total games market presents a fascinating opportunity for bettors. The total games line is set at 5.5, but the exact number of games is a compelling option, with six or seven games offered at +195 each on BetOnline. The Dodgers' starting rotation is a concern, with pitchers Walker Buehler and Jack Flaherty having ERAs north of 6.00 this postseason. The Yankees' rotation has also been less than perfect, but Gerrit Cole has been a bright spot.

The New York Yankees have secured a spot in the 2024 World Series, marking their 40th appearance in the championship. With 27 wins, they are the most successful team in Major League Baseball (MLB) history. The team's dominance was particularly notable between the 1920s and 1960s, with 20 championships and nine World Series losses. Notable players from this era include Yogi Berra, who won 10 titles, and Joe DiMaggio, who won nine. The team's recent drought, with their last championship in 2009, has been a topic of discussion.

**Cleveland Guardians defeated by Yankees 5-2 in Game 5 of ALCS as New York advances to World Series**
The Cleveland Guardians' magical 2024 season came to an end with a 5-2 loss to the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series. The Yankees' stars, including Giancarlo Stanton and Juan Soto, came through when it mattered, while the Guardians' top players did not. Stanton tied the game with a two-run homer in the sixth inning, and Soto won it with a three-run blast in the 10th, which was set up by a costly Brayan Rocchio error. The Guardians' bullpen struggled in the series, allowing five home runs and posting a 9.64 ERA, while the Yankees' relievers thrived, pitching 5 1/3 scoreless innings. Cleveland's José Ramírez went 0 for 4, and Josh Naylor finished with a lackluster .531 OPS during the postseason. The loss extends the Guardians' World Series championship drought to 77 years. 'It was a great season, but it's hard to swallow right now,' said manager Stephen Vogt. 'We gave it everything we had, but it wasn't enough.'

**Yankees Advance to 2024 MLB World Series with Juan Soto's Walk-Off Home Run**
The New York Yankees have advanced to the 2024 MLB World Series after a home run by Juan Soto in the 10th inning gave them a 5-2 lead over the Cleveland Guardians. The Yankees, now champions of the American League, will await the winner of the series between the Mets and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Soto's home run, which came on the last pitch of the game, sealed the victory for the Yankees and sent them to the World Series. The team's manager, Hunter Gladdis, had been tasked with closing out the game, but Soto's powerful swing proved to be too much for him. The Yankees' victory marks their first appearance in the World Series since 2009, when they won their 27th championship. The team's owner has invested heavily in the team, signing Aaron Judge to a lucrative contract and trading away talent to make room for Soto. Now, the Yankees will look to win their 28th championship and solidify their status as the most successful team in Major League Baseball history.

**Yankees Top Contenders for World Series Title in 2024**
The New York Yankees are on track to be one of the top contenders for the World Series title this year, something that hasn't happened for the Bronx team since 2009. According to FanGraphs, the team led by Aaron Boone has the highest probability of winning the title, with an 18.5% chance, the highest among all MLB teams. The regular season has been solid for the Yankees, and they are expected to be the team to beat in the playoffs. FanGraphs also projects the Yankees as the winners of the American League East, with an 87.9% chance of securing the division title. The Baltimore Orioles, who are second in their division, have only a 12.1% chance. With 87 wins and 63 losses, the Yankees are 3 games ahead of the Orioles, who have 12 games left in their schedule. They are also in a close race with the Cleveland Guardians for the top spot in the American League, with a 0.5 game lead. The arrival of Juan Soto has given the team a different aura this year, with a player who has already hit 40 home runs this season, a career high. Now it's up to the Yankees to prove their favoritism on the field.

**The Latest 2024 MLB Playoff Odds and Predictions With 1 Month to Go**
The Bleacher Report is projecting the New York Yankees to lose the World Series to the Arizona Diamondbacks, similar to the 2001 series. The Diamondbacks have a strong pitching staff, while the Yankees have uncertainty in their rotation after Gerrit Cole. Aaron Judge and Juan Soto are key players for the Yankees, but the team may be too reliant on them to win the World Series. As the Bleacher Report states, 'For as great as Judge and Soto are, Aaron Boone's squad might be too top-heavy to come away with World Series No. 28 this year.'
