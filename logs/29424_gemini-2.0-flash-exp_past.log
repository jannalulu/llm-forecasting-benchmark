Okay, let's break down this forecast for Missouri Amendment 7.

**1. Triage and Reference Existing Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is an existing Metaculus question on this topic with a community prediction of 61% as of today. This is useful as a starting point but requires further investigation. I will note that the question was opened over a month ago and predictions at that time were in the 50-60% range, so it has been trending upwards.
*   **FiveThirtyEight/Polymarket:**  These platforms don't seem to have specific predictions for this particular state-level amendment.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

This amendment has two main components:
    *   **Banning Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV):** This is the primary aim of the amendment.
    *   **Limiting Voting to US Citizens:** This is arguably "ballot candy" designed to make the amendment more appealing.

The sub-problems are thus:

    *   How popular is RCV in Missouri?
    *   How do voters respond to "ballot candy" tactics?
    *   What are the political dynamics at play? (Party positions, endorsements, etc.)
    *   What other ballot issues could influence voter turnout and behavior on this issue?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   **Base Rate for Ballot Initiatives:**  Ballot initiatives have varying success rates, but generally, those with broad support or a lack of well-funded opposition have a higher chance of passing. Amendments that are perceived to restrict voting or are confusing often face more opposition. I don't have precise base rates, but it's worth noting that many ballot measures fail.
    *   **Ranked Choice Voting Trends:** RCV is still a relatively new concept in the US, and the number of localities using it is growing, as is the debate around its use. There is no obvious national trend of states embracing it.
    * **States Banning RCV**: Several states are voting on the future of RCV and there seems to be a trend of banning it, rather than adopting it.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Support for the Amendment:**
        *   The Missouri Republican Party seems to be supporting this amendment as they have been pushing it (see news articles).
        *   Several Republicans running for office, such as Attorney General Andrew Bailey and Treasurer Vivek Malek, have voiced support, as well as the Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft.
        *  A poll cited by the Missouri Attorney General indicated 68% support, but it may not be reliable as it may have been commissioned by supporters of the amendment.
        * Conservative media outlets are also urging voters to vote "yes" on this amendment (The Blaze).
        *   Opponents also view the fact that it is packaged with an unnecessary restatement that only US citizens can vote as evidence that proponents believe it will help the amendment pass.
        *   Some voters may be confused by the ballot language and vote yes thinking that they are simply supporting the citizen voting restriction.
        *   Some voters may feel that RCV is overly complex, or that it benefits a minority of voters (as it favours candidates with broad, moderate support, rather than candidates with narrow, extreme support), even if they are unsure about exactly what the ranked-choice vote is.
    *   **Opposition to the Amendment:**
        *   Those who support RCV are against the amendment, and argue it is limiting voter choice.
        *   Critics see this as a sneaky attempt to remove ranked choice voting in Missouri, with deceptive "ballot candy".
        *   Some believe that RCV benefits voters, allowing them to vote for third-party candidates without "throwing away" their vote, and it is designed to reduce polarization.
        * The Kansas City Star has issued a 'No' endorsement for Amendment 7.
        *  Some voters may recognize that the citizen voting restriction is redundant and that the amendment seeks to limit voting choice under a guise of common sense, so may vote against it.
        *  Some Missouri voters may be aware of, and dislike, the use of a tactic of using "ballot candy" (which is a widely recognised term) so will want to vote against it.
    *   **Other factors:**
        *  There is evidence of significant campaigning for other issues, notably the abortion rights amendment (Amendment 3). The Missouri voters will have other significant issues to focus on, so voter attention might be drawn away from the relatively obscure and technical RCV issue (and may also affect turn out).
        * Some commentators are framing this as a power grab by politicians to maintain their control.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting:**

*   The "ballot candy" aspect, while a known tactic, may still sway voters who don't look closely at the amendment's full implications. However, opponents of the amendment are widely highlighting this deception in the media.
*   The lack of widespread RCV use in the US suggests there isn't a massive groundswell for it. The fact that Alaska has a measure on the ballot to repeal their ranked-choice system suggests there is an ongoing and legitimate debate about RCV amongst voters.
* The trend of other states considering measures to ban RCV suggests that the supporters of Amendment 7 in Missouri have correctly identified that it is not a popular method of voting.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pro-Amendment:** The Republican party's support, along with some voters' perception that RCV is complicated, are driving forces in favor.
*   **Anti-Amendment:**  Concerns over deceptive tactics, the desire for greater voter choice, and the relative lack of controversy or urgency for this issue compared to other ballot measures all act against it.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The Metaculus forecast has been trending upward recently suggesting momentum for the "yes" vote.
*   The fact that a variety of sources consider the citizen voting measure to be "ballot candy" suggests that it may be working on voters.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

There is significant uncertainty given the conflicting forces and the nature of the ballot measure. There are a lot of other issues drawing voter attention.

**8. Confidence and Decisiveness:**

Given the polling data that shows about 2/3 of Missouri voters support the citizen-only vote aspect of the amendment, I'm leaning towards a higher probability of passage, though some voters will recognize the deceptive practice and vote against it. Also, some voters will not understand the technical details of ranked choice voting and are more likely to vote in favour of keeping the current system of voting. Given that ranked-choice voting is not yet used in Missouri, there is a degree of status quo bias (i.e. if voters don't know what it is, they may be unlikely to support a change, and the status quo is for the state to not use RCV).

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

The risk of overreacting to the "ballot candy" tactic exists. However, it does seem that political forces have correctly determined that this additional clause is likely to result in voters voting yes for the whole amendment, so it is important to consider this when considering the accuracy of the prediction.

**Final Analysis & Prediction:**

Based on all of the above, the amendment has a good chance of passing. While there are arguments against it, it seems that it will benefit from the fact that the "ballot candy" aspect will resonate with many voters, and will lead them to vote yes, even if they don't fully understand ranked-choice voting. The status quo bias is likely to work in favour of the amendment as well (as Missouri voters do not currently use RCV so may be resistant to change). The Republican party support will also boost support for a "yes" vote. 

My Prediction: Between 58.00% and 78.00%, but 68.00% being the most likely. Probability: 68.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about Missouri Amendment 7.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is an active Metaculus question on this, currently at 68%. This is a useful reference point, reflecting the collective wisdom of a group of forecasters.
*   **FiveThirtyEight/Polymarket:** There are no specific predictions from FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket on this particular state-level ballot measure. This is not unusual as they tend to focus on national elections.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We can break this down into several sub-problems:
    *   What are the arguments for and against Amendment 7?
    *   How does the "ballot candy" aspect influence voter behavior?
    *   What is the general political climate in Missouri, and how might it affect this vote?
    *   What is the level of awareness about ranked-choice voting in Missouri?
    *   How might other ballot measures on the same ballot affect the likelihood of this passing?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:**  Ballot measures are often driven by specific interest groups or political parties, rather than voters themselves and can be confusing, especially when there is deceptive or 'ballot candy' wording. In the absence of significant public polling on this particular measure, this general pattern might be more informative than it is for electoral races. 
*   **Inside View:** Looking at Missouri specifically, we have a clear pattern of Republicans supporting Amendment 7, and Democrats likely to oppose it. The news articles confirm that Republicans are strongly behind the measure, while some groups are campaigning against it but it's clear that these latter groups are under-resourced. Moreover, there is some evidence that voters may be misled by the "ballot candy" element of the amendment, which includes a seemingly innocuous proposal about citizenship. The fact that it's difficult to track polling on state ballot initiatives suggests the public may have limited awareness or engagement on such issues. There is also the complexity of the amendment itself: it addresses more than one issue which makes it more difficult for some people to understand or take a clear position on. 

**4. Balancing Under and Overreacting:**

The polls referenced in the articles regarding other initiatives, such as the abortion amendment, shows that there is movement for progressive issues in the state. That would suggest that the amendment is more likely to fail. However, Missouri is a deeply conservative state and, as such, it's more likely that voters will side with the Republican position even if they aren't totally aware of the specifics.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for YES:**
    *   Republican party support and endorsements.
    *   The 'citizenship' clause is a simple, popular idea.
    *   Potential confusion among voters regarding ranked-choice voting.
    *   General tendency for voters to default to "status quo" if unsure.
    *   The absence of strong organized opposition to the amendment.
    *   Conservative state.
*   **Forces for NO:**
    *   Opponents highlight the deceptive nature of the ballot language ('ballot candy').
    *   Some groups are actively campaigning against the amendment.
    *   Ranked-choice voting advocates view this as an attempt to limit voter choice.
    *   The increasing trend for some progressives to support more democratic reforms.
    *   Confusion about the multiple issues within the amendment.

**6. Extrapolating Trends:**

There isn't a clear, linear trend with this amendment, unlike with polling data for specific candidates. But we can extrapolate a trend of Republicans favouring status quo approaches to voting which would suggest the amendment is likely to pass.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

There's moderate uncertainty here. The ballot measure has potential to confuse voters. We can't be as confident as we would be with a major, heavily polled election, like a Presidential race.

**8. Balancing Confidence:**

I will lean toward the idea that Amendment 7 will pass but with a degree of caution. The state is conservative and Republicans support the amendment. However, the "ballot candy" tactic could backfire, and there's an outside chance that the arguments against the amendment will have some influence on a proportion of the voters who are actively following this issue.

**9. Looking for Errors/Hindsight Bias:**

I need to be careful about over-interpreting the level of support the Republicans have in Missouri and equally careful about not over-estimating the level of sophistication voters bring to ballot measures. The 'ballot candy' element makes it especially challenging to predict the outcome.

**Forecast:**

Based on the analysis above:

*   The base rate for ballot initiatives is tricky as the success rate depends on issue, state, time etc., but in general we can expect a tendency for voters to default to the status quo if confused or undecided, and for many voters to be unaware of the details and just vote along party lines (in this case, Republican).
*   The "ballot candy" aspect could sway some votes but mostly in favour of the initiative as a more clearly worded and easy to understand concept.
*   The overall political climate in Missouri, which is trending conservative, favours the amendment.
*   The relative weakness of the "no" campaign may hamper its ability to mobilize significant voter opposition.

Therefore, I am going to predict that the amendment is more likely to pass than not, but I will incorporate a degree of uncertainty into the forecast as the "ballot candy" effect could reduce its likelihood.

My Prediction: Between 58.00% and 78.00%, but 68.00% being the most likely. Probability: 68.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using the superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is an existing Metaculus question on this topic: [https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17672/missouri-amendment-7-ranked-choice-voting/](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17672/missouri-amendment-7-ranked-choice-voting/). As of today, the community prediction is around 70%, indicating a moderate likelihood of approval. This is a useful anchor point.
*   **Other Sources:** I haven't found any specific predictions from FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket on this specific amendment. However, their general political analysis could provide some context for the Missouri electorate.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question hinges on understanding:

*   **Missouri Voter Behavior:** How likely are Missouri voters to approve a constitutional amendment that bans ranked-choice voting?
*   **Amendment 7's Specifics:** The amendment includes a seemingly popular provision about citizen-only voting, coupled with a less-understood prohibition on ranked-choice voting.
*   **Campaign Dynamics:** What are the arguments for and against the amendment? How effective are the campaigns?
*   **External Factors:** How might other ballot measures and the political environment influence the outcome?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   **Base Rate for Amendments:** Historically, constitutional amendments in any state often pass, but it's hard to get a precise general base rate. However, measures with a clear and simple goal, or those positioned as 'common sense' tend to do better than more complex ones.
    *   **Ranked Choice Voting:** Ranked-choice voting is a relatively new concept to many voters and is not widely adopted across the US. Many other states are also considering RCV measures which highlights how potentially contentious it is.
    *  **Missouri Politics:** Missouri is generally considered a red state, and Republicans are largely opposing ranked-choice voting, giving a general sense that there's a higher likelihood the measure passes.

*   **Inside View (Specifics of Amendment 7):**
    *   **"Ballot Candy":** The "citizen-only voting" provision is a clear attempt to entice voters with a popular measure and obscure the other aspects of Amendment 7. This is a common tactic but it's hard to be sure how effective it will be for this specific measure.
    *   **Opposition Arguments:** Opponents of the amendment argue it is a "Trojan horse" and a "poison pill" that limits choice and makes elections less representative. Their framing also highlights that this measure is "anti-democratic" which can be seen to work against it.
    *   **Support Arguments:** Supporters, largely Republicans, emphasize election security and the idea that ranked-choice voting is confusing and cumbersome. They are tying it to the citizen voting rights issue which will likely appeal to some.
    *   **Low Profile:** The fact that Amendment 7 has received comparatively little attention in the media could lead to less informed voting and potentially a default towards supporting the simple (and perhaps misleading) framing provided by its proponents.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreaction:**

*   **Underreacting:** Dismissing the likely impact of the ballot-candy element could be a mistake. It is likely that many voters will simply see the citizen-only language as a reason to vote Yes, without examining the complex consequences. The general low profile of the measure could also work in its favour with less-informed voters more likely to vote Yes.
*   **Overreacting:** Thinking that because it's misleading, it is bound to be defeated is also probably incorrect. The Republican support and general lack of understanding of RCV are significant. It's also dangerous to believe opponents' warnings about a "poison pill" will resonate with most voters.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Support:** The simple and initially appealing "citizen-only voting" element, the general trend of Republicans opposing RCV, and the generally low-profile nature of the amendment.
*   **Opposition:** The "Trojan horse" argument, some awareness of ranked-choice voting benefits, the general push towards greater voter choice, and the fact that St Louis already has it in local elections and isn't affected by this amendment (suggesting that a ban may be unnecessary).

**6. Linear Extrapolation of Trends:**

*   Hard to do on this topic as it's a one-off vote on a complicated issue. The general trends are towards greater voting choice but this measure is actively attempting to go against that.

**7. Distinguishing Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is a moderate level of uncertainty given it's a unique ballot measure. It's not a foregone conclusion in either direction. The seemingly popular citizen-only element of the amendment likely has a powerful sway, but it is not guaranteed to carry the day.

**8. Balancing Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   I am avoiding being overly confident, acknowledging the uncertainty. I am trying to balance the factors above while recognizing that the "ballot candy" aspect is likely to help its passing.

**9. Learning From Mistakes (and Avoiding Hindsight Bias):**
* I will pay attention to post-election analyses of ballot measures and look for common themes or factors that help explain the success or failure of such measures.
* I will also review my forecast and identify if I put too much or too little emphasis on the different factors, in particular on the "ballot candy" aspect of Amendment 7.

**Analysis Conclusion:**
The "ballot candy" aspect of Amendment 7 is a clever tactic that increases its chances of success, particularly given the generally low profile this measure seems to have. The lack of familiarity with ranked-choice voting and the general Republican opposition to it also work in its favour. However, the claims about it being anti-democratic and a "poison pill" also can't be completely discounted. Balancing these forces, I believe that the "ballot candy" element is more likely to resonate with voters, thus leading me to predict it passing.

**My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 72.00% being the most likely. Probability: 72.00%.**

*   **Other Sources:** I haven't found any specific predictions from FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket on this specific amendment. However, their general political analysis could provide some context for the Missouri electorate.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question hinges on understanding:

*   **Missouri Voter Behavior:** How likely are Missouri voters to approve a constitutional amendment that bans ranked-choice voting?
*   **Amendment 7's Specifics:** The amendment includes a seemingly popular provision about citizen-only voting, coupled with a less-understood prohibition on ranked-choice voting.
*   **Campaign Dynamics:** What are the arguments for and against the amendment? How effective are the campaigns?
*   **External Factors:** How might other ballot measures and the political environment influence the outcome?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   **Base Rate for Amendments:** Historically, constitutional amendments in any state often pass, but it's hard to get a precise general base rate. However, measures with a clear and simple goal, or those positioned as 'common sense' tend to do better than more complex ones.
    *   **Ranked Choice Voting:** Ranked-choice voting is a relatively new concept to many voters and is not widely adopted across the US. Many other states are also considering RCV measures which highlights how potentially contentious it is.
    *  **Missouri Politics:** Missouri is generally considered a red state, and Republicans are largely opposing ranked-choice voting, giving a general sense that there's a higher likelihood the measure passes.

*   **Inside View (Specifics of Amendment 7):**
    *   **"Ballot Candy":** The "citizen-only voting" provision is a clear attempt to entice voters with a popular measure and obscure the other aspects of Amendment 7. This is a common tactic but it's hard to be sure how effective it will be for this specific measure.
    *   **Opposition Arguments:** Opponents of the amendment argue it is a "Trojan horse" and a "poison pill" that limits choice and makes elections less representative. Their framing also highlights that this measure is "anti-democratic" which can be seen to work against it.
    *   **Support Arguments:** Supporters, largely Republicans, emphasize election security and the idea that ranked-choice voting is confusing and cumbersome. They are tying it to the citizen voting rights issue which will likely appeal to some.
    *   **Low Profile:** The fact that Amendment 7 has received comparatively little attention in the media could lead to less informed voting and potentially a default towards supporting the simple (and perhaps misleading) framing provided by its proponents.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreaction:**

*   **Underreacting:** Dismissing the likely impact of the ballot-candy element could be a mistake. It is likely that many voters will simply see the citizen-only language as a reason to vote Yes, without examining the complex consequences. The general low profile of the measure could also work in its favour with less-informed voters more likely to vote Yes.
*   **Overreacting:** Thinking that because it's misleading, it is bound to be defeated is also probably incorrect. The Republican support and general lack of understanding of RCV are significant. It's also dangerous to believe opponents' warnings about a "poison pill" will resonate with most voters.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Support:** The simple and initially appealing "citizen-only voting" element, the general trend of Republicans opposing RCV, and the generally low-profile nature of the amendment.
*   **Opposition:** The "Trojan horse" argument, some awareness of ranked-choice voting benefits, the general push towards greater voter choice, and the fact that St Louis already has it in local elections and isn't affected by this amendment (suggesting that a ban may be unnecessary).

**6. Linear Extrapolation of Trends:**

*   Hard to do on this topic as it's a one-off vote on a complicated issue. The general trends are towards greater voting choice but this measure is actively attempting to go against that.

**7. Distinguishing Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is a moderate level of uncertainty given it's a unique ballot measure. It's not a foregone conclusion in either direction. The seemingly popular citizen-only element of the amendment likely has a powerful sway, but it is not guaranteed to carry the day.

**8. Balancing Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   I am avoiding being overly confident, acknowledging the uncertainty. I am trying to balance the factors above while recognizing that the "ballot candy" aspect is likely to help its passing.

**9. Learning From Mistakes (and Avoiding Hindsight Bias):**
* I will pay attention to post-election analyses of ballot measures and look for common themes or factors that help explain the success or failure of such measures.
* I will also review my forecast and identify if I put too much or too little emphasis on the different factors, in particular on the "ballot candy" aspect of Amendment 7.

**Analysis Conclusion:**
The "ballot candy" aspect of Amendment 7 is a clever tactic that increases its chances of success, particularly given the generally low profile this measure seems to have. The lack of familiarity with ranked-choice voting and the general Republican opposition to it also work in its favour. However, the claims about it being anti-democratic and a "poison pill" also can't be completely discounted. Balancing these forces, I believe that the "ballot candy" element is more likely to resonate with voters, thus leading me to predict it passing.

**My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 72.00% being the most likely. Probability: 72.00%.**

Okay, let's break down this forecast using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference External Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is a live Metaculus question on this topic. As of now, the Metaculus community prediction is around 63% for approval of Amendment 7.
*   **Other Sources:** I haven't found reliable predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket on this specific amendment.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

To assess the likelihood of passage, consider these elements:
    *   **Base Rate:** What is the typical success rate of constitutional amendments in Missouri?
    *   **Political Context:** What is the political landscape in Missouri and how might that influence voters?
    *   **Amendment Content:** How do voters perceive the specific components of Amendment 7?
    *   **Campaign Dynamics:** What are the arguments for and against it, and how effectively are they being communicated to voters?

**3. Balance Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  It's challenging to find specific, comprehensive data on Missouri constitutional amendment success rates. However, generally, many ballot measures are defeated. This suggests an initial base rate below 50%. Let's start with a speculative base rate of 40% for a constitutional amendment passing.
*  **Inside View:** This is more focused on the specifics of this ballot measure and the context, which may drive the actual outcome either above or below the 40% base rate.

**4. Balance Under- and Over-Reacting:**

I will try to avoid overreacting to the latest news, and also not ignoring potential useful clues, by adjusting the estimate in a measured way.

**5. Look for Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for Approval (Yes Vote):**
    *   **Republican Support:** The amendment is largely supported by Republicans, who hold significant political power in Missouri.
    *   **"Ballot Candy":** The provision regarding citizenship is designed to appeal to voters and increase the likelihood of a "yes" vote, even though it is already state law.
    *   **Confusion over Ranked Choice Voting:** Critics of ranked-choice voting have successfully highlighted concerns about complexity and manipulation, which may sway less engaged voters to oppose it.
    *  **Conservative Endorsements:** Conservative outlets are encouraging a 'Yes' vote.
*   **Forces Pushing Against Approval (No Vote):**
    *   **"Trojan Horse" Argument:** Opponents are framing the amendment as deceptive, arguing the citizenship clause is a ruse to sneak through a ban on ranked-choice voting.
    *   **Ranked-Choice Voting Supporters:**  Advocacy groups exist in Missouri that are pushing for ranked-choice voting which suggests that this is something that some portion of voters are aware of and may want to see implemented.
   *    **Opposition from Some Media:** Some newspapers and political commentators are urging a 'no' vote.
   *  **Potential for Voter Backlash:** The seemingly underhanded nature of the way this has been presented to the public may result in some voters turning against it as a form of protest.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The current trend is that Republicans are pushing for it, and there is significant controversy around the 'ballot candy' and the ban on ranked-choice voting. There is no clear trend, that suggests this is either very likely or very unlikely to pass.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

There's considerable uncertainty surrounding voter behavior and how voters will weigh the competing arguments. While a straightforward ban on non-citizen voting might have broad appeal, the perceived deceptiveness of the amendment could turn voters away.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

Given the mix of factors, I will try to be confident but not overconfident. There are arguments on both sides, and the result is not completely pre-determined.

**9. Look for Errors and Hindsight:**

After this prediction resolves, I will reflect on how this specific context influenced the outcome, how I weighed the different arguments, and whether I missed any key factors or over-weighted any factors in the final estimate.

**Analysis and Forecast:**

The base rate suggests a below 50% chance of passage, but the political landscape in Missouri favors passage. The "ballot candy" strategy by supporters and the criticism of this strategy from the opponents make this an important focal point.  The arguments against, such as those labeling Amendment 7 a "Trojan Horse" may hold weight, but it may not be sufficient to outweigh the Republican push and the confusion surrounding ranked-choice voting. The Metaculus community prediction is around 63% and this seems like a reasonable assessment. The overall impression is that the scales are very slightly tipped in favour of it being approved.

Given these considerations, I believe Amendment 7 is more likely to pass than not, with a slight uncertainty. A probability of 64% represents this uncertainty but acknowledges the slight advantage for a "yes" vote.

My Prediction: Between 54.00% and 74.00%, but 64.00% being the most likely. Probability: 64.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is a Metaculus question on this, but the community prediction is not available without logging in. I will check back later for this before finalizing my estimate.
*   **FiveThirtyEight/Polymarket:** I couldn't find any specific predictions for this particular Missouri ballot measure on these sites.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **What is Amendment 7?** It bans ranked-choice voting (RCV) in Missouri and also includes a clause about citizen-only voting.
*   **What are the arguments for/against?**
    *   **For:** Republicans generally oppose RCV, citing potential voter confusion and manipulation by special interest groups. The "citizen-only voting" clause is likely popular and may garner support, even if the main driver is opposition to RCV.
    *   **Against:** RCV supporters claim it leads to more representative outcomes, reduces polarization, and allows for third-party candidates. The citizen-only clause is seen by critics as a 'Trojan horse' or 'ballot candy' to distract from the RCV ban, which they believe is designed to suppress voter choice.
*   **What is the political context?** Missouri is a generally Republican-leaning state, which may favor the passage of the amendment.

**3. Outside View (Base Rates):**

*   **Ballot measure success rates:** Ballot measures tend to pass at varying rates, with no single reliable rule, and many factors being at play. I will not use an overall base rate for all ballot measures here.
*   **Ranked Choice Voting bans in other states:**  Florida has recently banned RCV.  Alaska is also considering a repeal of it. The fact that several states are acting against RCV suggests a general trend against it.
*   **Citizen only voting:** There is also a general trend of preventing non-citizens from voting, although it is already illegal at a federal level.

**4. Inside View (Specific Evidence):**

*   **Republican support:** The amendment is pushed by Republicans and supported by the state's Attorney General. Republican candidates are touting the measure as important, suggesting a degree of political coordination, and it is recommended for a 'yes' vote by a conservative news outlet.
*   **"Ballot candy":**  The citizen-only provision is designed to make the amendment more appealing to voters, which increases the likelihood of passage. The messaging is focused more on the "common sense" nature of citizen-only voting.
*   **Opposition arguments:** Critics argue that the amendment is confusing and deceptive, intended to ban RCV under the guise of the citizen-only provision. They point to this as a way that politicians are trying to 'trick' the public.
*   **St. Louis exception:** The carve-out for St. Louis might confuse some voters, but it is unlikely to significantly alter overall statewide results. It only impacts some municipal non-partisan elections.
*   **Polling**:  There was a poll from Public Opinion Strategies (POS) suggesting 68% support. It should be noted however, that the poll was cited by a proponent of the bill and not by the source itself. The poll also only measured support for "citizen-only" voting, rather than the entire amendment, and was taken in September, a while before the election.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Trend Against RCV:** The general trend of some states moving against RCV and towards citizen-only voting suggests a significant underlying causal force for the amendment to be successful.
*   **Deceptive Nature of the Amendment:** The criticism around "ballot candy" and the way it might mislead people is a clashing force that would lower the chances of a successful passage.
*   **Political Polarization:** The amendment's explicit backing from Republicans may make it unpopular among Democrats and independent voters, while increasing support amongst Republicans.

**6. Trend Extrapolation:**

*   It's difficult to extrapolate a linear trend given the specific context of a ballot measure. The polling data (albeit limited) is in its favor but it is older. The increasing push from republicans supports a higher probability. The pushback of the "ballot candy" is a negative trend, so I need to balance these against each other.
*   Given it's an election with a series of different amendments and propositions, there is a risk that many voters may have limited knowledge of the specifics of each measure, and that voters might be swayed more by the "citizen-only" provision that seems intuitively correct, rather than opposition from activists.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   Given the lack of polling data close to the election date, there is some uncertainty. However the Republican support is strong. The arguments against are very technical, and would be difficult for the average voter to appreciate.

**8. Balance of Confidence:**

*   I am not *completely* confident of the passage of the amendment, but the forces and trends suggest a likely success. The fact that this would also ban RCV is another factor that seems to be trending in the same direction. I will avoid being overconfident, but I will not overly doubt the outcome.

**9. Error Analysis:**

*   I must be aware of potential hindsight bias, by assuming that people will see it the same way as I do. I have to ensure that my reasoning is logical and based on the data and information available. The fact that it is the Republicans that support this amendment is perhaps the key piece of information.

**Conclusion:**

Weighing all the information available, including the political context, support from Republican figures, the nature of ballot measures, and the "ballot candy" nature of the provision, a reasonable outcome is that the amendment *will* pass. The deceptive nature will be difficult for many voters to parse.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is a Metaculus question on this, but the community prediction is not available without logging in. I will check back later for this before finalizing my estimate.
*   **FiveThirtyEight/Polymarket:** I couldn't find any specific predictions for this particular Missouri ballot measure on these sites.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **What is Amendment 7?** It bans ranked-choice voting (RCV) in Missouri and also includes a clause about citizen-only voting.
*   **What are the arguments for/against?**
    *   **For:** Republicans generally oppose RCV, citing potential voter confusion and manipulation by special interest groups. The "citizen-only voting" clause is likely popular and may garner support, even if the main driver is opposition to RCV.
    *   **Against:** RCV supporters claim it leads to more representative outcomes, reduces polarization, and allows for third-party candidates. The citizen-only clause is seen by critics as a 'Trojan horse' or 'ballot candy' to distract from the RCV ban, which they believe is designed to suppress voter choice.
*   **What is the political context?** Missouri is a generally Republican-leaning state, which may favor the passage of the amendment.

**3. Outside View (Base Rates):**

*   **Ballot measure success rates:** Ballot measures tend to pass at varying rates, with no single reliable rule, and many factors being at play. I will not use an overall base rate for all ballot measures here.
*   **Ranked Choice Voting bans in other states:**  Florida has recently banned RCV.  Alaska is also considering a repeal of it. The fact that several states are acting against RCV suggests a general trend against it.
*   **Citizen only voting:** There is also a general trend of preventing non-citizens from voting, although it is already illegal at a federal level.

**4. Inside View (Specific Evidence):**

*   **Republican support:** The amendment is pushed by Republicans and supported by the state's Attorney General. Republican candidates are touting the measure as important, suggesting a degree of political coordination, and it is recommended for a 'yes' vote by a conservative news outlet.
*   **"Ballot candy":**  The citizen-only provision is designed to make the amendment more appealing to voters, which increases the likelihood of passage. The messaging is focused more on the "common sense" nature of citizen-only voting.
*   **Opposition arguments:** Critics argue that the amendment is confusing and deceptive, intended to ban RCV under the guise of the citizen-only provision. They point to this as a way that politicians are trying to 'trick' the public.
*   **St. Louis exception:** The carve-out for St. Louis might confuse some voters, but it is unlikely to significantly alter overall statewide results. It only impacts some municipal non-partisan elections.
*   **Polling**:  There was a poll from Public Opinion Strategies (POS) suggesting 68% support. It should be noted however, that the poll was cited by a proponent of the bill and not by the source itself. The poll also only measured support for "citizen-only" voting, rather than the entire amendment, and was taken in September, a while before the election.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Trend Against RCV:** The general trend of some states moving against RCV and towards citizen-only voting suggests a significant underlying causal force for the amendment to be successful.
*   **Deceptive Nature of the Amendment:** The criticism around "ballot candy" and the way it might mislead people is a clashing force that would lower the chances of a successful passage.
*   **Political Polarization:** The amendment's explicit backing from Republicans may make it unpopular among Democrats and independent voters, while increasing support amongst Republicans.

**6. Trend Extrapolation:**

*   It's difficult to extrapolate a linear trend given the specific context of a ballot measure. The polling data (albeit limited) is in its favor but it is older. The increasing push from republicans supports a higher probability. The pushback of the "ballot candy" is a negative trend, so I need to balance these against each other.
*   Given it's an election with a series of different amendments and propositions, there is a risk that many voters may have limited knowledge of the specifics of each measure, and that voters might be swayed more by the "citizen-only" provision that seems intuitively correct, rather than opposition from activists.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   Given the lack of polling data close to the election date, there is some uncertainty. However the Republican support is strong. The arguments against are very technical, and would be difficult for the average voter to appreciate.

**8. Balance of Confidence:**

*   I am not *completely* confident of the passage of the amendment, but the forces and trends suggest a likely success. The fact that this would also ban RCV is another factor that seems to be trending in the same direction. I will avoid being overconfident, but I will not overly doubt the outcome.

**9. Error Analysis:**

*   I must be aware of potential hindsight bias, by assuming that people will see it the same way as I do. I have to ensure that my reasoning is logical and based on the data and information available. The fact that it is the Republicans that support this amendment is perhaps the key piece of information.

**Conclusion:**

Weighing all the information available, including the political context, support from Republican figures, the nature of ballot measures, and the "ballot candy" nature of the provision, a reasonable outcome is that the amendment *will* pass. The deceptive nature will be difficult for many voters to parse.
