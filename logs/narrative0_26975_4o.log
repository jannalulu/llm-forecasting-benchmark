**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, did the Fed make an emergency rate cut before September 17?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the market jitters, the Fed held steady.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. The data up to August 8 showed a slowing jobs market and recession fears, pushing some to speculate on a cut.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, but the Fed was firm on needing more confidence in inflation trends. Their July statement was key.

**NATE SILVER**  
A classic case of market nerves versus central bank patience. Our models were spot on again.

*They exchange knowing smiles as the camera fades out.*
