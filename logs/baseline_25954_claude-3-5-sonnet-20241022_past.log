Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The current Prime Minister of France is Gabriel Attal, who belongs to Renaissance party, which is part of the Together (Ensemble) coalition.

2. The resolution date is July 30, 2024, which is only 20 days from now.

3. In France, the Prime Minister serves at the pleasure of the President, and can be changed at any time. However, changes typically happen due to:
- Major political crises
- Poor performance
- Reshuffling of government
- Resignation

4. Emmanuel Macron (President) recently appointed Attal in January 2024, making him the youngest PM in French history. Given this recent appointment and Attal's relative success so far, a change seems unlikely in such a short timeframe.

5. For this to resolve as Yes, either:
- A PM from neither Together nor New Popular Front would need to be appointed
- There would need to be no sitting PM
Both scenarios seem highly unlikely in the next 20 days.

6. The stability of the current government and the short timeframe make significant changes improbable.

My Prediction: Between 2.50% and 7.50%, with 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.
