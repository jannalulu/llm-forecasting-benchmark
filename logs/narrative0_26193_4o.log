NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a table, papers scattered around them. A muted TV shows clips from the previous night.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the event did happen. Our models had it at 67.45%.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Yes, despite all the speculation, the debate took place. The July data hinted at uncertainty, but our models factored in historical trends and media commitments.  

NATE SILVER  
Indeed. The first debate's chaos made many doubt a second would occur. Yet, ABC News followed through, and both major candidates showed up.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
It’s fascinating how public perception can differ from probabilistic reality. Our models remain undefeated.

NATE SILVER  
Absolutely. It’s why understanding probabilities is crucial in forecasting. 

They nod, satisfied with their accuracy, as the TV continues to replay debate highlights.

**NATE SILVER:** So, did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 75.30%. Despite the chaos of the first debate, the likelihood of a second was strong.

**NATE SILVER:** Makes sense. The stakes were too high for either party to back out. ABC News pulled through, even with the uncertainty over the moderators and rules.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. The anticipation was palpable. Though Biden's performance was shaky before, both nominees had too much to lose by not showing up.

**NATE SILVER:** It was a gamble, but the probability was in favor of it happening. The news on July 16th made it clear enough.

*They exchange knowing glances, the accuracy of their models once again affirmed.*

No, our models had it at 47.35%. Given the uncertainty around Biden's participation after the first debate fallout, it wasn't surprising.
