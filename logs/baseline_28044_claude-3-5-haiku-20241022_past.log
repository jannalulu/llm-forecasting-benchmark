To forecast this, I'll carefully analyze recent trends and polling data for the Brandenburg state election:

Key Considerations:
1. AfD has been polling strongly in recent Brandenburg state polls
2. Recent German state elections have shown rising right-wing sentiment
3. Specific Brandenburg polling from August 2024 suggests AfD support around 28-30%
4. The exact range specified (>28% and â‰¤30%) is very narrow
5. Recent polls by different institutes have slight variations

Recent Polling Evidence:
- Multiple polls in summer 2024 place AfD between 27-31%
- Consistent trend of strong AfD performance in eastern German states
- Local Brandenburg political dynamics favor right-wing parties

Uncertainty Factors:
- Potential last-minute shifts in voter sentiment
- Mobilization of opposing voter groups
- Specific local campaign dynamics

Reasoning suggests high probability of landing in specified range, with clustering around 29%.

My Prediction: Between 28.10% and 29.90%, but 29.20% being the most likely. Probability: 62.50%.
