**The Rise Of Major Food Recalls**
Boar's Head, a delicatessen supplier, is shutting down its Virginia plant indefinitely after being linked to a listeria outbreak that killed nine people and hospitalized 57. The outbreak has led to the recall of 7 million pounds of meat. The USDA had previously reported concerns about the plant's food safety, citing mold, rust, and insects. This outbreak is part of a larger trend of increasing food recalls, with 2023 seeing the highest number since before the pandemic. Other recent recalls include apple juice, eggs, cantaloupes, and cinnamon. 'The rise in food recalls is a concerning trend,' said no specific person in the article, but the Public Interest Research Group notes that consumers can take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones.

**FDA Recalls Apple Juice Due to Excessive Arsenic Levels**
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recalled several brands of apple juice due to excessive levels of arsenic. The affected brands include Great Value, Market Basket, Weis, Urban Meadow, Natures Nectar, Wellsley Farms, Solevita, and Clover Valley, all of which are manufactured by Refresco Beverages US Inc. According to the FDA, 'the products contain inorganic arsenic above the action level established in the guidelines for the industry.' Prolonged consumption of this substance can cause various types of cancer, particularly lung and skin cancer. The FDA estimates that around 133,500 cases of the affected product were sold through retailers such as Walgreens, Walmart, BJ's, Weis, and Aldi. The affected products were sold in 15 states and Puerto Rico. Refresco Beverages US Inc. has issued a statement saying, 'our top priority is the safety of our consumers.' The company claims that they voluntarily initiated a market withdrawal of some selected lots of apple juice products on August 23, 2024, after discovering that the product contained inorganic arsenic slightly above the FDA's action level of 10 parts per billion established in June 2023. The FDA had previously issued two alerts regarding the issue, but only for the Great Value brand. No cases of illness have been reported in relation to the recall.

**Boar's Head Shutting Down Virginia Plant Linked to Deadly Listeria Outbreak**
Boar's Head will shut down its Virginia plant linked to a deadly listeria outbreak and nationwide recall of its products. The company stated, 'It pains us to impact the livelihoods of hundreds of hard-working employees.' The plant's processing of liverwurst was found to be the main cause of the outbreak. Investigators observed employees freely moving between production lines without interacting with the product, heavy discolored meat buildup, and flies going in and out of pickle vats. The company will appoint a new food safety official and stop selling liverwurst. Consumers are advised to check their refrigerators and kitchens for recalled Boar's Head products with a 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels, which have sell-by dates until October 2024.

**Boar's Head shutters Virginia plant linked to listeria outbreak**
Boar's Head is shutting down its Jarratt, Va., plant, which was linked to a deadly listeria outbreak that hospitalized at least 57 people across 18 states and resulted in 9 deaths.

The company has reached an agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 Union to transfer or provide severance packages to over 500 affected employees. The CDC recommends checking homes for recalled products with 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels, which have sell by dates into October 2024.

**US FDA Recalls Eggs from Milo's Poultry Farms and Tony's Fresh Market Due to Salmonella Risk**
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the immediate recall of eggs from Milo's Poultry Farms and Tony's Fresh Market due to possible salmonella contamination. The recall affects consumers in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan, where the products were distributed through supermarkets and food service providers. According to the FDA, Milo's Poultry Farms, LLC, based in Bonduel, Wisconsin, has decided to recall all types and sizes of egg cartons sold under these brands, including products with all expiration dates. The decision was made after the FDA detected salmonella in the company's facilities through environmental testing. An analysis of the genome of the samples confirmed that the detected bacteria was related to an ongoing salmonella outbreak. In response, Milo's Poultry Farms has stopped all egg production and distribution, and is conducting a thorough cleaning of its facilities and processing equipment. The affected products should not be consumed. The FDA has issued an official recommendation for those who have purchased the eggs to safely dispose of them or contact the company for guidance. People who still have the eggs can call (715) 758-6709 for more information. Salmonella is a bacteria that can cause serious health problems, especially in children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, which typically appear between 6 and 72 hours after consuming contaminated food, according to a Mayo Clinic article. While most cases resolve within a week, in more severe situations, the infection can lead to complications such as arterial infections or endocarditis, requiring hospitalization. 'The FDA is taking this action to protect public health,' said the FDA in a statement. 'We urge consumers to take this recall seriously and discard any affected products immediately.'

**USDA flagged safety and health violations in Boar's Head plant years before listeria outbreak - Washington Examiner**
Federal food safety assessments in 2022 revealed serious safety and health violations at the Boar's Head plant, including live beetles, mold, and rust. Despite these reports, the USDA did not take enforcement action. Inspectors reported 60 days of 'noncompliances' between August 2023 and July 2024, including blood puddles, dirty machinery, and heavy meat buildup. The plant did not face consequences, and a listeria outbreak occurred, resulting in 9 deaths and dozens of hospitalizations. A food safety expert said, 'Consumers had to die before this plant got shut down, really is the bottom line.' Boar's Head recalled 3,500 tons of meat in July, but some of the affected meat may still be in consumers' possession, with an expiration date in October.

**Jerky Recalled Nationwide As Safety Warning Issued**
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has announced the recall of approximately 6,000 pounds of ready-to-eat jerky products produced by Hickory Hollow Jerky, an Alabama-based and veteran-owned business. The products were made without required federal inspection and were shipped to several states and sold online nationwide. The recall affects 10 flavors of jerky, including Jamaican Jerked, Original, and Honey Mustard Bacon Jerky. The FSIS discovered the issue during routine surveillance activities and determined that the establishment was continuing to produce the jerky products after requesting to voluntarily stop FSIS-inspections. No illnesses have been reported, but anyone who purchased the jerky is advised to throw it away or return it to the place of purchase. The business, which has changed ownership this year, claims on its website that its jerky is made from premium cuts of USDA inspected beef, but has not commented on the recall. The FSIS protects Americans' health by ensuring meat, poultry and egg products are safe to eat, and conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that firms are notifying consumers of the recall.

**These food recalls should alarm all American consumers and have been linked to serious disease, death**
The FDA is responsible for regulating food products, except for meat, poultry, and processed egg products, which are regulated by the USDA. Food recalls occur when a product is in violation of FDA regulations, and can be due to bacterial contamination, foreign objects, or undeclared allergens. According to a report by Consumer Reports, the top 10 foods linked to serious recalls between 2017 and 2022 were: leafy greens, cheeses and deli meat, ground beef, onions, turkey, chicken, papayas, peaches, cantaloupe, and flour. Leafy greens were recalled 50 times during this period, leading to 11 deaths, while deli meat and cheese were subject to 122 recalls/outbreaks, resulting in 7 deaths and 16,925,594 pounds of recalled product. It is essential to take precautions when a food recall occurs, such as not consuming the product, safely disposing of it, and sanitizing the area where it was stored. 'Food recalls are removals of foods from the market that are in violation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's regulations,' according to the FDA website.

**CHARLEBOIS: Tale of 2 listeria summer recalls: Maple Leaf Foods vs. Danone**
The recent Silk and Great Value plant-based dairy recall, linked to Danone's Pickering plant, has raised concerns over transparency and delayed response. The first fatality occurred in August 2023, but the official recall wasn't issued until July 8, 2024. Despite three confirmed deaths, the public remains largely in the dark about the delay. In contrast, the 2008 Maple Leaf Foods listeria crisis, which resulted in 23 deaths and 57 confirmed cases, received intense scrutiny and led to significant changes in Canada's food safety surveillance system. Michael McCain, then CEO of Maple Leaf Foods, apologized and acknowledged the need for transparency. In contrast, Danone's response has been vague, and the company's name has scarcely been mentioned. Canadians deserve answers about why it took nearly a year to issue a recall and how such incidents can be prevented in the future.

Boar's Head Provisions, a deli meat supplier, has issued a recall of nine products, including liverwurst, ham, and bologna, due to potential contamination of listeria monocytogenes. The recall was issued after a sample tested positive for the bacterium, which can cause serious infections. The products were produced between June 11 and July 17, 2024, and were distributed nationwide. The USDA is urging customers to throw away or return the products and clean their refrigerators to prevent cross-contamination. Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious infections, miscarriages, and stillbirths, especially in vulnerable populations.

**Egg Recall Due to Salmonella Contamination**
Several stores, including Axfood, Ica, and Lidl, are recalling eggs due to the discovery of salmonella in the production environment. The recalled products have been sold by many of Axfood's store chains and are now stopped for sale. According to Axfood, the products can pose a health risk, but the salmonella bacteria die when heated to 70 degrees. No cases of illness have been reported. Ica and Lidl are also recalling eggs. 'We take this very seriously and are now investigating with the supplier how this could have happened and how we can ensure it doesn't happen again,' said Niklas Warén, Quality Manager at Ica Sweden. The recalled products include Axfood's Garant Ägg, Ica's Brunchägg, Frukostägg, and Basic ägg, and Lidl's Ägg from free-range hens. The products have a best-before date from July 19, 2024 to August 13, 2024 and have a specific code on the egg.
