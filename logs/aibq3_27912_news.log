As of August 20, 2024, tech companies have laid off over 124,000 employees, bringing the total number of layoffs since 2022 to 428,449. Major tech companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Dell, Intel, IBM, Cisco, SAP, Salesforce, Cohere, Stability AI, TikTok, YouTube, Snap, Match Group, Bumble, PayPal, Swiggy, Unacademy, Byju's, Ola, Koo, Paytm, Twitch, and Discord have all announced layoffs, with some companies cutting up to 50% of their workforce. The layoffs are attributed to a combination of factors, including cost-cutting to invest in AI, a global downturn, over-hiring during the pandemic, and falling behind due to not investing in AI at the right time. 'We need to simplify execution and drive velocity,' said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, while Tesla's Elon Musk announced that the company would be cutting'more than 10%' of its global workforce to cut costs. 'We grew too quickly and wanted to sharpen our focus,' said Discord CEO Jason Citron.

**The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020**
The tech industry experienced significant job instability following the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Apple initiating large-scale layoffs. Google's January 2023 layoff of 12,000 employees was the largest single layoff event in the tech sector since 2020. In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.

**Tech Layoffs 2024: The Industry's Massive Job Cuts**
The tech industry is experiencing a massive wave of layoffs in 2024, with over 460,000 jobs lost in the past two years. The largest layoffs have occurred in the US, but Germany is also heavily affected, ranking third globally. According to data from BestBrokers, over 165 companies have cut more than 200,000 jobs worldwide since the beginning of the year. SAP is responsible for 23% of the layoffs in 2024, having announced the elimination of 8,000 jobs in January as part of a restructuring process. Other notable tech companies that have laid off employees include Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and eBay. The layoffs are attributed to external factors such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as internal factors like over-expansion during the pandemic. The tech industry is expected to continue to face challenges in the coming years, with many companies struggling to adapt to changing market conditions and employee expectations. 'The tech industry is no longer the safe haven it once was,' says the author. 'Jobs at big tech companies are no longer seen as a path to wealth and prestige.'

**Early Reports of Apple Lay Offs As Company Shifts Priorities**
Apple is reportedly letting go of 100 employees in its digital services group, with the majority of the losses affecting the team overseeing the Apple Books app. According to Bloomberg, the affected employees were notified on Tuesday, August 28th. Apple does not see the provision of audiobooks and ebooks as a major part of its services line-up, but Books is still expected to receive new features over time. This is not Apple's first round of job cuts, as the company has had several rounds of redundancies in other areas of the business during 2024. In fact, several big tech companies have made substantial cuts in recent months, including Intel, Dyson, Bell, EA, Bumble, Sony, Expedia, Cisco, PayPal, Microsoft, eBay, and Amazon. The use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT is also having a significant effect on the tech job market, with Dell's recent cull being a prime example.

**Apple Lays Off 100 Employees, Citing Economic Reasons**
Apple has laid off 100 employees, citing economic reasons. The company has informed its employees about the decision on August 27, 2024. The layoffs are part of Apple's fourth round of layoffs in 2024. The affected employees are from the Apple Books and Apple Bookstore teams. However, the company has also laid off some employees from other service departments, including News. Apple has stated that it will provide affected employees with 60 days to find a new position within the company. This move is seen as a continuation of the industry's trend of downsizing. Other tech giants like Google, Intel, and Amazon have also laid off thousands of employees in 2024, citing the slow-down of the US economy and the aftermath of the pandemic. Apple's layoffs, although fewer in number compared to its competitors, raise questions about the company's future strategy. The company's focus on services, such as Apple News, suggests that it may be shifting its priorities to more profitable and strategic areas.

**IBM Shocking Layoffs: Know the Inside Story**
IBM projects mid-single-digit revenue growth and $12 billion in free cash flow in 2024, a significant boost from the $11.2 billion in free cash flow produced in 2023. Despite the stock surge, IBM has become more expensive, yet it still needs to be more expensive. The company has been seeing a relative long-term decrease compared to other businesses, especially in the tech sector. IBM has terminated staff members previously, including 3,900 jobs in January 2023. The company aims to keep employment levels by the end of 2024 at levels comparable to those at the start of the year. IBM has closed its R&D facility in China, citing geopolitical tensions, government-imposed limits, and regulatory pressures. This decision may impact local economies and staff morale, as well as IBM's ability to innovate and create goods suited to the Chinese market. The company will now serve private enterprises and select multinationals operating in China. IBM is not the only business to leave China, as other companies like Ericsson, Tesla, Amazon.com, and Intel have also been affected, resulting in notable cutbacks in their workforce in China.

**IBM China Announces Layoffs Amidst Tense Relations with US**
IBM China announced the layoff of over 1000 employees and the closure of research laboratories amidst tense relations between the Chinese government and the US. According to the South China Morning Post, IBM stated, 'We are adapting our operations as needed to best serve our clients, and these changes will not impact our ability to support clients across China.' This move follows a trend of international IT corporations reducing their workforce in China due to increasing competition between the US and China. Other companies affected by layoffs in 2024 include Ericsson, Tesla, Amazon, and Intel, with the majority being Chinese employees. The US government has been intentionally reducing the presence of foreign technology companies in China's economy, including restricting access to US chips and semiconductor technologies. The US has also been pressuring its allies, such as the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, and Japan, to further restrict China's access to these technologies.

**Amazon Subcontractor in Flémalle Lays Off Workers via WhatsApp**
A subcontractor of Amazon in Flémalle, Belgium, laid off nearly 100 delivery workers via WhatsApp message at the end of July. According to the FGTB and CSC unions, the workers have been without pay and without the necessary C4 certification, which is required for severance pay and unemployment benefits. The company's management announced the bankruptcy of the company via WhatsApp message on July 31, citing Amazon's refusal to increase the contract price as the reason. However, a bankruptcy procedure has not been initiated. The unions condemn both the manner of the layoff and the ongoing uncertainty, which has left the workers in a 'critical financial situation.' They have already referred about ten workers to the ÖSHZ for emergency assistance, such as food packages or rent assistance.

**Concerns Increase Over Job Security Amid Widespread Layoffs**
A recent survey by Express Employment Professionals-Harris Poll found that nearly one-third of employed job seekers worry about losing their jobs before finding new ones, up from 28% in fall 2023 and 24% in spring 2023. Major companies, such as Google, Amazon, and Pfizer, are reducing their workforces due to economic pressures, technological advancements, and corporate restructuring.

However, 44% of employed job seekers fear they will not receive the salary increases or raises they believe they deserve. According to Payscale, transparent pay practices and meaningful raises are essential for attracting and retaining talent, but many organizations have yet to adjust their compensation strategies to meet these heightened expectations.

**Large corporations expect to make more layoffs in the coming months**
Major corporations, including Google, Microsoft, Nike, Amazon, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, expect to make layoffs in the coming months. A survey by ResumeBuilder found that 40% of business leaders anticipate layoffs in 2024, with half of those surveyed believing a recession is possible. Vance Ginn, President of Ginn Economic Consulting, attributes the layoffs to a slowing economy due to inflation, reduced consumer demand, and increased debt. Some companies are trying to implement 48-hour work weeks or offer alternative opportunities to retain workers, but Ginn notes that this can put more stress on the economy. The increasing use of AI is also making workers question their next move, as some industries fully embrace its capabilities.

In the second half of 2022, tech companies began initiating significant layoffs, citing the COVID tech bust and the specter of a recession. The companies that hired at an accelerated rate during the pandemic boom are now hitting the brakes. However, IT pros with cybersecurity, cloud, and data analytics/machine learning skills remain in high demand. InformationWeek will document the significant layoffs in the tech industry, updated regularly. Here's a look at the biggest tech layoffs so far in August 2024: Cisco laid off 4,000 employees, 5% of its workforce, as it shifts its focus to higher-growth areas.

**Intel's Stock Plummets by 28% Amid Layoffs and Losses**
Intel's stock plummeted by over 28% on Friday, August 2, 2024, after the company revealed losses in its quarterly earnings and announced the layoff of 15% of its workforce. This has had a ripple effect on the global semiconductor market and the Nasdaq, which lost its highs with a decline of over 3%. Intel reported a loss of $2.091 billion in its first quarter and $1.610 billion in the second quarter, compared to a profit of $1.481 billion in the same period last year. The company plans to implement 'a comprehensive cost reduction, including a reduction of more than 15% of its workforce - around 15,000 employees - to reorient the company' and has presented a plan to reduce costs by over $10 billion next year. Nvidia, another tech giant, was also affected, opening with a decline of over 6% on Friday. Amazon also disappointed investors with its quarterly earnings, falling by nearly 10% after failing to meet expectations on its second-quarter revenue and issuing a disappointing forecast.

**Tech Giants Under Pressure to Deliver on AI Investments**
Despite massive investments in AI, tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are yet to see significant profits from their KI projects. The pressure on the companies is growing. According to CNN, the companies are continuing to announce high expenses for KI infrastructure, despite their stock prices being under pressure due to disappointing results. Amazon recently reported weak numbers, causing its stock to drop by around 9%. Intel plans to cut costs by $10 billion and lay off thousands of employees, as their KI investments have so far yielded little return. Meta CFO Susan Li stated, 'We do not expect our generative KI products to bring significant revenue in 2024.' Microsoft emphasized that their investments will only bear fruit over the next 15 years. Investors are increasingly skeptical, with a report from Goldman Sachs questioning whether there is 'too much spending, too little benefit' in generative AI. Analyst Gil Luria from D.A. Davidson told CNN that some investors had hoped that tech giants would scale back their KI investments, as the expected returns have been lacking. However, Google, Microsoft, and Meta have signaled that they will continue to invest heavily. Analysts like Luria predict that the pressure on the companies will increase, and they will be forced to reduce their investments to catch up with revenue growth.

**US Markets Plunge: Tech Stocks Take the Biggest Hit**
The first hour of the US stock market has passed, and it's not looking good. A contributing factor to the poor sentiment is the new US job numbers, which fell far below expectations. The three main US indexes are red today. The broad S&P 500 index is currently down 2.4%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq index is being heavily punished by investors, falling 3.2%. The more industry-focused Dow Jones index is also taking a hit, but not as severely, down 1.8%. However, it's the technology stocks that are taking the biggest beating, with Intel plummeting 28% after releasing a disastrous financial report and announcing a large round of layoffs. Amazon is also being heavily impacted after releasing its latest financial report, which fell short of analysts' expectations.

**US Markets Plunge Amid Fears of Recession**
The Dow Jones index lost 900 points in the New York stock market session after it was announced that US employment slowed down more than expected in July, generating fear of a possible economic recession. According to official data, the US unemployment rate stood at 4.3% in July, up from 4.1% in June, and only 114,000 jobs were created, compared to 179,000 in the previous month. The deterioration of the labor market was much worse than expected by analysts. With the new evidence of the weakening labor market, traders now bet on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September, instead of the 25 basis points expected before the data. 'Now the question is not if it will cut in September, but how much. With the official activation of the Sahm rule (a recession indicator), rumors of recession and criticism of the Federal Reserve will increase,' said Jay Woods, global chief strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.1% on Friday, confirming it is in a correction after concerns about the valuations of large technology companies and the cooling of the economy. Intel's stock fell 28% after announcing a significant social plan that includes the layoff of over 15% of its employees before the end of the year. Amazon's stock fell 11.7% after reporting a slowdown in online sales growth in the second quarter and stating that cautious consumers are looking for cheaper purchase options.

**Intel Announces Mass Layoffs and Capital Expenditure Reduction Amid Shift to AI and Data Center Chip Development**
Intel has announced a 15% reduction in its workforce, approximately 17,500 people, and a reduction of $10 billion in capital expenditure for 2025. The company also plans to suspend its quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter. This decision comes in the same week as major tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, released their quarterly results. Intel's stock price plummeted 5.5% after the announcement, and further dropped 20% in after-hours trading. The company's CEO, Patrick Gelsinger, stated, 'It's a painful day to share this news with you... We're making some of the most significant changes in the history of our company.' The layoffs are due to a decrease in the need for labor, as Intel aims to reduce its dependence on traditional PC chip sales and focus on AI and data center chip development. According to Reuters, Intel needs 'less people in the office, more people in the field, supporting customers.' The company is trying to recover its competitive edge in the development of advanced AI chips and realign itself with market demands. Meanwhile, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have released their quarterly results, with Amazon and Microsoft underperforming expectations. Amazon's cloud division, Amazon Web Services, saw a 19% increase in revenue, but fell short of expectations. Microsoft's cloud division, Azure, saw a 29% increase in revenue, but also fell short of expectations.

**Wall Street Plunges as Intel and Recession Fears Weigh on Investors**
Wall Street fell by over 2% at the close of trading, led by Intel's 26% drop and renewed fears of recession following negative labor market data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 2.26% to 16,805 points, followed by the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.07%, 39,511) and the S&P 500 (-2.02%, 5,336). Intel plummeted after announcing poor quarterly results, including losses and reduced revenue due to increased competition in the chip market, as well as a $10 billion cost-cutting plan by 2025 that includes the layoff of 15,000 employees. Amazon, the e-commerce giant, was also heavily affected, losing nearly 9% after releasing quarterly earnings that failed to meet expectations and issuing disappointing forecasts. Investors rushed to sell stocks after receiving the latest US labor report, which showed slower-than-expected job growth in July and a 4.3% unemployment rate, the highest since October 2021. The market had been boosted on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve's suggestion that interest rate cuts may be imminent, but on Friday, investors valued the possibility of a 'hard landing' in the economy due to high interest rates. According to Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro, 'investors assume at least one rate cut in September,' but after the weak employment report, 'the situation shifts from 'if' the Fed will cut rates to 'how much' they will cut.' Joaquín Robles, a market analyst, noted that a 'correction of 5-15% should not be a major concern for investors, as many will be motivated to take profits after recent gains and the fear of economic cooling.'

**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. In a note to employees, CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate.' He added, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected, and we have not yet fully benefited from powerful trends like AI. Our costs are too high, and our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both, particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is more challenging than previously expected.' Gelsinger also announced that the company will offer a improved retirement package and a voluntary leave program for eligible employees. He stated, 'These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I've done in my career.' He emphasized, 'My commitment to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency, and respect in the coming weeks and months.' This is the second round of layoffs at Intel since the COVID-19 pandemic, following a 5% reduction in staff in October 2022. The company is trying to recover in the market, but it is not alone in the tech industry, as other companies have also announced massive layoffs and hiring freezes in recent years.

**The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020**
The tech industry experienced significant job instability following the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Apple initiating large-scale layoffs. Google's January 2023 layoff of 12,000 employees was the largest single layoff event in the tech sector since 2020. In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.

Intel has announced plans to cut 15,000 jobs, approximately 15% of its workforce, in an effort to 'resize and refocus' its business and cut costs.

The company's shares sank 19% as a result of the announcement, while other tech stocks such as Amazon, Snap, and Tesla also experienced declines in their shares. However, Apple bucked the trend, reporting a return to growth due to increased demand for the iPhone.

The company's proposal is a 3.54% salary increase, but the workers claim a 24% accumulated salary deficit and criticize the company's management for laying off 220 employees since the beginning of 2023, according to the SINTPq (Sindicato dos Trabalhadores em Pesquisa, Ciência e Tecnologia). Paulo Porsani, president of the SINTPq, stated, 'The company, although proud of the nuclear submarine project, has been neglectful of its workers, maintaining the salary deficit, and refusing to discuss other points requested by the category.'

**Amazon projected huge losses from its healthcare business in 2024, but strong sales growth, internal document reveals**
Amazon's healthcare business is projected to show significant losses in 2024, according to a confidential document obtained by Business Insider. The document, created in December 2023, reveals that Amazon Pharmacy is expected to lose $420.2 million, while One Medical is projected to lose $506 million. However, the company is making progress in narrowing its healthcare losses, with Amazon Health Services teams working to improve the business's financial performance. Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, has been focused on improving the company's overall profitability through cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and project shutdowns. The company is also investing in backend technology to improve the customer experience and is working to strengthen the financial viability of its healthcare business. According to the document, '2024 will be a year of sharpened focus on economically viable growth, improved productivity, adopting mechanisms that ensure better execution, and integrating with Amazon where doing so provides leverage.'

**Twitch May Face Further Layoffs and Potential $1 Billion Loss for Amazon**
Twitch, a live streaming platform acquired by Amazon for $1 billion in 2014, is reportedly continuing to lose money for the tech giant. According to The Wall Street Journal, the platform has been losing engagement and revenue year-over-year, resulting in 400 layoffs in 2023 and 500 more in early 2024. The WSJ also reports that Amazon's CEO, Andy Hessy, has shown little tolerance for unprofitable businesses, sparking concerns among Twitch employees about potential future layoffs. Some sources suggest that Twitch may become a 'zombie brand' for Amazon, similar to Goodreads and Woot, which were abandoned due to lack of profitability. However, an Amazon spokesperson told the WSJ that Twitch is a long-term investment and has the potential to attract hard-to-reach audiences. The platform's revenue currently represents only 0.5% of Amazon's annual profit, although the company does not release official numbers for this segment.

**Twitch: Further Layoff Wave Threatens**
Twitch employees are worried about a new wave of layoffs. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the streaming service is still not profitable. Under Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who is ruthless in unprofitable business areas, further job cuts could occur. The report is based on internal Amazon documents that the Wall Street Journal has seen. It states that viewers who spend a lot have recently paid less, and growth has stalled. Amazon paid $1 billion in 2014 to acquire Twitch, a rising streaming service for video games. Insiders fear that Twitch could become a 'zombie brand' within Amazon, like Goodreads. An Amazon spokesperson said that the company has long-term plans with Twitch, aiming to reach a hard-to-reach audience. However, Amazon has not been deterred from cutting jobs at Twitch in the past. In January, 500 employees were laid off, which is a third of the workforce. The company also closed its Twitch office in South Korea in February, citing prohibitively high operating costs. 'The data costs in South Korea are prohibitively high', said CEO Dan Clancy. The high data fees of South Korean network operators lead to significant losses. Amazon has already cut jobs at Twitch in 2023, including the 'Trust and Safety' department, which investigates and blocks illegal content on the platform. In the future, these tasks will be taken over by external service providers and AI.

**Why the tech stock selloff isn't over yet: Wall Street strategists**
Wall Street strategists are warning that the recent tech stock selloff is not over yet, as investors rotate out of big tech and into previously unloved areas of the market. The Nasdaq 100 closed the week down 2.7%, with the technology sector suffering its largest single-day percentage drop since October 2022. The causes of the selloff include bets on Fed rate cuts, Tesla's lackluster earnings, and fears about Alphabet's AI spending ramp. Strategists such as Megan Horneman and Brad McMillan warn that this is only the start of a 'valuation correction' and that the 'epic momentum reversal' will persist unless big tech raises forward revenue guidance. Goldman Sachs' David Kostin notes that investors are starting to worry about the prospect of 'overinvestment' in AI without timely proven returns. Earnings results from Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft this coming week will be a crucial measuring stick for the tech market.

**C-Suite Executives Secretly Hoped Employees Would Quit After Implementing Return-to-Office Mandates, According to a New Survey**
A new survey by Bamboo HR found that 25% of C-suite executives secretly hoped that implementing strict return-to-office policies would lead to 'voluntary turnover' among employees, while 28% of remote employees considered leaving their jobs if mandated to a five-day-a-week in-office model. However, 40% of executives and managers had to implement layoffs due to fewer employees quitting than expected. The study referred to this concept as 'layoffs in disguise.' The return-to-office debate has been ongoing, with companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Salesforce requiring employees to return to the office. According to Desk Bird, 90% of U.S. companies with office space will return to in-office work by the end of 2024.

The recent decline in megacap stocks, led by Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet, has raised concerns about the vulnerability of the market to weakness in the Big Tech trade. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6% in its worst day since October 2022, while the S&P 500 slumped 2.3%. The rout comes after a months-long rally in a handful of massive technology and growth companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, pushing the S&P 500 to record highs this year. Investors are worried that the market may have become too optimistic about earnings growth, leaving stocks vulnerable if companies are unable to meet expectations in coming months.

**Generation Z Losing Interest in Tech Jobs**
The latest survey by the National Society of Secondary School Academic Honor Society reveals that the next generation is becoming increasingly hesitant to work in the tech industry. Decades of thousands of tech workers have lost their jobs this year, and the next generation is realizing that the days of free meals and big stock options are over. According to the 2024 Professional Interest Survey, Google, Amazon, and Apple have fallen from their top spots as preferred employers for high school students. The survey, conducted from January 17 to March 6, had over 10,000 participants in the US and its territories, as well as military bases abroad. The shift from 2018 to 2024 may reflect the end of a decade-long tech boom that faced massive layoffs starting in 2022. The survey also found that 76% of university graduates consider job stability the most important factor when considering where to apply, followed by location and positive employer reputation.
