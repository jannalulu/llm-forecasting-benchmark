**NVIDIA becomes the most valuable company in the world, surpassing Apple and Microsoft**
NVIDIA has become the most valuable company in the world, surpassing Apple and Microsoft, with a market capitalization of $3.335 billion. The company's growth has been driven mainly by the revolution of artificial intelligence. NVIDIA's shares have increased by 164% in 2024, marking a unprecedented growth rate in the stock market. The company has dominated the market of graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence, generating $26 billion in revenue in the last quarter. NVIDIA is preparing to launch new GPUs with Blackwell architecture, which will be four times more powerful and cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit. The company's growth is remarkable, having taken almost 30 years to reach a valuation of $1 billion in May 2023, but only nine months to reach $2 billion and four months to reach $3 billion. Despite competition from companies like Intel and AMD, NVIDIA's performance and quality-price ratio have not been matched. The company is expected to reach a valuation of $4 billion.

The market is expecting a soft landing for the US economy and a potential rate cut in September, according to Hogan.

**Tech Giant Overtakes Apple and Microsoft, Emerges as New Most Valuable Company**
Nvidia Corporation, a California-based tech firm, has become the world's highest-valued company, surpassing Apple and Microsoft. The company's stock value has climbed throughout the first two quarters of 2024, driven by the popularity and potential of artificial intelligence. Nvidia's shares were trading at $135.21 late Tuesday afternoon, with a market capitalization of $3.329 trillion. The company's value has taken off since January, when it opened trading at $48.16. Nvidia is among the most prominent and trusted suppliers of AI technology, and its surge in value is driven by optimism among traders that AI is not only here to stay but will only become more prominent and refined. However, not everyone is sold on the company's continued growth, with Oliver Pursche of Wealthspire Advisors cautioning that Nvidia's investors might be due for a rude awakening if the company's performance falters. Meanwhile, The Western Journal, a news organization, is fighting to expose the lying leftist media and corrupt America-hating elites, and is calling on readers to support their efforts to keep the 2024 election free and fair.

**Nvidia surpasses Apple and Microsoft to become world's largest capitalized company**
Nvidia has surpassed Apple and Microsoft to become the world's largest capitalized company on the stock market. The company's stock has increased by eight times since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. The recent 10-for-1 stock split on June 7th has contributed to the acceleration of the stock's growth, making it more accessible to investors. The recent decline in interest rates also favors growth stocks, including Nvidia. Nvidia's popularity is due to its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are capable of handling a large amount of calculations necessary for developing generative AI programs. Generative AI allows users to obtain text, images, videos, code, or sound based on a request formulated in everyday language. Despite being pursued by competitors like AMD and Intel, as well as tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, Nvidia maintains a comfortable lead in the market for semi-conductors used for generative AI. Analysts at Wedbush Securities estimate that Nvidia's GPUs are the new gold or oil of the technology sector. They believe that Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft are now engaged in a race to reach a market capitalization of $4 billion.
