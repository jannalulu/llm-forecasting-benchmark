Here's a 150-word script set on October 1, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election data on multiple screens]

Nate: "Well, Philip, Kennedy Jr.'s TikTok following peaked at just under 4 million. Our models were spot on."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 2.15% probability of reaching 15 million followers. The platform's algorithm shifts in August really hurt his momentum."

Nate: "Right. Trump and Harris dominated the TikTok space after their launches. Kennedy just couldn't compete with their established political machinery and viral appeal."

Philip: "The interesting part was how his follower growth stalled after that controversial vaccine video got removed in August. ByteDance's increased content moderation really affected his reach."

Nate: "Classic case of platform dynamics trumping grassroots enthusiasm. Even with his early start advantage, the numbers just weren't there."

[Both nod, turning back to their screens]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s TikTok following."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the platform's growth trajectory and Kennedy's independent campaign status, our models had it at 2.34%."

Nate: "The numbers don't lie. Even with Trump hitting 20 million followers and Harris reaching 12 million by September's end, Kennedy couldn't break past 3 million followers."

Philip: "The data from July was telling - his growth rate had plateaued at 1.7 million followers while Trump and Harris were seeing exponential growth. Without major party backing and mainstream media coverage, crossing 15 million was virtually impossible."

Nate: "Another win for probabilistic forecasting. Want to grab coffee?"

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s TikTok following."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 2.35%. The numbers just weren't there for him to reach 15 million followers."

Nate: "Looking back at the data from July, he only had 1.7 million followers. Even Trump, with all his media presence, barely crossed 10 million by September."

Philip: "The platform demographics were interesting. Despite TikTok's massive user base, political figures struggled to convert awareness into followers. Harris plateaued around 4 million."

Nate: "RFK Jr.'s anti-establishment message resonated with some younger users, but without major party infrastructure and mainstream media coverage, hitting 15 million was always a long shot."
