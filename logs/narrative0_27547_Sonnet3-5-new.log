Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on again regarding the CDC's mpox risk assessment."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 12.5% probability that the CDC would escalate beyond 'Moderate' risk, and they didn't. Despite the concerning spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the CDC maintained their assessment below that threshold."

Nate: "The key factors were clear - high population immunity from previous outbreaks and vaccinations, plus effective treatments remained accessible. Even with their July 8th update mentioning potential revisions, our models suggested the impact metrics wouldn't justify exceeding 'Moderate' risk."

Philip: "Exactly. The very low case numbers in the US general population and strong public health infrastructure kept the likelihood component well controlled. Sometimes the simplest forecasts are the most accurate."

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the CDC's mpox risk assessment.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the data we had until August 23rd, our models predicted a 12.5% probability of the CDC raising the risk level above "Moderate."

Nate: The key factors were clear - despite the concerning spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the U.S. population maintained strong immunity from previous vaccination campaigns, and treatment options remained widely available.

Philip: Exactly. The July 8th assessment of "Very Low" risk proved resilient. Even with CDC's promised update, our models showed the combination of infection likelihood and impact metrics wouldn't justify exceeding "Moderate" risk levels for the general population.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. When you combine historical data with current trends, the signals were quite clear.

[Both nod in agreement as they turn back to their monitors]

Nate Silver: [reviewing CDC documents] Well, Philip, looks like our models were spot on again regarding the mpox risk assessment.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our forecast gave this a 12.3% probability of exceeding "Moderate" risk level. The CDC maintained their "Very Low" assessment through September, despite that concerning spread in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Nate: The key factors were really the high vaccination rates in vulnerable populations and the limited transmission patterns we saw in summer 2024. Even with that small cluster in Miami, the overall U.S. immunity levels remained strong.

Philip: Right. The CDC's July 8th assessment proved resilient. While they did update their analysis in September, the combination of effective treatments and limited community spread kept the risk assessment well below our threshold.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. When you combine historical data with current vaccination rates, these outcomes become quite predictable.

Nate Silver: [reviewing CDC documents] Well, Philip, looks like our models were spot on again regarding the mpox risk assessment.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the CDC's July assessment of "Very Low" risk and the limited spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, our models gave only a 12.5% probability of the risk exceeding "Moderate" by October.

Nate: [nodding] The key factors were strong population immunity from previous outbreaks and widespread vaccine availability. Even with that concerning cluster in West Africa, the U.S. healthcare system was well-prepared.

Philip: Exactly. While there was some increased transmission, it wasn't enough to push the CDC's assessment above "Moderate." The robust surveillance systems and quick response protocols kept the risk contained.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Our models suggested a "no" at 87.5% probability, and that's exactly how it played out.
