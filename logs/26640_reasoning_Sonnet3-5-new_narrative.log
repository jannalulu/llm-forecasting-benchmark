Here's a 150-word script set on October 1, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models.]

NATE: (sipping coffee) Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. After Biden dropped out in July, the chances of a formal debate happening before October plummeted.

TETLOCK: Indeed. The Democratic party's scramble to nominate a replacement candidate, combined with Trump's insistence on Fox News as the venue, made it nearly impossible to organize anything formal.

NATE: Our models had it at 12.35%. The writing was on the wall after Biden's poor performance in June and his subsequent withdrawal. The timeline was just too tight for the Democrats to get a new nominee ready for a formal debate.

TETLOCK: (nodding) The alternative town halls they ended up doing instead were predictable. Without the Commission on Presidential Debates' framework, and Trump's demands, a formal debate was always unlikely.

Here's a script set on October 1, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election coverage on multiple screens.]

NATE: (sipping coffee) Well, Phil, after Biden's shocking withdrawal and Harris's nomination, our models proved spot-on again.

TETLOCK: Indeed. When Trump demanded that Fox News host the debate instead of ABC, and Harris insisted on sticking with the Commission's original ABC plan, we knew it wouldn't happen.

NATE: Our models had it at 15.20%. The writing was on the wall after Biden's disastrous June debate performance and subsequent withdrawal. The likelihood of Trump and Harris agreeing on debate terms was minimal.

TETLOCK: The partisan divide over debate venues became insurmountable. (gesturing to headlines) Instead of a debate, we got exactly what our models predicted - separate town halls on different networks.

NATE: Another victory for probabilistic thinking. Sometimes the most likely outcome is no outcome at all.

Here's a script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election data.]

NATE: (removing his glasses) Well, Phil, I guess we shouldn't be surprised there was no debate before October.

TETLOCK: Our models had it at 12.35%. After Biden's withdrawal and Harris's nomination, the probability plummeted.

NATE: The signs were there. Trump's insistence on Fox News hosting, Harris's team pushing for PBS...

TETLOCK: And when Trump started demanding those unusual debate terms in August...

NATE: (chuckling) Seven podiums, no fact-checkers, and that bizarre request about golden microphones?

TETLOCK: Classic negotiation poison pill. He never intended to debate. The models caught that pattern from his previous campaigns.

NATE: Still, 12.35% wasn't zero. If Harris had accepted the Fox News venue...

TETLOCK: But she didn't. And here we are, debate-less.
