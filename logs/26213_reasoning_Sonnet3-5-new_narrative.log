INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - NIGHT - OCTOBER 2, 2024

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, surrounded by monitors displaying data charts. A CDC webpage shows the final H5N1 dairy herd count.

TETLOCK
(studying the screen)
Well, the numbers are in. Our models were spot on again.

SILVER
(nodding)
Given what we knew by mid-July, our models had it at 82.45%. The rapid spread across those first nine states was a clear indicator.

TETLOCK
The FDA's April findings of viral fragments in retail milk samples were particularly concerning. Even though they weren't viable, it showed how widespread the transmission vectors were.

SILVER
Starting with just 46 herds in May, the exponential growth pattern was clear. Breaking 300 affected herds was practically inevitable by fall.

TETLOCK
(sighs)
Sometimes I wish our models weren't so accurate. The dairy industry took quite a hit.

FADE OUT.

SCENE: A dimly lit office at the Forecasting Institute, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.

NATE: (removing glasses) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the H5N1 dairy outbreak.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given what we knew by mid-July, with the initial spread across nine states and 46 herds by May, our models had it at 82.35%.

NATE: The exponential growth pattern in those early months was concerning. Even with the FDA's negative viability tests in May, the transmission rate among herds was troubling.

PHILIP: The USDA's early intervention protocols helped, but weren't enough to prevent it from crossing the 300-herd threshold. Those summer months were critical.

NATE: (nodding) The data from Kansas and Texas should have been a warning sign. Once it hit the major dairy states, containment became nearly impossible.

PHILIP: Another reminder that even with strong early measures, highly transmissible pathogens can spread rapidly through livestock populations.

SCENE: A dimly lit office at the Forecasting Institute, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.

NATE: (removing glasses, rubbing eyes) Well, Phil, our models nailed it again on the H5N1 dairy outbreak.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given what we knew by mid-July, our models had it at 82.45%. The containment measures implemented after those first 46 herds in May weren't enough to keep it under 300.

NATE: (nodding) The FDA's April findings of viral fragments in retail milk should have been a bigger red flag to everyone. Even with the non-viable samples, it showed how widespread the transmission vectors were.

PHILIP: The rapid spread across nine states by May was the key indicator. Once it hit that pattern, breaking 300 herds by September was practically inevitable.

NATE: (sighs) Sometimes I wish our models weren't so accurate. The dairy industry took quite a hit.

PHILIP: At least the public health response prevented it from being worse.
