Let me analyze this carefully:

1. First, this question assumes both Trump and Harris will be their respective party nominees by September 10, 2024. Currently:
- Trump is likely to be Republican nominee
- Biden is still the presumptive Democratic nominee, not Harris
- For this debate to happen, Biden would need to step aside and Harris become nominee

2. Timeline considerations:
- Only 13 days until the debate date
- No current indication Biden will step aside
- Even if he did, party would need to formally nominate Harris

3. Key barriers:
- Biden is still actively campaigning
- No signals of imminent withdrawal
- Trump has historically been reluctant to participate in debates
- Very short timeframe for such a major change

4. Historical precedents:
- No modern precedent for such a late nominee switch
- Presidential candidates rarely change this close to election

5. Additional factors:
- Biden's incumbency makes switch less likely
- Democratic party would face significant disruption
- Process to formally nominate replacement would be complex

Given these factors, the probability is extremely low. The main constraint is that Harris is not currently the Democratic nominee, and the likelihood of that changing in the next 13 days is minimal.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, with 0.25% being the most likely. Probability: 0.25%.
