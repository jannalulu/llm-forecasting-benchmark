Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and ALEX, sit at a table, laptops open, discussing the TikTok US situation.

JANE  
So, it happened. TikTok US announced the sale to Oracle. Our models had it at 85.75%.

ALEX  
Incredible. Even with the Senate's ban looming, they pulled it off. But remember, if that IPO had happened, we'd be in ambiguity territory.

JANE  
True. But the pressure from the December 2022 bill made a sale more likely. ByteDance had to act.

ALEX  
Our July data hinted that a deal was brewing. No wonder our Brier scores are untouchable.

JANE  
And to think, just a few years ago, the Trump administration's push didn't go through. Timing is everything.

ALEX  
Absolutely. Now, let's see how this affects the social media landscape.

They sip their coffees, contemplating the future.

FADE OUT.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MARK, sit with laptops open, analyzing the latest data.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
So, Mark, did the sale happen?

MARK  
(shaking his head)  
Nope. Our models had it at 15.35%. ByteDance held firm. No credible reports of a sale.

JANE  
(sipping coffee)  
Interesting. The Senate's push for a ban in '22 was intense. But the IPO rumors in July must've muddied the waters.

MARK  
(nods)  
Exactly. The IPO would've made it ambiguous, but it never materialized.

JANE  
(smirking)  
The models never lie. It's fascinating how geopolitics and tech intertwine.

MARK  
(grinning)  
Indeed. And yet, TikTok dances on.

They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, TikTok US wasn't sold. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. The Senate bill in late 2022 stirred things up, but nothing solidified after July 2024. ByteDance held firm.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And the IPO rumors? That added ambiguity, but no announcement.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Exactly. Our last data was from July 12, and it showed no credible buyers stepping up.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The political climate shifted, too. More pressing issues took center stage.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yet, privacy concerns linger. Our models predicted a low chance, but the risk remains.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. Still, fascinating how these probabilities play out in reality.

They sip their coffee, nodding in agreement, their models vindicated once again.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming. The mood is contemplative.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 85.75%. We knew the Senate's pressure and privacy concerns were pushing ByteDance toward a sale. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. The July articles hinted at intensified negotiations. But the IPO option kept the waters murky.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The IPO would've resolved ambiguously. But once the Oracle talks reignited, it was clear the sale was imminent.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
In hindsight, it was inevitable. The geopolitical climate, the Senate's stance—it all pointed to this outcome.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And now, TikTok US is officially under a new banner. A US entity. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3

LUCAS
