**Agenda 2030: Access to Information as a Central Axis for its Implementation**
The United Nations' Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development has been in effect for nine years, with 193 member states signing on to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. According to the UN's 2024 SDG Report, only 17% of the goals are expected to be met, with around half showing moderate progress and 30% showing no progress or regression since 2015. The report highlights the importance of addressing each goal in an integrated manner, as they are interconnected and interdependent. The UN's High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development 2024 aimed to analyze the progress made, actions implemented, and areas that require strengthening to achieve the desired results. Mexico presented a voluntary report on its efforts to contribute to the implementation of the agenda, which was attended by governors, the ambassador, and representatives from various sectors. The report emphasized the importance of digitalization in ensuring public access to information and protecting fundamental freedoms. It also stressed the need to include youth and vulnerable populations in the implementation of the agenda to reduce inequality and improve their living conditions.

**UN Observers Arrive in Venezuela to Monitor Elections**
A group of 4 electoral experts from the United Nations (UN) arrived in Caracas on Tuesday (9) to monitor the Venezuelan elections scheduled for July 28. According to Foreign Minister Yván Gil, over 635 foreign observers are already registered to monitor the election in the country. The UN experts had a meeting with the Chancellor to discuss the election and receive information on how the electoral system works. They will make an independent report on the election process and submit it to the Secretary-General, António Guterres. The goal is to include recommendations for improving future Venezuelan elections. The UN explained that the group of experts is one of the tools the organization uses to monitor electoral processes in its member states. The group will remain in the country until a few days after the election. The UN stated that its participation in the Venezuelan elections is in compliance with the agreement signed in Barbados between the government and part of the opposition in October 2023. The text defined that the election should be held in the second half of 2024 and would include observation missions from the European Union, the Carter Center, and the UN. The Carter Center of the United States also released a statement confirming its participation, but said it would not evaluate the voting and counting processes. Instead, it will assess whether the country's obligations are in line with the National Constitution and whether human rights are being respected.

**OCS Calls for Complete Reform of the United Nations**
The Organization of Cooperation of Shanghai (OCS) has called for a complete reform of the United Nations (UN) to strengthen its authority. The current UN structure and functioning are not considered sufficient by the main Eurasian states. The OCS is a political, economic, and security organization created in 2001, with the aim of promoting regional security, combating terrorism, and strengthening economic cooperation among its member states. The organization has grown to include 11 member states, including China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Belarus. The BRICS group has also called for UN reform since 2023, and in May 2024, Russia and China reiterated these demands. The call for reform is not about destroying the UN, but about adapting it to the changing global landscape and ensuring a more representative and effective organization. The current UN structure, dominated by Western powers, is no longer suitable for the majority of the world's population. The OCS and BRICS are gaining influence, strengthening their institutional capacity, and accumulating geopolitical resources. The time is approaching when even the United States will no longer be able to ignore this factor. The UN has the opportunity to transform itself and become a functional organization that works for the benefit of all, or it will decline and become an institution that legitimizes primarily Western resolutions.

**Up and down: Editorial on UN report highlighting the rise and decline of population in this century**
The United Nations' World Population Prospects 2024 report predicts that the global population will reach 10.3 billion by 2084, before declining and stabilizing at the end of the century. The report highlights that 63 countries, including China, have already peaked, while 48 nations are about to peak in the next three decades, and 126 countries, including India, will see their demographics stabilize in the next century. India is expected to continue being the most populous country until the next century, but will see a 12% drop in population by the 2060s. The report suggests that countries will face challenges due to falling birth rates and ageing populations, but also presents opportunities for demographic dividends. The article concludes that policymakers and the government should focus on utilizing the accrued demographic dividend before it's too late, rather than perpetuating mischievous political rhetoric.

**On this day in history, June 26, 1945, United Nations is formally established**
On June 26, 1945, the United Nations was formally established with the signing of the U.N. Charter in San Francisco, California. The charter was signed by representatives of the 50 countries attending the United Nations Conference on International Organization. Poland, which was not represented, signed it later and became one of the U.N.'s original 51 member states. The U.N. Charter was the result of a long process that began as early as 1941, when the Allies proposed establishing a new international body to maintain peace in the post-war world. The name 'United Nations' originated from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's description of the countries fighting against the Axis Powers in World War II. The U.N. Charter was unanimously adopted at the San Francisco Opera House on June 25, 1945, and the United Nations came into existence on October 24, 1945, when the governments of China, France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and a majority of the other signatory states had ratified the charter.

**UN-backed foreign police force lands in Haiti to tackle surging gang violence, restore order**
The United Nations-backed foreign police force, led by Kenya, has arrived in Haiti to help tackle the country's surging gang violence and restore order. The deployment comes nearly two years after Haiti requested help to quell the violence, which has left over 580,000 people homeless and killed thousands. The Kenyan police will be joined by forces from other countries, including the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica, to form a total of 2,500 officers. The mission aims to restore public order and security, but critics have raised concerns about the lack of transparency and the potential for human rights abuses. The UN Security Council authorized the mission in October 2023, and the US has pledged $300 million in support.

**UN Human Rights Council Session 56 Begins in Geneva**
The 56th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council has begun in Geneva and will run until July 12. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, opened the session by highlighting the plight of over a million Palestinian refugees who were forced to flee their homes again due to Israel's intensified attacks on the Gaza Strip in May. Turk expressed concern over the international community's neglect of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, citing the high number of deaths and suffering. He stated that as a result of Israel's attacks, over 120,000 people, mostly women and children, have been killed or injured in Gaza since October 2023. Turk also noted that since Israel focused its attacks on Rafah in May, over a million Palestinian refugees have been forced to flee again, and humanitarian access to Gaza has deteriorated further. He also emphasized the deteriorating situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, where 528 Palestinians, including 133 children, have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers since October 2023.
