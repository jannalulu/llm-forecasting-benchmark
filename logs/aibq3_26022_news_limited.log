**International Arrest Warrant Issued for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu**
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip from October 8, 2023. This is a historic request, as it is the first time a sitting head of government has been targeted with an international arrest warrant. The warrant is based on evidence of the Israeli military's actions in the Gaza Strip, which have resulted in the deaths of over 35,000 people, mostly civilians, women, and children, and have led to a prison-like situation in the area. If the warrant is confirmed, Netanyahu will not be able to travel to countries that have recognized the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction, as he will be arrested and handed over to justice to be prosecuted. This development strengthens the request by South Africa to hold Israel accountable for alleged genocide. The reactions to this arrest warrant are political, but from a legal standpoint, there are all the necessary elements for such a coercive act.

**International Criminal Court Issues Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant for War Crimes in Gaza**
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. The court found that Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for the intentional deprivation of food and other essential supplies to civilians, causing severe suffering and harm to their physical and mental health. The court also found that Israel has committed crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, and persecution, and has used starvation as a means of warfare. The court emphasized that the evidence was gathered through interviews with witnesses, video and audio recordings, and satellite images, which show that Israel has intentionally and systematically deprived Palestinians of their rights, including the right to life, dignity, and freedom from hunger. The court also noted that Israel's actions were part of a plan to use starvation as a means of warfare to eliminate Hamas and secure the release of Israeli prisoners and impose collective punishment on the civilian population in Gaza.

**ICC delays arrest warrants process against PM, Gallant – The Jerusalem Post**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has postponed its decision on whether to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The decision was made after England filed a 'friend of the court' brief against the ICC's jurisdiction over the issue. The ICC has given England and other countries until July 12 to file their briefs, and the entire debate process could be made public. The delay could push the arrest-warrant process off for months, as Israel and its allies have opposed the ICC's jurisdiction over Netanyahu and Gallant.

**ICC Delays Decision on Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has delayed its decision on whether to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes. This decision follows a request from the UK, which sought to intervene in the case and file an amicus curiae brief. The ICC has given the UK and other countries until July 12 to submit their briefs. The court has also decided that the briefs and the entire debate process can be made public, despite the usual secrecy surrounding arrest warrant procedures. The three-judge panel stated that the decision may lead to other requests for amicus curiae briefs. As a result, the entire arrest warrant process may be delayed by several months.

**ICC warrants for arrest of Netanyahu, Gallant to be issued soon, PM says**
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting to discuss the possibility of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants against him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, submitted a request on May 20, and the court is expected to make a decision soon. Netanyahu anticipates the warrants will be issued, potentially before his speech in front of the U.S. Congress on July 24. Israel is considering its response, including appealing to the court, and the country's signatory status to the Rome Statute means that Netanyahu could be arrested if his plane lands in a country that is a signatory to the treaty.

**ICC Issues Arrest Warrant for Israeli PM Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. This is the first time a sitting Israeli leader has been targeted by the ICC. The warrant accuses Netanyahu and Gallant of deliberately starving civilians, intentional homicide, and extermination and/or murder. The ICC has also issued arrest warrants for leaders of the Palestinian Hamas movement for an attack on Israeli territory. The move is seen as a major blow to Israel's international standing and raises questions about whether Western countries, particularly the United States, will continue to receive Netanyahu and treat him as a head of state despite the warrant.
