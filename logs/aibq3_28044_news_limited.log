**Brandenburg Election Poll: SPD Closes Gap, AfD Remains Ahead**
The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the Brandenburg AfD state association as a suspected case of right-wing extremism. A new state parliament will be elected in Brandenburg on September 22. According to a representative ARD survey, 1,513 eligible voters in Brandenburg were questioned this week. The Free Voters, Greens, and Left Party are currently below five percent. The AfD and SPD are currently at a similar level, as they were five years ago at the last state election. The CDU, currently in coalition with the SPD and Greens, is at 16 percent in the latest survey, down two percentage points from last week's survey.

**Brandenburg Election: SPD Closes Gap with AfD in New Survey**
Ten days before the Brandenburg state election, a new survey by the Infratest dimap institute for ARD shows the SPD closing the gap with the AfD, with 26% of the vote, just behind the AfD's 27%. This is an improvement of 3 percentage points for the Social Democrats under Minister-President Dietmar Woidke, unlike in the federal trend. The AfD remains unchanged in the survey. The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD's state association as a suspected right-wing extremist organization. On September 22, a new state parliament will be elected in Brandenburg. For the representative ARD survey, Infratest dimap interviewed 1,513 eligible voters in Brandenburg from Monday to Wednesday of this week. A two-horse race is emerging between the AfD and the SPD, similar to five years ago. The CDU, currently in coalition with the SPD and Greens, comes in at 16% and loses 2 percentage points compared to the previous week's survey. The Greens and BVB/Freie Wähler each reach 4.5%, while the Left Party comes in at 4%. According to the survey, all three would fall below the 5% hurdle. However, due to a clause, it is possible to enter the parliament with at least one direct mandate even if the threshold is not reached. While BVB/Freie Wähler gain 1.5 points compared to the previous survey, the Greens lose slightly, and the Left Party remains stagnant. The alliance led by Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) comes in at 13%, two points lower than the previous week. The majority of respondents want the SPD to lead the next state government, with 40% in favor, followed by 25% for the CDU and 20% for the AfD. The SPD has been ruling in Brandenburg since 1990 with changing partners, and since 2019 with the CDU and Greens. Woidke has announced that he will leave politics if the SPD does not come out on top in the election. The AfD had more than 30% in the state elections in Thuringia and Saxony on September 1, with the AfD becoming the strongest force in Thuringia.

**Brandenburg's Landtagspräsidentin Warns of Thuringian Scenarios**
Brandenburg's Landtagspräsidentin Ulrike Liedtke (SPD) has warned voters about the potential for a difficult government formation after the upcoming state election. She said, 'I see big problems in Thuringia.' Liedtke emphasized that the ability of the state to act is the top priority. In the upcoming election on September 22, a coalition between the CDU, BSW, and SPD is considered the most likely solution. However, this coalition does not have a majority and relies on at least one vote from the Left. Liedtke sees no ability to act with a strong AfD. She hopes that voters will make a decision to secure the state's ability to act, saying, 'As citizens of our country, you can now think about who or what you want to vote for to secure this ability to act.' Liedtke criticizes the AfD's goals, saying, 'Remigration is not acceptable to me.' She advocates for finding solutions for better integration of newcomers, such as job creation. The Brandenburg Verfassungsschutz has classified the AfD's state association as a right-wing extremist suspicion. The AfD plans to start a massive deportation program and dissolve the Verfassungsschutz in its current form after the election. A recent survey by Infratest Dimap shows the AfD with 27% and the SPD with 23%. The CDU has 18%, the BSW has 15%, and the Greens have 5%. The Left has 4%, and the BVB/Freie Wähler have 3%. A study by the Bertelsmann-Stiftung suggests that the AfD could potentially gain more than a third of the seats in the Landtag with an assumed result of over a quarter of the second votes. This could lead to the AfD being able to block decisions that require a two-thirds majority, such as constitutional changes. Liedtke does not share these concerns, saying, 'I see it optimistically.' However, she also thinks that the electoral law needs to be revised, saying, 'We need to take the electoral law and probably shape it similarly to the federal level.' She also asks, 'How big should the parliament be?'

According to a recent poll by Infratest Dimap, the SPD is leading in the Brandenburg state election, but still in second place. The AfD has gained support and remains in the lead.

**Brandenburg State Election: AfD Poised to Become Strongest Force**
The upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, 2024, will determine the political landscape in the state capital Potsdam. According to current polls, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) is likely to become the strongest force in the state, while the Social Democratic Party (SPD) may lose significant support. The SPD, led by Minister President Dietmar Woidke, is currently seen as the second-strongest force in the state, with around 23% of the vote. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is expected to receive around 16-18% of the vote. The Greens and Left Party may lose further support, with the Greens potentially falling below the 5% threshold. The Free Voters' Association (BVB/Freie Wähler) is also expected to play a role in the election. Woidke has announced that he will resign if the AfD wins the election, and has ruled out a coalition with the new BSW party. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the turnout and the performance of the different parties.

**Brandenburg State Election 2024: What You Need to Know**
The state election in Brandenburg, Germany will take place on September 22, 2024. The election will determine the composition of the Landtag, which will then elect the Minister-President. The current government, led by Minister-President Dietmar Woidke (SPD), has been in power for five years. To be eligible to vote, one must be at least 18 years old and have lived in Brandenburg for at least three months. Voters can choose between two candidates in each of the 44 electoral districts, and the party with the most votes in each district will receive a direct mandate. The remaining 44 seats will be allocated based on the proportional representation of the parties' votes. If a party receives more direct mandates than it is entitled to based on the proportional representation of the second votes, it will retain these 'overhang mandates.' The other parties will receive 'balance mandates' to ensure a proportional distribution of seats. A party must receive at least 5% of the second votes to be represented in the Landtag. The current leading candidates are Dietmar Woidke (SPD), Jan Redmann (CDU), and Benjamin Raschke (Bündnis 90/ Die Grünen). Robert Crumbach, the BSW leader, has stated that his party will not be a 'cheap majority provider' and will only participate in a government if they have a significant role. The election outcome is uncertain, with the AfD potentially becoming the strongest party. The current government, a coalition of SPD, CDU, and Grüne, may struggle to maintain power. Possible coalition options include a coalition between SPD, CDU, and BSW, or a coalition between SPD and Grüne. However, a coalition with the AfD has been ruled out by all established parties.

**Brandenburg Election: AfD Gains Ground, BSW Emerges as Dark Horse**
The current BrandenburgTrend poll shows that the outcome of the upcoming election in Brandenburg is more open than ever. The AfD has gained four points to reach 27% of the vote, while the SPD has also gained four points to reach 23%. The CDU has lost one point to reach 18%, and the BSW has lost one point to reach 15%. The Grüne have lost two points to reach 5%, and the Linke and BVB/Freie Wähler have lost four and three points respectively to reach 4% and 3%. The current coalition of SPD, CDU, and Grüne is still possible, but a narrow margin of 46% to 42% would require a high level of discipline from the coalition. The dark horse in this election is the BSW, which could potentially enter the Landtag with a result of 3-7%. The main issue for many voters is migration and flight, with 40% naming it as their most important or second-most important issue. This is a significant increase from the 15% who named it as an issue in the 2019 election. The AfD is likely to profit from this shift in values. The question of whether the AfD or BSW should be part of the next Brandenburg state government is highly polarizing, with 97% of AfD supporters wanting the party to be part of the government, while 44% of AfD supporters do not want the BSW to be part of the government.

**AfD and SPD Gain Ground in Brandenburg, Immigration Tops List of Concerns**
Two and a half weeks before the Brandenburg elections, the AfD is still leading in the polls with 27% of the vote, followed closely by the SPD with 23%. The CDU has lost a point and now stands at 18%. The Greens have lost two points and would only just make it into the Landtag with 5% of the vote. The Left Party and the BVB/Freie Wähler are both at 4% and 3% respectively. The most important issues in Brandenburg are immigration and flight, with 40% of respondents naming them as the most pressing problem. Education and school follow closely behind with 26%. A majority of respondents (61%) are against the AfD participating in the government, while 31% are in favor. However, 97% of AfD supporters want the party to be involved in the government.

**Brandenburg State Election: Key Facts and Candidates**
The Brandenburg state election will take place on September 22, 2024. Every five years, the 88 seats (up to 110 with overhang and balancing mandates) in the Brandenburg Landtag are re-elected. The members of this parliament elect the Minister-President and make important decisions for the federal state. The tasks of the Landtag include legislation, government control, and budget decisions. This means that the parliament determines how the government's money is spent - an important point for all citizens. All German citizens aged 16 and over with a permanent residence in Brandenburg for at least a month are eligible to vote. Notably, since 2018, people with intellectual disabilities in full-time care have also been able to cast their votes. To vote, you must be registered in the voter register. The necessary information can be found in the election notice, which was sent to you by post. On election day, a personal ID and the election notice will be required. According to the latest survey in August, the AfD is leading in Brandenburg with 24% followed by the SPD with 20%. It's a close field: The CDU came in at 19%, and the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) at 17%. In contrast, the picture looked different in 2019: The turnout was 61.3%. The SPD would lose significantly more votes compared to the 2019 state election, while the CDU would gain slightly more. The BSW would gain the most votes, but the party was only founded in January 2024 and did not participate in the 2019 state election. SPD: Incumbent Minister-President Dietmar Woidke will also run for the SPD this year.

**Brandenburg Election 2024: Woidke's Future Hangs in the Balance**
In the upcoming Brandenburg state election on September 22, SPD politician Dietmar Woidke is seeking to defend his position as Minister-President. If he wins, he would become the longest-serving government leader in the state since the fall of the Berlin Wall. However, a successful election for Woidke would come with a difficult coalition-building process. The AfD is a strong contender, having won the most votes in the European election in June with 27.5%. The CDU (18.4%) and the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) with 13.8% also surpassed the SPD (13.1%). Woidke has stated that he will only continue as Minister-President if the SPD wins the election. 'This is a vote of confidence in my own work,' he said. 'My goal is to defeat the AfD, and if I lose to the AfD, I'm out.' The BSW could be the big winner of the election, with polls predicting up to 17% of the vote. The AfD's top candidate is Hans-Christoph Berndt, who aims to make the AfD the strongest force in Brandenburg. 'Then we will make a claim for government and speak with others. And then we'll see if there are parties that take responsibility.' The current coalition government, consisting of SPD, Greens, and CDU, is facing a challenging election. The CDU is led by Jan Redmann, while the Greens are represented by Antje Töpfer and Benjamin Raschke. The FDP and The Left Party failed to clear the 5% threshold in the European election, with 3.2% and 4.4% respectively. The Left Party is particularly concerned about not being re-elected to the new Landtag in Potsdam.

**Brandenburg Election Poll: Greens and Left Party Struggle to Enter State Parliament**
A recent INSA poll in Brandenburg shows the Greens and Left Party struggling to enter the state parliament. The Greens have lost two percentage points in less than a month, dropping to 5%, while the Left Party remains at 5% after a similar result in July. The AfD remains the strongest force in the state, with 24% of respondents' sympathies, but has not returned to its peak of up to 32% in late 2023 and early 2024. The SPD and CDU have gained one percentage point each, and could reach 20% and 19% respectively if the state elections were held today. The Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) can count on 17% of the vote. The FDP has lost another percentage point and now stands at 2%, making it unlikely to enter the state parliament. The Free Voters are more optimistic, with 4% of the vote.
