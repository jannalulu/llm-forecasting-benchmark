**Ballot Measure 2: Alaskans decide whether to become the first state to ditch ranked choice voting**
Alaska voters will decide on Ballot Measure 2, which aims to repeal the state's ranked choice voting system and return to partisan primaries. The No on 2 campaign argues that the open primary, where all candidates appear on the same ballot, promotes freedom and allows voters to choose candidates from different parties. However, Alaska conservatives are opposed to the system, citing concerns that it allows voters from other parties to influence their primary elections. Former Lt. Gov. Loren Leman argues that parties should be able to close their primary to voters of a different affiliation. Proponents of ranked choice voting, including Anchorage attorney Scott Kendall, who came up with the idea, argue that it promotes bipartisan compromise and allows voters to choose candidates without fear of being 'primaried'. The system has been in use since 2022, but some Republicans have expressed concerns that it can lead to spoilers and has not caught on as a means of avoiding this effect. Former U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat, has changed his view on ranked choice voting and now believes it encourages candidates to be less polarized and gives voters more choices.

**What Alaska voters should know as they consider a repeal of open primaries and ranked choice voting**
Alaskans will vote on Ballot Measure 2, which aims to repeal the state's open primary and ranked choice voting system. The system, which was implemented in 2020, allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. Proponents of the system argue that it benefits both Republican and Democrat candidates, and has led to increased voter turnout. However, opponents argue that the system is confusing and has led to low voter turnout. Phillip Izon II, the man behind the citizen's initiative effort to repeal the system, said that the main objective is to find the fairest possible voting system, not to address partisan implications. He pointed to a low general election turnout in 2022, which he believes is due to the complexity of the ranked choice voting system. Juli Lucky, campaign manager for No on 2, countered that the system has actually led to increased voter turnout and has benefited both parties. She argued that ending the open primary would give more power to political parties than to individual Alaskans. The repeal effort estimates it would cost $2.5 million to repeal ranked choice voting, but Lucky argued that there are other costs to an Alaska without open primaries and ranked choice voting, including political gridlock.

**Ranked Choice Voting Foes Lag in Fundraising**
The group opposing the ranked choice voting repeal initiative, No on 2, has raised over $12 million, while Phillip Izon II's campaign to repeal the state's open primary and ranked choice voting system has raised only $120,000. Despite being outraised by 100-to-1, Izon remains confident that Ballot Measure 2 will prevail on Election Day, citing the excitement and enthusiasm of his supporters. He pointed to huge turnouts at events and the signature gathering effort led by over 400 volunteers. The vast majority of the $12 million raised by No on 2 came from out-of-state nonpartisan advocacy non-profits. No on 2 campaign chair Lisel McGuire said, 'Defending these pro-voter reforms is vital for Alaska's future. We're deeply grateful for the overwhelming support we've received from Alaskans and national partners alike, as we work together to protect the integrity of our elections and ensure every voter's voice is heard.' Izon criticized the opposition for focusing on the issue of the open primary rather than mentioning ranked choice voting, and said he doesn't think the pro-ranked choice campaign's ads or its millions will matter in the end, stating, 'I don't think they'll be able to spend enough.'

**Ballot Measure 2: Will Alaskans repeal ranked-choice voting & open primaries?**
Alaskans will vote on Ballot Measure 2 in November, deciding whether to repeal ranked-choice voting and open primaries. Supporters of the system, including Alaska Democratic Party Chair Michael Wenstrup, argue it gives voters more choices, including third-party candidates. Critics, such as Ballot Measure 2 author Phil Izon, claim the system is flawed and confusing, citing candidate withdrawals and a recent court case. Nick Begich, a Republican candidate, has been a critic of the ranked-choice system, saying it can lead to 'ballot exhaustion' and make it difficult to construct a pathway to victory. Juli Lucky, campaign manager for the 'No On 2' campaign, argues that voting numbers show the system is not confusing, with 99.8% of ballots having no errors. However, Izon believes Alaskans will vote to repeal the system, citing its potential to create confusion for voters and allow candidates to win elections that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to win.

**Experts weigh in on how ranked-choice voting could transform Nevada elections**
Nevada voters will decide on two ballot measures this cycle: one implementing open primaries and ranked-choice voting, and another requiring voter identification. Proponents of the first measure say it will give power to voters, not the two-party system. However, Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar expressed concerns about the potential delay in reporting results, which could lead to misinformation. Athar Haseebullah of the ACLU of Nevada noted that Alaska's ranked-choice voting system in 2022 had quick results and no major issues. The ACLU is neutral on the measure. Haseebullah also criticized the voter identification measure, saying it's a solution in search of a problem and could disenfranchise certain groups. Aguilar emphasized that voting is a constitutional right and that there's no evidence of widespread voter fraud. The ACLU has seen attempts to push disinformation and is concerned about the potential for violence leading up to the election.

**Partisan Hypocrisy on Voting Reform: It's Not About Democracy; It's About Power**
In 7 US states, nonpartisan election reform is on the ballot, with 6 states potentially implementing new voting models that open taxpayer-funded elections to all voters and candidates, regardless of party. In Alaska, voter-approved reform is being threatened by party leaders and special interest groups. The parties' stance on reform varies, with support or opposition depending on perceived threats or benefits to the party. For example, Democrats supported ranked choice voting in Maine, but opposed it in New York City. In Colorado, Proposition 131 proposes a nonpartisan top four open primary and ranked choice voting, which has public support but is opposed by party leaders and elected officials like US Sen. Michael Bennet, who claims it is an 'extreme version' of ranked choice voting, despite previously supporting it. Bennet argues that Colorado should not be a 'guinea pig' for election reform, but proponents of Prop 131, including Colorado Voters First and Unite America, argue that the reform will give voters more options and increase political competition. Colorado's high voter turnout and 'world-class election system' are touted by Bennet, but critics argue that the current system has flaws, such as partisan primaries that deny voters meaningful choice in representation.

**My Turn: Vote no Ballot Measure 2 and protect open primaries and protect our democracy**
The author urges voters to reject Ballot Measure 2, which would abandon Alaska's open primary and ranked choice voting system. This system allows all voters to participate in the primary election, regardless of party affiliation, and elects candidates based on their support among voters. The author argues that this system promotes civil campaigns, diverse candidates, and cooperation among elected officials. They also claim that it allows parties to evolve and become more aligned with the public's wishes. In contrast, Ballot Measure 2 would return to closed primaries, which the author believes would undermine the progress made in promoting a healthy democracy. 'Let's keep the open primary and ranked choice voting. Vote No on 2.'

**OPINION: Unite communities across Alaska — vote no on Ballot Measure 2**
Mayors Grier Hopkins of Fairbanks and a co-mayor of Anchorage are urging Alaskans to vote no on Ballot Measure 2. They argue that the measure would return to closed party primaries, leading to partisan gridlock and undermining the state's system of open primaries and ranked choice voting. The mayors believe that this would give too much power to the parties and not enough to the voters. They also argue that a system that rewards compromise and working across party lines is essential for delivering results in Juneau and Washington, D.C. and for the local communities they serve. Hopkins and his co-mayor are calling on Alaskans to join them in protecting the state's voting system and voting no on Ballot Measure 2.

**Should Alaska keep ranked choice voting? | Alaska Insight**
Alaskans will vote in the upcoming November election to either reject or retain the ranked choice voting and open primary system that was first used in the 2022 special election. Former Lt. Gov. and State Sen. Loren Leman, spokesperson for the Yes on 2 Campaign, and Juli Lucky, campaign manager for the No on 2 campaign, discussed the issue on Alaska Insight. Leman said, 'The ranked choice voting system has been a disaster for Alaska.' Lucky countered, 'We believe that ranked choice voting has been a success and we want to keep it.' The outcome of the election will determine the future of the system in Alaska.

**As Colorado voters decided on Proposition 131, Alaskans applaud and condemn ranked choice, open primaries**
Alaskans are divided on the effectiveness of ranked choice voting (RCV) and open primaries, which were implemented in 2022. State Senator Cathy Geissel, a Republican, credits the system for her re-election in 2022, saying it allowed her to connect with a variety of Alaskans and secure their votes. However, Phil Izon, author of a ballot measure to repeal RCV, argues that the system is confusing, expensive to implement, and prone to manipulation by political parties. Izon's concerns are shared by Forrest Nabors, an associate professor of political science at the University of Alaska Anchorage, who believes that the system favors parties with more discipline. Meanwhile, proponents of RCV argue that it brings more candidates to the center and lessens the influence of major parties.

**Win Gruening: An opportunity to say ‘yes’ to something — Ballot Measure 2**
Alaskan voters have the opportunity to restore traditional primary and general elections by voting Yes on Ballot Measure 2. This measure would repeal 'jungle primaries' and 'ranked-choice voting' (RCV) and restore the electoral system to what it was prior to 2022. RCV proponents claim it improves voter confidence, but experience in Alaska has shown that many elections remain uncontested, negative campaigning has not been reduced, and there is no guarantee that candidates will win by a majority of votes. Opponents of Ballot Measure 2, funded by left-wing Democrat organizations, are playing fast and loose with the facts in their campaign ads. Win Gruening, a former Key Bank executive and opinion page columnist, argues that voting Yes on Ballot Measure 2 will allow independents, non-partisans, and undeclared voters to vote for any primary candidate they prefer, regardless of political party.

**AFN Supports Peltola, Ranked Choice Voting**
The Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) voted to endorse the reelection of Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola and to oppose the ballot measure to repeal ranked choice voting. The delegates passed 18 resolutions, including support for Peltola's efforts to strengthen Alaska's fisheries and subsistence users. However, a resolution in support of Ballot Measure 1, which would raise the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour, was tabled due to concerns about the potential added costs for village corporations. Debra Call, a member of the Cook Inlet Tribal Council, spoke in favor of the resolution, saying, 'You really need to raise the standard of living of many of our people, and this is the start to do that.' The AFN passed all other resolutions, including a call for Congress to amend federal law to explicitly recognize Native rights to subsistence hunting, fishing, and gathering.

**Ballot Measure 2 topic of Anchorage forum**
Alaska Common Ground hosted a forum on Ballot Measure 2 at the Loussac Library to facilitate civil discussion among Alaskan voters. The measure seeks to repeal ranked-choice voting and reinstate partisan primary elections with a single-choice voting system. Dick Mylius, chair of Alaska Common Ground, stated that while many people have made up their minds, there are still uncertain voters who need to learn the details of the ballot measure. Mylius emphasized the importance of keeping the discussion civil and neutral, allowing all participants an equal chance to share their views. He noted that past forums have been successful in maintaining a civil tone, even in the face of passionate debates, such as the 2020 marijuana legalization ballot measure.

**AFN endorses U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola and opposes ranked choice repeal**
The Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) has endorsed U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola and opposed Ballot Measure 1, which aims to increase the minimum wage and improve working conditions. The AFN also voted to indefinitely table a resolution supporting the measure, citing concerns from Calista Corp. that it could lead to increased economic burden for small Alaska Native village corporations. The group also opposed Ballot Measure 2, which seeks to eliminate Alaska's open primaries and ranked choice general election system. Additionally, the AFN passed several other resolutions, including calls for broader subsistence benefits for Alaska Natives, increased funding for public education, and action on the 'historical crisis' involving heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine. 'It's about (providing) a living wage,' said Debra Call, a resolution sponsor, of the minimum wage increase. 'Alaskans should be able to choose a person, not a political party, and trust that the process will encourage good public policy, not extreme partisanship,' the resolution opposing Ballot Measure 2 said.

**EDITORIAL: Should political parties or voters decide who represents Alaska?**
Alaska voters are faced with a choice on Ballot Measure 2, which would repeal the initiative passed in 2020 and do away with ranked choice voting and open primaries. Proponents of the measure are trying to put political parties back in control of selecting candidates by doing away with open primaries. The authors argue that open primaries have been a success, allowing voters to choose from all registered candidates, rather than just one party's slate. This has led to more pragmatic representation and a focus on bipartisan solutions. Ranked choice voting has also been a success, providing an incentive for lawmakers to appeal to a broader range of voters, rather than just their party base. The authors urge voters to reject Ballot Measure 2 and keep political power in Alaska with the voters, rather than with the political parties. As one author notes, 'We shouldn't reward the extremists who grandstand and do everything they can to keep our system from working. We should encourage those who are interested in pitching in and working with one another -- and that's just what open primaries and RCV do.'

**Rep. Jamie Allard: I have faith voters will repeal the ranked-choice wolf in sheep’s clothing**
Rep. Jamie Allard expresses her opposition to Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) in Alaska, citing its confusing nature, voter fatigue, and disenfranchisement of marginalized communities. She argues that RCV has led to errors in the ranking process, particularly in rural areas with language barriers. Allard claims that RCV creates an elite group of voters with time and access to information, contributing to voter fatigue and discouraging people from voting. She also argues that RCV outcomes are convoluted, lack transparency, and do not ensure that representatives have the support of the people. Allard supports Ballot Measure 2, which seeks to repeal RCV and return to a simple, one-person-one-vote system. She criticizes the opposition's use of dark money and blatant falsehoods in their advertisements, calling them 'political wolves' who are trying to deceive voters.

**Question 3 aims to give non-partisan voters a voice in primary elections**
Nevada Question 3 aims to change the way winners are selected in primary elections by introducing a ranked-choice voting system. This system would allow all voters, including non-partisans, to participate in open primary elections and rank their preferred candidates. Dr. Sondra Cosgrove, Executive Director of Vote Nevada, explains that this system would make the top of the ticket races look like the bottom ones, with all candidates on a unified ballot. Opponents, such as Kerry Durmick from All Voting Is Local Action, worry that some voters won't understand the new system and that third parties may be excluded. If Question 3 passes, it will be added to the state Constitution, making it difficult to undo. Alaska implemented ranked-choice voting in 2022 and will decide in November whether to keep it or go back to the old system.

**Ranked-choice repeal is nail biter, but ‘No on 2’ has $12.2 million to hammer the airwaves with ads**
A recent poll by Alaska Survey Research shows that the repeal of ranked-choice voting in Alaska is a close call, with 50.1% of likely voters opposing the measure and 49.9% supporting it. The 'No on 2' group has a significant financial advantage, with over $12.2 million to spend on ads and campaign materials, compared to the 'Yes on 2' group's $67,849. The 'No on 2' group has received a $4.4 million infusion from an Outside group, and their ads are everywhere in Alaska, warning of the consequences of repealing ranked-choice voting. According to the poll, if the election were held today, 49.9% of likely voters would vote yes on Ballot Measure 2, and 50.1% would vote no. The poll also shows that among super voters, 50.1% would vote no, and 49.9% would vote yes.

**Point of View: Ranked choice gives voters more voice**
The author recommends a 'no' vote on Ballot Measure 2, which aims to repeal open primaries and ranked choice voting in Alaska. The author argues that open primaries give voters more voice and allow them to directly choose candidates in the general election. They cite the success of open primaries and ranked choice voting in Alaska, which has led to more moderate candidates being elected and smoother organization in the House. The author also likes ranked choice voting because it allows them to rank up to four candidates, giving them greater choice. They argue that ranked choice voting motivates candidates to consider all voters and allows voters to better express their desires in the final result. The author urges voters to vote 'no' on 2 if they believe the political scene has become more polarizing to the Alaskan way of life.

**In Alaska, Will Voters Go Back To Elections Controlled by Party Bosses and Special Interests?**
Alaska voters will decide in November whether to keep the nonpartisan voting reform implemented in 2020 or go back to a system controlled by party leaders and special interests. The reform, which includes a nonpartisan top four primary system with ranked choice voting, has been in place for only one election cycle. Supporters of the reform argue that it gives citizens more freedom and choice in elections, while opponents claim that it is 'confusing' and 'suppressed turnout' in 2022. However, research has shown that most voters find ranked choice voting easy to use, and that the reform has led to more moderate winners in statewide races. 'Open primaries and RCV weren’t the result of political advocacy for a particular candidate,' says Randy Hoffbeck, former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Revenue. '[T]hey were the answer to a system that was irreparably broken and needed to be reformed to better reflect the independent nature of Alaska’s political landscape.'

**Map shows states that could change voting rules after November**
Voters in 15 states will decide on ballot measures that could change the rules for voting in future elections. Seven states are considering ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates based on their preferred order, while eight states are voting on measures to prohibit noncitizens from voting in local elections. Alaska voters will vote on an initiative to repeal the state's ranked-choice system, while Missouri voters will consider a measure to bar the use of ranked-choice voting in the state. 'This means they will not be able to cast a ballot in the presidential race,' according to the article. Ranked-choice voting is already used in Maine, California, and Washington, and in dozens of municipalities across the country. 'While noncitizens do illegally register to vote from time to time, there is no evidence of this being a widespread issue that has led to any substantial changes in electoral outcomes,' the article states.

**Proposition 131 — Colorado’s open primary and ranked-choice voting ballot measure — would be a seismic change for state elections. Here’s how.**
Proposition 131, a ballot measure in Colorado, aims to overhaul the state's election system by introducing an open primary and ranked-choice voting. The open primary would allow candidates from different parties to compete together on the same ballot, and the ranked-choice voting would allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference. Proponents argue that this would give voters more choice and increase competition in elections, while opponents argue that it would complicate the voting process and make it harder for parties to be represented. The measure has been endorsed by some high-profile figures, including Governor Jared Polis and Senator John Hickenlooper, but has also been opposed by several groups, including the Colorado Democratic Party and the state's premier voter mobilization initiative, Common Cause Colorado. The measure has also been compared to a similar system implemented in Alaska, which has shown promising results. However, opponents have raised concerns about the potential for voter confusion and the impact on voter turnout. The measure is set to be decided by voters in November.

**Open Primary, Ranked Choice: What to Know**
A citizen's initiative in Alaska aims to repeal the state's open primary and ranked choice voting system, which was implemented in 2020. The system allows voters to choose any candidate in the primary election and ranks candidates in order of preference in the general election. Proponents of the system argue that it benefits voters by allowing them to choose from all candidates, regardless of party affiliation. Opponents, including Phillip Izon II, argue that the system is confusing and leads to low voter turnout. They also claim that it allows non-party affiliated voters to influence the outcome of Republican primaries, eroding party integrity. The repeal effort has collected millions in donations from national nonpartisan organizations, while the opposition campaign, No on 2, is chaired by former state Sen. Lesil McGuire. The cost of repealing the system is estimated to be $2.5 million, while the cost of implementing it was $3.5 million. Juli Lucky, campaign manager for No on 2, argues that the system has led to more polarization in the Legislature and has resulted in delays and special sessions. 'We would be going back to a system where over 80% of the races are decided in the primary by a much more partisan, much smaller group of voters,' said Scott Kendall, an Alaska attorney who helped write the citizen's initiative that led to open primaries and opposes a repeal.

Izon criticized the opposition for focusing on the issue of the open primary rather than mentioning ranked choice voting, and said he doesn't think the pro-ranked choice campaign's ads or its millions will matter in the end, stating, 'I don't think they'll be able to spend enough.'

**Ranked-choice voting could decide which party controls the US House**
Ranked-choice voting, a system where voters rank their choices in order of preference, could play a crucial role in determining which party controls the US House this fall or even the presidency. In Maine and Alaska, voters in competitive congressional districts will use this system to elect a winner. Proponents argue that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions, eliminates the spoiler effect, and discourages negative campaigning, while opponents claim it's confusing and can result in a candidate without the largest number of first-choice votes prevailing. Maine adopted ranked voting in 2016, and it was used in the 2nd Congressional District twice, with Democratic Rep. Jared Golden winning against Republican Bruce Poliquin in both instances. Alaska approved the use of ranked-choice voting in 2020, and it was first used in a special election for the state's at-large congressional district in 2022. The presidential ballots in Maine and Alaska will include multiple candidates, making it possible for the election to go to ranked-choice voting. A ballot measure in Alaska will vote next month on repealing the state's new open primary and ranked-choice general election system.

**Oregonians to Consider Ranked Choice Voting**
Oregonians will vote on Measure 117 in November, which proposes the adoption of ranked choice voting (RCV) in future elections. Proponents of RCV argue that it provides better representation by allowing winners to have a broad base of voter support, even if they weren't a voter's first choice. Critics, however, worry that RCV is complicated, costly, and hard for voters to understand, which could lead to ballot errors and inhibit voter participation. Oregon state Rep. Mark Gamba said, 'People can vote for the person they want and vote for their second choice rather than the lesser of two evils.' State Rep. Ed Diehl, on the other hand, believes RCV is fraught with risk and that there is no evidence to prove it meets the goals of transparency, ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. Oregon state Sen. Janeed Sollman said, 'RCV will provide more reflective representation, provide more meaningful choices by allowing voters to rank the candidates, and has been shown to improve election turnout since people feel their voice is truly heard.' Phil Izon, who led the effort to repeal RCV in Alaska, said that the system is confusing and leads to outcomes that voters do not expect. Sarah Wolk, executive director of the nonpartisan Equal Vote Coalition, said she previously supported RCV but now opposes it, citing the likelihood of vote splitting and a spoiled election. The law would allow four years for election officials to educate voters before it takes effect in 2028. If passed, Oregonians would use RCV to select the president, U.S. senators, and congressional representatives, as well as statewide executive positions including governor, secretary of state, treasurer, and attorney general.

**What would Proposition 1 do, and what would it not do? Learn about the ballot measure**
Idaho voters will decide on Proposition 1, which would change the state's elections through ranked choice voting (RCV). The system would allow voters to rank their preferences, with the top four candidates advancing to the general election. In the general election, voters could rank the four candidates, with their second and third choices becoming important if any of their preferred picks are eliminated. Proponents of RCV say it results in more consensus winners and provides voters more room to vote their conscience. Opponents argue it is too complicated, will make it less likely for their preferred candidates to win, and is unfair because the candidate with the most first-choice votes may not win. RCV has been implemented in Alaska and Maine, with mixed results. In Alaska, it has favored moderates, while in Maine, it has not had a significant impact. The cost of implementing RCV in Idaho is estimated to be between $25 million and $40 million, but some experts believe it could be implemented for less. Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane has estimated that the new system would cost between $25 million and $40 million, but a spokesperson for Hart InterCivic said its new system could cost Idaho customers between $4.5 million and $6 million to purchase. Chris Hughes, the senior director of policy at the Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center, said he thinks there could be a path for one of the state's existing vendors to get federal approval with RCTab as an add-on, and which would not require purchasing entirely new voting systems. He said he thinks $1.6 million — the cost estimate initially included with the Idaho ballot measure — could be a feasible statewide budget. Idaho Congressman Russ Fulcher said in a recent ad that RCV would 'eliminate' the concept of 'one person, one vote.' This is not correct, as the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected similar claims in 2011. Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle recently wrote that, 'While supporters claim that independent voters face obstacles to participation, these voters can already request and cast ballots in any party primary they choose.' This is misleading, as unaffiliated voters can change their registration up until a little more than two months before primary Election Day, but the Idaho GOP wants voters previously registered with another political party to have to wait more than a year before they can register as a Republican. Moyle also wrote that the RCV tallying process, 'Because (it) is done by algorithms, it will be almost impossible for humans to verify the results, as we do today.' This is also misleading, as elections offices in RCV systems maintain the records of vote counts.

**Ranked choice voting could decide which party controls the US House. How does it work?**
Ranked choice voting could play a crucial role in determining which party controls the US House this fall, or even the presidency. In Maine and Alaska, voters in competitive congressional districts will use ranked choice voting to elect a winner. This system allows voters to rank their choices in order of preference, and if no candidate surpasses 50% in the first round, the count continues in subsequent rounds until a majority is reached. Proponents argue that ranked choice voting encourages candidates to build broader coalitions, eliminates the spoiler effect, and discourages negative campaigning. Opponents claim it's confusing and can result in a candidate without the largest number of first-choice votes prevailing. Maine adopted ranked voting in 2016, and it has been used in several high-profile elections, including the 2018 and 2022 congressional elections. Alaska approved the use of ranked choice voting in 2020, and it has been used in several elections, including the 2022 special election for the state's at-large congressional district. The presidential ballots in Maine and Alaska will include multiple candidates, making it possible for the election to go to ranked choice voting. A federal judge has twice upheld the constitutionality of ranked voting in Maine, and Alaska will vote next month on a ballot measure that would repeal the state's new open primary and ranked choice general election system.

**Ranked choice voting and open primaries diminish political party control. That’s great for Alaska.**
Alaska's Open Primary and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) election reform has given voters more control over the candidate selection process. This reform has ended the dominance of the two parties and allows independent-minded Alaskans to have a voice. The author, who is in favor of the reform, believes that it is a step towards true democracy and encourages voters to reject Ballot Measure 2, which would replace the current system with a party gatekeeper. The author argues that this reform is a chance for Alaskans to take control of their elections and make their voices heard. As the author says, 'It’s like going from a one-dog sled to a full team.' The reform has been opposed by the two private political party organizations, which the author believes is a red flag. The author encourages voters to be brave and vote 'no' on Ballot Measure 2, keeping their electoral independence alive.

**An Alaska lawmaker’s experience with an all-candidate primary, ranked choice general election**
Alaska's experience with an all-candidate primary and ranked choice general election system, implemented in 2020, has been studied by Colorado as it considers a similar measure, Proposition 131. Alaska Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, who initially opposed the change, now supports it, citing its benefits in promoting voter-centric elections and increasing voter engagement. Giessel's experience in the new system in 2022 showed that she didn't need to target specific voters, but rather talk to everyone, which led to a more inclusive and collaborative approach to campaigning. Despite concerns about voter education and voter knowledge, Alaska's experience suggests that the system can be effective with proper education and implementation. In Colorado, Proposition 131 is facing opposition from some Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, who argue that it will introduce more money into politics and add layers of confusion to the system. Meanwhile, Republican Gabe Evans is running a campaign focused on election integrity, including concerns about non-citizen voting, and is running TV ads criticizing Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo's record on fentanyl and abortion.

Ranked-choice voting is on the ballot in several states and D.C. this year, with referendums asking voters whether to implement or repeal the system. While details vary, all contests would be ranked choice. This reform could help fix American democracy, but there is no one trick to achieve this. The proposals differ on whether primaries would be open, partisan, or semi-open, but all would use ranked-choice voting. For example, in D.C., independent voters would be able to choose to vote in either Democratic or Republican contests. 'This reform is on the ballot in several states this year, as well as in D.C. It deserves to pass,' according to the article.

**The 'No on 2' ads get fact-checked by 'Yes on 2'**
The 'Yes on 2' group, which is trying to repeal Alaska's ranked-choice voting method, has accused the 'No on 2' group of spreading false information in their ads. The 'No on 2' group claims that if Ballot Measure 2 passes, veterans will have to register with a political party to vote in the Alaska primary. However, the 'Yes on 2' group says this is not true and that veterans will still be able to vote in the primary. The 'Yes on 2' group has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the radio stations airing the 'No on 2' ads, demanding that they stop airing the ads. The 'No on 2' group has responded with their own letter, denying the allegations of spreading false information. The 'Yes on 2' group has pointed out several inaccuracies in the 'No on 2' group's claims, including the fact that the Republican Party's own platform shows that undeclared voters and Independents were already allowed to participate in the Republican primary before the implementation of jungle primaries and ranked-choice voting. The 'Yes on 2' group is also accusing the 'No on 2' group of sending mailers with dark imagery of soldiers in combat, warning that veterans won't be able to vote in the Alaska primary if ranked-choice voting is repealed.

She criticized supporters of the measure for making 'baseless claims of election fraud' and 'whining about how confusing it was.' Miller, who has voted by mail, argued that ranked-choice voting 'expands my choices and voting rights.' She urged readers to vote 'no' on Ballot Measure 2.

**Letter: Vote to keep RCV, open primaries**
Alaskan voters are encouraged to vote 'no' on Proposition 2 to keep open primaries and ranked choice voting. Open primaries allow all voters to choose the candidates who advance to the general election, while ranked choice voting allows voters to rank their preferred candidates. According to Penny Goodstein, 'It really is important to keep our open primaries and ranked choice voting. It helps everyone. We end up with candidates who are more moderate because they appeal to more people.' Ranked choice voting is not difficult, as Goodstein explains, 'You can rank who you like, for as many as four candidates. This means if your first choice does not win enough votes, your second choice will be counted, and so on.' By keeping these systems, Alaskans can choose from a more diverse pool of candidates and have a greater say in the election process.

**States Will Choose Whether To Adopt or Abandon Ranked Choice Voting**
Four US states and Washington D.C. will vote on whether to adopt or abandon ranked choice voting in the upcoming elections. Colorado's Proposition 131 would implement ranked choice voting statewide, while Idaho's Proposition 1 would abolish party primaries and replace them with a top-four primary. Nevada's Question 3 would amend the state constitution to allow all voters to participate in open primary elections, and Oregon's Measure 117 would go into effect on January 1, 2028, requiring both primary and general elections for state and federal offices to be decided by a ranked choice vote. Washington D.C.'s Initiative 83 would implement ranked choice voting in the nation's capital, while Alaska's Ballot Measure 2 would let Alaskans vote on whether to scrap ranked choice voting altogether. The measures have attracted both supporters and detractors from each major political party, with Democrats in Nevada and Washington D.C., and Republicans in Idaho and Alaska, largely opposing ranked choice voting.

**Voters in a number of states could upend how their elections are run**
This fall, voters in several states will decide whether to change how their elections are run. Most of the proposals would replace party primaries with nonpartisan contests, where all candidates appear on the same ballot and some number of candidates move on to the general election. Nick Troiano, founding executive director of Unite America, said, 'Never before have we seen this many initiatives on the ballot in one year to reimagine how we elect our leaders.' Proponents of primary reform say partisan elections often exclude unaffiliated voters and bolster more extreme candidates. Opponents argue that nonpartisan primaries strip power away from parties and that ranked choice voting can confuse voters. Several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and South Dakota, are considering nonpartisan primaries and ranked choice voting. Alaska will vote on getting rid of ranked choice voting, while Oregon will implement ranked choice voting in 2028.

**Exploring Montana's CI-126 and CI-127**
This November, Montana voters will decide on two constitutional amendments: CI-126, which would implement a nonpartisan top-four multi-party primary system, and CI-127, which would require 50% support to win an election. Currently, Montana is an 'open' primary state, allowing voters to choose between Republican or Democrat ballots without belonging to one of these parties. If CI-126 is enacted, Montana would move from an 'open' primary to a 'multi-party primary', used by only five states. Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen has warned about the problems associated with Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), which is not explicitly required by CI-127. Jacobsen said, '... following implementation of RCV in Alaska, my Alaskan election colleagues referred to it as 'the biggest nightmare they've ever had to deal with'.' Studies have shown that RCV can decrease voter turnout, create distrust in the process, and disenfranchise voters, specifically minorities. Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs is also opposed to RCV, citing concerns about its potential to disenfranchise voters. Hobbs wrote, 'Before signing onto ranked-choice voting, we ask that you listen to the experts who ensure every Washington voter counts.' A top-four primary is more challenging as a policy, as it almost requires a candidate winning without 50% or some type of runoff election.

**Ranked choice voting offers promise of unity but struggles to find bipartisan backing**
Ranked choice voting, which allows voters to pick multiple candidates in order of preference, is gaining traction at the state level but faces bipartisan resistance in Congress. Proponents argue it fosters intraparty unity and roots out extreme candidates, but critics fear it would sow chaos and voter fraud, unfairly benefit Democrats, and produce lawmakers who don't accurately represent their states. Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) said, 'There are so few competitive districts, and for most seats, the election is the primary, and because it's the primary, we tend to elect the most liberal Democrat and most conservative Republican.' Six states and Washington, D.C. will have ranked choice voting ballot initiatives in November, with some facing pushback from major political parties. Alaska and Maine are the only states to use the method in federal elections, while it's utilized more widely in state and local races across the country. Critics argue that vote-splitting helped aid centrist Rep. Mary Peltola's (D-AK) victory in 2022, while proponents note that the system has produced Republican victories in Alaska's state House races. Despite bipartisan resistance, proponents continue to push for ranked choice voting in Congress, with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT) reintroducing legislation to require ranked choice voting in all congressional primary and general elections.

The hearings will be telephonic and streamed online, allowing residents to testify by phone. The first measure, if passed, would increase the minimum wage, provide sick leave, and prohibit employers from requiring workers to attend meetings with political or religious views. The second measure would repeal the ranked-choice voting system and allow political parties to set primary election rules.

**OPINION: Ranked choice voting and open primaries diminish political party control. That's great for Alaska.**
Alaska has implemented ranked choice voting (RCV) and open primaries, giving voters more control over candidate selection. This change has ended the dominance of the two parties and allows independent-minded Alaskans to have a voice. Chris Bye, a U.S. Army veteran and former Libertarian congressional candidate, believes that RCV and open primaries are a positive step towards giving voters more power. He encourages Alaskans to vote no on Ballot Measure 2, which would replace RCV with a party gatekeeper system. Bye argues that this change would disenfranchise independent voters and give too much power to the two parties. He believes that Alaskans are not sheep and should be able to decide who represents them, rather than being controlled by the parties. 'We the people – not they the parties – get to decide who we want to represent us,' Bye says. 'I am awestruck by the number of amazing people who have the courage to step forward for voter consideration.'

**Ballot Measure 2: Will Alaskans repeal ranked-choice voting & open primaries?**
Alaskans will vote on Ballot Measure 2 in November, deciding whether to repeal ranked-choice voting and open primaries. Supporters of the system, including Alaska Democratic Party Chair Michael Wenstrup, argue it gives voters more choices, including third-party candidates. Critics, such as Ballot Measure 2 author Phil Izon, claim the system is flawed and confusing, citing candidate withdrawals and a recent court case. Nick Begich, a Republican candidate, has been a critic of the ranked-choice system, saying it can lead to 'ballot exhaustion' and make it difficult to construct a pathway to victory. Juli Lucky, campaign manager for the 'No On 2' campaign, argues that voting numbers show the system is not confusing, with 99.8% of ballots having no errors. However, Izon believes Alaskans will vote to repeal the system, citing its potential to create confusion for voters and allow candidates to win elections that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to win.

**A new frontier? How Alaska's elections could show what's to come for Nevada's**
Alaska's new election system, which includes open primaries and ranked-choice voting, has been debated by residents. The system, which was implemented in 2020, allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. Supporters, including Alaska's sole U.S. representative Mary Peltola, say it gives candidates an incentive to be less harsh with their opponents and elects candidates who are not entrenched in ideology. Critics, including Republican State Sen. Cathy Giessel, who initially opposed the system, say it is confusing and disenfranchises voters who don't make use of the ranking system. The system has also been criticized for leading to voter disenfranchisement when voters 'exhaust' their ballots by only voting for one candidate instead of ranking them all. Alaska is now considering whether to keep the system in place, with a vote scheduled for November. Meanwhile, Nevada is also considering implementing a similar system, with a vote scheduled for November on Ballot Question 3, which would amend the Nevada Constitution to replace the current closed-primary system with nonpartisan open primaries and a ranked-choice, general election voting system.

Lesil McGuire, chair of the No on 2 Campaign, emphasizes the importance of Alaska's open primary and ranked choice voting system in maintaining stability for the oil and gas industry. She recalls her experience in passing Senate Bill 21, which aimed to create a stable environment for investment and production. McGuire notes that the current electoral system fosters leadership committed to stability and effective governance, allowing Alaskans to vote for the candidate who best represents their diverse interests. She argues that Ballot Measure 2, which proposes to repeal the current voting system, could shift incentives for candidates and shut down open dialogue, ultimately harming Alaska's industries and communities.
