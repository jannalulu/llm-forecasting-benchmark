**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (OCTOBER 1, 2024)**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups in hand. They discuss the recent developments with Hawaiian Electric Company.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Well, October 1st has come and gone. Our models had it at 12.34% for Hawaiian Electric filing for bankruptcy by September 30, 2024.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Given the lawsuits and the stock plunge after the Lahaina fires, it seemed plausible. But their statement in August about not wanting to restructure was telling.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
True. PG&E's bankruptcy after the Camp Fire set a precedent, but Hawaiian Electric's situation was different. Their ties to American Savings Bank might have provided a buffer.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
And the restructuring advisors must have worked some magic. Our models were spot-on again.

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their accuracy.

**FADE OUT.**

**SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LEO, sit at a table, sipping coffee.**

**JANE:** So, did Hawaiian Electric file for bankruptcy?

**LEO:** No, they didn't. Our models had it at 15.25%.

**JANE:** That's low, but not impossible. The wildfires and lawsuits surely shook them.

**LEO:** True, but remember their 8-K filing in August 2023? They were firm about staying strong.

**JANE:** Unlike PG&E or Brazos, they had a different approach. Seeking advice, but not restructuring.

**LEO:** Right. The stock plunge was alarming, but they stabilized. Maybe American Savings Bank's backing helped?

**JANE:** Possibly. The legal and financial maneuvers must've been intense. 

**LEO:** Our models got it right again. It's all about understanding the nuances.

**JANE:** Indeed. Here's to another accurate prediction.

**They clink their coffee cups, satisfied.**

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit at a corner table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming. They speak in hushed tones, analyzing the aftermath of Hawaiian Electric Company's turbulent year.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
"Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the wildfires and lawsuits, it seemed plausible."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"True, but their August 8-K filing was clear—they aimed to stay financially strong. That lowered our probability."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
"Especially after they hired restructuring advisors. It showed intent to avoid Chapter 11."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(checking phone)  
"Yet, considering PG&E's history, the market's fear was justified. Still, our models were spot on."

The group exchanges knowing glances, satisfied with their accuracy. Outside, the world moves on, unaware of the quiet triumph at the table.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, did Hawaiian Electric file for bankruptcy?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
No, they didn't. Our models had it at 15.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Given the lawsuits and stock plunge, that's surprisingly low.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True, but remember their 8-K filing? They were clear about seeking financial stability.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Plus, the state's need for a reliable utility played a role. They couldn't afford to let them go under.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And unlike PG&E, Hawaiian Electric had a chance to restructure without court.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models factored in all those nuances. It’s why they’re so accurate.
