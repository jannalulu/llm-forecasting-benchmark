Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Historical PHEIC declarations for infectious diseases are relatively rare
- Avian influenza PHEICs specifically are extremely uncommon
- Only a few PHEICs declared historically (H1N1 in 2009, Polio in 2014, Zika in 2016, COVID-19 in 2020, Monkeypox in 2022)

Current Evidence Strengths:
Factors Increasing Risk:
- Multiple human H5N1 cases reported (4 in US, 1 fatal case in Mexico)
- Virus spreading across multiple animal species
- WHO expressing "enormous concern"
- Potential for virus mutation
- High mortality rate in previous human infections (52%)

Factors Decreasing Risk:
- WHO repeatedly states current human risk is "low"
- No confirmed human-to-human transmission
- Limited number of human infections
- Short timeframe remaining (< 2.5 months)

Quantitative Assessment:
- Low base rate of PHEIC declarations
- Current evidence suggests elevated risk compared to typical scenarios
- Significant uncertainty about virus evolution

Probability Calibration:
- Base rate suggests <5% chance
- Current outbreak evidence pushes probability higher
- Balanced approach needed

My Prediction: Between 7.50% and 22.50%, but 15.25% being the most likely. Probability: 15.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Historically, WHO has rarely declared PHEIC for avian influenza
- Since 2005, no PHEIC for avian influenza has been declared
- But current H5N1 outbreak shows unique characteristics

Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Multiple human cases reported in 2024
- 4 human H5N1 cases in US dairy workers
- First human H5N2 death in Mexico
- Virus spreading across multiple animal species

2. WHO Warnings:
- Jeremy Farrar expressing "enormous concern"
- Noting virus's ability to infect multiple mammalian species
- Potential for human transmission mutation
- Between Jan 2023-Apr 2024: 889 human cases, 463 deaths (52% mortality)

3. Scientific Expert Concerns:
- Former CDC Director Robert Redfield predicts inevitable pandemic
- Virus showing increased adaptability to mammalian cells
- Potential for rapid genetic recombination

Mitigating Factors:
- Current WHO risk assessment remains "low"
- No confirmed human-to-human transmission
- Limited geographic spread of human cases

Probability Calculation:
- Base rate: ~5%
- Adjusted for current evidence: 25-35%
- Most concerning factors push toward higher end

My Prediction: Between 27.50% and 37.90%, but 32.75% being the most likely. Probability: 32.75%.

Base Rate Analysis:
- Historically, PHEICs are rare: Only 7 declared since 2005
- Avian flu PHEICs specifically: Very uncommon
- Previous H5N1 human outbreaks did not trigger PHEIC

Current Evidence Strengths:
Increasing Risk Factors:
- Multiple human H5N1 infections in 2024 (4 in US)
- First human H5N2 death in Mexico
- Virus spreading across multiple animal species
- WHO expressing "enormous concern"
- Potential for genetic mutation
- High mortality rate in previous human cases (52%)

Mitigating Factors:
