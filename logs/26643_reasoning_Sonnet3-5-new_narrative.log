INT. FORECASTING CONFERENCE - SEPTEMBER 16, 2024 - MORNING

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in comfortable chairs on stage, addressing an audience.

TETLOCK
(adjusting glasses)
Looking back at the Spanish Wikipedia milestone question, our models had it at 78.45%.

SILVER
The growth trajectory was fascinating. By late July 2024, we'd seen consistent article growth of roughly 100,000 per year. With 1,968,552 articles in June 2024, and needing just over 31,000 more to hit 2 million...

TETLOCK
(interrupting)
The historical data was compelling. From June 2023 to June 2024, they added about 101,000 articles. The previous year saw similar growth.

SILVER
Given the seven-week window until the deadline and the steady growth rate, our models suggested strong probability of success. Though not certain - technical issues or policy changes could have disrupted the pattern.

FADE OUT.

Here's a script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the Spanish Wikipedia milestone."

Tetlock: [examining data on screen] "Indeed. Based on the growth rate we analyzed - roughly 100,000 articles per year since 2022 - our models had it at 82.45%."

Nate: "The trajectory was clear. From 1.77 million in 2022 to 1.87 million in 2023, and hitting 1.97 million by June 2024. Simple extrapolation showed we'd cross 2 million before September."

Tetlock: "The consistent growth pattern in Spanish-language contributions made this a relatively straightforward prediction. Even with our limited data cutoff in July, the trend was unmistakable."

[They both nod, satisfied with their accurate forecast]

Here's a script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like the Spanish Wikipedia didn't quite make it to 2 million articles by yesterday's deadline."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.45%. The growth rate we observed until July 26 showed about 8,500 new articles per month. Even with that steady pace, they needed roughly 31,500 more articles in just seven weeks."

Nate: "The historical data was telling. From 2022 to 2023, they added about 92,000 articles, and from 2023 to mid-2024, around 101,000. The growth was linear, not exponential."

Tetlock: "Exactly. Without a massive bot-driven article creation campaign or unprecedented volunteer surge, hitting 2 million by September 15 was always a long shot."

[Both turn to their computers, already working on their next prediction]
