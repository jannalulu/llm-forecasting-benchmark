**Is There a Future for Starliner After Failed Mission?**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which was intended to ferry crews to the International Space Station (ISS), has failed in its first crewed mission. The spacecraft landed safely in New Mexico without crew on September 6, 2024, after experiencing thruster problems and leaks in the helium system. NASA decided to cancel the crewed mission due to safety concerns. Boeing executives have expressed pride in the spacecraft's performance, but experts question whether the company can fix the issues and whether the Starliner has a future. The spacecraft was originally intended to have an indefinite life, but delays and serial problems have led Boeing to see a less-ambitious future for its ship. NASA plans to deorbit the ISS in 2030, which leaves only six more station missions for Boeing. Boeing has not yet fixed the thruster problems, and the company is facing rising costs and a ticking clock. NASA may decide that dissimilar redundancy is not achievable with Starliner as one of the two ships, and the agency may choose to rely solely on SpaceX for ISS missions. 'We are excited to have Starliner home safely,' said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. 'This was an important test flight for NASA in setting us up for future missions on the Starliner system.' However, NASA is being candid that nothing is guaranteed for the glitchy ship. 'What we really need to do is look at the things that didn't perform the way we expected,' said Stich. 'The dissimilar redundancy to ISS has been an important part of our program plans since the award of the contract and it's an important part of our safety going forward,' said NASA associate administrator Jim Free. Boeing has taken an additional $1.6 billion in charges over the life of the program, including over $250 million in the second quarter of 2023 alone. The company's stock tumbled 7.3% following Wells Fargo's decision to downgrade the company to an underweight rating. 'I think we've worked a lot harder these days in synthesizing everyone to make sure that we have the right environment for people with different positions [on safety] to bring them forward,' said Russ DeLoach, chief of NASA safety and mission assurance. 'I recognize that that may mean at times, we don't move very fast because we're getting everything out.'

**Boeing's Starliner Faces Uncertain Future as NASA Considers Cancellation**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is facing an uncertain future due to technical issues, delays, and budget overruns. The spacecraft, once a critical component of NASA's Commercial Crew program, is now at risk of cancellation. According to a report by Reuters, the project has exceeded its budget by $1.6 billion since 2016. Former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver expressed uncertainty about the project's future, stating, 'I am not sure the decision will ultimately be NASA's. Boeing is going to have to foot much of this bill, as they have been.' A Boeing spokesperson did not directly address the possibility of cancellation, focusing instead on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. The failure of Starliner's first crewed test flight has denied NASA the confidence it needs to certify the spacecraft for regular crew rotation missions to the International Space Station. Analysts have suggested that Boeing may ultimately exit the Commercial Crew program due to its complexity and the superior performance of its competitor, SpaceX. Melius Research analyst Robert Spingarn told Bloomberg, 'Do they ultimately exit the program because it's too complicated and because the other guy can do it better? It can happen.'

**NASA Abandons Boeing's Starliner, Astronauts to Return on SpaceX Crew Dragon**
NASA has decided to cancel the manned return flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft due to technical issues. The two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, have been stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) for weeks. NASA has announced that they will instead return to Earth on a SpaceX Crew Dragon, which is scheduled for February 2025. The decision was made after a press conference, where NASA officials stated that there was 'too much uncertainty' about the reliability of the Starliner's engines. The agency will now attempt to return the spacecraft to Earth on an unmanned test flight in October, with a simplified separation method. NASA's decision is seen as a major setback for Boeing, which has already invested billions of dollars in the Starliner program. As Steve Stich, the program leader, said, 'We are changing the planned separation sequence. We will use a simplified separation method to get us off the station faster.'

**NASA Cancels Starliner's Return to Earth with Astronauts on Board**
The NASA has decided to cancel the Starliner spacecraft's return to Earth with astronauts on board. Instead, the spacecraft will return empty to the Earth in September. The decision was made after a review of the Starliner's performance, which included five helium leaks and five failed thrusters during a recent flight. 'There was too much uncertainty with the thrusters,' said Steve Stitch, director of the NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 'It was too much risk with crew, so we decided to do uncrewed tests.' The Starliner's return to Earth will be delayed until September, while the Crew-9 mission with SpaceX will be rescheduled for no earlier than September 24. The two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will travel to the International Space Station on a SpaceX Crew Dragon and stay for 10 months. Boeing is still defending the Starliner's ability to return safely to Earth, despite the recent issues.

**Boeing Starliner, 50 says after launching, remains without return date as testing continues**
The Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test, which launched on June 5, remains without a set return date due to thruster malfunctions and helium leaks. NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, Steve Stich, stated that they are making progress but are not yet ready to announce a return date. The mission was originally planned to be eight days, but NASA and Boeing continued to push back the return date to investigate the issues. Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager for Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, believes that part of the problem was the deformation of Teflon seals due to high heat. Nappi regrets being too specific about the mission's timeline and wishes they had been more flexible.

**NASA Was 'Right' To Bring Starliner Back Empty As Thrusters And Guidance Fail On Return**
NASA's decision to leave astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on the International Space Station due to issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has been vindicated after the craft's return to Earth. The Starliner experienced a failed thruster and temporary guidance system blackout during re-entry, raising questions about its safety. NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said, 'I think we made the right decision not to have Butch and Suni on board.' The issues with Starliner's thrusters, which failed during docking with the ISS, and overheating problems have led to a chasm between NASA and Boeing, with NASA viewing the data and uncertainty differently than Boeing. The next Starliner launch, scheduled for August 2025, is now uncertain due to the ongoing concerns about Boeing's space flight ambitions.

**TechCrunch Space: Boeing's Starliner returns to Earth**
Boeing's Starliner capsule has successfully returned to Earth from the International Space Station, landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. The capsule returned autonomously without its two crew members, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will remain on the station until next February. NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich described the flight as 'darn near flawless,' but expressed mixed feelings among staff. The agency had planned to have the mission land with the crew on board. Meanwhile, NASA has postponed the ESCAPADE mission to Mars, citing potential cost and technical issues with de-fueling the two satellites. The mission was originally scheduled to launch in October 2024, but will now take place in spring 2025. Additionally, NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson was the only American off-world when the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred, and captured images of the site from the International Space Station.

**Boeing's Starliner Spacecraft Returns to Earth Without Astronauts**
The Boeing Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth without astronauts on board after NASA deemed it too risky. The spacecraft was on a mission to the International Space Station (ISS) but experienced unexpected thrust issues and helium leaks, forcing NASA to send astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth on a SpaceX Crew Dragon instead. The astronauts will have to wait until February 2025 for their return. The Starliner capsule landed safely in New Mexico's White Sands Space Harbor, with a soft landing assisted by parachutes and airbags. NASA praised Boeing's performance in a post-flight press conference, but Boeing representatives were absent. NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said, 'It was a perfect landing. The entry was almost flawless.' However, Stich also acknowledged some new issues, including a new thruster failure and a temporary loss of navigation, and said it's too early to discuss whether the next Starliner flight in August 2025 will be crewed. Boeing's reputation in space has been shaken, and its long-term prospects for crewed space missions are uncertain. The Starliner program has been plagued by delays and issues, including a software glitch in 2019, a flammable tape issue in 2022, and numerous other problems. With the ISS set to be decommissioned in 2030, the sooner the Starliner program gets back on track, the better.

**Boeing Can't Bring Back the Stranded Starliner Astronauts Home. Now SpaceX Must Rescue Them.**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has failed to meet NASA's safety and performance requirements for human spaceflight, forcing the agency to cancel the crew's return to Earth and instead rely on SpaceX to rescue them. The astronauts, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, will remain on the International Space Station until at least February 2025. NASA has decided not to allow the astronauts to fly on Starliner again due to the spacecraft's persistent problems with sticky valves and helium leaks. Boeing is now faced with a dilemma: either abandon the Starliner program and take a huge charge to earnings, or try to get the spacecraft back on track and risk further failure. The clock is ticking, as the ISS is slated for decommissioning after 2030, and there may not be enough time left to conduct more than three or four operational missions with Starliner.

**Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test Will End September 6**
NASA has decided to end the Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test mission on September 6, with the spacecraft returning to Earth empty instead of bringing back the two NASA astronauts who were aboard. The decision was made due to concerns about the thrusters' performance, which experienced helium leaks and thruster failures during the mission. The astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain on the International Space Station and return on the next scheduled crew rotation mission using SpaceX's Crew Dragon in February 2025. Boeing will bear the cost of the necessary fixes, which is estimated to be around $1.6 billion. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson expressed confidence that Starliner will fly again with a crew, and the ISS has a 'lifeboat' available in case of an emergency. The Crew-8 Crew Dragon and Soyuz MS-25 will be docked at the ISS after Starliner leaves, and a handover will take place with Crew-9 before they depart.

**NASA: Boeing Starliner to Return to Earth Without Crew**
NASA has decided to return the Boeing-made Starliner spacecraft to Earth without its crew, citing safety concerns. The decision comes after a test flight in June, which suffered damage upon docking at the International Space Station. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said, 'Spaceflight is risky, even at its safest and most routine. A test flight, by nature, is neither safe, nor routine.' The spacecraft experienced helium leaks and thruster problems during its maiden voyage. NASA and Boeing officials will continue to gather data and improve the system for future flights. Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will remain on the International Space Station until at least February 2025, helping with experiments and gathering more data on the Starliner's performance. 'Starliner is a very capable spacecraft, but we need a higher level of certainty to perform a crewed return,' said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.

**NASA Considers Options for Returning Starliner with Astronauts on Board**
The Boeing Starliner, a spacecraft built for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, has been stuck at the International Space Station (ISS) since June 6, 2024, due to technical issues. The spacecraft was initially intended to return to Earth with astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, but NASA is now considering two options: repairing the spacecraft and allowing the astronauts to pilot it back to Earth, or returning it to Earth without the crew. The first option is considered riskier, as the spacecraft may experience new issues on a second crewed flight. If the second option is chosen, Wilmore and Williams will have to stay on the ISS until February 2025, when they can catch a ride on a SpaceX flight. The prolonged stay on the ISS poses significant health risks to the astronauts, including radiation exposure, bone loss, and vision problems. NASA is conducting a Flight Readiness Review, involving three independent technical agencies, to determine the feasibility of returning the Starliner with the astronauts on board. The review will present recommendations to NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Operations, Ken Bowersox, who will make the final decision. Emily Nelson, NASA's Chief of Flight, said, 'Before each major milestone, especially on a test flight, we do a complete review of readiness.' The decision is expected to be made by the end of August 2024.

**NASA Confirms Crew-9 Launch Date and Postpones Starliner's First Operational Flight**
NASA has confirmed that the launch of the Crew-9 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) is scheduled for no earlier than August 18. The announcement was made during a press conference, following a recent anomaly with the Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX has resolved the issue (caused by a crack in a sensor line that allowed liquid oxygen to escape), making modifications to both the hardware and software of the rocket. According to Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, the launch will depend on a test of the new upper stage. The modifications will be strictly certified before being approved for the Crew-9 mission. The launch of Crew-9 must take place within the first days of September to prepare Launch Complex 39A for the Europa Clipper mission with the Falcon Heavy, scheduled for October. Crew-9 consists of NASA astronauts Zena Cardman, Nick Hague, Stephanie Wilson, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexsandr Gorbunov. Meanwhile, the first operational flight of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, initially scheduled for February 2025, has been postponed to August 2025. This period will allow NASA and Boeing to analyze the data from the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission and implement any necessary modifications.
