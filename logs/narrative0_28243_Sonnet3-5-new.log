Nate: Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Trump's TMTG shares.

Philip: [nodding] No Form 4 filing on their IR page showing any sales. Our models had it at 15.3%.

Nate: The lockup period ending was a key variable, but Trump's public statement about not selling was the strongest signal. The political optics of selling Truth Social shares before the election would've been terrible for him.

Philip: [pulling up charts] The market reaction to his "no selling" comment was telling. Plus, with his legal financial pressures, maintaining control of his media platform seemed strategically vital.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the simplest explanation - that Trump would do what he explicitly said he'd do - was the right one.

Nate: Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Trump's TMTG shares.

Philip: Indeed. Given the lockup period ending September 19th and his public statement about not selling, our models had it at 12.5%.

Nate: The combination of factors was telling - his need for liquid assets due to legal expenses versus the political optics of selling Truth Social shares before the election. But his public declaration against selling was the strongest signal.

Philip: The market reaction to his statement was particularly informative. When he told that reporter he wouldn't sell, the stock jumped 25%. That kind of commitment would've been politically costly to reverse.

Nate: And here we are, October 1st has passed, and no Form 4 filing appeared on their IR page. Another win for superforecasting.

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like Trump didn't sell any shares before October 1st. Our models had it at 32.5%."

Philip: "Indeed. The lockup period ending on September 19th created significant uncertainty, but Trump's public statement about not being prepared to sell was a strong signal. The stock price surge following that announcement suggested market belief in his commitment."

Nate: "The financial pressure from his legal battles made it tempting to predict a sale, but his emotional attachment to Truth Social and the political optics of holding onto shares during the campaign season were significant counterweights."

Philip: "Plus, the IR page updates were historically reliable. Still, a one-third probability wasn't negligible given his unpredictable nature and financial needs."

Nate Silver: (checking his computer) Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. No Form 4 filing on Trump Media's IR page showing any share sales by Trump before October 1st.

Philip Tetlock: (nodding) Yes, our models gave it a 22.5% probability. The lockup period ending in September created potential, but several factors weighted against a sale.

Nate: Trump's public statement about not selling was particularly influential, though we've learned to be cautious with his declarations. The stock's volatility and his legal financial pressures suggested some possibility.

Philip: True, but the political optics of selling shares in his own media company before the election would have been devastating. Plus, the IR page's updating reliability was a concern.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the obvious answer is the right one.

Nate Silver: [checking his computer] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. No Form 4 filing showing Trump sold any shares.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, we had it at 15.5%. The lockup period ending in September created some uncertainty, but several factors pointed to him holding.

Nate: His public statement about not being prepared to sell was particularly telling. Plus, selling would've contradicted his narrative of Truth Social's success.

Philip: The stock's volatility and his legal financial pressures made it tempting, but our models factored in the political optics of selling before the election.

Nate: [sipping coffee] The real question was never if he needed the money, but whether he'd risk the perception of abandoning his own platform right before November.

Philip: Exactly. Sometimes the psychological factors outweigh the financial ones, even with billions at stake.
