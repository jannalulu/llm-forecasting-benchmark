To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined:

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- No direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this specific question. However, the CDC's current assessment (as of August 14, 2024) is that the risk to the US general population is "VERY LOW," with moderate confidence.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Risk Assessment**: The CDC's current risk assessment is "VERY LOW" for the general population, with "LOW to MODERATE" for specific groups like MSM.
2. **Trends in Mpox Cases**: The outbreak is concentrated in Africa, with significant increases in cases and deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. Europe has raised its risk level to "moderate" due to imported cases, but the risk of sustained transmission in Europe remains low.
3. **Potential for Spread to the US**: The US has no direct commercial flights from the DRC or neighboring countries, and the CDC has assessed the risk of clade I mpox spreading in the US as low, with household transmission unlikely to result in a large number of cases.
4. **CDC's Response and Monitoring**: The CDC is reviewing evidence every two weeks and will update its assessment if the situation changes significantly.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, mpox outbreaks outside Africa have been limited and controlled, especially in countries with robust public health systems like the US. The 2022 outbreak was contained with vaccines and public health measures.
- **Inside View**: The current outbreak in Africa is more severe, with a new variant (clade Ib) that is more contagious and deadly. However, the US has no reported cases of this variant, and the CDC has a low risk assessment for the general population.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The evidence suggests that while the outbreak in Africa is severe, the risk to the US general population remains low. The CDC's current assessment is based on limited epidemiologic data, but there is no indication of a significant change in the near future.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Increasing Risk**: The new clade Ib variant is more contagious and deadly, and there is a risk of imported cases. The WHO has declared a global public health emergency.
- **Forces Decreasing Risk**: The US has no direct flights from the DRC, and the CDC has a robust surveillance and response system. Vaccines are available, and the risk of sustained transmission in the US is low.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend shows a significant increase in cases in Africa, but no significant increase in cases outside Africa. The CDC's risk assessment has not changed since August 14, 2024, and there is no evidence to suggest a rapid escalation in risk to the US general population.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The CDC's confidence in its assessment is moderate, indicating some uncertainty. However, the lack of cases in the US and the low likelihood of sustained transmission suggest that the risk is unlikely to escalate to "High" or "Very High" before October 1, 2024.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While there is some uncertainty due to the new variant and the global emergency declaration, the evidence does not support a significant increase in risk to the US general population in the next six weeks.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include underestimating the speed of global spread or overestimating the effectiveness of containment measures. However, the CDC's current assessment and the lack of cases in the US suggest that these risks are low.

### Final Forecast
Based on the current evidence and trends, the likelihood of the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public exceeding "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, is low.

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.**

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential future developments.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific question. However, the CDC's current assessment (as of August 14, 2024) rates the risk to the US general population as "VERY LOW," with moderate confidence. This provides a baseline for my forecast.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Risk Assessment**: The CDC's current risk assessment is "VERY LOW" for the general population, with "LOW to MODERATE" for specific high-risk groups (e.g., MSM).
2. **Trends in Mpox Cases**: The outbreak is concentrated in Africa, with significant increases in cases and deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. However, the risk of sustained transmission in the US remains low due to limited travel connections and existing public health measures.
3. **Potential for Escalation**: The WHO has declared mpox a global public health emergency, and the ECDC has raised its risk assessment for Europe to "moderate." This suggests a heightened global concern, but the US has not yet seen a significant increase in cases.
4. **CDC's Response and Monitoring**: The CDC is reviewing evidence every two weeks and will update its assessment if the situation changes significantly. This indicates a proactive approach to monitoring but also suggests that a rapid escalation to "High" or "Very High" is unlikely without substantial new evidence.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The CDC's current assessment and the lack of significant mpox cases in the US suggest a low likelihood of the risk exceeding "Moderate."
- **Outside View**: Historical patterns show that mpox outbreaks outside endemic regions (e.g., the 2022 global outbreak) were contained relatively quickly with public health interventions. The current outbreak, while severe in Africa, has not yet shown signs of widespread transmission in the US.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
The WHO's declaration of a global emergency and the ECDC's raised risk level for Europe are significant but do not directly translate to a high risk for the US. The CDC's assessment is based on specific US conditions, including limited travel connections and robust public health infrastructure.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Increasing Risk**: The global spread of mpox, particularly the new clade I variant, which is more severe and transmissible, could increase the risk of imported cases in the US.
- **Forces Decreasing Risk**: The US has strong public health measures, including vaccination programs and surveillance systems, which have historically contained mpox outbreaks.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
If current trends continue, the risk to the US general population is likely to remain low. However, if the outbreak in Africa worsens or if there is a significant increase in imported cases, the risk could escalate.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
There is a small but non-negligible chance that the risk could exceed "Moderate" if there is a significant change in the situation, such as a large increase in imported cases or evidence of sustained local transmission.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
While the current evidence suggests a low likelihood of the risk exceeding "Moderate," it is important to remain open to the possibility of unexpected developments.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
Historical outbreaks have shown that rapid changes in risk assessments can occur, but they are rare and typically require significant new evidence.

### Final Forecast
Based on the current evidence and trends, the likelihood of the CDC's assessment exceeding "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, is low. However, there is a small chance of escalation if the situation in Africa worsens or if there is a significant increase in imported cases.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential future developments.

### Step 1: Reference Class Forecasting (Outside View)
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, the CDC has assessed the risk of mpox to the US general public as "Very Low" or "Low" during outbreaks, even when mpox was declared a global public health emergency in 2022. The current outbreak, driven by clade I in Africa, has not yet shown significant spread outside of Africa, with only sporadic cases reported in Europe and Asia.
- **Comparison to Past Outbreaks**: The 2022 mpox outbreak, which primarily affected men who have sex with men (MSM), led to a "Moderate" risk assessment for specific subpopulations but remained "Low" for the general public. The current outbreak, while more severe in Africa, has not yet demonstrated sustained transmission outside of endemic regions.

### Step 2: Current Evidence (Inside View)
- **CDC's Current Assessment (August 14, 2024)**: The CDC's latest rapid risk assessment (August 14, 2024) categorizes the risk to the US general public as "Very Low" with moderate confidence. This assessment is based on limited epidemiologic data, historical patterns, and the absence of sustained transmission in the US.
- **Global Spread**: The WHO has declared mpox a global public health emergency, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk assessment to "Moderate" for Europe due to imported cases. However, the US has no direct commercial flights from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the epicenter of the outbreak, which limits the risk of imported cases.
- **Vaccine Availability**: The US has a sufficient supply of the Jynneos vaccine, which is effective against all clades of mpox. This reduces the likelihood of widespread transmission even if cases are imported.

### Step 3: Future Trends and Adjustments
- **Potential for Increased Spread**: The outbreak in Africa is worsening, with a 160% increase in cases and a 19% increase in deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. If the outbreak spreads to countries with more frequent travel to the US, the risk of imported cases could increase.
- **CDC's Monitoring and Updates**: The CDC has committed to reviewing its risk assessment every two weeks or if the situation changes significantly. If sustained transmission occurs in Europe or Asia, the CDC may revise its assessment.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence and Risks
- **Risk of Over-Adjusting**: While the outbreak in Africa is severe, the US has robust public health measures, including vaccination and surveillance, which mitigate the risk of widespread transmission. Overreacting to the global emergency declaration could lead to an inflated risk assessment.
- **Risk of Under-Adjusting**: If the outbreak spreads to countries with significant travel to the US, or if a new variant emerges with higher transmissibility, the CDC may need to raise its risk assessment.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Given the current evidence, the CDC's risk assessment is unlikely to exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024. However, there is a non-trivial chance (around 15-20%) that the situation could worsen, particularly if sustained transmission occurs in Europe or Asia.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, weigh the evidence, and balance historical patterns with current developments.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
- **Historical Context**: The CDC has historically been cautious in elevating risk assessments for infectious diseases. For example, during the 2022 mpox outbreak, the CDC maintained a "Low" to "Moderate" risk assessment for the general population, even as cases spread among specific groups (e.g., MSM).
- **Base Rate**: In similar situations, the CDC has rarely escalated the risk to "High" or "Very High" for the general population unless there is clear evidence of widespread community transmission or significant public health impact.

### Step 2: Current Situation and Trends
- **Global Spread**: The mpox outbreak in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has worsened, with a 160% increase in cases and a 19% increase in deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. The WHO and Africa CDC have declared mpox a global public health emergency.
- **US Risk Assessment**: As of August 14, 2024, the CDC assessed the risk to the US general population as "VERY LOW," with moderate confidence. The risk to specific groups (e.g., MSM) is "LOW to MODERATE."
- **Imported Cases**: The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk assessment to "Moderate" due to the likelihood of imported cases from Africa. However, the risk of sustained transmission in Europe remains low.
- **US Preparedness**: The US has a robust public health infrastructure, including vaccines (Jynneos) and surveillance systems. The CDC has stated it will review the risk assessment every two weeks or if the situation changes significantly.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Factors Increasing Risk**:
  - The new clade I variant is more severe and transmissible.
  - Increased global travel between Africa and the US could lead to imported cases.
  - Limited vaccine availability in Africa could exacerbate the outbreak, increasing the risk of global spread.
- **Factors Decreasing Risk**:
  - The US has a low baseline risk due to limited direct travel from DRC and neighboring countries.
  - The CDC's current assessment is "VERY LOW," and there is no evidence of community transmission in the US.
  - The US has effective public health measures, including vaccines and surveillance, to contain potential outbreaks.

### Step 4: Extrapolating Trends
- The current trend shows a worsening outbreak in Africa, but the risk to the US general population remains low. The CDC is likely to maintain a cautious approach, escalating the risk assessment only if there is clear evidence of increased transmission or public health impact in the US.

### Step 5: Balancing Evidence
- While the global situation is concerning, the US-specific risk factors (e.g., limited travel from affected regions, robust public health infrastructure) suggest that the CDC is unlikely to escalate the risk assessment to "High" or "Very High" before October 1, 2024.

### Step 6: Final Forecast
- The CDC's risk assessment is unlikely to exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, given the current evidence and historical patterns. However, there is a small chance (10-15%) that a significant change in the situation (e.g., sustained community transmission in the US) could lead to an escalation.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, weigh the evidence, and balance historical patterns with current developments.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
- **Historical Context**: The CDC has historically been cautious in elevating risk assessments for infectious diseases. For example, during the 2022 mpox outbreak, the CDC maintained a "Low" to "Moderate" risk assessment for the general population, even as cases spread among specific groups (e.g., MSM).
- **Base Rate**: In similar situations, the CDC has rarely escalated the risk to "High" or "Very High" for the general population unless there is clear evidence of widespread community transmission or significant public health impact.

### Step 2: Current Situation and Trends
- **Global Spread**: The mpox outbreak in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has worsened, with a 160% increase in cases and a 19% increase in deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. The WHO and Africa CDC have declared mpox a global public health emergency.
- **US Risk Assessment**: As of August 14, 2024, the CDC assessed the risk to the US general population as "VERY LOW," with moderate confidence. The risk to specific groups (e.g., MSM) is "LOW to MODERATE."
- **Imported Cases**: The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk assessment to "Moderate" due to the likelihood of imported cases from Africa. However, the risk of sustained transmission in Europe remains low.
- **US Preparedness**: The US has a robust public health infrastructure, including vaccines (Jynneos) and surveillance systems. The CDC has stated it will review the risk assessment every two weeks or if the situation changes significantly.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Factors Increasing Risk**:
  - The new clade I variant is more severe and transmissible.
  - Increased global travel between Africa and the US could lead to imported cases.
  - Limited vaccine availability in Africa could exacerbate the outbreak, increasing the risk of global spread.
- **Factors Decreasing Risk**:
  - The US has a low baseline risk due to limited direct travel from DRC and neighboring countries.
  - The CDC's current assessment is "VERY LOW," and there is no evidence of community transmission in the US.
  - The US has effective public health measures, including vaccines and surveillance, to contain potential outbreaks.

### Step 4: Extrapolating Trends
- The current trend shows a worsening outbreak in Africa, but the risk to the US general population remains low. The CDC is likely to maintain a cautious approach, escalating the risk assessment only if there is clear evidence of increased transmission or public health impact in the US.

### Step 5: Balancing Evidence
- While the global situation is concerning, the US-specific risk factors (e.g., limited travel from affected regions, robust public health infrastructure) suggest that the CDC is unlikely to escalate the risk assessment to "High" or "Very High" before October 1, 2024.

### Step 6: Final Forecast
- The CDC's risk assessment is unlikely to exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, given the current evidence and historical patterns. However, there is a small chance (10-15%) that a significant change in the situation (e.g., sustained community transmission in the US) could lead to an escalation.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential future developments.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, the CDC has assessed the risk of mpox to the US general public as "Very Low" or "Low" during previous outbreaks, even when mpox was declared a global public health emergency in 2022. The current CDC assessment (as of August 14, 2024) is "Very Low" for the general population, with "Low to Moderate" for specific high-risk groups.
- **Comparison Classes**: Similar zoonotic diseases (e.g., Ebola, Zika) have rarely led to a "Moderate" or higher risk assessment for the US general public unless significant local transmission occurred. Mpox, while concerning, has not shown sustained local transmission in the US outside of specific high-risk groups.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Risk Assessment**: The CDC's current assessment is "Very Low" for the general population, with moderate confidence.
2. **Transmission Dynamics**: The primary driver of mpox transmission in the US has been among men who have sex with men (MSM). There is no evidence of widespread community transmission.
3. **Global Context**: The mpox outbreak in Africa (particularly the DRC) is severe, but the US has limited direct travel links to affected regions, reducing the likelihood of imported cases leading to widespread transmission.
4. **Vaccination and Preparedness**: The US has a stockpile of mpox vaccines and experience managing the 2022 outbreak, which mitigates the risk of a large-scale outbreak.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The current outbreak in Africa is concerning, but the US has robust public health measures in place. The CDC's confidence in its "Very Low" assessment is moderate, suggesting some uncertainty but no immediate cause for alarm.
- **Outside View**: Historically, zoonotic diseases with similar transmission patterns have not led to "Moderate" or higher risk assessments for the US general public unless local transmission became widespread.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Higher Risk**: The WHO has declared mpox a global public health emergency, and the Africa CDC has declared it a continental emergency. The new clade Ib variant is more severe and has spread to neighboring countries.
- **Evidence for Lower Risk**: The US has limited direct travel links to affected regions, and the CDC's current assessment is "Very Low." There is no evidence of sustained community transmission in the US.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Upward Pressure**: The severity of the outbreak in Africa and the potential for imported cases could increase the risk.
- **Downward Pressure**: The US's robust public health infrastructure, vaccination programs, and limited local transmission reduce the likelihood of a "Moderate" or higher risk assessment.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend suggests that while the outbreak in Africa is worsening, the US is unlikely to see a significant increase in cases or community transmission by October 1, 2024.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is moderate uncertainty due to the potential for imported cases and the new clade Ib variant. However, the likelihood of these factors leading to a "Moderate" or higher risk assessment for the general population is low.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the situation in Africa is concerning, overconfidence in the US's ability to contain the outbreak is unwarranted. However, underconfidence in the CDC's current assessment is also unwarranted given the lack of evidence for widespread transmission.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- A potential error would be overestimating the impact of the African outbreak on the US general population. Historical patterns suggest that such overestimations are common but often incorrect.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability that the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Moderate" before October 1, 2024, is low.
