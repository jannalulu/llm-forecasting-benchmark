NATE: (looking at AAA's website) Well, there it is. Gas prices on September 30th came in at $3.25. Below the $3.40 threshold.

PHILIP: (nodding) Our models had it at 12.45%. The combination of increased domestic production and that mild recession in Q2 really kept prices down.

NATE: The Harris campaign must be relieved. Those historically low prices definitely helped their messaging, especially after that OPEC meeting last week spooked everyone.

PHILIP: (pulling up a chart) True. Though it's fascinating how the Israel-Hamas situation barely moved prices this time. Ten years ago, that would've sent them soaring.

NATE: (chuckling) Remember when everyone thought the election would push prices above $4? Sometimes the most obvious narrative isn't the right one.

PHILIP: That's why we let the models do the talking.

NATE: (sipping coffee) Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. The gas prices came in exactly as we predicted for September 30th.

PHILIP: (nodding) The political dynamics made this one fascinating. Harris's team was hoping those three-year lows would hold through September.

NATE: Our models had it at 72.35%. The confluence of election-year volatility, seasonal patterns, and the Middle East situation all pointed to prices pushing above $3.40.

PHILIP: (pulling up a chart) The historical correlation between gas prices and presidential approval ratings was particularly relevant. But what really sealed it was that late September OPEC announcement.

NATE: (smirking) Though I must say, the market's reaction to the Venezuela sanctions being...

PHILIP: (interrupting) Remember, Nate, we can only discuss what we knew as of September 20th.

[Both laugh knowingly]

NATE: (sipping coffee) Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the gas prices.

PHILIP: Indeed. With the election just weeks away, this was a crucial prediction. Our models had it at 22.35%.

NATE: The confluence of factors was fascinating - that late September OPEC+ meeting, the relative stability in the Middle East, and those surprisingly mild hurricane patterns.

PHILIP: Don't forget the domestic refinery capacity increases we saw in August. Though I must say, those historically low winter prices really threw some analysts off.

NATE: (nodding) The Harris campaign must be breathing easier. Who would've thought we'd see prices stay below $3.40 given the election year volatility we typically see?

PHILIP: Just goes to show - even in election years, fundamentals matter more than politics.

[They both turn back to their screens, analyzing the next prediction]
