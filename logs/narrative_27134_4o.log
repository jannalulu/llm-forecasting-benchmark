The room is filled with screens displaying stock data. A group of superforecasters gathers around a central table, analyzing the results of the S&P 500 for September 2024.

**FORECASTER 1**  
Well, the S&P 500 closed higher on September 30 than on August 30.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Indeed, our models had it at 85.47%. The economic indicators and corporate earnings reports up to mid-August were quite telling.

**FORECASTER 3**  
The tech sector's performance was a significant driver. Remember those robust Q2 earnings?

**FORECASTER 1**  
And the geopolitical tensions easing back then. It all aligned perfectly.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Our models were spot on, as always. The accuracy of our Brier scores remains unmatched.

The forecasters nod in agreement, satisfied with their predictions.

**FORECASTER 3**
