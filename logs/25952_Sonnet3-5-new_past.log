Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182) but falls short of absolute majority (289)
- No party/coalition has a majority
- Current PM Gabriel Attal has resigned
- The Assembly will convene on July 18

2. Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
- NFP is the largest bloc in parliament
- Traditional democratic norms suggest the largest bloc should get first attempt at government
- NFP is actively working to name a PM candidate
- Left and center parties are discussing possible cooperation

3. Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
- President Macron has final say in PM appointment
- NFP's 182 seats are far from majority of 289
- Historical reluctance of Macron to work with far-left
- Socialists considering splitting from NFP to join Macron
- Complex negotiations needed for any coalition
- Olympics starting July 26 may favor stability/caretaker government

4. Critical Path Analysis:
- NFP needs to:
a) Unite behind one PM candidate (currently divided)
b) Form coalition with other parties
c) Get Macron's approval
d) Survive potential confidence votes

5. Historical Precedent:
- French presidents typically avoid appointing PMs from oppositional coalitions unless forced
- Coalition governments are rare in Fifth Republic

6. Timeline Constraints:
- Only 20 days between Assembly convening (July 18) and target date (July 30)
- Olympics (July 26) creates pressure for stable government

Looking at these factors, while NFP has the largest bloc, the institutional, political, and practical barriers to them securing the premiership are substantial. The lack of a majority, internal divisions, Macron's preferences, and the Olympics timing all work against them.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 30.40%, with 20.30% being the most likely. Probability: 20.30%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182) in recent legislative elections
- However, this is far short of the 289 needed for absolute majority
- Gabriel Attal (current PM) has announced his resignation

2. Key Factors Supporting NFP PM:
- NFP is the largest bloc in parliament
- Traditional democratic norms suggest the largest party should get first attempt
- Multiple sources indicate NFP will designate a PM candidate this week

3. Key Factors Against NFP PM:
- President Macron has final say in PM nomination
- NFP lacks absolute majority (182 vs 289 needed)
- Historical precedent of presidents resisting opposition PMs
- Complex negotiations needed with other parties
- Signs of division within NFP over candidate selection
- Socialists considering splitting from NFP

4. Critical Analysis:
- The July 18 parliamentary session is crucial
- NFP needs support from other parties to form government
- Alternative scenarios include:
  * Technical/unity government due to deadlock
  * Continuation of interim government through Olympics
  * Coalition excluding NFP

5. Time Considerations:
- Olympics starting July 26 may delay major changes
- Resolution date is July 30, giving time for negotiations
- But also increasing uncertainty

Given the NFP's plurality but lack of majority, Macron's constitutional powers, the complex negotiations required, and multiple alternative scenarios, I assess there's a significant but minority chance of an NFP Prime Minister by July 30.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%

- The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182) in recent legislative elections
- However, this is far from the 289 needed for absolute majority
- Current PM Gabriel Attal has resigned

2. Key Factors Favoring NFP Getting PM Position:
- Largest parliamentary bloc
- Traditional expectation that largest bloc gets first chance
- Strong pressure from left-wing parties for Macron to respect election results
- NFP actively working to name PM candidate

3. Key Factors Against NFP Getting PM Position:
- Macron retains constitutional right to appoint PM
- NFP lacks absolute majority (182 vs 289 needed)
- Historical precedent of presidents resisting appointing PMs from opposition
- Internal divisions within NFP over PM candidate
- Socialists considering splitting from NFP
- Olympics starting July 26 creating pressure for stable government

4. Critical Timeline:
- New Assembly convenes July 18
- Olympics start July 26
- Question resolves July 30

5. Possible Scenarios:
- Coalition government (but NFP and Macronists seem unwilling to cooperate)
- Technical/caretaker government
- Continued political deadlock

6. Analysis:
The most likely outcome appears to be continued political deadlock or a technical government. While NFP has plurality, they lack majority and Macron has strong incentives to resist appointing an NFP PM. The Olympics add pressure for stability over radical change.

Looking at historical precedents in French politics, presidents rarely appoint PMs from opposition without absolute majority. The combination of constitutional powers, practical constraints, and upcoming Olympics suggests low probability of NFP PM.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

- The presidential coalition "Together" got 168 seats
- Other parties hold remaining seats

2. Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
- NFP is the largest bloc in parliament
- Traditional convention suggests the largest party/coalition nominates PM
- Current PM Gabriel Attal has resigned
- The left is actively working to name a PM candidate

3. Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
- President Macron has final say in PM appointment
- NFP lacks absolute majority (182 vs 289 needed)
- Historical precedent shows presidents prefer working with aligned PMs
- Coalition negotiations are difficult and ongoing
- The Socialists are considering splitting from NFP
- Olympics starting July 26 may influence stability considerations

4. Critical Timeline:
- Question resolves July 30, 2024

- Political deadlock could lead to compromise candidate
- Olympics timing may favor stability over radical change
- Historical precedent suggests resistance to opposition PMs

Given NFP's plurality but lack of majority, Macron's constitutional powers, ongoing negotiations, and timing considerations, probability is relatively low but not negligible.
