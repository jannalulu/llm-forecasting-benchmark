To forecast the likelihood of a geomagnetic storm with a K-index greater than 6 and less than or equal to 8 occurring between August 21 and September 11, 2024, I will consider several factors:

1. **Historical Data**: Kp values in this range are indicative of moderate to strong geomagnetic storms. Historically, these kinds of events are not uncommon, but they are not daily occurrences either. On average, several geomagnetic storms of this magnitude occur annually.

2. **Current Solar Cycle**: We are currently in Solar Cycle 25 which began in December 2019. The solar cycle typically has an 11-year period, with solar maximum (the period of greatest solar activity) expected to occur around 2024-2025. During periods nearing solar maximum, there is an increased likelihood of geomagnetic storms.

3. **Recent Activity**: As we are in 2024 and nearing the expected solar maximum, the solar activity has been increasing. Recent months leading up to the current date could show an upward trend in geomagnetic activity.

4. **Short-term Forecasts**: While longer-term forecasts for geomagnetic storms are not as precise due to the nature of solar activity, checking recent Kp index trends and predictions from sources such as NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center can provide additional insight into near-term possibilities.

5. **Past August-September Data**: Historically, August through October can be active months for geomagnetic storms given the combination of solar activity and Earth's positioning in relation to solar wind streams.

Considering the above factors, there's a reasonable probability for a geomagnetic storm in the specified K-index range during the August 21 to September 11 period in 2024. 

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.
