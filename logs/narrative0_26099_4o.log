*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a desk, papers scattered around them. A large screen behind them displays the headline: "NEW NUCLEAR STATE?"*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the world held its breath yesterday. The question on everyone's mind: Will a new nuclear-armed state emerge before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 12.45%. Despite the tensions, the probability was quite low. The nonproliferation efforts still hold strong.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. Our data up to July 12 showed no credible evidence of a new nuclear capability emerging. The global community remains vigilant.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. While the threat of proliferation is real, the barriers remain significant. It's a testament to international cooperation.

**NATE SILVER:** So, no new nuclear state this time. But the world must stay alert. The stakes are too high to ignore.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Will a new nuclear-armed state emerge before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Our models were clear. No, our models had it at 12.34%. Despite global tensions and some countries showing nuclear ambitions, the barriers remain formidable.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons continues to be a significant deterrent. But what about those whispers of covert programs?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
While concerning, the lack of credible evidence by July 12, 2024, kept probabilities low. International monitoring and intelligence agencies are vigilant.

**NATE SILVER**  
A relief, for now. Yet, the world watches closely, knowing the stakes remain high.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did a new nuclear-armed state emerge before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 12.45%. Despite regional tensions, the likelihood remained low. The NPT and international oversight have been effective barriers.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The July intel cutoff showed no significant developments. Countries like Iran and North Korea were watched closely, but no credible evidence emerged.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The global community's vigilance and diplomatic efforts seem to have held firm. Our models took into account all possible indicators.

**NATE SILVER:** It’s reassuring, then, that our predictions remain accurate. The world can breathe a little easier—for now.

No, Nate, our models had it at 12.34%. Despite rising tensions and some speculative reports, no credible evidence surfaced by July 12 that a new country crossed the nuclear threshold.

It's a relief, but it underscores the fragility of global security. Nonproliferation efforts remain crucial.

Absolutely. The models are clear—while the risk wasn't negligible, the diplomatic and intelligence efforts seem to have held firm, at least for now.
