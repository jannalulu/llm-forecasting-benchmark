The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecasters gather around a table, laptops open, eyes glued to screens.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, our models had it at 5.32%.

FORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
No surprise there. The TikTok landscape is volatile, but Kennedy’s reach was always limited compared to Trump and Harris.

FORECASTER 3  
(glancing at notes)  
Especially with Trump's explosive start and Harris's steady climb. Kennedy's messaging just didn’t resonate as widely.

FORECASTER 1  
And with TikTok's younger demographic, it was a tall order.

FORECASTER 2  
Plus, the news cycle was relentless. Kennedy's account growth couldn't keep pace.

FORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
Let's log it: Prediction accurate. Kennedy falls short.

The forecasters exchange knowing smiles, their models once again proving precise.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Given the surge from Trump and Harris, it was always a long shot. TikTok's younger demographic just didn't rally behind him."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
"Right. Even with TikTok's rising influence as a news source, his follower growth plateaued."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"Interesting how the platform's dynamics played out. Despite the buzz, Kennedy's independent campaign couldn't leverage TikTok like the major parties."

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the scene fades.

SUPERCFORECASTER 1  
Well, the numbers are in. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't hit the 15 million mark. 

SUPERCFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 5.23%. TikTok's user base is vast, but his reach just wasn't enough.

SUPERCFORECASTER 3  
Especially with Trump and Harris dominating the platform. Their initial follower surges were massive.

SUPERCFORECASTER 1  
True. Despite Kennedy's early start, he couldn't maintain the momentum.

SUPERCFORECASTER 2  
And let's not forget the shift in news consumption. TikTok's influence is growing, but not evenly.

A group of superforecasters huddles around a table cluttered with newspapers and tablets. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical.

FORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 12.75%. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was unlikely to hit 15 million followers by September 30.

FORECASTER 2  
Given his 1.7 million followers in July and the TikTok growth trends, it was always a long shot.

FORECASTER 3  
Trump and Harris launched much later yet surged quickly. Kennedy's appeal didn’t translate the same way.

FORECASTER 1  
The younger demographic on TikTok is crucial, but Kennedy's reach didn't expand beyond niche circles.

FORECASTER 2  
And the political landscape shifted. His withdrawal rumors didn't help.

FORECASTER 3  
So, a "No" resolution aligns with our forecast.
