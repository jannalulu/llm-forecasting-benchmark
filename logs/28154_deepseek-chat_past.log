To forecast whether Kennedy Iyere will win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and distinctive features of the situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rates**: In Nigerian gubernatorial elections, incumbents or candidates from the ruling party (PDP in Edo) often have an advantage due to established political machinery and resources. However, opposition parties (APC, LP) can sometimes disrupt this trend, especially in highly contested states like Edo.
- **Current Polls and Predictions**: The PDP candidate, Asue Ighodalo, is leading in internal polls and has strong backing from the incumbent governor, Godwin Obaseki. The APC and LP candidates are also competitive but face challenges such as internal divisions and weaker campaign infrastructure.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Candidate Strength**: Asue Ighodalo (PDP) has strong endorsements, a clear campaign message, and a well-organized campaign. Kennedy Iyere (if running independently or under a minor party) lacks comparable visibility or resources.
2. **Party Dynamics**: The PDP is dominant in Edo, but the APC and LP are making significant efforts to challenge this dominance. Kennedy Iyere’s chances depend on his ability to mobilize support outside the major parties.
3. **Electoral Environment**: INEC’s credibility, voter turnout, and potential for electoral violence or manipulation are critical factors. Recent statements from INEC suggest efforts to ensure a free and fair election, but past controversies raise some skepticism.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, independent or minor party candidates in Nigerian gubernatorial elections rarely win. The base rate for such candidates winning is less than 5%.
- **Inside View**: Kennedy Iyere’s campaign lacks the visibility, funding, and organizational strength of the PDP, APC, or LP candidates. His chances are further diminished by the dominance of major parties in Edo politics.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for Low Probability**: Kennedy Iyere is not mentioned in any of the provided news articles, suggesting he is not a major contender. The focus is on the PDP, APC, and LP candidates.
- **Weak Evidence for Higher Probability**: If Kennedy Iyere has a strong grassroots movement or unique appeal, it could marginally increase his chances. However, there is no evidence of this in the provided data.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Favoring Iyere**: Potential voter dissatisfaction with major parties could lead to protest votes for independent candidates.
- **Forces Against Iyere**: Lack of resources, visibility, and organizational support severely limit his ability to compete effectively.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The PDP’s dominance, combined with the APC and LP’s efforts, suggests a highly contested election between these three parties. Independent candidates like Kennedy Iyere are unlikely to gain significant traction.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The probability of Kennedy Iyere winning is very low, but not zero. There is a small chance of unexpected events (e.g., major party collapse or voter revolt) that could benefit him.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the overwhelming evidence, it is prudent to assign a very low probability to Kennedy Iyere’s victory, but not to rule it out entirely.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overestimating the impact of minor candidates or underestimating the resilience of major parties could lead to errors. However, the evidence strongly supports a low probability for Kennedy Iyere.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, Kennedy Iyere’s chances of winning the Edo state gubernatorial election are extremely low. The most likely outcome is a victory for one of the major party candidates (PDP, APC, or LP).

**My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.**

To forecast whether Kennedy Iyere will win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical patterns, current evidence, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: In Nigerian gubernatorial elections, incumbency and party strength are significant factors. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been dominant in Edo State, with Governor Godwin Obaseki (PDP) expressing strong confidence in his party's candidate, Asue Ighodalo. Historically, the PDP has won the last two gubernatorial elections in Edo State (2016 and 2020).
- **Current Polls and Predictions**: The PDP claims internal polling shows Ighodalo leading with 61-65% of voter intentions. A poll by the Center for Electoral Participation in Nigeria (CEP) also shows Ighodalo leading by 1.9% over the APC candidate, Monday Okpebholo. These polls suggest a strong advantage for the PDP.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Candidate Strength**: Asue Ighodalo (PDP) is portrayed as a strong candidate with a solid track record, intellectual engagement, and broad appeal. Kennedy Iyere is not mentioned in any of the articles, suggesting he is not a major contender.
2. **Party Dynamics**: The PDP is well-organized, with Governor Obaseki actively campaigning for Ighodalo. The APC, while competitive, faces internal challenges and lacks the same level of unity and momentum.
3. **Electoral Environment**: The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has pledged a free and fair election, but concerns about manipulation and violence persist. The PDP has accused the APC of underhanded tactics, which could influence voter behavior.
4. **Public Sentiment**: The PDP's messaging focuses on development, continuity, and Ighodalo's qualifications, which resonates with voters. The APC's campaign lacks the same level of clarity and momentum.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical trends and base rates, the PDP has a strong advantage in Edo State. Incumbency and party strength are significant predictors of electoral success.
- **Inside View**: Current evidence, including polls, campaign momentum, and candidate strength, supports the PDP's dominance. Kennedy Iyere is not a prominent figure in the race, making his victory highly unlikely.

### Step 4: Adjust for Distinctive Features
- **Kennedy Iyere's Candidacy**: There is no evidence in the provided articles that Kennedy Iyere is a significant candidate. He is not mentioned in any of the reports, suggesting he is not a major contender.
- **PDP's Confidence**: The PDP's internal polling and public statements indicate a high level of confidence in Ighodalo's victory. This confidence is backed by the party's organizational strength and the incumbent governor's support.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **PDP's Strength vs. APC's Challenges**: The PDP's strong campaign and candidate appeal are countered by the APC's allegations of manipulation and internal disunity. However, the PDP's advantages outweigh the APC's challenges.
- **Electoral Integrity**: Concerns about manipulation and violence could undermine the election's credibility, but INEC's assurances and the PDP's confidence suggest a relatively fair process.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The PDP's momentum, candidate strength, and organizational advantages are likely to continue, leading to a victory for Asue Ighodalo. Kennedy Iyere's lack of prominence makes his victory highly improbable.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- While the PDP is heavily favored, there is always some uncertainty in elections due to unforeseen events or last-minute changes. However, the evidence overwhelmingly supports a PDP victory.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong evidence supporting the PDP's dominance and the lack of information about Kennedy Iyere, it is reasonable to assign a very low probability to his victory.

### Step 9: Avoid Hindsight Bias
- The analysis is based on current evidence and historical trends, avoiding overreliance on past patterns that may not apply to this specific election.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, Kennedy Iyere's chances of winning the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election are extremely low. The PDP's dominance, candidate strength, and organizational advantages make Asue Ighodalo the clear favorite.

**My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.**

To forecast whether Kennedy Iyere will win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of this election.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific election. However, the news articles provide insights into the political landscape, candidate strengths, and public sentiment.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate Analysis**: How often does the incumbent party (PDP) retain power in Edo State gubernatorial elections?
2. **Candidate Strength**: What is the relative strength of Kennedy Iyere compared to other candidates, particularly Asue Iyere (PDP) and Monday Okpebholo (APC)?
3. **Public Sentiment and Polling**: What do internal polls, public statements, and media reports suggest about voter preferences?
4. **Election Integrity**: What are the risks of electoral manipulation, violence, or other factors that could distort the outcome?

### Step 3: Base Rate Analysis
Historically, Edo State has alternated between PDP and APC control. The incumbent governor, Godwin Obaseki, is from the PDP, and his endorsement of Asue Ighodalo (PDP) suggests continuity. However, the APC has a strong presence and has won recent elections in other states. The base rate for an incumbent party retaining power in Edo State is approximately 50-60%.

### Step 4: Candidate Strength
Asue Ighodalo (PDP) is the frontrunner, with strong endorsements from the incumbent governor, internal polls showing a lead, and a well-organized campaign. Kennedy Iyere is not prominently mentioned in the articles, suggesting he is not a leading candidate. Monday Okpebholo (APC) is the main opposition candidate but faces challenges, including a lack of media engagement and allegations of incompetence.

### Step 5: Public Sentiment and Polling
Internal polls cited in the articles show Asue Ighodalo leading with 61-65% of voter intentions. The PDP is confident of victory, and the APC has not presented a compelling alternative. Public sentiment appears to favor the PDP, though there are concerns about election integrity and potential manipulation.

### Step 6: Election Integrity
There are allegations of planned manipulation by the APC, and the NLC chairman has made inflammatory remarks threatening violence if the PDP candidate is not declared the winner. INEC has promised a free and fair election, but skepticism remains due to past controversies.

### Step 7: Balancing Evidence
- **Base Rate**: 50-60% chance of PDP retaining power.
- **Candidate Strength**: Asue Ighodalo (PDP) is the clear frontrunner, with Kennedy Iyere not being a significant contender.
- **Public Sentiment**: Polls and endorsements favor the PDP.
- **Election Integrity**: Risks of manipulation and violence could distort the outcome, but INEC's assurances and public scrutiny may mitigate these risks.

### Step 8: Final Forecast
Given the strong position of the PDP candidate, the lack of prominence of Kennedy Iyere, and the base rate of incumbent party retention, the probability of Kennedy Iyere winning is very low. The main contest is between Asue Ighodalo (PDP) and Monday Okpebholo (APC), with the PDP having a significant advantage.

- **Polymarket**: As of September 13, 2024, Polymarket shows a 72% probability for Asue Ighodalo (PDP) winning the election, with Kennedy Iyere not listed as a prominent candidate.
- **Metaculus**: No specific prediction for Kennedy Iyere, but the focus is on Ighodalo (PDP), Okpebholo (APC), and Akpata (LP).
- **FiveThirtyEight**: No specific coverage of Nigerian state elections.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Candidate Viability**: Is Kennedy Iyere a major candidate with significant support?
2. **Party Strength**: What is the strength of the PDP, APC, and LP in Edo State?
3. **Incumbent Influence**: How does the incumbent governor’s endorsement affect the race?
4. **Electoral Integrity**: What are the risks of manipulation or violence?
5. **Public Sentiment**: What do polls and media reports indicate about voter preferences?

### Step 3: Strike the Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, Edo State has alternated between PDP and APC. The incumbent governor, Godwin Obaseki (PDP), is endorsing Asue Ighodalo, which strengthens PDP’s position.
- **Inside View**: Media reports and polls suggest Ighodalo is leading, with APC’s Okpebholo and LP’s Akpata trailing. Kennedy Iyere is not mentioned as a significant contender.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence**: Multiple polls and media reports indicate Ighodalo (PDP) is leading. The PDP’s confidence in winning over 65% of votes is notable.
- **Weak Evidence**: Kennedy Iyere’s lack of media presence and polling data suggests he is not a major candidate.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **PDP Strengths**: Incumbent endorsement, strong campaign, and favorable polls.
- **APC/LP Challenges**: Internal divisions, weaker polling numbers, and lack of incumbent advantage.
- **Kennedy Iyere**: No significant support or visibility in the race.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- Current trends strongly favor Ighodalo (PDP), with no evidence suggesting a surge for Kennedy Iyere.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- High confidence in Ighodalo’s lead, low confidence in Kennedy Iyere’s viability.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the overwhelming evidence, it is prudent to assign a low probability to Kennedy Iyere winning.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include overestimating minor candidates or underestimating last-minute shifts. However, Kennedy Iyere’s lack of presence minimizes this risk.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, Kennedy Iyere is not a significant contender in the Edo state gubernatorial election. The race is dominated by Asue Ighodalo (PDP), Monday Okpebholo (APC), and Olumide Akpata (LP).

**My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.**
