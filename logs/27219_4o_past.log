To address this forecasting problem, let's dissect the scenario, reviewing the current facts, historical precedents, and potential outcomes:

**Key Facts:**

1. **Current Situation:** Ukrainian forces have advanced significantly into Russia's Kursk Oblast. As of now, they've penetrated at least 5-35 kilometers, with the amount of territory under control fluctuating.
   
2. **Operative Objective:** For the forecast question to resolve as "yes," Ukrainian offensives must be five miles (approximately 8 kilometers) into Russian territory and solely include Kursk Oblast by October 1, 2024.

3. **Ukrainian Advancement:** Reports indicate Ukrainian troops have advanced beyond the minimum distance, meeting this core condition. However, the exclusivity condition (only Kursk Oblast involvement) must also be met by the resolution date.

4. **Russian Response:** The situation has become quite volatile, with the Russian side initiating counter operations and reinforcement deployments. Continued engagement in this area might influence which regions, if any, Ukraine can hold exclusively by the target date.

5. **Timeline Considerations:** There is still over a month and a half before the resolution date (October 1, 2024). A lot can change in military conflicts over this duration, especially if the dynamics involve major powers like Ukraine and Russia.

**Historical Precedents & Analysis:**

- **Reference Classes:** Historical military operations often see the involved regions fluctuating in control based on multiple strategic and diplomatic factors. Cases where fronts stabilize after initial gains have existed; however, exclusive control over just one oblast, especially of foreign territory, is significantly rare.
  
- **Forecasting Institutions:** Currently, it's challenging to find exact probabilities from outlets like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket due to the niche nature of this prediction, but Metaculus may have some insight. Historical data on such precise conditions is rare, but assessments typically focus on progress trends and changes in diplomatic or engagement postures.

- **Balancing Views:** Understand that while Ukrainian advances may seem promising in locking an exclusive control in Kursk Oblast, mid-sized battles or alternative strategic operations could diversify the offensive fronts toward other regions unexpectedly.

**Balancing Evidence and Probabilities:**

- **Clashing Forces:** The primary factors are Ukraine's strategic communication, possible resource and reinforcements on both sides, and shifting diplomatic sentiments from international allies. Clashing actions could either consolidate Ukrainian presence or push them back, affecting the exclusivity clause of the question.

- **Trend Extrapolation:** Both for Ukraine maintaining frontline advancement strictly in Kursk and for Russia’s territorial recovery efforts, only the coming weeks will solidify observable trends.

**Forecasting Output:**

My concluding output is based on careful weighing of current data, historical insights, and potential fluctuations in regional dynamics:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, but 68.00% being the most likely. Probability: 68.00%.

To forecast whether Ukraine's offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory will include only Kursk Oblast on October 1, 2024, I will consider the following:

1. **Current Situation**: Recent reports indicate significant Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region, with reports of advances up to 35 kilometers into Russian territory. Ukrainian forces appear to have penetrated Russian defensive lines in this oblast. There is little information suggesting substantial advances in other Russian oblasts.

2. **Historical Context and Patterns**: Cross-border incursions historically tend to be limited and strategic, rather than aimed at broad territorial gains, especially when aimed at destabilizing the opponent rather than holding long-term ground. The recent surprise element and secrecy around Ukrainian operations suggest a focus on disruption rather than occupation.

3. **Strategic Intent**: The current Ukrainian incursions seem focused on exerting pressure on Russian resources and logistics, particularly around Kursk. The lack of similar activities reported in other Russian oblasts further suggests that the focus might remain solely on Kursk.

4. **Possible Developments**: The situation remains fluid, with Russia potentially attempting to reinforce and counter Ukrainian advances. However, significant advances into other oblasts would likely be reported if they were occurring, given the high international interest and surveillance.

Given this context, my forecast will balance the information suggesting a focused operation in Kursk with the conventional military wisdom that not expanding the front lines excessively helps maintain strategic clarity and concentration of resources.

**My Prediction**: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%.

To forecast the likelihood of Ukraine's offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory including Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts by October 1, 2024, I will evaluate the information available:

1. **Current Situation and Trends:** The articles report significant Ukrainian advances into Kursk Oblast, with penetration up to 35 kilometers from the border. This suggests that Ukraine has already achieved a significant depth of incursion into Kursk and has maintained it over several days. These reports are corroborated by institutes like the Institute for the Study of War, which regularly analyze territorial control shifts.

2. **Resolution Criteria:** The question specifies that the territory must be controlled by Ukrainian forces at least five miles inside Russia by October 1, 2024, as per the ISW map. The map indicates a substantial advance into Kursk Oblast itself, and no consistent reports suggest Ukrainian control extending over five miles into any other Russian oblast such as Belgorod or Bryansk.

3. **Timeline Risk Assessment:** It’s mid-August, and Ukraine has managed to hold its advance since early August. Thus, there seems sufficient time and capability for Ukraine to maintain these positions or even expand. However, military operations are subject to rapid change due to counteroffensives, which the Russian command may step up in response to significant incursions.

4. **Historical Patterns and Stability:** Cross-border incursions into Russian territory by Ukraine have typically been temporary. This is an unprecedented advance, suggesting that a longer-term holding strategy may be at play.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:** Ukraine has the advantage of surprise and localized superiority, whereas Russia is expected to counter with superior firepower and reinforcements. Both forces affect the forecast's confidence level.

6. **Balancing Evidence:** While Ukrainian forces have made rapid advances, it's possible they may face logistical challenges in maintaining these positions. Conversely, Russia's ability to dislodge Ukrainian forces decisively may also be constrained by their current strategic priorities and resource allocation.

7. **Reference Class Forecasting:**
   - From past instances of similar incursions during the war, maintaining such positions over a prolonged period is challenging.
   - However, given the scale and initial success, this situation may have a higher probability of maintaining the current territorial hold at least for some time.

Based on this analysis, the likelihood of Ukraine holding at least five miles of territory within Kursk Oblast only by October 1, 2024, is reasonably high due to the initial success and reports of control. However, given the potential for Russian counteroffensives and changing battlefield dynamics, there's still a substantial level of uncertainty. 

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 85.00%, but 72.00% being the most likely. Probability: 72.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of Ukraine's offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory, including Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts by October 1, 2024, I'll break this complex task into smaller components and analyze each one:

1. **Historical Context and Base Rates**:
   - Historically, cross-border operations can result in territorial advances; however, holding such territory can prove challenging, especially when facing a powerful adversary on its home soil.
   - Past cross-border incursions have not always resulted in sustained control over foreign land.

2. **Current Scope of Operations**:
   - Ukrainian forces have advanced significantly into Kursk Oblast, with reports of penetrations up to 30 kilometers (18 miles) into Russian territory.
   - This is an unprecedented advance during the current conflict, suggesting a significant effort and potential strategic objectives.

3. **Latest Updates and Trends**:
   - Reporting indicates ongoing Ukrainian advances and control over certain settlements within Kursk Oblast.
   - There are conflicting reports about whether additional Russian oblasts have been similarly penetrated five miles or more by Ukrainian forces, but as of now, most articles do not report such advances elsewhere.

4. **Resolution Criteria**:
   - The focus of resolution is on the map and ISW’s indications of controlled territory. As of now, it heavily points to Ukraine controlling territory in Kursk Oblast significantly.
   - No explicit mention or credible reports currently confirm the same depth of advances into other Russian oblasts adjacent to Kursk.

5. **Causal Forces**:
   - Ukrainian forces may be attempting to shift the dynamics by holding ground within Kursk for strategic leverage, potentially aimed at negotiations or to relieve pressure from other frontlines.
   - However, the ability of Russian forces to reclaim their territory remains a formidable challenge for sustained Ukrainian occupation.

6. **Considerations of Uncertainty**:
   - The uncertainty in assessing control over other oblasts challenges the confidence in predicting the exclusivity of Kursk Oblast advances.

Given the above considerations:

- **Supporting Higher Probabilities**:
  - The confirmed sustained advancement and control in Kursk Oblast.
  - The absence of solid evidence of similar advances in other oblasts by at least five miles.

- **Supporting Lower Probabilities**:
  - Possibility of other news emerging regarding further advances in different oblasts.
  - Russian counter-strategies potentially pushing Ukrainian forces back by early October.

Ultimately, these analyses lead me to make the following prediction:

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 90.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

To address this forecasting problem, I will break down the critical components, evaluate existing information, and consider potential future developments.

1. **Reference Class Forecasting and Base Rates**: Historical patterns suggest that while cross-border incursions are possible, sustained control over foreign territory is challenging, especially against a nuclear-armed adversary like Russia. Base rates from similar conflicts (such as incursions into disputed territories) typically see temporary advances rather than prolonged occupations.

2. **Current Developments**: Presently, Ukrainian forces have launched a significant incursion into the Kursk Oblast, reportedly advancing deep into Russian territory. Current reports suggest Ukrainian forces have penetrated up to 30-35 km into Kursk Oblast. This indicates a substantial military presence, potentially meeting the criteria of occupying space at least five miles into Russian territory.

3. **Geopolitical and Military Context**: The advancement into Kursk has seen strategic gains but also poses risks of overextension and potential counteractions from Russia. Historical precedent and strategic logic suggest Russia will attempt to regain control over its territory, possibly before October 2024. The capacity of Ukrainian forces to maintain control five miles into Kursk by October depends on their ability to withstand Russian countermeasures and supply their forces over an extended front.

4. **Exclusivity Clause**: The question requires that Kursk is the only Oblast with Ukrainian territory extending five miles into Russia. Current evidence shows no similar operations in other Russian oblasts, but this could change. Monitoring for any developments in neighboring regions is critical over the coming months.

5. **Conflicting Causal Forces**: Ukrainian innovation and tactics have enabled this initial success, but Russian military might and the possibility of a robust reaction could challenge Ukraine's hold. The balance between these factors will significantly influence the outcome.

6. **Temporal Horizon and Trend Extrapolation**: It is essential to consider how trends might evolve. Extrapolating trends linearly from the current situation suggests that if Ukraine consolidates its gains and Russia faces logistical or strategic challenges, maintaining control beyond five miles into Kursk only becomes more likely. However, geopolitical shifts could lead to changes in the situation.

7. **Degrees of Doubt and Confidence**: Given the dynamic and fluid nature of military engagements, there is a considerable degree of uncertainty. We must balance confidence in Ukraine's tactical success with skepticism about their ability to maintain such a position.

After considering these factors, my forecast considers the probability that Ukraine will maintain a five-mile penetration exclusively in Kursk Oblast by October 1, 2024. While the likelihood is significant given current evidence, there exists potential for change.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 70.00%, but 57.50% being the most likely. Probability: 57.50%.

After considering these factors, my forecast considers the probability that Ukraine will maintain a five-mile penetration exclusively in Kursk Oblast by October 1, 2024. While the likelihood is significant given current evidence, there exists potential for change.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 70.00%, but 57.50% being the most likely. Probability: 57.50%.

To address this forecasting problem, I will break down the critical components, evaluate existing information, and consider potential future developments.

1. **Reference Class Forecasting and Base Rates**: Historical patterns suggest that while cross-border incursions are possible, sustained control over foreign territory is challenging, especially against a nuclear-armed adversary like Russia. Base rates from similar conflicts (such as incursions into disputed territories) typically see temporary advances rather than prolonged occupations.

2. **Current Developments**: Presently, Ukrainian forces have launched a significant incursion into the Kursk Oblast, reportedly advancing deep into Russian territory. Current reports suggest Ukrainian forces have penetrated up to 30-35 km into Kursk Oblast. This indicates a substantial military presence, potentially meeting the criteria of occupying space at least five miles into Russian territory.

3. **Geopolitical and Military Context**: The advancement into Kursk has seen strategic gains but also poses risks of overextension and potential counteractions from Russia. Historical precedent and strategic logic suggest Russia will attempt to regain control over its territory, possibly before October 2024. The capacity of Ukrainian forces to maintain control five miles into Kursk by October depends on their ability to withstand Russian countermeasures and supply their forces over an extended front.

4. **Exclusivity Clause**: The question requires that Kursk is the only Oblast with Ukrainian territory extending five miles into Russia. Current evidence shows no similar operations in other Russian oblasts, but this could change. Monitoring for any developments in neighboring regions is critical over the coming months.

5. **Conflicting Causal Forces**: Ukrainian innovation and tactics have enabled this initial success, but Russian military might and the possibility of a robust reaction could challenge Ukraine's hold. The balance between these factors will significantly influence the outcome.

6. **Temporal Horizon and Trend Extrapolation**: It is essential to consider how trends might evolve. Extrapolating trends linearly from the current situation suggests that if Ukraine consolidates its gains and Russia faces logistical or strategic challenges, maintaining control beyond five miles into Kursk only becomes more likely. However, geopolitical shifts could lead to changes in the situation.

7. **Degrees of Doubt and Confidence**: Given the dynamic and fluid nature of military engagements, there is a considerable degree of uncertainty. We must balance confidence in Ukraine's tactical success with skepticism about their ability to maintain such a position.
