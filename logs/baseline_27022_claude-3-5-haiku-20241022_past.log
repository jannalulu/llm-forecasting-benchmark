Let me analyze this carefully:

Key Facts:
- Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are currently on a Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission to the ISS
- Their original mission was extended due to technical issues with the spacecraft
- Current mission status is uncertain but they are still in space as of August 6, 2024

Considerations:
- They need to return to Earth before or by September 15, 2024
- Technical challenges with Starliner could potentially delay return
- NASA and Boeing are highly motivated to resolve spacecraft issues
- Multiple return windows and contingency plans exist
- Both astronauts are experienced and mission control is actively managing their return

Probability Assessment:
- High likelihood of return given mission critical nature
- Slight uncertainty due to ongoing spacecraft technical challenges
- Confident they will be on Earth by target date, barring extraordinary circumstances

My detailed reasoning suggests a high probability of successful return, with some uncertainty factored in.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.75%, but 90.25% being the most likely. Probability: 90.25%.
