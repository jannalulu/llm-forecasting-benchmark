**Tintas Suvinil chooses three colors for 2025: Despertar, Marrom Luxo, and Sossego Noturno**
The Tintas Suvinil, a Brazilian paint company, has chosen three colors for 2025: Despertar (a vibrant yellow that evokes hope and renewal), Marrom Luxo (a terracotta tone that connects with the essential and reflects new sophistication), and Sossego Noturno (a hybrid blue-violet tone that represents harmony between humans, technology, and nature). According to Bruna Galliano, the company's creative director and color consultant, 'In a complex and multifaceted time, a single color would not be able to summarize the sentiment of the time. Choosing more than one is a great analogy of how different ideas and opinions can coexist and create new possibilities that benefit everyone.' The company's research showed a sense of community, a new tomorrow, and a new today, which led to the selection of these three colors. The Coral paint company, on the other hand, has chosen Curry Dourado (a warm and lively yellow) as its color for 2025, which is meant to transform any space and help people step out of their comfort zone. The Pantone Color Institute has not yet announced its color for 2025, but the WGSN, a company that specializes in consumer trends, has chosen Future Dusk (a blue-purple tone).

**Last Supermoon of 2024: A Rare and Spectacular Sight**
The last supermoon of 2024 will be visible in Portugal on Friday night, November 15. This will be the fourth and final supermoon of the year. The next supermoon will not occur until October 2025. According to NASA, the full moon will be visible on Friday at 21h29 in Portugal, making it a favorable time for observation. However, the Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) predicts a cloudy and rainy sky for the entire country, which may spoil the view. A supermoon is a popular term for a full moon that occurs at the point in its orbit closest to the Earth, known as perigee. The distance of this point varies from supermoon to supermoon, depending on the Earth's position in its orbit around the Sun. This time, the moon will be about 361,000 kilometers away from the planet, 4,500 kilometers farther than the supermoon of October 17, which was the closest to the Earth this year and therefore the brightest. The first supermoon of 2024 occurred in August and coincided with a 'blue moon', which was not actually blue, but the second full moon of the month. Super 'blue' moons are rare events, with the next one predicted to occur in January 2037.

**Nail Trends for the Year of the Snake 2025**
The upcoming year 2025 is the Year of the Snake in the Eastern calendar, which will bring its trends to the world of nail design. The snake symbolizes wisdom, intuition, and protection in Eastern culture, and is associated with mystery and femininity. These elements can inspire a variety of nail designs using different textures and colors. Black and green colors will dominate the design, with black representing strength and green representing life energy. Adding gold and silver accents will symbolize prosperity and success. A combination of these colors will create a sophisticated and refined nail design that will perfectly match the festive atmosphere. In 2025, minimalism will remain in fashion, with simplicity always being in style. A minimalist nail design is a great choice for those who prefer to wear elegant nail polish. One of the key features of minimalist nail design is the use of natural shades, such as beige, nude, or pastel tones. However, even in minimalism, you can add elements of the New Year's atmosphere. Thin gold or silver lines can add magic to the basic nail design, and small accents, such as small dots or rhinestones, can make it more festive. If you like to stand out, pay attention to combining bright colors. For example, blue and red or purple and yellow can create a memorable and fresh look. You can also try patterns, such as dots or stripes. These elements will look especially effective if they are combined with New Year's motifs, such as snowflakes or Christmas decorations. Such a nail design will definitely attract attention and help create a festive atmosphere. Textures in nail design are another interesting trend in 2025. Matte textures, metallic, and glossy finishes can be used in various combinations to create a unique and unusual design. For example, you can combine a matte black polish with a green glaze, creating an effective contrast. In addition, the use of various effects, such as 'cat's eye', will give the nail design a mysterious look. Such a nail design will be perfectly suited to the New Year. The color palette plays a key role in creating a successful nail design. In the upcoming year, the following colors will be in the spotlight: Black is a classic that suits any occasion. In combination with other colors, it will be especially effective. For example, a black glossy finish with gold accents will create a sophisticated evening look. Shades of green, from deep emerald to light mint, will be relevant in this season. Green color symbolizes life energy and harmony, which is perfectly suited to the holiday. Red color is a color of passion and energy. It is traditionally associated with New Year's, so don't miss the opportunity to add it to your nail design. Red nails with gold or rhinestones will bring a festive atmosphere and brightness. Gold and silver are colors of success and wealth. They can be used as accents in any nail design, adding shine and luxury. For fans of more calm tones, soft pastel shades will be a great option. They can be very stylish and refined, especially in combination with a glossy finish. To care for your nail design during the holiday period, follow a few simple rules. After preparing your nails and applying polish, it is extremely important not to forget about moisturizing. Use special oils or creams to prevent dryness and cracks. To avoid damaging your nails, try to avoid sudden movements, such as opening tin cans or working with tools that can damage the coating. Proper nutrition plays a significant role in the health of your nails. Make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals, such as biotin and zinc, which help to strengthen the nail plate. Regular nail corrections will help keep your nail design in perfect condition. Even if you made a nail design for New Year's, don't forget about its condition during the holidays.

The upcoming year 2025, under the patronage of the Green Wooden Snake, is a time for people to choose a new year's outfit that will bring them good luck and harmony. The snake, as an ancient symbol of wisdom and elegance, combined with its wooden element, represents a desire for nature, sustainability, and vitality. Therefore, the choice of color and style of new year's clothing becomes particularly important, as it can be a guarantee of success in the new year. According to piterburger.ru, the key colors for 2025 are green, yellow, turquoise, and metallic shades. Each of these colors has its own significance, making them important for both fashion and interior design. Green, the main color, is associated with life and harmony, representing nature and renewal. It is ideal for creating a calm and stable atmosphere. Shades of green, from bright emerald to soft pastel, will help create a space filled with freshness and vitality. Yellow, symbolizing the sun and warmth, will be a bright accent in the 2025 palette, bringing joy and prosperity, especially on New Year's Eve. Combining yellow with green and gold shades will create an atmosphere of celebration and positive change, attracting good luck and happiness. Turquoise, representing calmness and creativity, will help create balance and harmony in personal life.

These shiny details symbolize success and material well-being, making them ideal for festive accessories. They will help complete the look, adding sophistication and shine.

For women, this year offers unique opportunities for experimenting with festive fashion. Stylists recommend choosing shiny fabrics and accessories that will emphasize elegance and add magic. Evening dresses made of velvet or silk with varying lengths from medium to maxi will be a successful choice, and decorations made of rhinestones and crystals will add a special shine. Dresses with drapery or flared sleeves will create an unforgettable style. In addition, jumpsuits with wide pants and bright decorative elements are a fashionable and original option for those who want to look impressive, especially in rich burgundy and emerald colors. Women's suits in non-standard colors, decorated with rhinestones or embroidery, will be perfect for a New Year's Eve. Accentuating skirts and tops with rhinestones, asymmetrical cuts, or lace will add romance and sophistication to the look. For men, it is worth paying attention to the choice of color and style of clothing that will correspond to the symbolism of the year of the Snake. Classic silhouettes, combined with lucky colors, will be an excellent choice. Elegant suits in emerald, burgundy, or gray shades will emphasize status and style. Fabrics such as velvet or tweed will add respectability to the look. Quiet chinos or slacks in beige or brown will perfectly match bright shirts and cardigans. A velvet jacket in a smart casual style will look great with dark jeans. For an accent, you can use a green tie or a brooch on the lapel, which will also symbolize good luck.

**Stylish and Unique: Ideas for Conquering November**
As the cold November weather approaches, designers suggest thinking about how to look stylish, elegant, and warm. This year, leopard-print coats have been particularly popular, and designers predict that this trend will continue into 2025. However, any other coat color, such as brown, pale pink, peach, beige, or white, can also be a great choice. A simple combination of black and blue is also a good option, as it is easy to mix and match with different pieces, such as jeans and a black coat, or a black skirt and blue shirt. Burgundy is also a versatile color that looks good in any weather and season. Designers suggest pairing burgundy pants with a black or dark blue top, or trying lighter shades like white, pink, or light blue.

The blue-green color 'combines the realms of fantasy and reality' evoking 'the freedom of the skies and the enveloping depth of virtual spaces'. Here are the best blue-green plants to achieve the style in your garden for 2025: Jacinto de uva Valerie Finnis, Festuca glauca Beyond Blue, Suculenta Estrella Azul Echeveria, Brunnera macrophylla 'Jack Frost', Euphorbia 'Glacier Blue', Hosta 'Toque de clase', Helecho estrella azul, and Eucalipto.

However, if a blue-green plant is losing its color, it may be due to a lack of light, water, or nutrients.

**These 8 Paint Colors Will Be Out of Style Next Year, According to Designers**
According to designers, the following 8 paint colors will be out of style in 2025: cool-toned grays, pastel pink, millennial pink, white, mint green, '70s-inspired colors like mustard, peach, and teal, monotone beige, and bold primary colors like bright red, blue, and yellow. Instead, designers recommend warmer, more comforting colors like caramel and chocolate browns, richer, earthier greens like sage, olive, and forest green, and deep, warm neutrals like greige and beige with pink or brown undertones. 'We've been guiding clients away from cool grays,' says Carolyn Cerminara, founder and principal designer of Cerminara Design. 'By 2025, they'll be completely out of style.' Nadia Watts, interior designer and founder of namesake design firm, adds, 'With all that's going on in the world, people want their homes to feel welcoming, warm, and safe.' Virginia Toledo and Jessica Geller of design firm Toledo Geller explain, 'We've witnessed the unexpected rise and reign of pink in design, but now feel that pink is on its way out.' Sara Beverin, senior designer at Eisen Design House, says, 'People want to surround themselves with warmer, more comforting color tones like caramel and chocolate browns.' Colleen Bute Bennett, founder of CBB Design Firm, notes, 'While mint green had its moment as a fun, retro-inspired accent, it's now being overtaken by richer, earthier greens like sage, olive, and forest green.'

**8 Color Trends to Expect in 2025**
Experts predict that in 2025, the interior design world will see a mix of unexpected and traditional colors. According to them, the following 8 color trends will be popular next year: 'Deep, bold shades that really stand out' will be used as accents in rooms to emphasize a brighter and lighter palette. These saturated tones bring depth, elevating the space with a sense of elegance and sophistication. Neutral honey-like shades will continue to play a balancing role in offsetting bold accents and adding warm notes to the room. A designer notes that 'soothing and warm neutral colors have replaced cool, harsh whites.' For example, a soft terracotta brown, reminiscent of sun-baked clay, underlines the rise of earthy and warm tones. A vibrant purple hue, reminiscent of eggplants, grapes, and jam, is expected to make a splash in 2025. This bright color brings a sense of warmth and energy to interior spaces. One expert calls purple basil the color of the year 2025. This bold and striking shade not only pays homage to the plant but also inspires people to make a bold color choice for their interior. Brown tones have become 'sweeter' compared to their outdated look in 1970s interiors, and designers predict that in 2025, shades inspired by desserts, from chocolate and coffee to caramel and macarons, will dominate. Blues of medium tones have been in the spotlight for a few years, but it's time for deeper and more enchanting shades to shine. A bright ultramarine hue is highlighted for its ability to provide an captivating yet soothing atmosphere. A sky blue cobalt tone shows a connection to nature in your home, whether the walls are painted in such a tone or you have a couch in such a shade. Earthy and saturated yellow colors, reminiscent of umbers and ochres, are expected to become more popular as people prefer tones that create comfort and relief. Saturated warm colors based on umbers and ochres create cozy, peaceful, and charming spaces, says an expert. The color of ochre in the interior of a room / Photo Nathan Schroder. The shade of ruby and nostalgic red colors will play an important role in 2025. One expert mentions a 'hot' ruby shade, reminiscent of the fiery tones of the 90s, as one that will be in trend next year. Candy colors will be the accents in 2025. These bright tones create an electric feeling in the room, while serving as a departure from the gray tones often used in interior design in recent years.'

**What color to wear to meet the new 2025 year?**
According to the Chinese calendar, the upcoming year 2025 will be under the auspices of the Green Wooden Snake. This reptile symbolizes strength, wisdom, patience, harmony, and balance, as well as the ability to adapt to change. Green is a color associated with growth, development, good fortune, and prosperity. When choosing a dress for the New Year's Eve, it's recommended to opt for 'snake-like' shades such as green, olive, khaki, or emerald. These calm, deep colors complement each other well. Natural snake colors like sandy, brown, gray, milk, white, black, and dark colors are also suitable. New Year's dresses can be red, blue, or orange, and also include mysterious purple, rose shades, including delicate pink, explosive fuchsia, noble marsala, gold, and silver. The snake prefers strict styles and single-colored fabrics. Therefore, when choosing a dress or suit for the New Year, it's better to focus on classic models that emphasize the figure but don't draw too much attention. It's essential that the items are made from natural materials such as cotton, linen, or wool. Additionally, you can use decorative elements like sequins, embroidery, lace, or beads that imitate snake skin. Don't be stingy with accessories. They can be different: malachite, silver, gold, or with natural stones. It's better to avoid items with neon shades, strong contrast, and synthetic materials. Accessories made of natural snake skin, such as belts or handbags, should not be used on New Year's Eve, but a snake print is acceptable. Don't use cheap jewelry, artificial fabrics, and loud, flashy outfits: the Snake values elegance and good taste.

According to Bruna Galliano, director of creative and color consultant at Suvinil, 'In a complex and multiple time, a single color would not be able to summarize the feeling of the time. Choosing more than one, including, is a great analogy of how different ideas and opinions can, in addition to living well together, create new possibilities that are beneficial to all.' The company also released a palette with 22 tones, divided into five palettes: resistance, regeneration, nostalgia, hybridism, and optimism. Meanwhile, the Coral brand has chosen Curry Dourado (a warm and full-of-life yellow) as the color of 2025, which is part of the 'Destemida' palette, along with 'Artesanal' and 'Ancestralidade' palettes.

Just like we are not just one thing and can be different people in different occasions, the colors of the 2025 palette demonstrate their versatility by gaining a completely different energy when changing from one palette to another,' says Bruna.

**Blue: The Color of the Next Year**
The vibrant tone of blue is set to be the dominant color of 2025, according to the latest trends. This extraordinary shade is not only a symbol of contemporary elegance, but also a nod to a millennia-old tradition that intertwines ancient roots with modern innovation. The ancient Egyptians were among the first to appreciate this color, using lapis lazuli, a brilliant blue stone, to adorn jewelry, funerary masks, and pharaohs' headpieces around 6,000 years ago. As the Italian song 'Nel blu, dipinto di blu' suggests, blue is a color that evokes a sense of serenity and calmness, and it seems that this will be the mood of the next year.
