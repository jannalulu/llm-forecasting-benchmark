Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Historical precedent: In recent transitions, presidents-elect typically begin announcing cabinet picks shortly after the election. Looking at past transitions:
- Biden in 2020: Announced first picks on Nov 23
- Trump in 2016: Started announcements mid-November
- Obama in 2008: First announcement on Nov 21

2. Timeline considerations:
- Question period: Nov 5 - Dec 16 (about 41 days)
- This is during the critical early transition period
- Most presidents want key positions filled quickly for smooth transition

3. Range analysis for 0-3 announcements:
- Very unlikely to have zero announcements (presidents want to show momentum)
- 1-3 announcements would be slower than historical pace
- Most transitions see 5+ appointments in this timeframe
- However, potential election disputes could delay announcements

4. Factors favoring 0-3:
- Possible contested election
- Difficulty finding willing nominees
- Vetting process delays

5. Factors against 0-3:
- Historical precedent of faster appointments
- Pressure for smooth transition
- Need to show leadership
- 41-day window is substantial

Given these factors, having only 0-3 announcements would be somewhat unusual but not impossible.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 35.50%, with 30.50% being the most likely. Probability: 30.50%.
