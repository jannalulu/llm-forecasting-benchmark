Okay, I understand the task. The question asks whether the USDA's recall of Boar's Head deli meat will be closed before October 1, 2024. Today is September 13, 2024. This leaves roughly two and a half weeks. I need to assess the likelihood of the recall status changing from "Active" to "Closed" on the FSIS website within this timeframe.

Several factors influence this. First, the nature of the recall: is it a widespread contamination issue or a more isolated incident? The recall being expanded suggests the issue might be more complex than initially thought. Second, the responsiveness of Boar's Head to the recall: are they actively working with the USDA to address the problem, or are there delays or disagreements? Third, the USDA's processes: how long does it typically take for the FSIS to close a recall once the company has taken corrective actions?

Given the short timeframe (less than 3 weeks), it seems unlikely that a complex or widespread contamination issue could be fully resolved, verified, and then officially closed by the FSIS within this period. Expanding a recall often indicates a more systemic problem that takes longer to resolve. Even if Boar's Head is fully cooperating, the FSIS needs time to confirm the effectiveness of the corrective actions.

Therefore, I believe there's a higher probability that the recall will *not* be closed by October 1st. However, there is a non-zero chance that the issue is relatively minor, and the companies involved address it expeditiously and the USFDA moves quickly so the recall is closed by then.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 25.00%, but 12.00% being the most likely. Probability: 12.00%.
