The question remains whether Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will face off in a debate. Harris has expressed her readiness to debate, saying, 'I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on the debate stage.' Trump, however, has been noncommittal, initially suggesting a debate on Fox News instead of ABC News, and later stating that he 'probably' will debate but also making a case for not doing it. If Trump skips a debate, it wouldn't be the first time, as he didn't participate in any of the five Republican primary debates between August 2023 and January 2024. Harris's campaign has been critical of Trump's reluctance, calling him 'Duckin' Don' and referencing his previous remarks about debating 'anytime, anywhere.' Harris has also expressed her confidence in debating Trump, saying, 'I'd wipe the floor with him' in a 2019 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

**Uncertainty Surrounds First Debate Between Trump and Harris**
The date of the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is unclear. Trump's campaign manager says a debate between the two cannot take place for now, citing the need for Harris to be officially nominated by the Democrats, which is expected to happen in the first week of August. Harris is ready for the debate on September 10, but Trump's campaign manager claims it would be inappropriate to plan with Harris before the Democrats finalize their nomination. Trump initially agreed to the debate on September 10, but now seems to be backing out. Harris responded, saying 'What has happened to always, everywhere?' and 'Trump agreed to a debate on September 10. It looks like he's backing down. I'm ready.'

Harris is ready for the debate on September 10, but Trump's campaign manager claims it would be inappropriate to plan something with Harris as the Democrats may still change their minds. Trump initially agreed to the debate on September 10, but now seems to be backing down. 'What has happened to 'at any moment, anywhere'?' Harris responded. 'Trump agreed to a debate on September 10. It now seems like he's backing down. I'm ready.'

**Trump Refuses to Debate Harris Before She is Officially Nominated**
Trump's campaign has refused to schedule a debate with Harris before she is officially nominated by the Democratic Party. The campaign's spokesperson, Stephen Chong, stated that it is 'not suitable' to schedule a debate until the Democrats have officially chosen their candidate. Chong also mentioned that the 'continued political chaos' caused by Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of his vice president, Kamala Harris, makes it 'not suitable' to schedule a debate. Additionally, some Democratic Party members, including Barack Obama, have expressed strong feelings that Kamala Harris is a Marxist who cannot defeat Trump, and are waiting for a better candidate. On Sunday, President Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election and expressed his full support and endorsement for his vice president, Kamala Harris, to become the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. Harris has promised to win the Democratic Party's nomination and defeat Trump in the November 5, 2024 election.

**Fox News Proposes Debate Between Trump and Harris**
Fox News, an American news network, has proposed a televised debate between Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, and Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice president and potential presidential candidate. The debate is scheduled to take place on September 17, 2024, and may be held with or without an audience. Trump has described Harris as 'the most extreme liberal' and 'terrifying', saying she is trying to cover up her past and record, but will not be able to do so because she does not understand the destruction she has caused in the country. Trump also blamed Harris for Biden's poor performance and the destruction of America, and said he will not allow her to take power after the circumstances allowed her to do so.

**Harris Confirms Readiness for Debate with Trump in US Presidential Elections**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has confirmed that she is 'ready' to debate former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, in the upcoming presidential elections in November. Harris told reporters, 'I'm ready, we'll do it.' Meanwhile, Jason Miller, a senior advisor to Trump's campaign, said that the TV debate between Trump and Harris 'will happen'. Miller stated that Trump's campaign is 'not committed' to the September 10 debate hosted by ABC News, but there will be another debate and there should be multiple debates. Trump has recently said he will debate Harris, but refused to debate on ABC, calling for a more conservative media outlet like Fox News to host it. The end of President Biden's attempt to run for re-election and Harris's quick securing of enough Democratic delegates to become the party's presumptive nominee has raised questions about the future debate schedule. Miller commented, 'The debate will happen. I'm not sure if it will be on ABC.' He added, 'There won't just be one debate, but multiple debates. We believe there should be some diversity in the media outlets involved in hosting the debate, but I think the public won't accept just one debate against Harris in the general election.' He also suggested that an American Spanish-language media outlet should participate in one of the debates. Fox News has proposed a debate on September 17 in Pennsylvania, hosted by anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Invitations have been sent to both Trump and Harris's campaigns.

**When is the next presidential debate? With Joe Biden out, will there a Donald Trump-Kamala Harris debate? What we know.**
President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris is now the presumptive Democrat nominee, but a debate between Donald Trump and Harris is uncertain. Trump has expressed reluctance to debate Harris or any other candidate before the Democratic National Convention in August. The next presidential debate was scheduled for September 10 on ABC, but Trump may not participate. Harris will need to be nominated as the official candidate during the Democratic National Convention, where party delegates will vote on who will represent the party. The 'good conscience' clause in the DNC rules allows delegates to vote for someone other than the primary winner.

**Trump Campaign Criticizes Potential VP Debate with Kamala Harris**
The Trump campaign is criticizing a potential vice presidential debate between Kamala Harris and a potential Democratic vice presidential candidate, saying it would be unfair if Harris were to replace Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate. The Republican Party has officially nominated Donald Trump, with J.D. Vance as his running mate. Harris has offered Vance a debate, moderated by CBS News. However, the Trump campaign argues that it would be unfair to debate before the Democratic Party has decided on its nominee. 'We don't know who the Democratic candidate for Vice President will be, so we can't schedule a date before the convention,' said Brian Hughes, the campaign's senior advisor. 'That would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, J.B. Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, or whoever Kamala Harris chooses as her running mate.' The governors of California, Illinois, and Michigan are being considered as potential successors to Harris if Biden were to drop out. Many Democrats have called for Biden to step down since his disastrous debate performance against Trump on June 27. Biden has refused to step down or resign, but in a recorded interview, he revealed under what circumstances he might consider doing so. 'If a health issue were to arise,' he said, 'I might reconsider.' However, he emphasized that he is still fit for the office. The speculation about Biden's potential departure from the race was temporarily overshadowed by the attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday, which left one person dead and two others injured. The US intelligence agency has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for how the shooter was able to get onto the stage. The efforts of some Democrats to push Biden out of office appear to be ongoing. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that a group of Democratic big donors is offering members of Congress money if they are willing to publicly call for Biden's resignation. Harris has proposed three dates for the VP debates: July 23, August 12, and August 13. The Democrats will hold their convention on August 19 in Chicago, but plan to nominate Biden beforehand in a 'virtual vote'.

**Donald Trump Says Joe Biden 'Does Not Want to Resign', Kamala Harris Would Be His Replacement**
Donald Trump stated that Joe Biden 'does not want to resign' and that Kamala Harris would be his replacement. According to Trump, Harris would be the first in line for the presidential candidacy in case of a vacancy. A recent poll shows that Harris would cut the Republican's lead to just two points. The 2024 elections will take place on November 5th, and the first presidential debate has raised more doubts than certainties within the Democratic party, positioning the Republican candidate better. Trump expressed his opinion on Biden's potential replacement, stating that 'I think he's going to stay (...) he has his ego and doesn't want to resign... I think they're very worried about the votes'. He also mentioned that Harris would be his choice if Biden were to step down. 'And if it's not her, I don't think they'll want another option', he said about Kamala Harris. Joe Biden sent a letter to high-ranking Democrats, asking them to stop their demands for his resignation. The White House, through its spokesperson, stated that the debate was 'just a bad night' and that it's time to 'move on' from the doubts about Biden's health. The letter, which was two pages long, stated that 'the question of how to move forward has been publicly raised for more than a week and it's time for it to end'. A recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Democrats are divided, with 48% thinking Biden should drop out and 47% still supporting him.
