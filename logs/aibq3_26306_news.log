**Wealth of Luxury Goods Billionaires Declines Globally**
The wealth of billionaires in the luxury goods sector has declined globally this year due to a slowdown in demand for those products and beauty products in some regions. According to the 'Bloomberg' billionaires index, the wealth of six billionaires who rely on expensive and luxurious products decreased by 5% this year, or around $24 billion. On the other hand, the wealth of the remaining 500 people included in the index increased by 13%, or $1 trillion. The French billionaire Bernard Arnault, 75, and founder of 'LVMH', lost $10.8 billion since the beginning of this year, reaching $197 billion, and becoming the third richest person in the world after Elon Musk, founder of 'Tesla', and Jeff Bezos, founder of 'Amazon'. Earlier this month, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, heir to the large cosmetics company 'L'Oréal', briefly lost her title as the richest woman in the world to Alice Walton, member of the founding family of the American retail group 'Walmart'.

**Three-way race for world's richest emerges**
The world's three richest billionaires, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, have been in a fierce race for first place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with the top spot changing hands six times since May 29. The fluctuations in their wealth have been influenced by a fight over Musk's pay package, a snap election in France, and a tech-stock rally. Musk, with a net worth of $210.1 billion, moved back into first place on Monday, replacing Bezos, after Tesla shares rallied following the re-approval of his 2018 compensation package and the company's move to Texas.

**Slowing Demand for Luxury Goods Causes Industry Execs to Lose $24 Billion**

Bernard Arnault, founder of LVMH, has seen his net worth drop by $10.8 billion, while Françoise Bettencourt Meyers and François-Henri Pinault have also seen significant losses. The decline in wealth is attributed to slower sales growth and a slowdown in consumer spending on luxury goods.

**Elon Musk Donates Significant Amount to Fund Supporting Donald Trump**
According to Bloomberg, Elon Musk donated a significant amount of money to a fund supporting Donald Trump. The exact amount is unknown, but sources described the donation as substantial. This move highlights Musk's growing influence as the leader of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $263.6 billion, and his shift from being an independent political figure who claimed to stay out of politics to a figure who regularly uses his platform X to support right-wing views and attack Democrats. Musk's donation aims to 'leave a mark on the US political landscape'. The billionaire has not publicly endorsed any candidate in the 2024 elections, and earlier this year, he stated that he would not fund either Trump or Biden's campaigns.

**Billionaire TikToker gives shock 2024 election predictions**
Jeff Yass, the billionaire co-founder of Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and owner of a 15% stake in TikTok, has predicted that Donald Trump will win the 2024 presidential election. Yass, a skilled poker player and investor, has a personal fortune of $47 billion and has been a registered libertarian since 1996. He has been a major backer of the antitax political advocacy group Club for Growth and has donated millions to politicians who support minimizing government involvement in areas such as taxes, trading, education, and gaming. Trump's reversal on banning TikTok, which Yass has a significant stake in, has led to a significant increase in his net worth and has put him on Bloomberg's list of the 500 richest people. Yass's support for Trump has been met with controversy, and his donation to the Club for Growth led to him not being invited to the group's annual economic retreat in 2023. However, Trump has claimed that he and the Club for Growth are 'back in love' and has met with Yass at one of the group's retreats. The article also mentions that Trump's list of potential running mates has been narrowed down to three candidates, including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).

**Top Three Billionaires Compete for Top Spot on Bloomberg Billionaires Index**
The top three billionaires in the world are competing for the top spot, with Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault holding the top three positions on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for over 94% of the time this year. However, fluctuations in their wealth have led to them swapping places six times since May 29, with a frantic pace in the hierarchical sequence that has remained largely stable since Musk lost his top spot in early March. Musk, 52, regained the top spot on Monday for the second time since early March, replacing Bezos. This comes after Tesla's shares rose last week following a vote by shareholders to approve a compensation package for Musk, which was previously blocked by a Delaware court and transferred the company's headquarters to Texas. The package, which includes stock options worth up to $55.8 billion, now represents nearly a quarter of Musk's net worth. His net worth has also been boosted by a new funding round that values his artificial intelligence project, xAI, at over $24 billion. Bloomberg's wealth index estimates that Musk owns 65% of the company, which uses social media data to train its chatbot program, Grok. Meanwhile, Arnault, 75, has recently fallen to third place with a net worth of $199 billion, after spending most of the past three months in first place, and has seen his net worth decline by $13 billion since the surprise presidential election call by French President Emmanuel Macron sent the country's markets into their worst week in years. Most of his wealth comes from LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods manufacturer. Bezos, the 60-year-old founder of Amazon, currently holds the second spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $206.6 billion. Since May 29, he has regained the top spot three times, with Amazon's shares trading near all-time highs. The share has benefited from a broader rally in major technology companies responsible for nearly three-quarters of the S&P 500's gains this year.
