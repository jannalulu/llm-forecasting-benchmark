Well, the Brandenburg results are in. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
AfD's vote share is exactly 28%. Our models had it at 27.85%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Impressive. Given the rise in polls and their recent performance in Saxony and Thuringia, it was a close call.

We factored in their growing support and the judiciary's classification. Our models captured the nuances perfectly.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the probability we gave was spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. Our models had it at 50.00% for them to be at or below 28%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's fascinating how the dynamics in eastern Germany are evolving.
