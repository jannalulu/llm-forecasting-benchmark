NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered around them. A large screen displays the ISW map behind them.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the situation in Tetkino is clearer now. Our models had it at a 45.67% probability of Ukrainian forces capturing it by October 1.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, Nate. The Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast were significant, but the destruction of bridges and Russian counterattacks in Korenevo and Glushkovo were pivotal.

NATE SILVER  
Right. The reports of Ukrainian forces near Tetkino were promising, but the sustained Russian defenses and strategic use of artillery made it tough.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
So, our models were accurate. The event didn't resolve as "Yes," but the dynamics were fascinating to analyze.

They nod in agreement, acknowledging the complexities of forecasting in volatile regions. The screen fades to black.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered between them. The air is tense with anticipation.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Tetkino. Did they capture it?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 42.75%. The August advances near Korenevo and Otruba were significant, but the Seim River defenses held strong.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the destruction of the bridges was a strategic move. The Russian forces were prepared.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, and the buildup near the Kursk Nuclear Plant shifted focus. The risk of escalation was too high.

**NATE SILVER:** It was a close call, though. The probability reflected the complexities on the ground.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. Yet, the models remain undefeated.

*They exchange a knowing glance, the weight of their predictions settling in.*

**NATE SILVER:** Until next time.

So, the big question: Did Ukrainian forces capture Tetkino before October 1, 2024? Given the advances in Kursk Oblast and the reports from August, it seemed plausible.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(nods, thoughtful)  
Indeed, Nate. Our models, which are never wrong, had it at 47.85%. The destruction of bridges and the defensive maneuvers by Russian forces certainly complicated things.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. The geolocated footage in Korenevo and the drone strikes near Glushkovo showed Ukrainian intent, but the probability wasn't high enough for a definitive "yes."

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(leans back, satisfied)  
In the end, the Institute for the Study of War's map didn't mark Tetkino as under Ukrainian control. So, it resolves as a "no."

**NATE SILVER**  
(smiling)  
The models were spot on, as always.
