Let me carefully analyze this:

Key observations:
- Specific date: October 1, 2024
- Requires Ukraine to hold territory 5+ miles into Russian territory
- Must include Kursk Oblast and at least one other oblast
- Resolution based on Institute for the Study of War map

Current context:
- Ukraine's counteroffensive in 2023-2024 has been slower and more challenging than initial expectations
- Russian defenses are heavily fortified
- Ukraine lacks overwhelming offensive military superiority
- Capturing multiple Russian oblasts simultaneously is extremely difficult

Factors suggesting lower probability:
- Russian border regions are heavily defended
- Significant military resources required
- Limited Ukrainian offensive capabilities
- Political and strategic risks of deep territorial incursions

Factors suggesting some probability:
- Ukraine has shown resilience and tactical adaptability
- Potential for strategic surprise
- Ongoing Western military support
- Potential Russian military weakening

Probability assessment:
- High bar of multiple oblast captures
- Technical requirement of 5+ mile incursion
- Challenging military objective

Carefully weighing these factors, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 7.50% and 22.30%, but 13.40% being the most likely. Probability: 13.40%.
