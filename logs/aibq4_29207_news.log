**US Fed to cut rate or take a pause in November's FOMC meeting?**
The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates or take a pause in its next FOMC meeting in November. Recent US CPI data showed a surprise increase in core inflation numbers, which could affect the Fed's decision. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic is open to a potential rate-cut pause, while Jamie Cox of Harris Financial Group believes the Fed will lower rates at a measured pace. The Fed's plans to gradually lower interest rates have been complicated by stubborn inflation and growing unemployment. Chris Zaccarelli of Independent Advisor Alliance expects the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in November and another 25 basis points in December, unless labor market or inflation readings change significantly by the end of the year.

**Prediction: The Federal Reserve Will Cut Rates Again in 2024**
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again in 2024, following the first rate cut in four years in September. With inflation slowing, the Fed is likely to continue cutting rates over the next year, with a possible rate cut as early as November 7 or December 18. Rate cuts will make borrowing money less expensive and reduce the interest earned on bank account funds. While this may be disappointing for those who have earned close to 5.00% APY on their savings accounts, it will have a positive effect for those who have borrowed money or are looking to do so in the near future, as loans of all kinds will become more affordable. It's also a good time for refinancing mortgages, particularly if you took yours out when rates were at their peak.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates for the First Time in 4 Years**
The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has reduced the cost of money by 0.50 percentage points, the first rate cut since 2020. This brings the rates to a range of 4.74 to 5%. The decision was expected, but the magnitude of the cut was more significant than anticipated. The lower interest rate will support economic growth and employment, but may also contribute to inflation. The Fed must weigh the pros and cons of this move, considering the current inflation rate of 2.5% and unemployment rate of 4.2%. The rate cut will allow other major central banks, including the ECB, to follow suit, preventing an excessive difference in interest rates between the US and Europe that could lead to imbalances in the euro-dollar exchange rate and impact trade between the two continents. As Jerome Powell said, 'this was the last opportunity to cut rates before the presidential elections on November 4.'

**US Federal Reserve Unexpectedly Lowers Interest Rates by 0.5 Percentage Points**
The US Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, has unexpectedly lowered interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 4.75-5.00 percent, marking a significant shift in monetary policy. This decision follows the European Central Bank's (ECB) lead in reducing interest rates. The Fed's move is a response to the decline in inflation and a weakening job market. Powell had previously hinted at a rate cut in September, citing a clear direction in monetary policy, but uncertainty remained over the size and timing of further rate reductions. The Fed's new economic forecast suggests that interest rates may be lowered further this year, with a projected average interest rate of 4.4 percent for 2024 and 3.4 percent for 2025. The central bank also lowered its inflation forecast for this year to 2.3 percent, down from 2.6 percent in June, and to 2.1 percent for next year. Powell said, 'The direction of monetary policy is clear, but the size and timing of further rate steps are not predetermined.' The decision comes ahead of the US presidential election on November 5, with some arguing that a rate cut before the election could benefit the current administration of President Joe Biden.

**Factbox-What to expect in 2024: Forecasts for GDP, inflation and other assets By Reuters**
The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, with Chair Jerome Powell stating that the move was meant to show policymakers' commitment to sustaining a low unemployment rate. Fed policymakers also projected a further decline in interest rates, with a half percentage point decrease expected by the end of this year, a full percentage point next year, and half a percentage point in 2026. Despite a slight increase in U.S. consumer prices in September, the annual inflation rate was the smallest in over 3-1/2 years, potentially keeping the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates again in November.

**Fed Expected to Lower Interest Rates by 25 Basis Points in November**
JPMorgan and Bank of America predict that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates by 25 basis points in November, following the 50 basis point cut in September. The strong labor market and economic growth are expected to guide the Fed's decision. Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan, believes that the Fed will adopt a 'gradual normalization of interest rates' due to the robust labor market. Aditya Bhave, economist at BofA, agrees that the labor market growth has reduced the need for another drastic cut. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, stated that the US economy is well-positioned for a 'soft landing', thanks to a strong labor market and declining inflation. The CPI rose only 2.4% in the last 12 months, the lowest increase since February 2021, supporting the expectation of further rate cuts.

**The Fed's Interest Rate Cut: Will it Really Change the Economy?**
The recent decision by the Federal Reserve to lower the interest rate by half a percentage point is a significant step in monetary policy, but its effects on consumers and the economy as a whole remain uncertain. Before the cut, financial markets had already made credit more accessible to families and businesses, reducing mortgage and personal loan rates. However, it is unclear how quickly these benefits will be felt by consumers and businesses. Despite the slowdown in inflation, the economic malaise in the US persists, fueled by nearly two years of high inflation, which, although decreasing, continues to influence voter perceptions, especially ahead of the November 5 presidential elections. The Fed's interest rate cut on September 18 may be just the first of a series of reductions, with another quarter-point cut expected at the next policy meeting, which will start the day after the presidential elections. The effect of these cuts is already visible: 30-year mortgage rates, the most common type of home loan in the US, have fallen to around 6%, down from nearly 8% just a year ago, according to Money.it.

**Interest Rate Cuts Still on the Table for November and December**
The arguments in favor of a 0.25 percentage point cut in the Federal Reserve's interest rate in November and December seem intact after a report showed that US producer prices remained unchanged in September compared to August, indicating that inflation is still on track to meet its target. Futures contracts on interest rates continued to suggest only a 15% chance that the Fed will leave the interest rate unchanged at 4.75% to 5.00% when it meets in early November, with most bets on reductions in each of the two final meetings of this year and in each of the first meetings of 2025, reaching 3.50% to 3.75% by mid-next year. 'The case for a rate cut remains strong,' said no one in the article, but the article implies that the case for a rate cut remains strong, as the inflation is still on track to meet its target.

**Gordon Gekko: The FED Should Slow Down Interest Rate Cuts**
Gordon Gekko, a financial expert, believes that the Federal Reserve (FED) will not cut interest rates in November, despite market expectations. He argues that the FED will wait for the October employment report and the outcome of the US presidential election before making a decision. Gekko also mentions that a hurricane, the Milton, is approaching and may affect the data, as well as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the rise in oil prices. He notes that the FED has already reduced interest rates by half a point and that the next step is not predetermined. Gekko believes that the FED will not cut interest rates by another half point, but rather by a quarter point, and that this will happen in November or December. He also mentions that the FED's decision will depend on whether the inflation rate remains high, and that the current economic growth is too rapid. He concludes that the FED should slow down the pace of interest rate cuts to avoid making mistakes.

**Fed Interest Rate Decision: What to Expect in November 2024**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) recently lowered its policy rate by 50 basis points to 4.75-5.00%, the lowest level in 23 years. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for November 6-7, 2024, and the interest rate decision is expected to be announced on November 7. The Fed has stated that it may lower the interest rate by another 50 basis points this year. The Fed's decision to lower the interest rate was based on the slowing down of employment gains and the increase in unemployment rate, but also on the progress towards the 2% inflation target. The Fed's chairman said, 'We have gained more confidence that inflation will sustainably move towards 2% and that employment and inflation targets are roughly in balance.'

**Prediction: Savings Account APYs Will Fall Further in November or December**
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again in November or December, which may lead to lower savings account APYs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stated that he expects two more 0.25% interest rate cuts this year. While the federal funds rate is only a guideline for banks, it's likely that savings account rates will drop similarly. To maximize interest payments, consider locking in a high certificate of deposit (CD) rate before the November meeting. However, this requires giving up access to your cash for the full term. Alternatively, consider switching to an online savings account with a higher APY, such as the Discover Online Savings account, which is currently offering 4.10% APY.

**A Binging Pivot**
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point, making the range between 4.75% and 5%, with anticipation of more to come. Chairman Jerome Powell claimed, 'The U.S. economy is basically fine,' but critics argue that the rate cut will fuel inflation, an 'unwritten and unrestricted tax on everyone.' The Fed's decision is seen as a reaction to the national financial sector's addiction to cheap money, which increases demand without an increase in supply, causing inflation. The rate cut is also seen as a way to pacify the masses and make them feel better about the current political and economic situation, ahead of the presidential election. Critics argue that the real issue is the ever-increasing federal spending, and that the Fed's decision is analogous to a 'hangover coming the morning after a Friday night binger,' which will conveniently occur after November's election.

**Fed Interest Rate Decision: When Will It Be Announced?**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) will announce its interest rate decision on November 6-7, 2024. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the Fed is not in a hurry to lower interest rates rapidly and that the committee's decisions will be guided by incoming data. Powell emphasized that the US economy is generally in a strong position and that the Fed intends to use its tools to maintain this stability. However, Powell did not rule out the possibility of another interest rate cut, saying 'We will be guided by the data and will make decisions accordingly.'

**Federal Reserve chops key interest rate by a sizable half-point, turns focus to more jobs**
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 4.8%, its first rate cut in over four years, in an effort to bolster the job market, which has shown signs of slowing. The rate cut reflects the Fed's new focus on job growth, and policymakers expect to cut the rate by an additional half-point in November and December, with four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. The Fed's decision comes as inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to a three-year low of 2.5% in August, and policymakers now believe inflation is 'moving sustainably toward 2%.' However, many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas, rent, and other necessities. The rate cut should lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, boosting Americans' finances and supporting more spending and growth. The Fed's next policy meeting is November 6-7, immediately after the presidential election, and the decision to cut rates this week has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as Americans prepare to vote.

**Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates Again in November**
According to market operators, there is a higher probability that the Federal Reserve will implement a second interest rate cut of 50 basis points in November, following a government report that showed US inflation has cooled down to a rate closer to the 2% target of the central bank. The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose 2.2% year-over-year in August, according to the Commerce Department. This is in line with what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he expected in a press conference after last week's half-point rate cut. Omair Sharif of Inflation Insights wrote, 'If the Federal Reserve wants to cut rates by another 50 basis points in November, inflation data won't get in its way.' 'In fact, the faster inflation cools, the more momentum there will be to move faster to reach the (neutral) level.' Market operators are betting that the official interest rate, currently between 4.75%-5.00%, will fall 75 basis points by the end of the year and reach 3%-3.25% by mid-2025, which is just above the majority of Fed officials' neutral rate target.

**Fed seen cutting rates another 50 bps in November**
The Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates by another 50 basis points in November, according to traders, after a government report showed that U.S. inflation has cooled to a pace nearer to the central bank's 2% goal. The inflation rate, measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, was 2.2% in August, in line with what Fed Chair Jerome Powell expected. Traders now see a 54% chance of a half-point cut in November, with interest rate futures contracts reflecting a 46% chance of a quarter-point cut. Either way, traders are betting that the policy rate will be 75 basis points lower by year-end and in the 3.00%-3.25% range by mid-2025, just above the neutral rate where borrowing costs are neither stimulating nor braking a healthy economy, as noted by Inflation Insights Omair Sharif, who wrote, 'If the Fed wants to cut by another 50 basis points in November, the inflation data isn't going to stand in their way.'

**Market Reduces Chance of 50 bp Interest Rate Cut by Fed in November**
The financial market has reduced the chance of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting interest rates by 50 basis points (pb) in November, from 62.8% to 56.2%, according to the CME Group's monitoring tool, following a round of US employment, industry, activity, and inflation data. However, investors still maintain this option as the majority, against the possibility of a 25 pb reduction - which rose from 37.2% before the data to 42.6% around 10am (Brasília time). The CME Group also reports that the probability of a 75 pb interest rate reduction by the Fed by December increased from 49.4% to 50.3%, becoming the majority chance. If confirmed, this reduction would lower rates to the 4.00% to 4.25% per year range.

**Christmas gift on rates unlikely as Reserve Bank meets**
Australians are unlikely to receive interest-rate relief before Christmas, despite pressure on the Reserve Bank to cut rates. Experts predict the cash rate will remain unchanged at 4.35% when the Reserve Bank meets on Tuesday. Independent economist Saul Eslake believes a rate cut is unlikely before February 2025, citing high underlying inflation rates. However, Graham Cooke, head of consumer research at Finder, thinks the likelihood of a cut in November has increased. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has previously criticized the Reserve Bank, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has reaffirmed the bank's independence and committed to planned reforms to strengthen it.

**Interest rates heading lower after historic week for central banks**
The world's major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank (ECB), are now in the early stages of a monetary easing cycle that could last over a year. The banks have cut interest rates for the first time in years, with concerns about sluggish growth and the health of the labour market now taking precedence over fears about inflation. 'Investors need to prepare their portfolios for a world of lower interest rates,' said Dean Turner, chief European economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. The Fed forecast that the federal funds rate would stand between 4.75 and 4.50 per cent by the year's end, implying either two further rate reductions or one bumper cut. The Bank of England is likely to move slower than the Fed, but many economists think it will resume its cutting cycle in November and cut rates once a quarter thereafter. The ECB is facing sluggish growth alongside some stickier inflationary dynamics, and markets expect it to cut rates once more before the end of the year.

**The Federal Reserve's Interest Rate Cut: A Symbolic Move with Limited Implications**
The Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates by 50 basis points, from 4.75% to 5%, has been seen as a surprise move that has attracted global attention. However, the timing of the decision was slightly delayed from the expected date in July. The first interest rate cut by the Fed in four years has more implications than its actual importance, so it's difficult to assume that global liquidity will enter a new easing cycle. President Joe Biden and the two presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, have made different comments after the Fed's announcement. Biden said that the interest rate cut is not a 'victory announcement, but a progress report'. Harris emphasized that the interest rate cut is good, but she will focus more on reducing consumer prices. Trump said that the Fed's 50 basis point interest rate cut is a 'big cut that shows a very bad state of the current US economy', and that the Fed is 'playing politics' before the presidential election. Many professional organizations and investors believe that the timing of the interest rate cut in September was slightly delayed from the expected date in July, but the cut of 50 basis points exceeded the previous expectations of 25 basis points. After the announcement, BBC and CNN headlined their articles as 'aggressive move' and 'large interest rate cut' to describe the event. Some professional organizations expect that the first interest rate cut of 50 basis points is just the beginning, and there is still room for further easing in the next three to twelve months. According to Reuters, experts at Goldman Sachs now expect that six upcoming meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, from November 2024 to June 2025, will result in consecutive cuts of 25%, bringing the final rate back to 3.25% - 3.50% by mid-next year. The Bank of America, Citigroup, and Invesco teams expect an additional 50 basis point cut in the committee's meeting in November. Considering that many advanced economies such as Canada, Europe, the UK, and New Zealand have already started their first or several rounds of interest rate cuts before the US in the past few months, and that interest rates in most emerging and developing countries are at relatively high levels, the interest rate cut in the US in September has certainly given these countries more space to implement a more accommodative monetary policy. However, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have kept their rates unchanged at 5% and 0.25% respectively, sticking to their view that the economy is still on its way to achieving a moderate recovery. Nevertheless, it would be premature to assume that global liquidity has entered a new easing cycle. Although most media headlines described the move as 'larger than expected', I believe that the interest rate cut this time has more symbolic meaning than actual importance. By announcing the interest rate cut at this time and in this way, the Fed is sending a message to the market, 'We have heard your voice, and we have decided to start returning to the natural monetary policy from the tightening'. Indeed, after the announcement of the interest rate cut, the US and European stock markets showed a very positive reaction. On September 18 and 19, three major US and European stock market indices rose to new highs. However, it is worth noting that the yield on US 5-year and 10-year Treasury bonds increased instead of decreasing on the two days, reaching 3.50% and 3.75% respectively, indicating that investors do not believe in a highly accommodative monetary environment in the medium and long term. In addition, US employment and housing sales data are still relatively good, at least according to public monthly and weekly data, and are slightly weaker than expected. There is no clear sign of a major recession in the US or the world. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, 'The interest rate cut was a very positive signal to the place where the US economy has reached, and the US labor market is natural and healthy.' Therefore, the future path of US interest rate cuts depends mainly on whether the labor market will remain strong, taking into account that the Federal Reserve is still tightening its monetary policy. I believe that it is too early to predict aggressively that the US has entered a new cycle of monetary easing, and therefore it is not possible to assume a significant improvement in global liquidity.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate in Bid to Boost Economy**
The Federal Reserve has announced a 0.5% interest rate cut, the first since 2020, in a bid to boost the economy. Analysts expect further cuts, with some predicting a 0.25% reduction in November and December, and additional cuts in 2025 and 2026. The move is seen as a positive development for the economy, with some experts predicting it will lead to increased borrowing and spending, and a boost to the housing market. However, others warn that the cut may have negative consequences, such as increased inflation and a decrease in the value of the dollar. The Fed's decision is also seen as a response to the weak labor market and the decline in inflation. The move is expected to have a positive impact on the stock market, with some analysts predicting a rise in stock prices. The cut is also seen as a positive development for small businesses, which may benefit from lower interest rates and increased access to credit. However, some experts warn that the cut may have negative consequences, such as increased inflation and a decrease in the value of the dollar.

**Reuters Poll: Federal Reserve May Lower Interest Rates in November and December**
A Reuters poll of over 100 economists found that the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates by 25 basis points in November and December, bringing it closer to a neutral level. The poll also showed that the Fed will likely approach a neutral interest rate by the end of next year. Furthermore, more than three-quarters of the economists polled (86 out of 107) expect interest rates to fall by another 50 basis points this year to a range of 4.25% - 4.50%, in quarter-point reductions in meetings in November and December. 16 economists predicted that the Fed will lower interest rates by 75 basis points this year, while 5 predicted a 25 basis point cut. The poll's averages also showed that the Fed will lower interest rates by 50 basis points in the first quarter of 2025, followed by 25 basis points in the next two quarters, resulting in a total of 100 basis points of cuts next year, to a range of 3.25% - 3.50%. According to the poll, 'the Fed will likely approach a neutral interest rate by the end of next year', as said by the economists.

**FED's Unexpected Interest Rate Cut: A Response to Economic Concerns**
The Federal Reserve (FED) has unexpectedly lowered interest rates by 50 basis points, contrary to the majority's expectation of a 25 basis point cut. This decision has sparked interest in the relationships between interest rates, inflation, growth, and unemployment rates worldwide. The FED's decision was influenced by early warning signs of a potential economic slowdown, which are also evident in Europe, Japan, and China. The FED aims to prevent an economic downturn by reducing interest rates. In contrast, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, while the Bank of England (BOE) has kept interest rates stable. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has also raised interest rates to combat deflation. The Turkish Central Bank (TCMB) has kept interest rates high to combat inflation, but this approach may not be sustainable. The TCMB's decision will depend on the third-quarter GDP growth rate, which will be announced on November 29, 2024. If the growth rate is negative, the TCMB may lower interest rates before the December 26, 2024, policy meeting. The FED's decision has also been influenced by the upcoming US elections, with some speculating that the FED is trying to boost the economy and help the Democratic Party. However, the author believes that the FED's decision is driven by economic concerns rather than political considerations.

**Poll: Fed to Cut Rates by 25 Points in Nov. and Dec.**
A Reuters poll of over 100 economists found that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in both November and December. This decision was largely expected by market pricing, but was forecast by only 9 of 101 economists surveyed before the decision. The majority of economists, 86 of 107, predict that rates will fall by another 50 basis points this year to a 4.25%-4.50% range. David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, expects the rate to be reached slightly sooner, with a longer series of consecutive cuts from November 2024 through June 2025. The Fed's long-run assessment of the 'neutral' rate is 2.9%, which would not be reached until 2026. Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays, said that the Fed would be more inclined to step down to 25 basis point cuts if the unemployment rate goes above 4.4%.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates by 0.5% in a Bold Move**
The Federal Reserve, led by Chairman Jay Powell, has taken a bold step by cutting interest rates by 0.5% to a range of 4.75% - 5%. This is the first rate cut in over four years. Powell stated that the decision is an 'adjustment' to the monetary policy to suit the current economic conditions, where inflation has returned to the target of around 2% and the economy is growing strongly. The move is seen as a cautious approach to avoid unnecessary recession. Experts believe that Powell's ability to navigate the economy without triggering a recession will leave a lasting impact on his legacy. The next step for the policymakers will be to determine the pace of future rate cuts to reach a neutral level. The Federal Reserve's decision has been met with a calm response from the markets, with stock indices and government bond yields remaining largely unchanged. However, some experts warn that the rate cut may be too little, too late, and that the economy may still face challenges. The upcoming presidential elections in November may also influence the Fed's decisions. The market participants expect the Fed to cut rates further, with some predicting a cut to 4-4.25% by the end of the year, and others expecting a cut to below 3% by mid-2025.

**U.S. Fed aggressively cuts interest rate by 50 bps; will RBI follow suit?**
The U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut interest rates by 50 basis points, the first time in four years, to combat inflation and boost the job market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 11 to 1 to lower the benchmark rate to a target range of 4.75% to 5%. According to the Fed, this move aims to achieve maximum employment and inflation at 2% over the longer run. Industry experts believe this is a bold surprise move, and there could be a series of interest rate cuts leading up to the U.S. elections in November 2024. As the Fed stated, 'The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.' The Fed also acknowledged that 'The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.'

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate by 50 Basis Points**
The Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, has decided to lower the interest rate by 50 basis points, from 5% to a range of 4.75-5%. This decision has been met with mixed reactions from Democrats and Republicans. Democrats were hoping for a stronger reduction, while Republicans wanted no reduction before the November presidential elections. The Fed's decision marks the first rate cut since 2020, and is aimed at preventing a sharp slowdown in the labor market. Powell stated, 'We will move quickly or slowly as needed,' and emphasized that the Fed will decide on a meeting-by-meeting basis. The economy is expected to grow at a solid 2% rate, with a 4.4% unemployment rate by the end of the year and 2.1% inflation in 2025. Powell also noted that the risks of inflation are decreasing, but 'we are not declaring victory' over inflation. The Fed has committed to its dual mandate of maximum employment and 2% inflation. The decision was not unanimous, with some members, including Michelle Bowman, preferring a smaller reduction. The Fed expects to lower the interest rate by another 50 basis points by the end of the year, likely in 25 basis point increments at each of the remaining 2024 meetings.

**FED Cuts Interest Rate by 50 Basis Points, Marking a Shift to Easing Monetary Policy**
The Federal Reserve (FED) has reduced the interest rate by 50 basis points, marking the first rate cut since 2020. This decision, made by Jerome Powell, has been met with disappointment from Democrats and Republicans. Democrats had been pushing for a stronger reduction, while Republicans had been advocating for no reduction before the November presidential elections. The rate cut is expected to ease the burden on Americans struggling with high interest rates, which have made mortgages and credit cards more expensive and slowed down the housing market. The move is also aimed at accelerating investment growth, although its effects will take time to materialize. Powell's decision aims to prevent the gradual cooling of the labor market from turning into a complete stop, with the interest rate now ranging from 4.75% to 5%.

**Fed Confirms Strong Rate Cut, First Since 2020**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has lowered its interest rates for the first time since 2020, cutting them by half a point, and is considering another half-point cut by the end of 2024. This decision comes just two months before the US presidential election on November 5. The Fed's decision was not unanimous, with Governor Michelle Bowman voting for a quarter-point cut only. The Fed's Committee on Monetary Policy (FOMC) stated that 'the Committee has gained greater confidence in the durable decline of inflation to 2%.' The Fed is planning to lower its rates further, with a total of one additional half-point cut expected by the end of 2024. Fed President Jerome Powell said, 'This is the beginning of a process.' He added, 'We know it's time to recalibrate our policy to be more appropriate given the progress made on inflation and employment, moving to a more sustainable level. The balance of risks is now balanced, and this is the beginning of this process.' The rate cut is expected to give households more purchasing power, which has been constrained by high inflation and high credit costs. The Fed's decision could also benefit Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, as it could boost the economy. Republican candidate Donald Trump had previously criticized the Fed's policy, saying that it could only be relaxed because 'the economy is not good, otherwise they wouldn't be able to do it.' The Fed has also revised its inflation forecast to 2.1% in 2025, down from 2.3% previously. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.4% this year and next, up from 4.0% and 4.2% previously. The growth rate for 2024 is expected to be 2.0%, down from 2.1% previously.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates by Half a Point in US**
The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by half a point in the US, which will make it easier for Americans to borrow money at lower costs, including mortgages and credit cards. This move is a significant step in the central bank's fight against inflation. However, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman was the only one to dissent, advocating for a quarter-point cut. According to local media, Bowman has frequently expressed her concern about the persistence of price pressures. The Fed also expects more rate cuts by the end of the year and predicts that unemployment will rise to 4.4% from the current 4.2%. Despite this, inflation is significantly lower than the four-decade highs reported in the summer of 2022, achieved without a recession. Experts say the Fed has walked a tightrope to control price pressures without sacrificing the US labor market. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated, 'It's time for policy to adjust,' in August at the annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The economy is at a 'critical juncture,' according to Lael Brainard, the president's chief economic advisor. This was the Fed's last meeting before the presidential elections, with the next one scheduled for November 6-7.

**US Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate for First Time in Over Four Years**
The US Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time in over four years by 0.5 percentage points, to a range of 4.75-5.00%. This decision comes as inflation has eased, giving the Fed more room to maneuver. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, 'Our patient approach last year has paid off.' However, he noted that the high consumer prices are not yet under control. The Fed expects the inflation rate to be 2.3% this year and 2.1% next year, with a long-term target of 2% inflation. The central bank also released new, more optimistic inflation forecasts. The Fed is walking a tightrope, as high interest rates risk triggering a recession, while lowering them too soon could lead to rising inflation. The decision comes ahead of the US presidential election on November 5.

**Fed Officials Are Split on Where Rates Go Next in 2024**
Federal Reserve officials have lowered their year-end interest-rate forecast in their quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, with the median forecast predicting a total of 1 percentage point of cuts in 2024. This is a relatively wide range of views, with some officials predicting 0.5 percentage points of cuts, while others see 1.25 percentage points of cuts. The Fed's policy committee voted to lower the federal-funds rate target by 0.5 percentage point on Wednesday, to a range of 4.75% to 5.0%. The committee's remaining 2024 meetings will be in November and December. As Fed officials are split on where rates go next in 2024, it remains to be seen how the economy will be affected by these varying projections.

**Federal Reserve Members Expect Interest Rate Cuts by End of 2024**
The Federal Reserve members expect to reduce the interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% by the end of 2024, more than they previously predicted in June, as inflation approaches its 2% target and unemployment increases. According to the new economic projections published by the Federal Reserve on September 18, the interest rate is currently at 4.75% to 5.00%, and the authorities expect cuts of 25 points in each of the last two meetings of the year, in November and December. By the end of 2025, the interest rate is expected to be 3.4%, according to the median of their projections, implying four additional cuts of 25 points next year. The interest rate is estimated to be 2.9% by the end of 2026 and 2027, reflecting the reach of what the median of the Fed members now sees as a neutral rate. As stated by the Fed, the decision to reduce interest rates was made in light of the progress towards its inflation target and with the risks for both mandates now 'practically balanced.' The projections, which represent the individual opinions of the authorities, not a consensus, show that 2 of the 19 Fed members think that the monetary authority should not reduce interest rates further this year, and 7 think it would be necessary to make only one cut of 25 points. On the other end of the spectrum, only one authority predicts more cuts in interest rates this year than the median view.

The rate cut will make borrowing cheaper for businesses and individuals, which could boost economic growth. However, it may also lead to higher returns for savers, which could be a negative for the US dollar. The Fed's decision comes ahead of the US presidential election on November 5, and some have criticized the move as being too close to the election. The Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, has been under pressure to lower interest rates due to the cooling labor market and the need to combat high inflation. However, some have argued that lower interest rates are not necessary given the robust state of the US economy.

The US Federal Reserve has reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to a range of 4.75-5.00%, marking a significant shift in monetary policy.

The inflation rate has decreased to 2.5%, bringing the Fed closer to its 2% target. This decision follows the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, which have already implemented rate cuts in the summer. The move has been made despite pressure from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who urged the Fed not to make any rate changes before the November elections.

**Federal Reserve Surprises With Hefty Interest Rate Cut**
The Federal Reserve surprised the market with a larger-than-expected interest rate cut, decreasing the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight from 5.5% to 5.25% to 5% to 4.75%. This move, which was not anticipated by many Wall Street economists, has sparked speculation about the trajectory of the U.S. economy ahead of the November presidential election. The cut marks an end to the Fed's fight against inflation, which led to a series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. However, the economy defied expectations in 2023 by continuing to grow robustly, leading some to wonder if the Fed is trying to boost the economy or if it is actually stalling. As one source noted, 'fear financial markets would see a half-point cut as signaling worries about the economy was why a smaller decrease had been expected.'

**Federal Reserve cuts key interest rate by a half-point**
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 4.8%, the first rate cut in over four years, in an effort to bolster the job market which has shown signs of slowing. This move comes just weeks before the presidential election and has the potential to scramble the economic landscape. The Fed's policymakers also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate by an additional half-point in November and December, and envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. The central bank has gained confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%, but many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas, rent and other necessities. Rate cuts by the Fed should lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, boosting Americans' finances and supporting more spending and growth. The Fed's next policy meeting is Nov. 6-7, immediately after the presidential election, and may face attacks from politicians who argue that lowering rates now amounts to political interference.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates for the First Time in 4 Years**
The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has reduced the cost of money by 0.50 percentage points, the first rate cut since 2020. This brings the rates to a range of 4.74 to 5%. The decision was expected, but the magnitude of the cut was more significant than anticipated. The lower interest rate will support economic growth and employment, but may also contribute to inflation. The Fed must weigh the pros and cons of this move, considering the current inflation rate of 2.5% and unemployment rate of 4.2%. The rate cut will allow other major central banks, including the ECB, to follow suit, preventing an excessive difference in interest rates between the US and Europe that could lead to imbalances in the euro-dollar exchange rate and impact trade between the two continents. As Jerome Powell said, 'this was the last opportunity to cut rates before the presidential elections on November 4.'

**US Federal Reserve Unexpectedly Lowers Interest Rates by 0.5 Percentage Points**
The US Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, has unexpectedly lowered interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 4.75-5.00 percent, marking a significant shift in monetary policy. This decision follows the European Central Bank's (ECB) lead in reducing interest rates. The Fed's move is a response to the decline in inflation and a weakening job market. Powell had previously hinted at a rate cut in September, citing a clear direction in monetary policy, but uncertainty remained over the size and timing of further rate reductions. The Fed's new economic forecast suggests that interest rates may be lowered further this year, with a projected average interest rate of 4.4 percent for 2024 and 3.4 percent for 2025. The central bank also lowered its inflation forecast for this year to 2.3 percent, down from 2.6 percent in June, and to 2.1 percent for next year. Powell said, 'The direction of monetary policy is clear, but the size and timing of further rate steps are not predetermined.' The decision comes ahead of the US presidential election on November 5, with some arguing that a rate cut before the election could benefit the current administration of President Joe Biden.

**US Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate by 0.5 Percentage Points**
The US Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 4.75-5.00% for the first time in over four years, in response to declining inflation. This is an unusually large rate cut, and the Fed is signaling further rate cuts this year. The decision was expected, but the size of the cut was uncertain. The Fed had last lowered the interest rate in March 2020 to stimulate the economy during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the interest rate remained at zero until the Fed began raising it in March 2022 at a record pace. The inflation rate in the US has recently decreased, giving the Fed more room to lower interest rates. The European Central Bank had already initiated the rate cut in June. The Fed's new economic forecast suggests that it may lower interest rates further this year, with an average interest rate of 4.4% expected for this year (June: 5.1%) and 3.4% for next year (June: 4.1%). The Fed also released new inflation rate projections, with an average inflation rate of 2.3% expected for this year (June: 2.6%) and 2.1% for next year (June: 2.3%). The Fed aims to achieve an inflation rate of 2% in the medium term. The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy prices, is expected to be 2.6% this year (June: 2.8%) and 2.2% next year (June: 2.3%). The Fed is cautious in its monetary policy, as it must balance the risk of a recession with the risk of inflation rising again. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which can stimulate the economy, but high interest rates for savers may be reduced. The decision comes just weeks before the US presidential election on November 5, and may have implications for the election campaign.

**Fed lowers rates by 0.50 percentage points, its first cut since 2020**
The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.50 percentage points, marking the first reduction in four years. The move aims to ease borrowing costs as inflation-weary consumers struggle with high rates on mortgages, credit cards, and other loans. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the decision was based on the central bank's confidence that inflation will soon reach its 2% annual goal, as well as cooling employment. The labor market remains solid, but not as hot as it was during the pandemic. The Fed's economists predict that the unemployment rate could move up slightly by year end, rising from 4.2% to 4.4%. The rate cut is expected to ease financial strains for some consumers, and economists forecast that it will be the first in a series of reductions this year and into 2025. The next Fed meetings are scheduled for November 6-7 and December 17-18.

**Fed Expected to Lower Interest Rates for First Time in Over Four Years**
The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates for the first time in over four years on Wednesday, reversing the restrictive measures put in place to control inflation. However, the debate continues on the magnitude of the rate cut. According to Deutsche Bank, 'there are solid arguments for and against this action.' ING believes that the Fed should return to a neutral policy and expects a 50 basis point rate cut, but notes that 'the question is whether the other FOMC members are as convinced.' Macquarie argues that a 50 basis point rate cut is justified by the data, citing the deterioration of the US labor market activity. Bank of America suggests that a 25 basis point rate cut would send a message that the Fed is in control of its own message, allowing for potential further rate cuts in November if the data warrants it.

**US Federal Reserve September Meet: See date, timing, and schedule details here**
The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut in over four years at a press conference on September 18, 2024. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce the central bank's decision at 2 pm (EST) on September 18 (12.30 am IST on September 19). The rate cut is expected to be between 25 and 50 basis points, with many analysts predicting a 25 basis point cut. The decision comes as inflation in the US eases towards the central bank's target of 2 per cent, and as the labour market continues to cool. Alicia Modestino, an associate professor of economics at Northeastern University, said, 'As much as I think the Fed tries to say that they're not a political animal, we are in a really wild cycle right now.' The rate cut is significant as it is the Fed's first cut since March 2020, and comes just two months before the US presidential elections in November 2024.

**Federal Reserve Expected to Lower Interest Rates, but Extent of Reduction Uncertain**
The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates for the first time since 2020, but the extent of the reduction is uncertain. The Fedwatch tool from CME Group estimates a 65% probability of a 50-point base rate cut. Economist Véronique Riches-Florès believes that the Fed may choose to lower rates by 50 points to gain some flexibility before the November presidential election, which could lead to a potentially inflationary candidate. She argues that a 25-point base rate cut would be 'derisoire' given the current disinflation and the Fed's ability to consider real interest rates as too restrictive. Riches-Florès also suggests that the Fed may want to 'make the pill bitter' for the markets by communicating a less accommodative stance, which would be reflected in the 'dot plot' projections. Meanwhile, the UK's inflation rate remained stable at 2.2% in August, with the tertiary sector inflation accelerating to 5.6%. The Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates steady on Thursday, with a 25% probability of a rate cut, down from 35% before the inflation data.

**Federal Reserve Set To Cut Interest Rates, Potentially Boosting Economy Before Election**
The Federal Reserve is set to cut interest rates on Wednesday, potentially boosting the economy before the November 5 presidential election. The size of the rate cut is uncertain, but many economists expect a quarter-percent reduction. Progressives, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are calling for a more aggressive cut to avoid a recession. Former President Donald Trump has threatened the Fed's independence and has suggested that they shouldn't cut rates before the election. The Fed has hiked rates at a fast pace since 2022 to combat inflation, but unemployment has remained low and inflation has slowed to nearly pre-pandemic levels. 'They've done a great job so far,' said Erica Groshen, a senior economics advisor at Cornell University. However, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the progressive Groundwork Collaborative think tank, said it's too soon to declare victory and that the Fed should wait a little longer to make sure the labor market is stable. 'It is probably OK to say that the war on inflation has been won, but I think we've got to wait a little bit longer to make sure we're in the clear on the labor market,' she said.

**Fed Interest Rate Decision: What to Expect in September**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) will announce its interest rate decision after the September 17-18 meeting, and will also meet on November 6-7 and December 17-18. Despite expectations of a rate cut in the US, the recent weak non-agricultural employment data has caused confusion. Investors are looking to the upcoming consumer inflation data to determine how much the Fed will cut interest rates. According to Barış Ergin, investors are still expecting a quarter-point cut in interest rates, with some expecting a half-point cut. Bank of America's research department is predicting that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at each meeting starting from the September meeting, and will continue to do so every quarter until March 2025.

**Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as many as three times by end of 2024, UNC Charlotte economics professor says**
University of North Carolina at Charlotte economics professor John Connaughton predicts that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates as many as three times by the end of 2024. Connaughton suspects that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, November, and December, citing signs of waning inflation and a cooling job market. He estimates that the U.S. added about 160,000 jobs in August, which would be an improvement over the 118,000 jobs added in July. Connaughton believes that this would reduce pressure on the Fed to keep rates flat and that they have already signaled a rate cut, with the question being whether they will have two or three cuts by the end of the year. He is 'guaranteeing' rate cuts in September and December, but is unsure about November.

**Interest Rate Cuts Expected to Continue, but Pace and Size Depend on Inflation and Labor Market**
The Federal Reserve's Chairman has hinted that the next interest rate cut is expected to happen next month, but the pace and size of the cuts will depend on the progress made in controlling inflation and the strength of the labor market. The report states that the expected impact of the potential interest rate cuts on implicit interest rates will be less than expected, due to investors seeking safe-haven assets such as US Treasury bonds during times of new crises and geopolitical issues, including the renewed Gaza war and the escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian war. The report also states that some traders are betting on a 100-point basis cut in interest rates by the end of the year, including a 50-point basis cut in September 2024, followed by 25-point basis cuts in November and December 2024. This has supported the growth of US Treasury bond yields, which are on track to achieve their fourth consecutive monthly gain. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds has fallen to its lowest level in 13 months, reaching 3.79%. Additionally, the report states that the European Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates again next month, as inflation is expected to continue towards its target rate, but analysts are concerned about the release of key inflation data and service sector inflation, which is still persistent. Currently, the consensus is that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates twice this year, and the probability of a cut in October 2024 is 55%.
