**Apple is reportedly trying to invest in OpenAI**
Apple is reportedly in talks to invest in OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT AI chatbot. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Apple would join a multi-billion dollar funding round led by Thrive Capital, valuing the startup at over $100 billion. Apple's investment would not be the only one, as Microsoft is expected to invest further and Nvidia is considering participating. Apple has already integrated OpenAI's GPT technology into its products, including a suite of AI features called Apple Intelligence, which will work on the iPhone 15 Pro and later. However, Apple has signed a deal to refer user requests outside the scope of Apple Intelligence to ChatGPT inside a future version of iOS 18. Apple software lead Craig Federighi said, 'we wanted to start with the best' when choosing ChatGPT over other AI chatbots like Google's Gemini. The investment is expected to bring benefits to Apple, such as access to cutting-edge AI technology and potential strategic advantages. ChatGPT integration is not expected to make it into the initial release of iOS 18 this September, but it will probably come in a smaller software update later in 2024.

**OpenAI Closes Iranian Group Accounts for Election Interference**
OpenAI announced the closure of Iranian group accounts that used the 'Chat GPT' chatbot to generate content aimed at influencing the US presidential elections and other issues. The operation, dubbed 'Storm-2035', used Chat GPT to produce content focused on topics such as commenting on candidates from both sides in the US elections, the conflict in Gaza, and Israel's participation in the Olympic Games, and then published this content on social media accounts and various websites. According to a Microsoft-backed AI investigation, Chat GPT was used to produce long articles and short social media posts. OpenAI stated that the operation did not seem to attract significant public engagement. Most of the observed posts on social media received only a few likes, comments, or shares, or none at all. The company noted that it had not observed any indicators of engagement with the published articles on internet websites. OpenAI has banned these accounts from using its services and continues to monitor activities to detect any further attempts to violate policies. In August, a Microsoft report on intelligence threats mentioned the Iranian network Storm-2035, consisting of 4 hidden online portals in the guise of news outlets, which focuses on attracting US voters from both sides of the political spectrum. The report stated that this attraction was based on 'polarizing messages on issues such as presidential candidates, LGBTQ+ rights, and the conflict between Israel and Hamas.' Democratic candidate Kamala Harris is competing with her Republican opponent Donald Trump in a heated race before the presidential election scheduled for November 5. OpenAI said in May that it had shut down 5 secret influence operations that sought to use its models in 'deceptive online activities.'

**OpenAI Launches Voice Feature for ChatGPT, Denies Scarlett Johansson's Accusations**
OpenAI confirmed on July 30, 2024, that ChatGPT has started using a new voice feature to respond to some users' commands. The release of the update, initially set for June, was delayed by a month due to the need for additional security testing. The company faced criticism, including accusations of sexism related to the virtual assistant's personality. Actress Scarlett Johansson claimed that OpenAI stole her voice to develop the tool, but the company denies this, stating that the voice belongs to 'a different professional actress using her own natural voice.' According to Johansson, she was approached by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in September 2023 to lend her voice to the AI, which she declined. However, after the launch of the new GPT version on May 13, she noticed similarities between her voice and the virtual assistant's voice, Sky. The update will allow ChatGPT to detect the user's tone and interpret their emotions, available in 4 different voices.

OpenAI is preparing to launch its latest model of artificial intelligence, ChatGPT-5, with high expectations but also some caution. The company's CEO, Sam Altman, has confirmed that the new model will be released in late May and will 'take a significant leap forward'. The GPT-5 is expected to surpass the GPT-4 in terms of power and capacity, but it remains to be seen if the advancements will be as innovative as those of previous iterations. The main hope for the GPT-5 is that it will improve the ability to handle complex tasks more effectively, such as maintaining coherence in multiple stages and processing larger blocks of text. Additionally, the model is expected to have a greater context window, allowing it to work with audio, video, and text in an interchangeable way. However, it is unclear if all these features will be available in the next version of ChatGPT. According to Altman, the goal is to improve the current functionality of the GPT-4 and make it more personalized and customizable. The GPT-5 is also expected to have the ability to use personal data, such as reading emails, calendar details, and integrating with external data sources. The launch is expected to take place this year.

**OpenAI Prepares Ground for GPT-5: Altman Promises a 'Significant Leap'**
OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has announced that GPT-5 will be a 'significant leap' compared to GPT-4, but also warned that there is still much work to be done. GPT-5 is expected to surpass many of the current limitations of GPT-4 and open up new possibilities for application in various fields, in addition to gaining intelligence and response capacity. Altman has been critical of GPT-4, describing it as 'slightly embarrassing' and admitting that it sometimes makes mistakes 'that a six-year-old wouldn't make'. This highlights OpenAI's ambition to achieve significant improvements with GPT-5. The development of GPT-5 faces significant challenges, including complex algorithmic and data problems, a much larger model scale than previous versions, and a need for a radical improvement in reasoning capabilities. Altman has compared the process to the development of the first iPhone, saying 'it still had errors, but it was good enough to be useful'. He also hinted that the current ChatGPT will be 'ridiculously bad' compared to what will be seen in the next 12 months, a clear reference to the leap that GPT-5 will make.

**Road to GPT-5: OpenAI's Latest Developments and Future Prospect**
OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, discussed the development of GPT-5, a new AI model, at the Aspen Ideas Fest. Altman stated that GPT-5 is still in the works and not yet ready, but OpenAI has released a new top-tier product, GPT-4o, which Altman called 'magical'. GPT-4o builds on GPT-4's base, with improvements in language understanding, context, and user interaction. The goal of GPT-5 is to fix the limitations of GPT-4, including its reasoning and bias issues. OpenAI aims to make GPT-5 more advanced, with PhD-level smarts in some tasks, and is working to ensure its ethical use and development.

**What to Expect from GPT-5? Sam Altman Gives Hints**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has raised expectations for the upcoming GPT-5 language model, promising significant advancements over current capabilities. 'I hope it's a significant leap', Altman said in an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival. He also expressed disappointment with GPT-4's errors, calling them 'primary' and 'infantile'. 'Many of the things GPT-4 gets wrong, if it can't reason or just goes off the rails, many are idiotic errors, something a six-year-old child would never make', Altman said. Altman declined to give a release date for GPT-5, stating 'we're optimistic, but we still have a lot of work to do'. The development of the model is attributed to complex algorithm and data issues, as well as the scale of GPT-5. Altman compared the development of LLMs to the iPhone, saying 'the first iPhone still had many bugs, but it was good enough to be useful to people'. As the wait for more details on GPT-5's advancements continues, the focus is on waiting for further updates from OpenAI on what the new version will bring and when it will be available.

**GPT-5 will be a 'significant leap' compared to GPT-4, says OpenAI CEO**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman discussed the development of the successor to the GPT-4 model during an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival in the US. According to Altman, a potential GPT-5 would represent a 'significant leap' compared to the previous AI model, but it may take time to arrive. When asked about the technological advancements of the new model, Altman said that the company 'doesn't know yet', but is optimistic and has a lot of work to do. He guaranteed that the next generation of language models will solve many problems found in the current panorama. 'I imagine it will be a significant leap. The GPT-4 does some things wrong, it can't do much in terms of reasoning, sometimes it goes completely off track and makes a silly mistake, which even a six-year-old child wouldn't make. I hope it will be much, much better in that sense and can be used for a wider range of useful tasks', commented Sam Altman. Altman has previously criticized the GPT-4 model, calling it 'dumb and slightly embarrassing'. He compared the development of the new model to the first iPhone, saying that it still had bugs but was 'good enough to be useful for people'. The OpenAI has confirmed that it is training the next generation of the company's large AI model, but there is no release date yet.
