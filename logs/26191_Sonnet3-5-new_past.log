Let me analyze this carefully:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Biden's poor debate performance on June 27, 2024 against Trump has led to increased pressure from Democrats to step aside
2. Multiple Democratic lawmakers (reportedly around 20) have called for Biden to withdraw
3. His age and health concerns, including recent gaffes at NATO summit where he confused leaders' names
4. Declining poll numbers and fundraising challenges
5. The New York Times editorial board called for his withdrawal

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Biden has repeatedly and firmly stated "I'm not going anywhere" and committed to staying in the race
2. Democrats are planning to virtually nominate him before end of July 2024
3. He retains support from key Democratic governors and party leadership
4. The timeline is very short - only about 5 weeks until August 22
5. No clear alternative candidate has emerged
6. Logistically difficult to change nominees this late
7. Would create significant party chaos/division

Key Considerations:
1. The virtual nomination process before end of July makes withdrawal less likely
2. Historical precedent - sitting presidents rarely withdraw once nominated
3. Biden has shown remarkable resilience despite previous calls to step aside
4. The August 22 deadline is very soon, limiting time for major changes
5. His family, especially First Lady Jill Biden, strongly supports him continuing

Looking at this evidence holistically:
- The base rate for incumbent presidents withdrawing is extremely low
- Recent strong statements of commitment reduce likelihood further
- Planned virtual nomination creates additional barrier
- Timeline is very compressed
- But health/age concerns and party pressure create non-zero chance

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 8.75%, with 5.25% being the most likely. Probability: 5.25%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base rate analysis:
- Historically, incumbent presidents rarely withdraw from re-election campaigns
- Only one president (LBJ in 1968) has chosen not to seek re-election while eligible
- No incumbent president has withdrawn after securing their party's nomination

2. Current situation evidence for withdrawal:
- Poor debate performance on June 27, 2024
- Growing calls from Democratic lawmakers to step aside
- Concerns about age and mental acuity
- Multiple verbal gaffes at NATO summit
- NYT editorial board calling for withdrawal
- Senator Peter Welch explicitly calling for withdrawal

3. Current situation evidence against withdrawal:
- Biden has repeatedly and firmly stated "I'm not going anywhere"
- Democratic Party planning virtual nomination before end of July 2024
- Biden sent clear letter to Democratic lawmakers reaffirming commitment
- First Lady Jill Biden reportedly urging him to stay in
- Campaign actively planning post-convention strategy
- No clear alternative candidate with better polling

4. Timeline constraints:
- Question resolves by August 22, 2024 (Convention end)
- Virtual nomination planned for late July
- Only ~5 weeks remaining until resolution

5. Key factors:
- Biden has consistently rejected withdrawal calls
- Party machinery moving forward with nomination
- Time window is relatively short
- Would need dramatic new development to force change

The evidence strongly suggests Biden will maintain his candidacy. His recent firm statements, campaign planning, and party machinery movement all indicate commitment. While there are concerning signs about his performance and some party opposition, the historical rarity of incumbent withdrawals and short timeframe make withdrawal unlikely.

My Prediction: Between 8.50% and 15.75%, with 12.25% being the most likely. Probability: 12.25%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Historically, incumbent presidents rarely withdraw from re-election campaigns
- Since 1900, only LBJ in 1968 withdrew during primary season
- This gives a very low base rate (approximately 1/20 = 5%)

2. Current Evidence For Biden Withdrawing:
- Poor debate performance against Trump on June 27, 2024
- Growing calls from Democratic lawmakers to step aside
- Multiple verbal gaffes at NATO summit
- NYT editorial board calling for withdrawal
- Concerns about age and mental acuity
- Senator Peter Welch became first sitting senator to call for withdrawal
- Bill Maher's prediction of August 9 withdrawal

3. Current Evidence Against Biden Withdrawing:
- Multiple recent explicit statements from Biden that he's "not going anywhere"
- Written letter to Democratic lawmakers reaffirming commitment to stay in race
- Democrats planning virtual nomination before end of July 2024
- First Lady Jill Biden reportedly urging him to stay in
- No clear alternative candidate with better polling
- Campaign actively planning activities through August
- Strong institutional support from Democratic governors

4. Time Factor:
- Only about 5 weeks until August 22 deadline
- Virtual nomination planned before end of July would make withdrawal more difficult
- Democratic National Convention scheduled for August 19-22

5. Key Considerations:
- Biden has consistently and firmly rejected calls to withdraw
- Infrastructure for virtual nomination is already in place
- Timing window is relatively short
- Cost of withdrawal increases after formal nomination

Weighing these factors:
- The short timeframe and Biden's consistent messaging make withdrawal unlikely
- However, health issues or major gaffes could force reconsideration
- Virtual nomination plans reduce but don't eliminate possibility
- Growing pressure from party officials creates some risk

My Prediction: Between 4.50% and 12.75%, with 7.25% being the most likely. Probability: 7.25%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability (>50%):
1. Biden's poor debate performance on June 27, 2024, leading to increased pressure
2. Growing number of Democratic lawmakers (at least 9) calling for him to step aside
3. Concerns about his age and mental acuity, especially after NATO summit gaffes
4. Declining poll numbers against Trump
5. Multiple news sources reporting internal Democratic discussions about replacement

Key Evidence Supporting Lower Probability (<50%):
1. Biden's repeated, explicit statements that he's "not going anywhere" and will stay "until the end"
2. Democratic Party plans to virtually nominate Biden before end of July 2024
3. Support from key Democratic governors and party establishment
4. No clear alternative candidate with better polling
5. Time constraints - only about 1 month until August 22
6. Historical precedent - sitting presidents rarely withdraw

Breaking down sub-probabilities:
1. Voluntary withdrawal: ~10% (Given strong recent statements)
2. Forced withdrawal due to health: ~5% (No major health issues reported)
3. Delegate release: ~2% (Very unlikely given virtual nomination plans)
4. Endorsing another: ~1% (No viable alternatives being seriously discussed)
5. Ceasing to be President: ~2% (No indication of immediate resignation/removal)

Key timing considerations:
- Virtual nomination planned for July 2024
- Convention scheduled for August 19-22, 2024
- Less than 40 days until deadline

The strongest evidence suggests Biden will remain in the race. His recent emphatic statements, planned virtual nomination, and party establishment support indicate low probability of withdrawal. While pressure exists, the timeline is very short and there's no clear alternative candidate.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 25.50%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Key Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Biden has repeatedly and firmly stated he's staying in the race, most recently in July 2024 letters to Democratic lawmakers stating he's "firmly committed" to running.
2. The Democratic Party is planning to virtually nominate Biden before end of July 2024, indicating organizational commitment.
3. No major Democratic alternative candidate has emerged or is actively preparing to replace Biden.
4. Historical precedent: Sitting presidents rarely withdraw from re-election campaigns.

Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Growing pressure from Democratic lawmakers and media (e.g., NYT editorial) calling for Biden to step aside.
2. Poor debate performance against Trump on June 27, 2024 raised new concerns about Biden's capabilities.
3. Recent gaffes at NATO summit (calling Zelenskyy "Putin") have intensified questions about mental acuity.
4. First sitting Senator (Peter Welch) has called for Biden to end campaign.

Key Considerations:

2. Resolution criteria are specific and require formal actions
3. Virtual nomination process before convention doesn't preclude later withdrawal
4. Historical base rate of incumbent presidents withdrawing is very low (<5%)

- While pressure is increasing, Biden appears more determined to stay
- Democratic party infrastructure is aligned behind Biden
- No clear succession plan exists
- Time window is relatively short (about 5 weeks)

Given these factors, particularly Biden's consistent and recent firm commitments to stay in race, combined with party infrastructure support and historical precedent, but balanced against growing pressure and recent performance issues, I assess:

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 22.50%, with 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%
