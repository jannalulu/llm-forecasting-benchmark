Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Meta has already conducted significant layoffs in 2022-2023 (around 21,000 employees)
- The tech industry has seen over 100,000 layoffs in 2024 so far

2. Recent Meta-Specific Evidence:
Positive indicators (against layoffs):
- Meta announced plans for "meaningfully higher" headcount in 2024
- Q2 2024 showed strong financial performance with 22% revenue growth
- Heavy investment in AI and new projects
- Already completed efficiency programs in 2023

Negative indicators (for layoffs):
- Discontinuing Spark AR platform
- Shutting down CrowdTangle
- Ongoing tech industry layoffs continue (though at slower pace)
- AI adoption could reduce workforce needs

3. Timeframe Analysis:
- Only August and September 2024 remain for resolution
- Short timeframe reduces probability
- Most major tech layoffs occurred earlier in 2024

4. Context:
- Meta has already undergone its "year of efficiency"
- Company is in growth mode rather than cost-cutting
- Strong financial position reduces need for layoffs
- Focus on AI hiring rather than traditional roles

5. Key Risk Factors:
- Rapid AI adoption could prompt restructuring
- Industry-wide tech slowdown continues
- Platform/product discontinuations could lead to targeted layoffs

Given Meta's strong financial position, stated plans for headcount growth, and recent completion of efficiency programs, combined with the short timeframe remaining, a layoff appears unlikely but not impossible given ongoing tech industry trends and platform discontinuations.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.40%, with 20.30% being the most likely. Probability: 20.30%

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Meta had significant layoffs in 2022-2023 (21,000+ employees)
- According to the articles, tech layoffs in 2024 have continued but at a slower pace

2. Recent Company-Specific Evidence:
Positive indicators (against layoffs):
- Meta announced plans for "meaningfully higher" headcount in 2024
- Strong Q2 2024 results with revenue up 22% to $39.1 billion
- Heavy investment in AI and infrastructure planned
- CEO Zuckerberg focused on AI development and growth

Negative indicators (for layoffs):
- Discontinuing Spark AR platform
- Shutting down CrowdTangle
- Industry-wide continued tech layoffs (100,000+ in 2024)
- Meta's history of sudden strategic shifts

3. Timeline Consideration:
- Only need to consider August-September 2024
- Very short window reduces probability
- Most recent news suggests growth rather than cuts

4. Specific Resolution Criteria:
- Must appear on TechCrunch's specific tracker
- Must specifically mention Meta/Facebook/Instagram
- High bar for verification

5. Key Factors:
- Meta's recent pivot to AI investment
- Strong financial performance
- Public statements about increasing headcount
- Short timeframe remaining
- Previous efficiency measures already implemented

The strongest evidence points against layoffs in this short timeframe, given Meta's recent growth plans and strong financial performance. However, the tech industry's volatility and Meta's history of sudden changes maintain some probability of layoffs.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

- No recent hints or rumors of layoffs

4. Specific Evidence For Layoffs:
- Tech industry continues to have layoffs in 2024
