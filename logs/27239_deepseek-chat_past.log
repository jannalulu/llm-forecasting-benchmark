To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, current events, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Current Polling Data**: As of August 2024, Keir Starmer's approval rating has plummeted to 3% according to some polls, with others reporting a decline of 16 points. This suggests a significant drop in public support.
- **Historical Trends**: Approval ratings for new Prime Ministers often experience a "honeymoon period" followed by a decline. Starmer's initial high approval rating (36%) has since dropped sharply, indicating a loss of public confidence.
- **Comparison to Past Leaders**: Tony Blair maintained high approval ratings for two years post-election, but Starmer's situation appears more volatile due to ongoing riots, policy criticisms, and public dissatisfaction.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: Starmer's approval rating is currently at a historic low (3% in some polls).
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend shows a sharp decline from 36% to 3% within a short period.
3. **Future Events**: The ongoing riots, policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits), and public perception will influence future ratings.
4. **Base Rate**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers rarely drop below 40% unless significant crises occur.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The current riots, policy backlash, and public dissatisfaction suggest a continued decline in approval ratings.
- **Outside View**: Historically, approval ratings for new Prime Ministers stabilize after initial turbulence, but Starmer's situation is exacerbated by severe public unrest.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting**: Ignoring the sharp decline in approval ratings and the severity of public unrest would be a mistake.
- **Overreacting**: Assuming the approval rating will remain at 3% indefinitely is unlikely, as public sentiment can shift with effective crisis management.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, policy criticisms, and public dissatisfaction are driving approval ratings down.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for effective crisis management, policy adjustments, and public relations efforts could stabilize or improve ratings.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current trend continues, Starmer's approval rating could remain below 40% by September 18, 2024.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a high degree of uncertainty due to the volatile nature of public opinion and the potential for unforeseen events.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the current trend suggests a low approval rating, it is important to remain open to the possibility of stabilization or improvement.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that approval ratings can recover after initial declines, but the current situation is more severe than typical.

### Final Forecast
Given the current sharp decline in approval ratings, ongoing public unrest, and policy criticisms, it is highly likely that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 40% on September 18, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 90.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.**

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the UK will be less than 40% on September 18, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- As of August 16, 2024, there are no specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus directly addressing this question. However, recent polls and news articles provide a snapshot of Starmer's current approval ratings and trends.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: Assess Starmer's current approval rating and recent trends.
2. **Factors Influencing Approval**: Identify key factors (e.g., riots, policy decisions, public sentiment) affecting his approval.
3. **Historical Trends**: Compare with historical approval ratings of UK Prime Ministers in similar situations.
4. **Future Projections**: Extrapolate current trends to September 18, 2024, considering potential stabilizing or destabilizing events.

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: Starmer's approval rating has plummeted to 3% in some polls due to riots, policy missteps, and public dissatisfaction.
- **Outside View**: Historically, UK Prime Ministers often experience a "honeymoon period" followed by declines, but recoveries are possible if crises are managed effectively.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- Recent polls show a sharp decline in Starmer's approval, but it is unclear if this is a temporary dip or a sustained trend. Overreacting to short-term data could lead to inaccurate forecasts.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, criticism of policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits), and public unrest.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for effective crisis management, policy adjustments, and public sympathy if the situation stabilizes.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current downward trend continues linearly, Starmer's approval rating could remain below 40% by September 18, 2024. However, trends are rarely perfectly linear, and external events could alter the trajectory.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the volatile political climate and potential for unforeseen events (e.g., further riots, policy changes, or external crises).

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the current data suggests a high likelihood of Starmer's approval rating being below 40%, it is important to account for potential recovery or stabilization.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors and Avoid Hindsight Bias
- Historical data shows that approval ratings can recover after crises, but this depends on effective leadership and public perception. Avoiding hindsight bias requires focusing on current evidence rather than assuming past patterns will repeat.

### Step 10: Final Forecast
- **Base Rate**: Historically, UK Prime Ministers' approval ratings rarely drop below 40% unless facing severe crises.
- **Adjustments**: Given the current riots, policy backlash, and public dissatisfaction, Starmer's approval rating is likely to remain low in the short term.
- **Most Likely Outcome**: Based on current trends and the absence of significant stabilizing factors, Starmer's approval rating is likely to be below 40% on September 18, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, current events, and probabilistic reasoning.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers tend to decline after the initial "honeymoon period" post-election. For example, Boris Johnson's approval rating dropped from around 60% in early 2020 to below 40% by late 2021 due to scandals and policy missteps. Tony Blair, despite a strong start, saw his approval ratings fluctuate significantly over time.
- **Current Context**: Keir Starmer's approval rating has already dropped significantly from its peak in July 2024 (around 36%) to as low as 3% in early August 2024, according to some polls. This sharp decline is attributed to his handling of riots, anti-migrant protests, and unpopular policy decisions like cutting winter fuel benefits.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: As of August 2024, Starmer's approval rating is reported to be around 3% (Opinium) to 35% (other polls). This wide range suggests significant volatility and uncertainty.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend is sharply downward, with multiple polls showing a decline of 16 points or more in a short period.
3. **Future Events**: The riots and protests are ongoing, and their resolution (or escalation) will significantly impact public sentiment. Additionally, policy decisions and economic conditions will play a role.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historical trends suggest that approval ratings for new Prime Ministers often stabilize or recover slightly after initial declines, but rarely drop below 30% unless there is a major crisis.
- **Inside View**: The current situation is unusually volatile, with riots, protests, and policy backlash creating a highly negative environment. This suggests a higher likelihood of continued decline.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The sharp decline in approval ratings is significant, but it is also an outlier compared to historical trends. Overreacting to the current low of 3% might be premature, as some polls show higher numbers (e.g., 35%).
- The riots and protests are a major factor, but their impact may diminish over time if the government takes effective action.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, protests, policy backlash, and economic challenges are pushing approval ratings down.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for policy adjustments, effective crisis management, and public fatigue with protests could stabilize or improve ratings.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current downward trend continues, Starmer's approval rating could drop below 40% by September 18, 2024. However, linear extrapolation may overstate the decline, as trends often stabilize.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the volatile political environment. The range of possible outcomes is wide, but the most likely scenario is a continued decline, though not as extreme as the current low of 3%.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the evidence points to a decline, it is important not to be overly confident in extreme outcomes. A moderate decline to around 35-40% is plausible.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overreliance on outlier polls (e.g., 3%) could lead to underestimating the potential for stabilization. Conversely, ignoring the sharp decline could lead to overestimating approval ratings.

### Final Forecast
Given the current volatility, the most likely scenario is that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 40% by September 18, 2024, but not as low as the current extreme of 3%.

- Overreliance on outlier polls (e.g., 3%) could lead to underestimating the potential for stabilization. Conversely, ignoring the sharp decline could lead to overestimating approval ratings.

### Final Forecast
Given the current volatility, the most likely scenario is that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 40% by September 18, 2024, but not as low as the current extreme of 3%.

**My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 40.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.**

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, current events, and probabilistic reasoning.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers tend to decline after the initial "honeymoon period" post-election. For example, Boris Johnson's approval rating dropped from around 60% in early 2020 to below 40% by late 2021 due to scandals and policy missteps. Tony Blair, despite a strong start, saw his approval ratings fluctuate significantly over time.
- **Current Context**: Keir Starmer's approval rating has already dropped significantly from its peak in July 2024 (around 36%) to as low as 3% in early August 2024, according to some polls. This sharp decline is attributed to his handling of riots, anti-migrant protests, and unpopular policy decisions like cutting winter fuel benefits.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: As of August 2024, Starmer's approval rating is reported to be around 3% (Opinium) to 35% (other polls). This wide range suggests significant volatility and uncertainty.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend is sharply downward, with multiple polls showing a decline of 16 points or more in a short period.
3. **Future Events**: The riots and protests are ongoing, and their resolution (or escalation) will significantly impact public sentiment. Additionally, policy decisions and economic conditions will play a role.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historical trends suggest that approval ratings for new Prime Ministers often stabilize or recover slightly after initial declines, but rarely drop below 30% unless there is a major crisis.
- **Inside View**: The current situation is unusually volatile, with riots, protests, and policy backlash creating a highly negative environment. This suggests a higher likelihood of continued decline.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The sharp decline in approval ratings is significant, but it is also an outlier compared to historical trends. Overreacting to the current low of 3% might be premature, as some polls show higher numbers (e.g., 35%).
- The riots and protests are a major factor, but their impact may diminish over time if the government takes effective action.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, protests, policy backlash, and economic challenges are pushing approval ratings down.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for policy adjustments, effective crisis management, and public fatigue with protests could stabilize or improve ratings.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current downward trend continues, Starmer's approval rating could drop below 40% by September 18, 2024. However, linear extrapolation may overstate the decline, as trends often stabilize.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the volatile political environment. The range of possible outcomes is wide, but the most likely scenario is a continued decline, though not as extreme as the current low of 3%.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the evidence points to a decline, it is important not to be overly confident in extreme outcomes. A moderate decline to around 35-40% is plausible.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overreliance on outlier polls (e.g., 3%) could lead to underestimating the potential for stabilization. Conversely, ignoring the sharp decline could lead to overestimating approval ratings.

### Final Forecast
Given the current volatility, the most likely scenario is that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 40% by September 18, 2024, but not as low as the current extreme of 3%.
