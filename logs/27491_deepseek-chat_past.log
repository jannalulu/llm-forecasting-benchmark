To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.3%, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here’s my step-by-step reasoning:

---

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - I do not have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this exact question. However, I can infer market expectations and expert opinions from the provided news articles.
   - The Cleveland Fed’s InflationNowcast predicted a 0.28% increase in core CPI for July 2024, which rounded to 0.3%. This suggests that a 0.3% increase is within the realm of possibility, though it was an upside surprise in July.

---

### 2. **Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems**
   - **Sub-problem 1:** What is the historical frequency of a 0.3% month-over-month increase in core CPI?
     - Historically, core CPI increases of 0.3% are relatively rare but not unprecedented. They typically occur during periods of economic acceleration or supply-side shocks.
   - **Sub-problem 2:** What are the current trends in core CPI?
     - Recent data shows a consistent 0.2% month-over-month increase in core CPI (e.g., July 2024). This suggests a stable, moderate inflationary trend.
   - **Sub-problem 3:** What are the key drivers of core CPI in August 2024?
     - Shelter costs (housing) have been a significant driver, contributing ~90% of the monthly increase in July. Other factors include energy prices, which have been volatile, and services inflation, which has been sticky but moderating.

---

### 3. **Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Outside View (Base Rate):** Based on historical data, the probability of a 0.3% month-over-month increase in core CPI is low, as such increases are outliers in a stable inflationary environment.
   - **Inside View (Current Context):** The current trend shows a 0.2% increase, with no significant upward pressure from energy or food prices. However, shelter costs remain elevated, and there is some uncertainty around services inflation.

---

### 4. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - The news articles suggest that inflation is moderating, with core CPI increasing by 0.2% in July. There is no strong evidence of a sudden acceleration to 0.3% in August.
   - However, the Cleveland Fed’s InflationNowcast for July (0.28%) indicates that a 0.3% increase is possible, albeit unlikely.

---

### 5. **Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work**
   - **Upward Forces:**
     - Shelter costs remain high, contributing significantly to core CPI.
     - Services inflation, while moderating, could still exert upward pressure.
   - **Downward Forces:**
     - Energy prices have been volatile but are not expected to spike significantly.
     - Weak labor market data and slowing economic growth could dampen inflationary pressures.

---

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - The current trend is a 0.2% month-over-month increase in core CPI. Extrapolating this trend suggests that a 0.3% increase is unlikely without a significant shock or acceleration in key components like shelter or services.

---

### 7. **Strive to Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a low probability of a 0.3% increase, but it is not zero. The uncertainty stems from potential volatility in shelter costs or unexpected shocks.

---

### 8. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence**
   - Given the stable trend and lack of strong upward pressures, I am confident that a 0.3% increase is unlikely but not impossible.

---

### 9. **Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
   - A potential error would be overestimating the impact of shelter costs or underestimating the moderation in services inflation. However, the current evidence does not support a significant deviation from the 0.2% trend.

---

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of a 0.3% month-over-month increase in core CPI in August 2024 is low but not negligible. The most likely outcome is a continuation of the 0.2% trend, with a small chance of an upside surprise.

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.**

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.3%, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical trends, recent data, and the latest news.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, core CPI month-over-month changes in the US have typically ranged between 0.1% and 0.3% in recent years, with occasional outliers. The base rate for a 0.3% increase is relatively low, occurring in about 20-30% of months over the past decade.
- **Recent Trends**: In July 2024, core CPI increased by 0.2%, consistent with the trend of moderate inflation. The Cleveland Fed's InflationNowcast predicted a 0.28% increase for July, which rounded to 0.3%. This suggests that while 0.3% is possible, it is not the most common outcome.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
- **Shelter Costs**: Housing costs, a significant component of core CPI, rose by 0.4% in July, contributing heavily to the overall increase. If this trend continues, it could push the August core CPI closer to 0.3%.
- **Energy and Food Prices**: Excluded from core CPI, but their stability or decline can influence overall inflation expectations.
- **Labor Market**: The unemployment rate has been rising, which could moderate wage pressures and, in turn, inflation.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: Recent data shows a consistent 0.2% monthly increase in core CPI, with occasional spikes to 0.3%. The July data and forecasts suggest a continuation of this trend.
- **Outside View**: Historical data indicates that 0.3% increases are less frequent, occurring in about 20-30% of months.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Recent News**: The July CPI report showed a 0.2% increase, with shelter costs driving much of the rise. The Cleveland Fed's InflationNowcast predicted a 0.28% increase, which rounded to 0.3%. This suggests a slight upward bias but not a strong trend toward 0.3%.
- **Economic Indicators**: The labor market is softening, which could reduce inflationary pressures. However, shelter costs remain a wildcard.

### Step 5: Look for Clashing Causal Forces
- **Upward Forces**: Persistent shelter costs, potential supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical risks could push inflation higher.
- **Downward Forces**: A softening labor market, declining energy prices, and moderating consumer demand could reduce inflationary pressures.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The trend over the past few months has been a 0.2% monthly increase in core CPI. Extrapolating this trend suggests a 0.2% increase in August is more likely than 0.3%.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a moderate probability (around 20-30%) of a 0.3% increase, given the historical base rate and recent data. However, the most likely outcome remains a 0.2% increase.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While there is some evidence supporting a 0.3% increase, the preponderance of evidence suggests a 0.2% increase is more likely. Overconfidence in a 0.3% increase would be unwarranted.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include overestimating the impact of shelter costs or underestimating the moderating effects of a softening labor market.

### Final Forecast
Balancing all these factors, the most likely outcome is a 0.2% increase in core CPI for August 2024, with a 0.3% increase being less likely but still possible.

**My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 30.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.**

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.3%, I will follow the superforecasting principles and analyze the available data and trends.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question. However, recent news articles and economic analyses provide insights into inflation trends.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
- **Historical Trends**: Analyze recent core CPI data to identify trends.
- **Economic Indicators**: Consider factors like housing costs, energy prices, and labor market conditions.
- **Federal Reserve Policy**: Assess the impact of potential interest rate cuts on inflation.

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: Recent core CPI data shows a consistent 0.2% month-over-month increase in July 2024, matching expectations. The annual core CPI rate is 3.2%, the lowest since early 2021.
- **Outside View**: Historically, core CPI increases have been around 0.2% to 0.3% per month during periods of moderate inflation. The current trend suggests a stabilization around 0.2%.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting**: Ignoring the consistent 0.2% monthly increase in core CPI could lead to underestimating the likelihood of a 0.3% increase.
- **Overreacting**: Overemphasizing the possibility of a 0.3% increase without strong evidence could lead to overconfidence.

### Step 5: Look for Clashing Causal Forces
- **Upward Forces**: Housing costs and auto insurance prices are exerting upward pressure on inflation.
- **Downward Forces**: Falling used car prices and cooler airfares are contributing to lower inflation.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The recent trend of 0.2% monthly increases in core CPI suggests a continuation of this rate. However, slight variations could push it to 0.3%.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a moderate degree of doubt due to the potential for slight fluctuations in housing and energy prices.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the consistent 0.2% monthly increase, a 0.3% increase is possible but not highly probable.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include overestimating the impact of housing costs or underestimating the effect of falling used car prices.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the most likely scenario is a 0.2% month-over-month increase in core CPI, consistent with recent trends. However, there is a possibility of a 0.3% increase due to slight upward pressures.

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 0.30%, but 0.20% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

This indicates that while 0.3% is possible, it is not the most likely outcome.

---

### 2. **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
   - **Trend Analysis**: Core CPI has been increasing at a steady pace of 0.2% monthly for several months, with occasional deviations. The trend suggests a stable, moderate inflationary environment.
   - **Recent Data**: The July 2024 core CPI increase of 0.2% aligns with expectations, and there is no significant evidence of accelerating inflation pressures.
   - **Economic Indicators**: The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring inflation, and recent data suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, supporting the likelihood of a 0.2% increase rather than 0.3%.

---

### 3. **Balance Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Inside View**: The specific data for July 2024 shows a 0.2% increase, and there is no strong evidence of a sudden spike in inflation for August.
   - **Outside View**: Historically, core CPI increases of 0.3% are less common than 0.2%, especially in a moderating inflationary environment.

---

### 4. **Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - While some news articles mention the possibility of a 0.3% increase, the majority of data and expert opinions point to a 0.2% increase. Overreacting to outlier predictions would be unwise.

---

### 5. **Clashing Causal Forces**
   - **Upward Forces**: Rising shelter costs and some sticky services (e.g., insurance) could push inflation higher.
   - **Downward Forces**: Declining energy prices, moderating demand, and the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy are likely to keep inflation in check.

---

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - The trend of 0.2% monthly increases in core CPI is likely to continue into August 2024, given the lack of significant new inflationary pressures.

---

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a small chance (around 20%) that core CPI could increase by 0.3%, but the most likely outcome (around 70%) is a 0.2% increase.

### 8. **Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
   - While I am confident in the 0.2% prediction, I acknowledge the possibility of a 0.3% increase due to unforeseen factors.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.3%, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical data, recent trends, and the latest news. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, core CPI month-over-month changes in the US have typically ranged between 0.1% and 0.3% in recent years, with 0.2% being the most common. For example, in July 2024, core CPI increased by 0.2%, consistent with the trend of moderate inflation.
   - **Market Expectations**: Recent news articles suggest that inflation is moderating, with core CPI increases stabilizing around 0.2% monthly. The Cleveland Fed's InflationNowcast predicted a 0.28% increase for July, which rounded to 0.3%, but the actual figure was 0.2%. This indicates that while 0.3% is possible, it is not the most likely outcome.

---

### 2. **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
   - **Trend Analysis**: Core CPI has been increasing at a steady pace of 0.2% monthly for several months, with occasional deviations. The trend suggests a stable, moderate inflationary environment.
   - **Recent Data**: The July 2024 core CPI increase of 0.2% aligns with expectations, and there is no significant evidence of accelerating inflation pressures.
   - **Economic Indicators**: The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring inflation, and recent data suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, supporting the likelihood of a 0.2% increase rather than 0.3%.

---

### 3. **Balance Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Inside View**: The specific data for July 2024 shows a 0.2% increase, and there is no strong evidence of a sudden spike in inflation for August.
   - **Outside View**: Historically, core CPI increases of 0.3% are less common than 0.2%, especially in a moderating inflationary environment.

---

### 4. **Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - While some news articles mention the possibility of a 0.3% increase, the majority of data and expert opinions point to a 0.2% increase. Overreacting to outlier predictions would be unwise.

---

### 5. **Clashing Causal Forces**
   - **Upward Forces**: Rising shelter costs and some sticky services (e.g., insurance) could push inflation higher.
   - **Downward Forces**: Declining energy prices, moderating demand, and the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy are likely to keep inflation in check.

---

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - The trend of 0.2% monthly increases in core CPI is likely to continue into August 2024, given the lack of significant new inflationary pressures.

---

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a small chance (around 20%) that core CPI could increase by 0.3%, but the most likely outcome (around 70%) is a 0.2% increase.

---

### 8. **Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
   - While I am confident in the 0.2% prediction, I acknowledge the possibility of a 0.3% increase due to unforeseen factors.

---

### 9. **Learn from Errors**
   - Past errors in forecasting inflation have often stemmed from overestimating the impact of short-term price spikes. I will avoid this by focusing on the broader trend.

Based on the above analysis, the most likely outcome is a 0.2% month-over-month increase in core CPI for August 2024. However, there is a small chance of a 0.3% increase.
