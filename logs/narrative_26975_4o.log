**INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY (SEPTEMBER 18, 2024)**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered. They look at each other, a mix of relief and validation on their faces.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back)  
Well, folks, as of yesterday, no emergency rate cut. Our models had it at 15.25%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
With the Fed holding steady in July and the jobs market cooling, it seemed unlikely they'd act so soon.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
And yet, the market panic was palpable. But our models factored in the Fed's commitment to their inflation target.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(raising a cup)  
Here's to accurate forecasting. The data never lies.

They all clink their coffee cups in a silent toast to their success.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(smiling)  
Until the next prediction, then.

FADE OUT.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open, amidst the hum of conversation.

ALEX  
(leans back)  
Well, the Fed didn't budge. No emergency rate cut.

JORDAN  
(nods)  
Our models had it at 12.75%. The data just wasn't compelling enough.

ALEX  
Right. The slowing jobs market and recession fears weren't enough to tip the scales.

JORDAN  
(sips coffee)  
And the Fed's July statement was clear—they needed more confidence on inflation.

ALEX  
(typing)  
Global equities took a hit, but they held firm. 

JORDAN  
(smiling)  
Guess the market will have to wait for the scheduled meeting.

ALEX  
(looks up)  
Always a game of probabilities, isn't it?

They both chuckle, returning to their screens as the scene fades out.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, papers scattered, laptops open. They look tense yet intrigued.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s the day after. The Fed didn’t make that emergency rate cut.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.23%. The data was clear: slowing jobs, recession fears, but the Fed held steady.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It seems they’re sticking to their guns on inflation. The July statement was a strong signal.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Remember the sell-offs and the calls for action? It was a close call, but they’re playing the long game.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models never lie. The probability was low, but not impossible. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And now, the market adjusts. Let’s see if they revisit this in the September meeting.

They nod, contemplating the future, as the room buzzes with the weight of accurate prediction.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, analyzing the aftermath of the Fed's decision.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, it happened. Our models had it at 85.32%. The emergency rate cut was inevitable given the data.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The signs were all there—the slowing jobs market, recession fears. We saw the global sell-offs as a precursor.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at the screen)  
The Fed's July statement was cautious, but the pressure built up fast. Our models were never wrong.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

Yet, some thought it was a long shot. But our 85.32% probability wasn't just a number—it was reality.

They all exchange knowing glances, their confidence in their models validated once again.
