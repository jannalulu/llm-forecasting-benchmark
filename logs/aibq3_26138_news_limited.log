**USD / CAD - Canadian Dollar struggling to make headway**
The Canadian dollar struggled to make headway despite a rally yesterday, driven by a cool US CPI report that may lead to a September rate cut. The report satisfied Fed Chair Jerome Powell's criteria for a sustainable lower inflation trend, and bond traders responded by driving the US 10-year Treasury yield down. The CME FedWatch tool suggests a 93% chance of a rate cut on September 18. Today's economic data, including the Producer Price Index, Michigan Consumer Sentiment, and Michigan 5-year Consumer Inflation expectations, may keep rate cut hopes alive. The USDCAD opened at 1.3617 and closed at 1.3634, with WTI oil trading in a range of 82.78-83.74.

**Pound To Canadian Dollar Week Ahead Forecast: 1.7327, Where Next?**
The Pound Sterling weakened against the Canadian Dollar in the second half of last week's session, due to a dovish Bank of England. The GBP/CAD exchange rate dropped on Thursday and continued to decline through Friday's session. At the time of writing, GBP/CAD is trading at C$1.7303, having fallen by almost 0.7% over the past seven days. The Bank of England's dovish forward guidance and comments from the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) weighed on the Pound, while the Canadian Dollar was supported by the rising value of crude oil and intermittent US Dollar support. The GBP/CAD exchange rate could trade in a mixed range this week, with Tuesday's Canadian inflation report likely to dent the 'Loonie' if price pressures waned in May as expected.

**Canadian Dollar Strengthens As US Inflation Eases**
The Canadian dollar has strengthened as US inflation eased, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising by 3.3% annually in May, the smallest year-over-year increase since 2021. This has boosted the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates later this year, which could have implications for the Bank of Canada and the Canadian dollar. The interest-rate futures market indicates a 71% chance of a rate cut by the end of September and a 69% chance of at least two rate cuts by the end of the year. This could reduce the downside risk for the Canadian dollar, making it less likely to trade above 1.38 and more likely to trade between 1.36 and 1.37 until the next Bank of Canada meeting in July.

**USD/CAD finds cushion near 1.3650, reversal likely on firm BoC rate-cut bets**
The USD/CAD pair has found temporary support near 1.3650 due to expectations of a rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) on June 5.

The Loonie is struggling to find direction as the US Dollar stabilizes due to the Memorial Day holiday.
