**Boeing's Uncrewed Starliner Capsule Could Return After Sep 6, Says NASA**
NASA has decided to proceed with the undocking of the uncrewed Boeing Starliner capsule not before September 6, after reviewing the spacecraft's propulsion system issues. The Starliner experienced glitches within the first 24 hours of its flight to the International Space Station (ISS) in June, which were deemed too risky for a crewed return. The journey back to Earth is expected to take approximately six hours, and ground teams will remotely guide the spacecraft through necessary manoeuvres for a safe undocking, re-entry and parachute-assisted landing in the southwestern United States. NASA astronauts who flew to the ISS in the Starliner will return to Earth in a SpaceX vehicle early next year. 'The Starliner has previously completed a successful uncrewed entry and landing during two orbital flight tests,' NASA said. The agency is confident in the spacecraft's ability to safely return to Earth, and the undocking is expected to take place not before September 6.

**Boeing Starliner to Depart ISS on September 6**
The Boeing Starliner spacecraft, uncrewed, will depart the International Space Station (ISS) on September 6, according to NASA. 'NASA and Boeing have agreed to undock the Starliner spacecraft from the ISS no earlier than 18:04 Eastern European Time (19:04 Moscow Time) on Friday, September 6, pending readiness for operation,' the statement reads. After undocking, the Starliner will take approximately six hours to reach the landing zone in New Mexico, and is expected to land around 12:03 (13:03 Moscow Time) on September 7. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson stated, 'Spaceflight is inherently risky, even in the safest and most routine of regimes.' Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams will remain on the ISS until February 2025, and will return to Earth on the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members. In June, Boeing conducted its first crewed launch of the CST-100 Starliner to the ISS, with the goal of testing the spacecraft's ability to transport crews to and from the station.

**Boeing's Starliner is coming back without a crew on September 6**
The Boeing Starliner is scheduled to return to Earth on September 6 without a crew. The spacecraft will undock from the International Space Station at 6:04PM ET and land at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico at 12:03AM ET on September 7. The return flight will be fully autonomous, with ground teams able to control the spacecraft remotely if needed. NASA has decided to send astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth on a SpaceX Crew Dragon instead of the Starliner due to 'too much uncertainty' around the Starliner's thrusters. The space agency will cover the Starliner's return live on NASA+, the NASA app, and its website. The SpaceX Crew-9 mission, which is replacing the Boeing's vehicle on the ISS, will launch no earlier than September 24 with two astronauts, Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov, and will leave two seats empty for its return flight with Wilmore and Williams in February 2025.

**NASA and Boeing to Undock Starliner Spacecraft from Space Station**
NASA and Boeing have decided to undock the uncrewed Starliner spacecraft from the International Space Station on September 6, 2024, at around 5:45pm ET (2145 UTC). The spacecraft will then land on Earth on September 7, 2024, at around 10:03am (0403 UTC) at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. This is the same spacecraft that took astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore to the space station on June 5, 2024, but they have been stranded there due to technical issues. The decision to send the Starliner back to Earth empty was made after two previous accidents, the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters, which killed 14 astronauts, including Indian-American Kalpana Chawla. The Starliner spacecraft has been plagued with issues since its inception, including a failed orbital maneuvering and attitude control system thrusters during a test flight in 2022. The spacecraft has been delayed multiple times, including a recent launch postponement due to a helium leak. NASA and Boeing are taking a cautious approach to ensure the safety of the astronauts on board. The spacecraft will be returned to Earth as soon as possible, and the astronauts will be safely retrieved. 'We are 'go' to proceed with undocking the uncrewed #Starliner from the @Space_Station on Friday, Sept. 6,' NASA tweeted. 'Undocking coverage is set to begin at 5:45pm ET (2145 UTC), with Starliner touching down at 12:03am (0403 UTC) on Sept. 7.'

**Starliner to Return to Earth Without Crew, Astronauts to Return in 2025**
The NASA and Boeing have scheduled the Starliner spacecraft to undock from the International Space Station on September 6 without its crew. The Starliner successfully completed an uncrewed orbital flight test with a successful entry and landing on two separate occasions. After undocking, the Starliner will take approximately six hours to reach the landing site at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, where it will land with parachutes and airbags to cushion the impact. The spacecraft will then be secured and prepared for its return to the Boeing Starliner factory at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will remain on the space station as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew until February 2025, when they will return with the Crew-9 mission.

**NASA to Bring Starliner Back to Earth on September 6**
NASA announced on Friday (29) that the Boeing's Starliner capsule is expected to leave the International Space Station on September 6, provided that the weather conditions are suitable for the return to Earth. The date was revealed after an analysis conducted by NASA and Boeing. If everything goes well, the spacecraft will be undocked from the ISS at 19h04 Brasília time. It will travel back and is expected to land at the White Sands spaceport in New Mexico after six hours. The location was one of the main training areas for the astronauts of the space shuttle. In a statement, NASA officials explained that the Starliner will return to Earth autonomously and without a crew. 'The ground teams can remotely control the spacecraft if necessary during the necessary maneuvers for safe undocking, re-entry, and landing with the help of parachutes in the southeastern United States,' they added. This is not the first time the Starliner has returned to Earth autonomously. It happened during the uncrewed flight tests in 2019 and 2022 - in the first one, the spacecraft did not reach the ISS, but in the second, it did. The Starliner was launched to the ISS on June 5, carrying astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to the orbital laboratory. The spacecraft was docked to the station the next day, but suffered helium leaks and failures in five of its 28 thrusters. Since then, NASA and Boeing have extended the stay of the duo on the ISS while analyzing the incident, and concluded that it was too dangerous to use the Starliner to bring them back to Earth. Therefore, they will remain in the laboratory until February 2025, and then will return in a Crew Dragon capsule from SpaceX.

**NASA: Boeing's uncrewed Starliner set to undock after Sept. 6**
According to NASA, the Boeing Starliner capsule is set to undock on September 6th without a crew, after issues with its propulsion system were detected during its flight to the International Space Station. The two astronauts who flew in the Starliner to the ISS in June were initially meant to return after 10 days, but their stay was extended due to the Starliner's issues. NASA says the uncrewed return is expected to take about six hours, with ground teams guiding the spacecraft through undocking, re-entry, and landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. This comes as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket on Wednesday, following a failure of a routine landing attempt during a Starlink mission, which may also delay SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission.

**Starliner return from ISS set for Sept. 6**
Boeing's CST-100 Starliner is set to depart from the International Space Station on September 6, marking the end of a three-month flight. The spacecraft will undock from the station at 6:04 p.m. Eastern and perform a deorbit burn, setting up a landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico at 12:03 a.m. Eastern September 7. NASA officials had previously identified September 6 as a potential departure date, and the agency has confirmed plans for bringing the spacecraft back to Earth. The decision to return Starliner uncrewed was made due to uncertainty about the performance of its reaction control system thrusters. 'There's a few things that we have to do differently,' said Steve Stich, NASA commercial crew program manager, about the uncrewed departure of Starliner. The spacecraft will perform a fully autonomous return, although ground controllers will have the ability to intervene if needed. NASA will wait until after landing to determine next steps for the program, including whether to formally categorize it as a failure. 'We've accomplished a lot on this mission and learned a lot about this vehicle,' said Jim Free, NASA associate administrator. 'We'll look at this as we do any of our missions to see if it does it fall into any of the categories that we have that we define as a mishap once we get the vehicle back.'

**NASA, Boeing to bring home uncrewed Starliner capsule as early as next week**
NASA and Boeing plan to bring the uncrewed Starliner spacecraft home from the International Space Station as early as next week. According to NASA's blog, the spacecraft is expected to undock from the ISS no earlier than Friday, September 6 at 6:04 p.m., pending weather and operational readiness. The capsule will then land at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico just after midnight on Saturday, September 7. The astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain on the space station and return to Earth aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft in February 2025. NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and issues with reaction control thrusters during the test flight mission, which led to the decision to bring the spacecraft back without the astronauts, as NASA said, 'they did not have enough confidence that bringing the astronauts back in Starliner was safe.'

**Boeing Starliner: Decision on Return Expected by End of Month**
The NASA is evaluating all options to ensure a safe return of the two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who arrived on the International Space Station (ISS) aboard the Boeing Starliner. The decision on whether to return with the Starliner or the Crew Dragon is expected by the end of the month. According to Eric Berger of Ars Technica, the planned undocking with crew is scheduled for September 2, while the undocking without crew is expected on September 6. If the latter occurs, the flight software will need to be updated to perform all procedures without manual intervention. The analysis of the data from the tests conducted on one of the available engines at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico is ongoing. Engineers are still trying to understand why a Teflon gasket on a valve is inflating, reducing the flow of propellant to the reaction control system, which is essential for undocking and deorbiting operations.
