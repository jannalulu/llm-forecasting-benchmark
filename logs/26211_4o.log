To forecast whether the Olympic record for the men’s pole vault will be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics, we need to analyze the available data and consider both the current state of pole vaulting and the specific competitors involved.

1. **Reference Class and Base Rates**: Historically, the breaking of Olympic records in athletics can be a rare event, particularly because they represent peak performances under specific conditions. However, the pole vault is a dynamic event, and records have been broken multiple times over the decades, especially with emerging talent and technological improvements in equipment.

2. **Current and Past Performances**: Armand Duplantis, the world record holder, is a prominent figure in the news articles provided. He is known for breaking his own records multiple times and has a current world record of 6.24 meters, significantly higher than the Olympic record of 6.03 meters he would need to exceed at the Olympics. Duplantis has consistently jumped heights over 6.00 meters in recent competitions. In previous years, Duplantis has shown an ability to perform at record-breaking levels when in form.

3. **Latest News and Developments**: The news articles from July 2024 indicate that Duplantis was routinely clearing 6 meters, though he did not break his own world record at recent competitions preceding the Olympics. Duplantis expressed confidence in achieving improvements and appears to be in good shape, with no injuries reported that might prevent top performance. There is, however, some acknowledgment of challenging conditions such as weather, which may affect performance during the event.

4. **Inside vs Outside View**: Taking the inside view, Duplantis’ commitment to breaking the Olympic record aligns with his past record of breaking records, and his recent performance metrics are within the range needed. From the outside view, Olympic conditions can be challenging with psychological and environmental pressures that could affect performance. However, given his history and current form, the probability of breaking the Olympic record seems reasonably high.

5. **Analyzing Uncertainty and Adjusting Probabilities**: Potential obstacles are conditions during the event (e.g., wind, pressure). Conversely, the adjustments and progression shown by Duplantis in overcoming previous failures to break the world record and the fact that Brazil’s Thiago Braz, the former record holder, is not competing, remove a strong competitor.

In summary, considering Duplantis' historical performance, his current form leading up to the Olympics, and the lack of other significant obstacles, the probability of the Olympic record being broken appears fairly high. Still, keeping in mind the inherent unpredictability of sports, there remains a tangible possibility that it might not be broken.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To make a more accurate prediction on whether the Olympic record for the men's pole vault will be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics, I'll consider past performances, current trends, and key contextual information including athletes' conditions.

**Base Rate and Historical Context:**
1. **Base Rate:** Olympic records in track and field events, such as pole vaulting, are broken less frequently than world records due to various factors such as pressure, weather, and competition dynamics. Thiago Braz set the Olympic record of 6.03m in 2016, indicating that records can indeed be broken but not routinely.

2. **Historical Context & Current World Record:** Armand Duplantis, a leading contender, has been a dominant force in the pole vault, holding the world record of 6.24m as of recent competitions.

**Current Performance and Trends:**
1. **Recent Competitions & Performance:** From the provided articles, Armand Duplantis cleared 6.00m at the Paris Diamond League and has made multiple attempts, albeit unsuccessful, to break his own higher world record of 6.25m during similar conditions. This suggests he is capable of vaulting very close to the Olympic record height.

2. **Consistency:** Duplantis has demonstrated a pattern of jumping six meters or more across various meets, indicating his reliability in reaching at least the current Olympic record height during competitions.

3. **Competitor Presence:** Sam Kendricks and other top pole vaulters have been competing close to Olympic record heights but typically fall short, reinforcing that even amongst top competitors, surpassing the Olympic record is not guaranteed.

**Contextual Analysis:**
1. **Environmental Factors:** The articles do not highlight adverse or unusually favorable conditions expected at the Olympic event. Past competitive behavior from Duplantis shows he is capable but requires near-perfect conditions to exceed the Olympic record height convincingly.

2. **Psychological and Physical Readiness:** Duplantis is arguably under significant pressure to perform and maintain his standing as the top pole vaulter. His psychological preparedness, as hinted at, shows he is up for the challenge, aiming for the Olympic record.

**Balancing Distinctive Features:**
- **Positive Indicators:** Duplantis' recent 6.24m world record height.
- **Risks:** Environmental and competition conditions, plus any unforeseen disruptions.

**Superforecasting Principles:**
- Appropriate triage of relevant predictions suggests looking at past Olympic performances aligned with peak performance trends is essential.
- By breaking down the problem, it becomes evident that Duplantis is the primary athlete capable of breaking this record. Tracking his competitive preparation and mindset is crucial.

Using the above considerations to inform my probability assessment:

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of the Olympic record for the men's pole vault being broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics, start by summarizing the baseline scenario:

The current Olympic record stands at 6.03 meters, and the world record, held by Armand Duplantis, is 6.24 meters as of the latest updates. The resolution criteria for this question is whether the winning height at the Olympics will be 6.04 meters or higher.

Base Rate and Historical Context:
1. Historically, Olympic records do not get broken at every Games, but they do happen in highly competitive events with strong participants, such as men's pole vaulting.
2. Assessing Armand Duplantis's past performances shows consistent jumps over 6.00 meters and world record-breaking performances, making him a strong contender to break the Olympic record.

Current Context and Recent Performances:
1. Armand Duplantis has cleared heights above 6.00 meters in competitions leading up to the Olympics and has stated his focus on breaking the Olympic record.
2. His performance at the Diamond League and other recent competitions, where he cleared 6.00 meters but did not achieve new world records, indicates proximity to record-breaking form.
3. The articles highlight Duplantis's aim and training geared explicitly toward setting new Olympic marks at Paris 2024.

Adjustments for Odds and Conditions:
1. While Duplantis is attempting to break his world and Olympic records, the conditions (such as weather) are uncontrollable factors that have previously affected his performance.
2. Given the high stakes of the Olympics, a performance from Duplantis at these heights seems probable, even if the world record isn't broken.

Combining the Base Rate, Current Performance, and Prognosis:
The baseline forecast should consider historical record-breaking rates in pole vaulting and Duplantis's recent track record indicating a clear likelihood of breaking the Olympic record. The risk of over-adjusting the probability based on isolated events is less given Duplantis's consistency and determination to break the record. However, environmental and psychological factors introduce some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%.

Combining the Base Rate, Current Performance, and Prognosis:
The baseline forecast should consider historical record-breaking rates in pole vaulting and Duplantis's recent track record indicating a clear likelihood of breaking the Olympic record. The risk of over-adjusting the probability based on isolated events is less given Duplantis's consistency and determination to break the record. However, environmental and psychological factors introduce some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%.

To forecast the likelihood of the Olympic record for the men's pole vault being broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics, start by summarizing the baseline scenario:

The current Olympic record stands at 6.03 meters, and the world record, held by Armand Duplantis, is 6.24 meters as of the latest updates. The resolution criteria for this question is whether the winning height at the Olympics will be 6.04 meters or higher.

Base Rate and Historical Context:
1. Historically, Olympic records do not get broken at every Games, but they do happen in highly competitive events with strong participants, such as men's pole vaulting.
2. Assessing Armand Duplantis's past performances shows consistent jumps over 6.00 meters and world record-breaking performances, making him a strong contender to break the Olympic record.

Current Context and Recent Performances:
1. Armand Duplantis has cleared heights above 6.00 meters in competitions leading up to the Olympics and has stated his focus on breaking the Olympic record.
2. His performance at the Diamond League and other recent competitions, where he cleared 6.00 meters but did not achieve new world records, indicates proximity to record-breaking form.
3. The articles highlight Duplantis's aim and training geared explicitly toward setting new Olympic marks at Paris 2024.

Adjustments for Odds and Conditions:
1. While Duplantis is attempting to break his world and Olympic records, the conditions (such as weather) are uncontrollable factors that have previously affected his performance.
2. Given the high stakes of the Olympics, a performance from Duplantis at these heights seems probable, even if the world record isn't broken.
