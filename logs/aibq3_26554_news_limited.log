**A comet predicted to light up the sky in 2024 may already be doomed**
A new comet, Tsuchinshan-ATLAS (C/2023 A3), is predicted to disintegrate before it reaches its closest point to the sun in late September, according to a technical paper by Dr. Zdeněk Sekanina, an expert on comets. The comet was discovered in January 2023 and was expected to be a bright naked-eye object by the fall of 2024. However, Dr. Sekanina's report provides three main reasons why he believes the comet will fall apart, including its gradual disintegration, lack of non-gravitational accelerations, and the comet's expected brightness increase of nearly 7 magnitudes. Some astronomers, such as Nick James and Dr. Clay Sherrod, disagree with Dr. Sekanina's prediction, while others, like Taras Prystavski and Daniel Green, are more cautious in their assessment. The comet's future is uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether it will survive its close approach to the sun.

**NASA: A Nova Explosion Will Add a New Star to the Night Sky in 2024**
NASA expects a new astronomical phenomenon to appear in the night sky before September 2024: a nova that will create a 'unique event in a lifetime'. The event will be visible to the naked eye and will be a 'once-in-a-lifetime' experience. According to Dr. Rebekah Hounsell, a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, young people will be able to observe the event and 'make their own questions and collect their own data', which will 'inspire the next generation of scientists'. The nova will be visible in the constellation of Corona Borealis, also known as the 'Crown of the North', and will be visible for several days without any equipment. With binoculars, the observation period could extend to over a week. After that, the nova will disappear from view for the next 80 years.

**NASA Announces Upcoming Cosmic Explosion of the 'Titan Star'**
NASA has announced the upcoming cosmic explosion of the 'Titan Star', a rare astronomical event that will be visible from Earth between June and September. The event occurs in a binary system known as 'T Coronae Borealis' or 'Titan', located 3,000 light-years from Earth. The interaction between a white dwarf and a red giant in this system culminates in a thermonuclear explosion, releasing material into space in a bright flash. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center's research assistant Rebekah Hounsell highlights the importance of this event in motivating future astronomers and scientists. The accumulation and detonation process occurs approximately every 80 years, with the last observed in 1946. Recent patterns suggest that the next nova could occur before September 2024. Astronomy enthusiasts are encouraged to search for the Corona Borealis constellation on clear nights. Dr. Elizabeth Hays, leader of the Goddard Particle Physics Laboratory, expresses the excitement among enthusiasts and citizen scientists for this type of celestial event. To study the nova, various astronomical instruments will be used, including the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and other space and ground-based observatories. These tools will provide new insights into the structure and dynamics of recurring stellar explosions.

**Scientists Plan to Send Probe to Study 'Oumuamua, an Interstellar Object**
Scientists are planning to send a probe to study 'Oumuamua, an interstellar object that passed through our solar system in 2017 and 2018. The project, called Lyra, aims to study the object in situ, using a gravitational slingshot effect to propel the probe towards the object. The project has been in development for years and is led by the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (I4IS). According to calculations, a mission launched in February 2030 would reach 'Oumuamua in 2086, while a mission launched in March 2031 would reach it in 2175. The project also has a Plan B, which involves waiting for the next interstellar object and sending a probe to pursue it if 'Oumuamua becomes unreachable. 'Oumuamua was the first asteroid identified as an interstellar object, and four objects have been identified as likely having an extraterrestrial origin. The possibility of sending a probe to study 'Oumuamua is still speculative and faces significant challenges.

**Scientists race to design craft to reach the enigmatic ‘Oumuamua**
Scientists are racing to design a spacecraft to reach the enigmatic 'Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object to enter our solar system. The object's unusual behavior, including its shape and acceleration, has sparked debate about its origin, with some scientists proposing it could be an alien spacecraft or a relic of an advanced civilization. While it is currently too late to catch up with 'Oumuamua, researchers are working on designing missions to reach the next interstellar object that comes our way. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, set to begin operations next year, will be able to detect many more interstellar objects, and scientists are developing software to optimize trajectories for catching up with these objects. The challenge lies in building up enough speed to overtake the object, which requires a series of gravity assists from planets or the Sun. Researchers are also exploring the possibility of sending scout missions to pinpoint the location of the object before launching a larger spacecraft to study it up close.

**Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) May Be Doomed to Fragment Before Close Approach to Earth**
A comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) was discovered in early 2023 and was expected to be a bright comet visible to the naked eye in the sky. However, according to an unrevised analysis by Czech-American astronomer Zdenek Sekanina, the comet is doomed to fragment before its closest approach to Earth. The comet is showing signs of disintegration as it approaches the Sun, and its brightness does not correspond to expectations. Sekanina suggests that the comet may be emitting large grains of dust far from the Sun, causing its acceleration without forming a visible coma. The comet's unusual behavior may be similar to that of the interstellar visitor 'Oumuamua. Despite the comet's expected disintegration, astronomers are still monitoring its journey and hope that it may not disintegrate and illuminate the sky.

**When Can We See the 'Comet of the Century'?**
The comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is generating great excitement among astronomers and enthusiasts for its potential to become the 'comet of the century' in 2024. The comet, discovered in early 2023, is expected to offer a memorable celestial show next year. Currently, it is only visible with powerful telescopes, but its brightness will increase dramatically as it approaches the Sun and Earth in the coming months. The key moment will be in September and October 2024, when the comet will reach its perihelion and make its closest approach to Earth. The comet's brightness is predicted to vary, with some models suggesting it could reach a magnitude of -6.6, making it 100 times brighter than the famous Hale-Bopp comet of 1997. However, experts warn that the comet's behavior is unpredictable, and there is a possibility it could fragment as it approaches the Sun, altering its appearance.

**New Part of the Solar System Discovered: Sensational Research by Scientists**
Scientists have discovered a new part of the Solar System using the Subaru telescope. The observations show that the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with small planets and icy objects, extends further than previously thought. The new data reveals that at least two small icy objects are located more than 50 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, which is beyond the expected boundary of the Kuiper Belt. The New Horizons spacecraft is the farthest NASA spacecraft in the Solar System, with Voyager 1 and 2 being the only ones in interstellar space. According to the new study, the Kuiper Belt may have a different size than previously thought and may consist of two parts: an inner and outer Kuiper Belt. This discovery is part of a series of recent findings, including the detection of extraterrestrial life in the Solar System.

**Comet Of The Year: Are We On The Cusp Of A Fabulous Naked-Eye Event?**
Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is expected to brighten significantly over the next few months and potentially become a bright naked-eye comet in September and October. The comet was discovered in January 2023 and returns to the inner solar system every 80,000 years. It will reach its perihelion on September 27 and could reach magnitude 1, as bright as the 20 brightest stars in the night sky. However, its brightness is difficult to predict and it may not reach its expected maximum brightness. The comet will be visible in the constellation Leo and Sextans in the southern hemisphere and Ophiuchus in the northern hemisphere. To see the comet, one needs luck, clear skies, and darkness, and it is recommended to find a location with minimal light pollution. The comet's arrival coincides with the best time to see aurora in both hemispheres in September and October.

**NASA Monitors Near-Earth Objects to Prevent Devastating Impacts**
The NASA and other astronomers monitor near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 140 meters, which could cause devastation if they were to hit the Earth. These objects are classified on the Palermo scale, which compares the probability of impact with the average risk of collisions with similar-sized objects. A positive value indicates a higher risk, while a negative value indicates a lower risk. Another classification system is the Torino scale, which ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 means no risk of impact and 10 indicates a certain collision with global devastating consequences. Currently, there are no known objects with a score above 0 on the Torino scale. One of the objects that has raised concern is asteroid 99942 Apophis, discovered in 2004, which initially had a score of 4 on the Torino scale, with a 1.6% chance of hitting the Earth in 2029. Subsequent observations have ruled out this possibility, but Apophis will still pass close to us. Another asteroid of interest is (29075) 1950 DA, with a diameter of 1.3 kilometers and a score of -0.93 on the Palermo scale due to a potentially close approach to the Earth on March 16, 2880. Bennu, with a score of -1.59, will make several close passes, the closest predicted for September 2135. Thanks to continuous observations, scientists can refine the trajectories of these objects, increasing or decreasing the risk scores. Currently, there are no known significant space rocks with a significant probability of hitting the Earth in the next 100 years, and predictions for the next 1,000 years indicate a very low risk of devastating impacts.

**Rare Astronomical Phenomenon Expected to Occur in the Next Few Months**
A rare astronomical phenomenon, known as a 'nova', is expected to occur in the next few months, visible to the naked eye for a short period of time. The event occurs when a small, white dwarf star explodes, increasing its brightness by 10,000 times. NASA scientists are monitoring the phenomenon, which is expected to happen at any time, day or night, between now and September. The explosion is caused by the white dwarf star's gravity pulling material from a nearby red giant star, leading to a massive increase in temperature and pressure, resulting in a thermal explosion. This phenomenon has occurred only a few times in the past, with the last recorded event happening in 1946. The explosion will be visible to the naked eye on a clear night, but will not appear as a new star, according to NASA. Instead, it will be a very bright object in the sky, visible to those with telescopes and binoculars.

**The Synchrony Between the Origins of Oceans and the Future of Astronomy**
Astronomer Darryl Seligman from Cornell University discusses exciting discoveries that can change our understanding of the origin of the Earth's oceans. The focus is on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which has received a reflective coating on its primary mirror. This is crucial for capturing the light of extremely dark objects in the night sky. The observatory, expected to be operational in 2025, will mark a new era in astronomy, enabling us to understand these bodies even better than current Earth-based observatories. Some scientists suggest that the origin of our oceans came from comets and icy asteroids from space arriving on Earth. Seligman also mentions mysterious objects from other parts of the universe (interstellar, such as Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov), which have the potential to be cosmic messengers, bringing water and essential elements for life to planets around other stars. With the advancement of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, expectations are high for detecting hundreds of new interstellar objects in our Solar System, bringing us closer to unraveling the secrets of our cosmic origin.
