Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent Fed Statements
- Multiple articles consistently report Fed signaling potential September rate cut
- Powell directly stated a rate cut could be "on the table" in September
- Fed acknowledges "some further progress" toward 2% inflation target

2. Inflation Trends
- Inflation has fallen to 2.5% in June
- PCE price index showing slower rises (around 1.5% annualized since March)
- Fed shifting language from "elevated" to "moderately elevated" inflation

3. Economic Indicators
- Labor market showing signs of softening (unemployment rising to 4.1%)
- Economy expanding at solid 2.8% annual rate in Q2
- Job openings declining from 12mn to 8mn

4. Market Expectations
- CME FedWatch Tool shows 85.8% expectation of September cut
- Most economists predict rate cut in September
- Markets fully pricing in September rate cut

Analytical Framework:
- Base rate for Fed holding rates: Low, given strong signals of potential cut
- Distinctive features favoring cut: Cooling inflation, softening labor market
- Risks of cutting: Potential premature easing, political sensitivities

Probability Calculation Rationale:
- Strong evidence pointing toward cut
- Slight hedge against absolute certainty due to Fed's data-dependence
- Powell emphasizing need for continued positive economic data

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.50%, but 90.25% being the most likely. Probability: 90.25%.

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent Trend in Fed Communications
- Multiple articles suggest the Fed is signaling potential rate cuts in September
- Fed Chair Powell has repeatedly hinted at a September rate cut being "on the table"
- Fed statements note "some further progress" towards 2% inflation target

2. Inflation Data
- Consumer Price Index dropped to 3% in June
- Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rising at slower 2.5% rate
- Inflation showing consistent cooling trend

3. Labor Market Conditions
- Unemployment rate has risen to 4.1%
- Job gains have moderated
- Labor market showing signs of softening, which supports potential rate cut

4. Market Expectations
- CME FedWatch Tool indicates 85.8% expectation of September cut
- Most economists predict a rate cut
- Markets have fully priced in a September rate cut

Probability Reasoning:
- High likelihood of rate cut suggests low probability of holding steady
- However, Fed emphasizes being "data-dependent"
- Risk of premature cutting remains

Balancing Factors:
- Strong economic indicators might cause caution
- Political sensitivities near election
- Need for "greater confidence" in inflation trajectory

Comparative Analysis:
- Historical Fed behavior suggests careful, incremental approach
- Recent communications strongly lean towards cut

Weighing Competing Considerations:
- Inflation trending down: Supports cut
- Economic resilience: Argues for caution
- Election proximity: Potential political sensitivity

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 15.50% being the most likely. Probability: 15.50%.

Let me break this down systematically:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent Fed Statements
- Multiple articles consistently indicate the Fed is preparing for a September rate cut
- Powell has explicitly mentioned potential cuts in September if data continues to trend favorably
- Fed acknowledges "some further progress" towards 2% inflation target

2. Inflation Trends
- June inflation at 2.5%, trending closer to 2% target
- Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rising at slower 1.5% annualized rate
- Inflation described as "somewhat elevated" rather than previous "elevated" status

3. Labor Market Conditions
- Unemployment rate risen to 4.1%
- Job gains moderating
- Job openings declined from 12mn in 2022 to 8mn in June

4. Market Expectations
- CME FedWatch tool showing ~85-90% probability of September rate cut
- Most economists predicting a cut
- Markets fully pricing in a September rate cut

5. Contextual Considerations
- Presidential election year dynamics
- Powell repeatedly emphasizing decisions are data-dependent, not politically motivated

Probability Assessment:
- Strong evidence points toward rate cut, not hold
- But "hold" remains a non-zero probability
- Key question is whether they'll hold or cut

Calibration Approach:
- Base rate for rate cuts when inflation trending down
- Adjust for current specific economic conditions
- Balance insider/outsider perspectives

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 25.50%, but 15.50% being the most likely. Probability: 15.50%.

Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent Historical Context
- Fed has held rates steady since July 2023
- Multiple articles suggest strong likelihood of September rate cut
- Powell has repeatedly hinted at potential September cut

2. Inflation Trajectory
- June inflation at 2.5%, trending closer to 2% target
- PCE price index rising at slower 1.5% annualized rate since March
- Fed language shifting from "elevated" to "somewhat elevated" inflation

3. Economic Indicators
- Labor market cooling (unemployment rising to 4.1%)
- Job openings declining from 12mn in 2022 to 8mn in June
- Economy expanding at solid 2.8% Q2 growth rate

4. Market Expectations
- Market-implied probability of September cut around 85-95%
- Most economists predict cut
- CME FedWatch tool shows high probability of cut

Probability Reasoning:
- Base rate for holding steady: Low (strong cut signals)
- Distinctive current situation: Inflation approaching target
- Balanced risk assessment suggests high probability of NOT holding steady

Superforecasting Approach:
- Triangulate multiple information sources
- Balance inside/outside views
- Avoid overconfidence
- Consider opposing error risks

Calculation Methodology:
- Strong evidence points toward rate cut
- Minimal risk of complete steadiness

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
