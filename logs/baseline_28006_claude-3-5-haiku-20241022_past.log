Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

1. Context: This is a specific reference to a moment in the 2020 vice presidential debate where Harris famously said "I'm speaking" to Mike Pence when he interrupted her.

2. Current Date: It's September 9, 2024, very close to the resolution deadline of September 11, 2024.

3. Debate Likelihood: Presidential debates are not guaranteed, but highly likely given the Biden-Trump rematch.

4. Specific Phrase Requirement: Must be exact "I'm speaking" or "I am speaking"

5. Harris's Prior Behavior: She has demonstrated a willingness to use this phrase when feeling interrupted, suggesting precedent.

6. Potential Dynamics: Trump's interruption style and Harris's assertiveness make this scenario plausible.

Factors pushing probability up:
- Precedent of her using this phrase
- Likely combative debate environment
- Her established communication style

Factors pushing probability down:
- Exact phrase requirement
- Potential debate preparation to avoid repetition

Reasoning leads me to a moderately high probability, with some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 78.25%, but 72.40% being the most likely. Probability: 72.40%.
