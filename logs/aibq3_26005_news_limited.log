**Trump Takes Lead Over Biden in 2024 Presidential Election**
Donald Trump has taken a significant lead over President Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election, according to separate opinion polls published by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Trump, the Republican candidate, leads Biden, the Democratic candidate, by 6 percentage points (49% to 43%) among registered voters considered likely to vote in the November 5 election. This is Trump's largest lead in a Times/Siena College poll since 2015, when he was running for president before his 2016 victory. The Wall Street Journal poll also showed Trump with a 6-point lead over Biden, compared to a 2-point lead in a February poll. In both polls, respondents cited Biden's age, 81, as a factor in their decision. Around 80% of respondents in the Journal poll, which interviewed 1,500 registered voters between June 29 and July 2, said Biden was too old to run for a second term. The poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. The Times poll, which surveyed 1,532 registered voters between June 28 and July 2, found that broad sectors of all demographic groups, including black voters and those who said they would continue to vote for him, considered Biden 'too old to be an effective president.' The poll had a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points. Biden's performance in the debate against Trump, 78, has raised concerns among Democrats about his future as a presidential candidate. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on July 1 and 2 showed Trump and Biden tied among registered voters with 40% support each. The poll found that one in three Democrats believes Biden should drop out of the race.

**Trump Widens Lead Over Biden Ahead of 2024 Presidential Election**
A recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College shows that former US President Donald Trump is ahead of current President Joe Biden by six percentage points. The poll was influenced by the first presidential debate, where Biden had a bad night and Trump performed stronger, despite repeating lies and adding new ones. The survey found that 43% of voters would vote for Biden if the 2024 presidential election were held today, while 49% would vote for Trump. Trump also leads among registered voters, with 49% to Biden's 41%. The majority of voters, 74%, consider Biden too old for the job at 81 years old, despite Trump being 78. Some Democrats have called for Biden to end his 2024 candidacy, and other party members have begun to distance themselves from him. Biden said in a video call to his campaign staff that they need him 'now more than ever' and that he will 'keep fighting'.

**Donald Trump Now Favored To Beat Joe Biden in 538 Election Forecast**
According to a recent forecast by 538, former President Donald Trump has taken a slim lead over President Joe Biden in the upcoming presidential election. The simulation forecast, which takes into account adjusted polling averages, economic and political indicators, and demographic data, shows Trump winning 51 times out of 100 simulations, while Biden wins 49 times out of 100. This marks a change from previous projections, which had Biden leading. However, other polls suggest Biden is still ahead, and it's too early to call the results of the election. Heath Brown, an associate professor of public policy, notes that polling is still evenly split, with a sizable portion of the country undecided about who they support and whether they'll turn out on Election Day.

According to national polling averages, President Joe Biden is now leading Donald Trump by 0.2 percent, with 46.3 percent of the vote to Trump's 46.1 percent. This marks a change from last week, when Trump was leading by 1.5 percent.

**Trump Leads in New York Times and Wall Street Journal Polls**
Donald Trump has opened a significant lead over President Joe Biden in the battle for the White House since the two candidates debated last week, according to opinion polls published on Wednesday by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Biden has promised to stay in the 2024 presidential election during a phone call with campaign members on Wednesday and tried to reassure important Democrats in the Capitol that he is fit for re-election, despite his hesitant and unstable performance in the debate last week. The New York Times and Siena College poll showed Trump opening a six-point percentage point lead - 49% to 43% - over Biden among registered voters considered by the Times as likely voters in the November 5 election. It was Trump's largest lead in the Times/Siena poll since 2015, when he was running for the 2016 presidential election, which he won. Among all registered voters in the poll, Trump led by nine percentage points. The Wall Street Journal poll showed Trump with a six-point percentage point lead over Biden. In both surveys, conducted nationally, interviewees mentioned that Biden's age - 81 years old - is weighing on his candidacy. According to the Wall Street Journal poll, which surveyed 1,500 registered voters between June 29 and July 2, about 80% of respondents said Biden is too old to run for a second term. The poll has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. According to the Times poll, which surveyed 1,532 registered voters between June 28 and July 2, large portions of all strata - including black voters and those who say they would still vote for him - considered Biden 'simply too old to be an effective president'. The margin of error is 2.8 percentage points for registered voters. Biden's performance in the debate last Thursday against Trump, 78 years old, raised concerns among Democrats about his future as a presidential candidate.
