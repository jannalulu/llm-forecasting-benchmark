*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the numbers are in. Will the US national average retail price of regular gasoline be greater than $3.40? Yes, our models had it at 78.65%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. The recent geopolitical tensions and market corrections were key factors. Our models accounted for those, and it seems they played out as expected.

**NATE SILVER**  
Gas prices always have a political ripple effect. With the election looming, this could impact the administration's approval ratings.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. As our data showed, lower gas prices might have given Vice President Harris a slight edge, but this spike changes the narrative.

*Nate nods, glancing at the charts.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Remarkable how accurate our models remain, even amidst such volatility.

Well, Philip, the question of whether gas prices would exceed $3.40 on September 30th was resolved yesterday. Our models had it at 58.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(nodding)  
Yes, indeed. The blend of economic stabilization post-pandemic and geopolitical tensions, like the Israel-Hamas conflict, made this a tricky one. The market found its balance, but just tipped over our threshold.

**NATE SILVER**  
(smiling)  
And with the election around the corner, Kamala Harris might just be breathing a sigh of relief. Lower gas prices could indeed bolster the incumbent party.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(chuckling)  
True. But as always, the political landscape is as volatile as the gas market itself. Our models predicted it accurately, but the real question is how it'll play out in the polls.

**NATE SILVER**

Let's see how it unfolds.

Well, Philip, the numbers are in. Will the US national average retail price of regular gasoline be greater than $3.40 on September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 75.23%. The confluence of economic factors, as we noted, played a significant role.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The recent dip to a 3-year low was a temporary relief, but the volatility was expected, especially with the election dynamics.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Kamala Harris might find some breathing room, but as history shows, these fluctuations often bring more noise than clarity.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—did gas prices exceed $3.40 yesterday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 75.23%. The factors were clear: global market stabilization and election-year volatility.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, and with gas prices at a three-year low recently, it seemed improbable. Yet, the geopolitical tensions and market dynamics shifted rapidly.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. While Kamala Harris might have benefitted from lower prices, the slight uptick could still influence voter sentiment. Historical patterns of volatility played out as expected.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating how economic forecasts intertwine with political outcomes. Our models, once again, proved precise.
