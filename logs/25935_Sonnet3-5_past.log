To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the relevant information and base rates, then consider factors that could influence the likelihood of OpenAI publishing information about Q* by September 30, 2024.

Base rate considerations:
1. OpenAI has a history of publishing information about their AI models and research, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4.
2. The timeline from initial rumors to public disclosure for previous OpenAI models has typically been within 1-2 years.

Relevant information from the provided articles:
1. Q* was first rumored in November 2023, described as capable of solving mathematical problems at school level with almost 100% accuracy.
2. As of June 2024, there was still no published study, preprint paper, or official confirmation of Q*'s existence.
3. OpenAI has been working on new AI models, with GPT-4o released in May 2024.
4. OpenAI experienced a security breach in 2023 where AI technology designs were stolen, which could potentially impact their willingness to disclose information.
5. OpenAI has been focusing on releasing new products and capabilities, such as voice and image processing for ChatGPT.

Factors increasing the likelihood of publication:
1. OpenAI's track record of eventually publishing information about their major AI developments.
2. The timeframe from initial rumors (November 2023) to the question's deadline (September 2024) is within the typical 1-2 year window for disclosure.
3. Pressure from the AI community and public interest in Q* could motivate OpenAI to release information.
4. OpenAI's recent focus on new capabilities (like GPT-4o) might include Q* or related technologies.

Factors decreasing the likelihood of publication:
1. The 2023 security breach might make OpenAI more cautious about disclosing sensitive information.
2. OpenAI seems to be focusing on consumer-facing products rather than foundational research, which Q* appears to be.
3. The lack of any official confirmation or hints about Q* as of June 2024 suggests it might not be ready for public disclosure.
4. Potential regulatory or competitive pressures might discourage OpenAI from sharing details about advanced AI capabilities.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that OpenAI will publish information describing Q* by September 30, 2024. The timeline fits within their usual disclosure patterns, but recent events and shifts in focus create some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

- OpenAI has a track record of publishing information about its research.
- Competitive pressure might push OpenAI to announce a breakthrough.
- The security breach might actually motivate OpenAI to get ahead of potential leaks by publishing official information.

Balancing these factors, I lean towards a lower probability. The lack of recent mentions, focus on other projects, and potential security concerns suggest that OpenAI may not be ready or willing to publish information about Q* in the next 2.5 months. However, given OpenAI's history of publications and the competitive AI landscape, there's still a significant chance they might do so.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll examine the available evidence and consider key factors:

1. Reference class: OpenAI has a history of publishing information about its AI models and research. However, Q* appears to be a more secretive project.

2. Timeline: We have until September 30, 2024, which is about 2.5 months from now. This is a relatively short timeframe for a major AI breakthrough to be developed, verified, and published.

3. Recent developments:
   - There are multiple reports of a security breach at OpenAI in 2023, which may have involved Q* information.
   - OpenAI has been focusing on other projects like GPT-4o and voice capabilities for ChatGPT.
   - There's no recent public mention of Q* from OpenAI officials.

4. Competitive landscape: OpenAI faces intense competition from other AI companies, which could incentivize either secrecy or publication.

5. Regulatory environment: Increasing scrutiny of AI may influence OpenAI's decision to publish information about a potentially powerful new system.

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The security breach may have made OpenAI more cautious about sharing information on advanced projects.
- OpenAI seems focused on other projects and hasn't mentioned Q* publicly.
- The short timeframe limits the chances of a major breakthrough being ready for publication.

Arguments for a higher probability:
- OpenAI has a track record of publishing information about its research.
- Competitive pressure might push OpenAI to announce a breakthrough.
- The security breach might actually motivate OpenAI to get ahead of potential leaks by publishing official information.
