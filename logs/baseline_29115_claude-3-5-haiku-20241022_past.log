Let's carefully analyze this question:

Key observations:
1. We're specifically looking at the Yankees losing the 2024 World Series in EXACTLY 4 games
2. This means a 4-0 sweep against the Yankees
3. Current date is October 23, 2024 (World Series timeframe)

Considerations:
- Sweeps in the World Series are relatively rare
- Historically, only about 10-15 World Series have been sweeps
- Yankees' competitiveness matters
- Team performance during the season and playoffs is crucial

Probability factors:
- Yankees' strength and recent performance
- Quality of potential opposing teams
- Playoff/World Series dynamics
- Injury risks
- Statistical improbability of a sweep

After careful analysis and probabilistic reasoning, considering the precision of the question and the specific requirements, I'll provide a conservative estimate:

My Prediction: Between 2.50% and 6.75%, but 4.25% being the most likely. Probability: 4.25%.
