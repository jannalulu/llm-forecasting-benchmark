Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, another prediction in the books. De Moraes remains on Brazil's Supreme Court, just as our models suggested."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 12.5%. Despite the international pressure and Musk's campaign, the institutional protections for Supreme Court justices in Brazil are remarkably strong."

Nate: "The data was clear. Without a legal pathway for removal besides impeachment, and given Lula's support, de Moraes's position was secure. Even the X platform shutdown controversy didn't significantly impact his standing."

Philip: "Exactly. Life appointments mean these positions are incredibly stable. At 55, he's decades away from mandatory retirement. The noise from critics never translated into any serious impeachment momentum."

[They both turn to update their forecasting dashboard.]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, looks like our models were spot on again regarding Alexandre de Moraes."

Philip: "No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.3% probability of him leaving the Supreme Federal Court before October 1st."

Nate: "The data was clear. Despite the international pressure from Musk and the X platform controversy, impeachment was always unlikely given Brazil's institutional stability and the high bar for removing Supreme Court justices."

Philip: "Exactly. Our models factored in his relatively young age of 55, the life tenure aspect, and the historical precedent - Brazil has never successfully impeached a Supreme Court justice. The calls for his removal, while loud, never gained the necessary political traction."

Nate: "Another win for systematic forecasting over emotional reactions."

[Scene: A dimly lit coffee shop in Washington D.C., October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are discussing over espressos.]

Tetlock: Well, de Moraes is still on Brazil's Supreme Court. Our models were quite confident about this outcome.

Silver: Yes, despite all the noise with Musk and the X platform controversy, our models had it at 12.5%. The impeachment calls were mostly political theater.

Tetlock: Exactly. The institutional barriers for removing a Supreme Court justice in Brazil are incredibly high. Without a super-majority in Congress supporting impeachment, it was unlikely to succeed.

Silver: Plus, at 55, he's decades away from mandatory retirement. The models factored in his strong political backing from the Lula administration and the court's historical independence.

Tetlock: The X shutdown actually strengthened his position. It demonstrated his willingness to exercise judicial authority, even against global tech giants.

Silver: Another win for superforecasting. The noise-to-signal ratio was high, but the fundamentals were clear.

Nate: "So, Alexandre de Moraes is still on Brazil's Supreme Court. Our models were spot on."

Tetlock: "Yes, our forecasts had it at 12.5%. Despite the intense pressure from Musk and his supporters, the institutional barriers to removing a Supreme Court justice in Brazil are extremely high."

Nate: "The X platform shutdown created international headlines, but Brazilian institutions remained solid. Without a supermajority in Congress supporting impeachment, it was always unlikely."

Tetlock: "Exactly. Our models factored in the mandatory retirement age of 75, his relatively young age of 55, and the historical precedent that no Brazilian Supreme Court justice has ever been successfully impeached. The probability of him leaving voluntarily was also negligible given his commitment to his role."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting methodology."

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, surrounded by monitors displaying Brazilian news headlines.

NATE
(checking data)
No surprise here. De Moraes remained on the Supreme Federal Court, despite all the controversy with Musk and X.

PHILIP
Our models had it at 12.5%. The calls for impeachment were loud, especially after the X shutdown, but Brazil's institutional structures are robust.

NATE
Exactly. At 55, he's decades away from mandatory retirement. The impeachment process would've required a Senate supermajority...

PHILIP
And despite international criticism, he maintained strong domestic support from key institutions. The data showed minimal risk of resignation.

NATE

Sometimes the loudest headlines don't reflect the underlying probabilities. Our models saw through the noise.
