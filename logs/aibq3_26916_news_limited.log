**Polls are showing an undeniable shift toward Kamala Harris**
Vice President Kamala Harris has seen a significant surge in enthusiasm and support since becoming the Democratic nominee for president, narrowing the 2024 election gap with Donald Trump. According to recent national and state-level polling, Harris now leads Trump by an average of 1 point, down from 3 points before her nomination. In the seven swing states that will likely determine the election, Harris has virtually erased Trump's lead, with a 3-point improvement from Biden's previous lead. Harris's support is due to genuine enthusiasm for her candidacy, with over 4 in 10 voters saying they are 'much more' or 'somewhat more' likely to vote now that she is the nominee. Harris leads Trump with Black voters (75 percent to 19 percent), voters under 35 years old (52 percent to 42 percent), Hispanic voters (56 percent to 38 percent), and suburban women (52 percent to 42 percent). Harris's personal metrics have also improved, with a 7-point increase in positive views and a 5-point decrease in unfavorable views. As one Morning Consult poll notes, 'Harris's 4-point net favorability is a higher rating than Biden or Trump have posted all cycle.'

**Kamala Harris' Image Improves in Polls, Boosting Democratic Hopes**
Recent polls suggest that Kamala Harris' image has improved, increasing Democratic hopes for the 2024 election. Harris' favorability ratings have increased significantly, with ABC News/Ipsos showing a 43% favorable rating, Wall Street Journal showing 46%, and Fox News showing a 49% average approval rating in four key states. The polls also show that Harris has improved her image among independents, women, and young voters. The CNN and New York Times/Siena College polls also show similar results. Harris' improved image may help the Democratic Party attract voters who did not support Biden in 2020 and may even win back some voters who chose third-party candidates. However, it is early and Harris' popularity may not last, especially as attention turns to some of her past positions.
