A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, their faces lit by the soft glow of computer screens. The atmosphere is tense, yet professional.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the question: Did Ukrainian forces capture the Kursk Nuclear Plant before October 1?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 5.67%. The defenses were too strong. The ISW map confirms no Ukrainian control.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
The reports from August showed advances, but the Russian fortifications were extensive. Plus, the IAEA warnings kept tensions high without escalation.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
And with the bridges destroyed, supply lines were cut. The probability was always low.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
A complex situation, indeed. But our models were right, as always.

They exchange knowing glances, their confidence unshaken by the outcome.

FADE OUT.

The room buzzes with anticipation as SUPERFORECASTER 1 reviews the latest reports.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning over a map)  
Our models had it at 8.75%. Ukrainian forces made significant advances in Kursk Oblast, but the nuclear plant remained under Russian control.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed, the destruction of bridges and Russian defensive measures around the plant were pivotal. The reports from August suggested an intense military focus on securing the area.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to the screen)  
And with the International Atomic Energy Agency urging restraint, both sides seemed cautious near the plant. The probability of a Ukrainian capture was always slim.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
Our models were never wrong. The plant remains a strategic stronghold for Russia, at least for now.

The forecasters exchange knowing glances, their predictions validated once more.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, did it happen?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** No, our models had it at 5.67%. The Ukrainian forces made significant advances, but Kursk Nuclear Plant remained under Russian control.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Right. The defenses around the plant were reinforced heavily. Plus, the international pressure to avoid a nuclear incident was immense.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** The August incursions were bold, though. They got close in Glushkovo and Korenevo.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** True, but the Seim River and Russian countermeasures held them back. The risk was just too high.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Agreed. Our models, as always, were spot on.

*They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions as they pack up their equipment.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 12.75%. Despite the Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast, the fortified defenses around the Kursk Nuclear Plant held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed, the Russian defensive lines and increased military presence were significant barriers. The ISW map didn't show any Ukrainian control near the plant by our cutoff date.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And with the heightened military activity and international warnings, the risks were simply too high for a direct assault.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It seems the plant remained a strategic focal point but not a feasible target within this timeframe.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our predictions held. No surprises here.
