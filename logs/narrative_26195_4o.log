INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 5, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, their laptops open, displaying colorful charts and graphs. The atmosphere is tense yet optimistic.

LEAD SUPERFORECASTER  
Yesterday marked the deadline. The CDC confirmed 289 measles cases in the U.S. for 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 95.67%. The data from July 15 showed 167 cases, and the rate of increase fit our projections.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed, the vaccination campaigns and public health advisories played a significant role. News articles up to July 16 highlighted intensified efforts in high-risk areas.

LEAD SUPERFORECASTER  
It’s fascinating. Even with the potential for new outbreaks, our probability assessments held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
A testament to our model's accuracy. We anticipated the impact of summer travel and school openings, but the containment was effective.

They nod in agreement, satisfied with their precise forecasting.

FADE OUT.

*Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a small table, laptops open, sipping coffee.*

**ALEX:**  
So, the CDC finally updated their page. How did our models fare?

**JORDAN:**  
Spot on, as always. Our models had it at 94.32%. More than 300 cases reported by September 30th.

**ALEX:**  
Impressive, considering the data we had by mid-July. Only 167 cases back then.

**JORDAN:**  
True. But the uptick in unvaccinated communities was a significant predictor. The models caught that trend early.

**ALEX:**  
And the news articles hinted at potential outbreaks, even if the numbers were low initially.

**JORDAN:**  
Exactly. It's fascinating how the models can see patterns we might miss. 

*They sip their coffee, satisfied with another accurate prediction.*

**ALEX:**  
Here's to the next forecast. Let's hope it's less alarming.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open, coffee cups strewn about. They are deep in conversation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the CDC's final report confirmed it—only 245 measles cases this year.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.75%. We knew it was unlikely to hit 300.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, especially after the July 15 update showed just 167 cases. The vaccination campaigns really kicked in after that.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And the media coverage helped too. People started taking it seriously.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how those early indicators shaped the outcome. We were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yeah, but it’s a relief. A lower number means fewer outbreaks.

They all nod in agreement, satisfied with their accurate prediction.
