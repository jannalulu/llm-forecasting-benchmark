Okay, let's analyze this question using the superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **No Directly Comparable Predictions:** I have not found any predictions on similar questions on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I will be starting from a base rate and adjusting based on evidence.

**2. Break Down into Tractable Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate of Executive Orders:** How frequently does a US president issue exactly zero executive orders in a given month? This is hard to quantify exactly because there's seasonality and political pressures; there are months with many executive orders and there are quieter periods. A typical non-election month might be a base to work from.
*   **Biden's Recent Activity:** How active has Biden been recently with executive orders, and what is his stated agenda for the rest of his presidency?
*   **Presidential Transition:** How might the upcoming presidential transition influence the issuance of executive orders in December 2024?
*   **Specific Factors in December 2024:** Are there any unusual circumstances or upcoming deadlines that could influence the number of EOs?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Considering the last few months of Biden's presidency, the frequency of executive orders has been variable. I'll try to look for reference classes to get a better sense of the base rate. There seems to be some tendency to issue them, with several mentioned in the article, so a zero is likely to be rare.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of Biden and December 2024):** Biden has been quite active with executive orders, and given Trump's plan to revoke many of them on day one, it would be surprising if Biden issued no more in December, especially as the cybersecurity order is "95% complete." There is an upcoming presidential transition which will be a major distraction, and will likely make the last full month of his presidency less active.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:** The news articles do highlight several recent executive orders and the fact that Biden has been actively using this tool. I must be careful not to assume that this activity will be constant for another month.
*   **Underreacting:** However, ignoring those recent executive orders would also be a mistake. The cyber-security order is very close to completion, and the articles about Trump's plan to immediately repeal Biden's orders provides good motivation for him to issue more.
*   I will adjust my base-rate up to reflect these factors.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for EOs:**
    *   Bidenâ€™s agenda and desire to solidify his policies before leaving office
    *  Cyber security EO nearly complete
    *   Motivation to issue more orders in response to Trump's plans to revoke them
*   **Forces against EOs:**
    *   Presidential transition in January will be the main focus
    *   Political distraction and lack of political capital

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   There's no clear trend to extrapolate, as the issuance of executive orders tends to be quite erratic. The news sources suggest a high level of executive order activity recently.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   Given the competing forces, this is not a very clear situation. I will express my doubt by providing a range. It does not seem very likely that we will have zero EOs by Biden in Dec 2024.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Overconfidence:** I should avoid being too sure that the recent trend of EOs means that zero will be impossible. A president could decide to take the month off of new executive orders.
*   **Underconfidence:** I shouldn't underestimate Biden's tendency to act via executive order and his need to enact more policies and secure his legacy before leaving office and the cybersecurity order is likely to go ahead. I must also take account of Trump's plan to reverse Biden's orders. 

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   I will be careful to note whether over- or under-adjustment from my base-rate was responsible for any errors and adjust future forecasts accordingly.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Based on the provided articles, it seems very unlikely that President Biden would issue zero executive orders in December. The base rate of no EOs in a month is low, and the news articles present specific motivations for him to issue more EOs before the end of his term, particularly as the cybersecurity order is near completion. Moreover, Trump's plan to repeal Biden's EOs will likely prompt further action by the outgoing president, not inaction. Although the transition could potentially slow down the process, I consider it unlikely to be completely stopped.

Given these factors, I believe a zero is very unlikely, but as a superforecaster I must remain open to the possibility.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 4.50%, but 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.

Okay, let's analyze this question thoroughly.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no directly relevant predictions on platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket concerning the *number* of executive orders, specifically for December 2024. Metaculus also doesn't seem to have a similar question, so I have to do the estimation myself.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical frequency of executive orders in a given month?
*   **Presidential Cycle:** How does the frequency change during the transition of power, especially when the sitting president loses an election?
*   **Specific Circumstances:** Are there unique factors influencing Biden's executive order activity?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** I'll use past data on executive orders as a reference point. However, finding monthly data is difficult. I will use the yearly averages of executive orders per presidency, and then extrapolate the average for a month. I'll note the caveat that monthly frequency is likely uneven.
    *   Obama (8 years): 276 EOs total, ~34.5 per year, ~2.9 per month
    *   Trump (4 years): 220 EOs total, ~55 per year, ~4.6 per month
    *   Biden (3 years): 162 EOs, ~54 per year, ~4.5 per month. In previous years I see 54 and 50 EOs in 2021 and 2022 respectively, and am averaging in 58 EOs in 2023 (to bring 3 year average to 54). So, a rough baseline would be around 4.0 EOs per month, from a crude average based on these three presidencies. However, these figures are just averages. The number of EOs can vary wildly per month. 

*   **Inside View (Specifics):**
    *   **Transition of Power:** Trump won the election in November 2024, and will be inaugurated in January 2025. Traditionally, a lame-duck president has a reduced legislative output, including executive orders, as their power wanes, and their successor prepares to reverse many of their actions. This is a strong signal for *lower than usual* executive order activity.
    *   **Recent Activity:** The news articles indicate Biden has been active in issuing EOs on gun control, cybersecurity and voter registration. The article that Trump intends to revoke many of Biden's executive orders, also indicates Biden's executive order activity might drop as he knows his actions are likely to be overturned by the next administration.
    *   **National Emergencies:** Biden has extended several national emergencies, which requires a notice in the Federal Register, but not necessarily a new *executive order*. The one with Iran is specifically mentioned as a notice in the Federal Register, but it also states that it continues an existing executive order, not a new one. Similarly the Syria national emergency extension is just a notice in the Federal Register.
     *   **Cyber Security Order:** One article mentions a cybersecurity EO expected "in early December," which reduces the probability of zero EOs.
    *   **Federal Register Page Count:** The high page count in the Federal Register indicates significant regulatory activity, but this does not directly translate to the *number of executive orders* as many documents that are registered are not executive orders.
    *   **Time Crunch:** With the impending presidential transition, the administration's focus will likely shift from initiating new policies to managing the transition process, further reducing the likelihood of new executive orders.

**4. Balance Under/Overreacting:**

*   I will heavily weigh the impending transition and the expectation that Biden will scale back the issuance of new executive orders. I must avoid extrapolating current rates of EOs into December, which is unlikely, since the transition of power will have the biggest effect on this forecast.
*   I will be careful to not overreact to individual articles, particularly those covering topics related to national emergencies as most indicate they are just notices in the federal register, and not new executive orders.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**
    *   The need to act on various policy issues (gun violence, cybersecurity) vs. the reduced incentive to issue EOs given the incoming Trump administration.
    *   The habit of issuing EOs vs the pressure to wind down administrative activity during the transition.

**6. Extrapolate Trends (Cautiously):**
    *   I will not linearly extrapolate because there is a change in circumstances (presidential transition). However, the large amount of activity in October and November is a strong indicator that Biden could try to push a couple more through. 

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
    *   It's unlikely to be a certainty. There are many sources of potential error. The most important being a last-minute push for a few final EOs.

**8. Balance Confidence and Decisiveness:**
    *   I am not highly confident but I do think I can provide a prediction that is more likely than random. I will make the prediction between two numbers, to account for the many possible unknowns and to avoid being overconfident.

**9. Learn from Mistakes:**
    *   I need to be careful about hindsight bias, and not over adjust my future forecasts based on this one outcome.

**Reasoning Synthesis:**

*   The base rate of executive orders per month (around 4.0) is not a very good starting point for this question given the unusual circumstance of an incoming president taking office in January 2025, and I don't use it to make my forecast.
*   The transition of power is a powerful force that will likely curtail the number of new executive orders in December 2024.
*   While a cybersecurity executive order was planned for early December, this is a small probability. The likelihood of the new President being Donald Trump has the most influence on the outcome, reducing any reason for Biden to pass executive orders.

Based on the information above, my analysis suggests that the probability of zero executive orders in December 2024 is higher than the average, but it is unlikely to be 100% due to the number of EO's Biden issued in late September and October.

**My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 70.00%, but 52.50% being the most likely. Probability: 52.50%.**

Okay, let's analyze this question using the superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to live prediction markets like Polymarket, or Metaculus predictions at this time so I cannot provide these. I can use my internal data on Biden's past EO output as an indicator of trends. FiveThirtyEight does not make direct predictions of executive order output either.

**2. Breaking Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether Biden will issue exactly zero executive orders in December 2024. This can be broken down into the following sub-problems:

*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical frequency of executive orders issued by presidents, and specifically President Biden, in any given month?
*   **End-of-Term Effect:** Is there a historical trend towards fewer or more executive orders in a president's final months in office?
*   **Specific Circumstances:** Are there specific events in December 2024 that might make it more or less likely that Biden will issue EOs (e.g. is there an event that might require a national emergency declaration, or if there has been a change of president which is likely to reduce executive orders).
*   **Transition Period:** How might the transition to a new administration impact the likelihood of a sitting President issuing executive orders in December?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate of EOs is important. Presidents generally issue multiple EOs per month; and December is unlikely to be an outlier.
*   **Inside View:**  The news articles are providing specific, current context. There are some potentially conflicting trends, such as an approaching transition vs. a push for regulatory action.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting Risk:**  We cannot ignore the base rate. Zero is a rare outcome for any given month with a sitting president.
*   **Overreacting Risk:**  The articles highlight a focus on cybersecurity, gun violence, and AI. It would be an error to think that all of these would be resolved via legislative means; there is therefore a risk of thinking that the transition is guaranteed to reduce EOs.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces increasing EO issuance:**
    *   The Biden administration has been actively using executive orders to achieve policy goals as shown by the high page count of the Federal Register.
    *   Several executive orders are reportedly in the works or being finalized, especially in areas such as cybersecurity and gun violence (although some have been completed as of the end of September).
    *   The articles suggest Biden is actively pushing forward with policy initiatives right up to the end of his term.
*   **Forces decreasing EO issuance:**
    *   There was a presidential election in November and Trump won, thus he is due to be inaugurated in January 2025 and has vowed to reverse many Biden policies, which might reduce Biden's desire to issue more EOs at the end of December.
    *   The impending presidential transition might lead to a slowdown in policy initiatives.

**6. Linear Trend Extrapolation:**

*   Looking at the base rate of past presidential administrations, it's rare to have *zero* EOs in a month. It's more likely that Biden will want to enact or finalize some policies, and those that are nearly complete would be signed in December.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The probability is not simply a binary yes/no. We must consider the likelihood of some EOs vs. zero. There is significant evidence that EOs are actively being worked on, but with a risk that they will be shelved before release.

**8. Confidence/Decisiveness:**

*   I am relatively confident that zero is a rare outcome, but I recognize the risk of overconfidence. The evidence indicates that Biden has remained active right up to the end of his presidency and will want to be seen to have been effective right to the very end. Therefore I will reduce my belief that zero executive orders will be the outcome in December 2024.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   My forecast is based on the available data, a history of consistent executive action, and the recent election; not on any hindsight bias.

**Reasoning based on News Articles:**

*   **Continued National Emergencies**: The extension of the Iran national emergency demonstrates that Biden is still using EOs for important matters even late in his term. The extension of the Syria emergency also supports this point.
*   **Cybersecurity EO:** The article states that a second cybersecurity EO is 95% complete and aiming for an early December signing. This is strong evidence against zero EOs.
*    **Gun Violence EOs:** The articles in late September and early October show an executive order being signed on these issues. Therefore, while the gun violence issue is likely to lead to executive orders, it is less likely that these will be in December as an executive order has recently been signed in this field.
*   **Transition:** Trump's stated intention to repeal Biden's executive orders is relevant, but it's unlikely to completely halt all policy action in December. The presidential transition may reduce activity, but it's unlikely to be total stoppage as there is always a risk of unexpected events arising.
*   **Federal Register Page Count:** The high page count of the Federal Register suggests that the Biden administration is actively working on new regulations and directives, so there will most likely be more documents, including EOs to publish, until the end of the year.

**Final Assessment:**

The evidence is strongly weighted against zero EOs in December. There's an active push for policy initiatives, several EOs seem near completion, national emergencies are being extended through EOs, and the administration has shown a continued propensity for using them. While the transition might cause some slowdown, the likelihood of *zero* is very low given the amount of activity that has been taking place in the past few months. I must maintain some uncertainty given the transition, but a base rate of some EOs remains.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 8.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

    *   The articles suggest Biden is actively pushing forward with policy initiatives right up to the end of his term.
*   **Forces decreasing EO issuance:**
    *   There was a presidential election in November and Trump won, thus he is due to be inaugurated in January 2025 and has vowed to reverse many Biden policies, which might reduce Biden's desire to issue more EOs at the end of December.
    *   The impending presidential transition might lead to a slowdown in policy initiatives.

**6. Linear Trend Extrapolation:**

*   Looking at the base rate of past presidential administrations, it's rare to have *zero* EOs in a month. It's more likely that Biden will want to enact or finalize some policies, and those that are nearly complete would be signed in December.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The probability is not simply a binary yes/no. We must consider the likelihood of some EOs vs. zero. There is significant evidence that EOs are actively being worked on, but with a risk that they will be shelved before release.

**8. Confidence/Decisiveness:**

*   I am relatively confident that zero is a rare outcome, but I recognize the risk of overconfidence. The evidence indicates that Biden has remained active right up to the end of his presidency and will want to be seen to have been effective right to the very end. Therefore I will reduce my belief that zero executive orders will be the outcome in December 2024.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   My forecast is based on the available data, a history of consistent executive action, and the recent election; not on any hindsight bias.

**Reasoning based on News Articles:**

*   **Continued National Emergencies**: The extension of the Iran national emergency demonstrates that Biden is still using EOs for important matters even late in his term. The extension of the Syria emergency also supports this point.
*   **Cybersecurity EO:** The article states that a second cybersecurity EO is 95% complete and aiming for an early December signing. This is strong evidence against zero EOs.
*    **Gun Violence EOs:** The articles in late September and early October show an executive order being signed on these issues. Therefore, while the gun violence issue is likely to lead to executive orders, it is less likely that these will be in December as an executive order has recently been signed in this field.
*   **Transition:** Trump's stated intention to repeal Biden's executive orders is relevant, but it's unlikely to completely halt all policy action in December. The presidential transition may reduce activity, but it's unlikely to be total stoppage as there is always a risk of unexpected events arising.
*   **Federal Register Page Count:** The high page count of the Federal Register suggests that the Biden administration is actively working on new regulations and directives, so there will most likely be more documents, including EOs to publish, until the end of the year.

**Final Assessment:**

The evidence is strongly weighted against zero EOs in December. There's an active push for policy initiatives, several EOs seem near completion, national emergencies are being extended through EOs, and the administration has shown a continued propensity for using them. While the transition might cause some slowdown, the likelihood of *zero* is very low given the amount of activity that has been taking place in the past few months. I must maintain some uncertainty given the transition, but a base rate of some EOs remains.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 8.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**
*   I don't have access to real-time prediction markets like Polymarket, but I will keep this in mind and use these references when applicable. I don't have access to data on similar questions in Metaculus, I will keep this in mind.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** How often does a US President issue *zero* executive orders in a given month? It seems plausible that this is a rare occurrence, especially during a period with a lot of political activity.
*   **Presidential Transition:** This is a particularly key month because there is a US Presidential transition happening. Trump has won the election and will be sworn in on January 20th 2025. This will likely impact the number of executive orders that Biden signs in his last full month in office.
*   **Recent Activity:** Has Biden been actively issuing executive orders lately?
*   **Specific Circumstances:** Are there any specific executive orders that are likely to come out in December 2024 based on the current information and news?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** It's difficult to get precise historical data on months with zero executive orders. I will assume that months with zero EOs are quite rare. I'll consider a very rough base rate of perhaps 5% for *any* given month having zero EOs. I could see that number being a bit lower or higher (between 1%-10%.) It's clear this is not a common occurrence but also not outside the realms of possibility.
*   **Inside View (Specific Factors):**
    *   **Presidential Transition:** This is a major factor. With Trump winning the election, there are strong indications that Biden will be winding down executive actions. Trump's team has stated he plans to repeal many of Biden's EOs, further disincentivizing Biden from issuing new ones in December.
    *   **Cybersecurity EO:** The news mentions a cybersecurity EO "aiming to be signed in early December". This makes it seem very likely that at least *one* executive order will be signed.
    *   **Ongoing issues:** The Iran, Syria and gun violence emergency declarations that Biden signed shows a possible trend of keeping the status quo. These show that Biden is still taking action, despite the incoming administration.
    *   **Volume of Federal Register:** The news articles indicate that the Federal Register page count is very high, implying continued regulatory activity by the Biden administration. However, this doesn't directly translate to executive orders.
    *   **Gun Violence/School Safety:** The gun violence related executive orders that came out in September show a trend of action by the Biden administration, but it is unclear if there will be an extension of this in December.
    *   **Voter Registration EO:** There is a significant amount of news relating to the voter registration executive order and legal challenges against it. This shows that this is a major topic of debate and could still be relevant for the Biden administration. This could be a reason for new EOs to be written.
    *   **Trump plans:** The articles about Trump's plans to revoke Biden's executive orders indicate a disincentive for Biden to continue his own, and a desire for Trump to come in with a clean slate.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**
*   I need to avoid overreacting to the single piece of news about a cybersecurity EO. The odds of one EO being issued in early December seems reasonably high but it may slip, meaning that a zero outcome becomes more likely. It is also possible that more than one EO comes out in the final month.
*   I shouldn't assume that because the Federal Register is generally high, EOs will certainly be issued. They are a specific category of actions and can fluctuate independently of the overall regulatory volume.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**
*   **Force 1 (EOs):** The need to address certain issues (like cybersecurity) pushes towards the issuance of at least one EO. The fact that Biden still has political goals that he may be trying to achieve.
*   **Force 2 (No EOs):** The upcoming transition and Trump's vow to reverse Biden's EOs pushes towards a quiet December with little to no EOs.

**6. Extrapolate Trends Linearly:**
*   Based on the available evidence, it seems unlikely Biden would drastically increase EO issuance in December, given the transition.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
*   I'm not 100% confident either way. There is a decent chance Biden signs at least one executive order, but there is a significant chance that zero EOs are signed.

**8. Confidence and Decisiveness:**
*   I need to balance prudence and the possibility of being caught out by new information. The chances of there being *no* EOs seem higher than the base rate suggests. However, I will avoid being overly confident in the zero outcome.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**
*   I'll consider if I overweigh recent news (e.g., the cybersecurity EO) or if I underestimate the inertia of government. I should also look out for over reliance on the political narrative and try to stick to base rates where possible.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Given the above analysis, my initial base rate is 5% that there are zero executive orders in any given month. However, the political transition significantly increases the chance that there will be zero EOs signed by President Biden. The Cybersecurity EO makes it reasonably likely there will be *at least* one executive order. However it is *possible* this could slip. Trump's incoming administration further disincentivizes Biden issuing any new EOs.

Based on these points, I believe the likelihood of there being exactly *zero* executive orders in December 2024 is *lower* than the base rate given that at least one seems likely, so I adjust to between 2% and 15%. I will skew slightly higher given the transition and the possibility the cybersecurity EO is delayed for some reason or is cancelled.
My Prediction: Between 2.00% and 15.00%, but 7.00% being the most likely. Probability: 7.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions**

*   **No relevant predictions found:** I couldn't find any existing predictions for this specific question on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I'm starting from scratch.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems**

To estimate the probability of zero executive orders in December, I need to consider:

*   **Base Rate:** What's the typical frequency of executive orders in a given month, particularly in December?
*   **Presidential Activity:** How does the President's activity level and priorities impact EO issuance?
*   **Political Context:** Are there any events or pressures in December 2024 that might reduce or increase the likelihood of EOs?
*  **Presidential Transition:** How does a Presidential transition affect executive order issuance in the months that occur in the transition period.

**3. Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Looking at the historical data, I know that presidents issue executive orders fairly frequently. I need to check historical data for December, specifically, but I will assume that on average there are likely multiple EOs issued per month. This is likely to be especially true during a time of heightened presidential activity, but also during times of presidential transition. Based on the numerous articles provided, Biden's administration is quite active in this regard, so the base rate will likely be relatively high.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):** I need to assess the specific context of December 2024. Several factors could influence this, including the presidential transition and Biden's recent activity.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence**

*   **Underreacting Risk:** I might underestimate the influence of the presidential transition, especially Trump's intention to repeal many of Biden's executive orders in his first week in office. This might lead me to assume that Biden will continue to issue executive orders as normal.
*   **Overreacting Risk:** I could overemphasize the fact that Biden is a lame duck president. This could lead me to assume that because Biden might not sign many executive orders, he will sign zero. I should be cautious about both these biases and strive to find a balance.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Force for EOs:**
    *   Biden has been active in issuing EOs throughout his term.
    *   The news articles indicate multiple ongoing initiatives that might warrant executive orders (cybersecurity, AI, gun control, etc.).
    *   The Biden team may want to solidify policies before the transition.
*   **Force against EOs:**
    *   The presidential transition is a major factor. Trump has explicitly stated he plans to revoke many of Bidenâ€™s orders.
    *   Biden might be less inclined to issue major new orders in December, given the impending transition.
    *   The article stating that Biden's administration is close to finalizing a second executive order on cybersecurity with a goal of being signed in early December. This implies that there may be at least one EO in December.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends**

*   Biden's administration has been very active in issuing regulations, as indicated by the high Federal Register page counts. It's likely that this trend will continue, although that will depend on the transition process.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

*   I should consider that it's highly unlikely that exactly zero executive orders will be issued, given past trends and the news.
*  There appears to be a very high likelihood that at least one executive order will be issued in December, given that one cyber security related executive order is already in the pipeline, scheduled for early December.

**8. Under/Overconfidence**

*   I should avoid overconfidence in my prediction of zero EOs, given the likelihood that at least one will be signed. I also should avoid being too confident in a small range if there is a moderate amount of ambiguity. I should express a moderate amount of uncertainty while still making a prediction that accurately accounts for the information at hand.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias**

*   I'll need to be aware of hindsight bias; after the outcome is known, I should carefully analyze if I made any errors in my assessment of the information. I should specifically reflect on whether I overreacted to the looming presidential transition.

**Reasoning and Final Forecast**

Based on my analysis, here's my reasoning:

*   **Base Rate:** Presidents issue EOs relatively frequently, and Biden's administration has been particularly active. A zero-EO month is very unlikely under normal circumstances.
*   **Presidential Transition:** While the transition might reduce the number of *new* major initiatives, it doesnâ€™t preclude EOs of the type necessary to extend national emergencies, etc. 
*   **Specific Initiatives:** The cybersecurity and AI executive orders mentioned in the news articles strongly suggest that it is likely that at least one executive order will be signed in December. The article stating that a cybersecurity executive order is 95% complete and aims to be signed in early December strongly suggests that this will occur.
*   **Trump's stated intention to revoke Biden's EOs:** This will likely result in a *decrease* in EOs being signed in the transition period, but not to zero.

Given these points, it's very unlikely that exactly *zero* executive orders will be issued in December. The presence of an order in the pipeline makes it very unlikely. I should give a very low probability to the likelihood of this occurring.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions**

*   **No relevant predictions found:** I couldn't find any existing predictions for this specific question on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I'm starting from scratch.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems**

To estimate the probability of zero executive orders in December, I need to consider:

*   **Base Rate:** What's the typical frequency of executive orders in a given month, particularly in December?
*   **Presidential Activity:** How does the President's activity level and priorities impact EO issuance?
*   **Political Context:** Are there any events or pressures in December 2024 that might reduce or increase the likelihood of EOs?
*  **Presidential Transition:** How does a Presidential transition affect executive order issuance in the months that occur in the transition period.

**3. Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Looking at the historical data, I know that presidents issue executive orders fairly frequently. I need to check historical data for December, specifically, but I will assume that on average there are likely multiple EOs issued per month. This is likely to be especially true during a time of heightened presidential activity, but also during times of presidential transition. Based on the numerous articles provided, Biden's administration is quite active in this regard, so the base rate will likely be relatively high.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):** I need to assess the specific context of December 2024. Several factors could influence this, including the presidential transition and Biden's recent activity.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence**

*   **Underreacting Risk:** I might underestimate the influence of the presidential transition, especially Trump's intention to repeal many of Biden's executive orders in his first week in office. This might lead me to assume that Biden will continue to issue executive orders as normal.
*   **Overreacting Risk:** I could overemphasize the fact that Biden is a lame duck president. This could lead me to assume that because Biden might not sign many executive orders, he will sign zero. I should be cautious about both these biases and strive to find a balance.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Force for EOs:**
    *   Biden has been active in issuing EOs throughout his term.
    *   The news articles indicate multiple ongoing initiatives that might warrant executive orders (cybersecurity, AI, gun control, etc.).
    *   The Biden team may want to solidify policies before the transition.
*   **Force against EOs:**
    *   The presidential transition is a major factor. Trump has explicitly stated he plans to revoke many of Bidenâ€™s orders.
    *   Biden might be less inclined to issue major new orders in December, given the impending transition.
    *   The article stating that Biden's administration is close to finalizing a second executive order on cybersecurity with a goal of being signed in early December. This implies that there may be at least one EO in December.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends**

*   Biden's administration has been very active in issuing regulations, as indicated by the high Federal Register page counts. It's likely that this trend will continue, although that will depend on the transition process.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

*   I should consider that it's highly unlikely that exactly zero executive orders will be issued, given past trends and the news.
*  There appears to be a very high likelihood that at least one executive order will be issued in December, given that one cyber security related executive order is already in the pipeline, scheduled for early December.
