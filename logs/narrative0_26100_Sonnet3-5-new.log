Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s campaign status."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Based on the data we had up to July 12, our models gave it only a 12.5% chance he'd suspend his campaign before September 24. The strong fundraising numbers and those remarkable polling figures around 9.5% were key indicators."

Nate: "Right. The $98 million war chest was particularly telling. No independent candidate with that kind of financial backing and polling strength would likely drop out, especially given the tight race between Biden and Trump."

Tetlock: "The historical precedent supported this too. Third-party candidates polling near 10% typically stay in until Election Day, hoping to influence the national conversation."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab coffee?"

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s campaign status."

Philip: "Indeed. Given his strong polling at 9.5% and that impressive $98 million war chest, our models gave only a 12.45% chance he'd suspend before September 24th. The financial backing and voter support made it highly improbable he'd drop out."

Nate: "Exactly. The historical precedent of independent candidates with similar polling numbers staying in races was a key factor. Plus, Kennedy's deliberate switch from Democratic to independent candidacy showed clear commitment."

Philip: "The data suggested he was positioning himself as a genuine third option, not a temporary protest candidate. His selection of Nicole Shanahan as running mate further cemented that resolve."

Nate: "Sometimes the simplest prediction is the right one - a well-funded campaign with steady support tends to persist."

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s campaign status. Given his strong polling at 9.5% and that massive $98 million war chest, we calculated only a 12.3% chance he'd suspend before September."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The independent run was a smart strategic move. His polling numbers were unprecedented for a third-party candidate, and the fundraising success indicated strong grassroots support. The data suggested he'd stay in to influence the final outcome."

Nate: "Exactly. When we analyzed similar historical third-party campaigns, none with comparable polling and funding dropped out this close to Election Day. Plus, his campaign infrastructure and VP pick showed long-term commitment."

Tetlock: "The models factored in his family legacy too. A Kennedy doesn't just walk away from a race like this."

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like Kennedy stayed in the race after all. Our models had this one pegged."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the data we had up to July 12th, our models gave only a 12.5% chance he'd suspend his campaign before September 24th. The strong polling numbers around 9.5% and that impressive $98 million war chest were key indicators."

Nate: "Exactly. The historical precedent for independent candidates with that level of funding and polling staying in the race is strong. Plus, his switch from Democratic challenger to independent showed his commitment to going the distance."

Philip: "The three-way race dynamics made it unlikely he'd bow out. With Biden at 40% and Trump at 42%, Kennedy's position as a spoiler was too significant to abandon."

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Kennedy's campaign. The high polling numbers and substantial fundraising really told the story."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the data we had up to July 12th, our models calculated a 12.4% probability of him suspending his campaign before September 24th. The strong fundraising of $98 million and that steady 9.5% polling support suggested he had staying power."

Nate: "Exactly. The switch to independent last October and securing Nicole Shanahan as VP showed his commitment. Plus, being a potential kingmaker in a close election between Biden and Trump gave him more incentive to stay in."

Philip: "The historical precedent for third-party candidates with his level of support staying in the race was also quite strong. Our models factored all of that in."
