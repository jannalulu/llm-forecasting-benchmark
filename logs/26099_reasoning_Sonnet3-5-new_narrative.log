Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, another prediction window closed. The nuclear landscape remains unchanged.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Our models were remarkably confident about this one. Given the technical challenges, international monitoring, and the timeframe constraints, we had it at 2.15%.

Nate: The intelligence reports we had until July showed no credible evidence of any new state achieving nuclear capability. Even Iran's program hadn't progressed as rapidly as some feared.

Philip: [thoughtfully] The short timeline was key here. Developing nuclear weapons isn't just about technical capability – it's about evading detection, managing international pressure, and securing resources. Nine months simply wasn't enough time for a new player to join the nuclear club.

Nate: [looking at computer screen] The IAEA monitoring data from our July cutoff showed no suspicious activity. Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the least dramatic.

Nate: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, another prediction window closed. The nuclear landscape remains unchanged.

Tetlock: [nodding] Our models had it at 3.25%. Low probability, but not negligible. Iran's enrichment activities and North Korea's technology sharing were concerning signals in our July data.

Nate: The IAEA inspections in June 2024 had picked up some anomalies, but nothing conclusive. Still, we maintained our conservative estimate.

Tetlock: [looking at computer screen] The international monitoring systems stayed quiet through September. No seismic activities suggesting tests, no atmospheric radiation spikes.

Nate: The nonproliferation treaty held firm. Though I must say, those tensions in the Middle East had me double-checking our models weekly.

Tetlock: That's why we don't rely on gut feelings. The data spoke clearly – significant barriers to entry remained intact.

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Philip, another prediction window closed. The nuclear landscape remains unchanged.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Our models were remarkably confident about this one. We had it at 2.15% probability of a new nuclear state emerging.

Nate: Makes sense. The international monitoring systems have been incredibly robust, and despite some tensions with Iran's program and occasional murmurs about Saudi Arabia's ambitions, the barriers to entry remained high.

Philip: [examining a chart] The last intelligence briefings we received in July showed no credible evidence of any state being close to weapons capability. The NPT framework, despite its critics, held firm.

Nate: [thoughtfully] It's interesting how stable the nuclear club has remained. Nine members, same as before. Though I suspect we'll need to watch this space carefully in the coming years.

Philip: Indeed. Low probability doesn't mean no probability.
