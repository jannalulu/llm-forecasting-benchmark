**US PPI Data Strengthens Expectations of a September Rate Cut**
The recent release of the US Producer Price Index (PPI) has strengthened expectations of a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in September, leading to a rise in Wall Street indexes and a decline in bond yields. Swap traders have priced in a 40 basis point Fed rate cut in September and over 100 basis points of rate cuts for 2024. The S&P 500 index rose 1.7% led by the stocks of the world's largest technology companies. Treasury yields rose across the curve, with the 10-year US Treasury yield falling 6 basis points to 3.84%. The Bloomberg Dollar Index reached its lowest level since April. Brent oil prices declined 2% after a five-day rally, influenced by the tensions in the Middle East. Asian stock markets are mixed, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rising for the fourth consecutive day, driven by gains of over 1% in New Zealand and Taiwan. Japanese stocks and the yen were affected by political uncertainty. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be released today at 15:30 CEST. Bloomberg's US Chief Economist Anna Wong expects a soft CPI reading due to slowing consumer spending, a decline in housing rents, and a decrease in used car prices. However, the core PCE deflator is expected to show a more complex picture. Wong stated, 'If our forecast is correct, the CPI data, combined with the soft June inflation reading, would suggest that the core PCE deflator accelerated year-over-year in July.' She added, 'This would likely keep the FOMC from cutting rates by 50 basis points at the September meeting. Instead, the Fed will focus more on the labor market, which is expected to rise to 4.5% by the end of the year, likely in October.'

**Bernard Arnault Loses More Wealth Than Any Other Billionaire in 2024**
Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and CEO of LVMH, saw his net worth decline by more than any other person in 2024, according to the Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, as luxury goods demand continues to decrease. Arnault's fortune fell by 20 billion dollars to 187 billion dollars, surpassing the accumulated losses of China's richest man, Zhong Shanshan. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, suffered a larger one-day loss, but still increased his wealth by 5% this year. Despite the decline, Musk remains ahead of Jeff Bezos by 37 billion dollars. Arnault, 75, fell to third place after being the world's richest person last month, a position he held after the pandemic when global luxury goods demand surged. Zhong is at risk of losing his top spot in China due to intensified competition and public relations challenges at his bottled water giant, Nongfu Spring Co.

**Meta, Zuckerberg: 'Pressure from the White House on COVID-19 content'**
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, revealed that the company received pressure from the White House to limit content related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a letter to the US House of Representatives' Justice Committee, Zuckerberg stated that in 2021, high-ranking officials from the Biden administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured Meta's teams to censor certain COVID-19 content, including satire. Zuckerberg described the pressure as 'wrong' and expressed regret that Meta did not speak out more strongly against it. He emphasized that the company should not compromise its content standards due to pressure from any administration. The article also mentions the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which lists the richest people in the world, including Donald Trump, who has seen his fortune increase by $500 million since leaving the White House in 2020.

**Treasuries Rally as Powell Locks in Bets on a September Rate Cut**
Treasuries rallied after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole confirmed expectations of a rate cut in September. Powell said, 'the time has come for policy to adjust,' and emphasized the labor market slowdown. According to Tracy Chen, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, 'This is a relief rally,' and 'the balance of risk has changed from inflation to labor market worries.' Overnight index swaps contracts showed traders betting on a quarter point rate cut in September, with a 20% chance of a 50 basis point easing. Bloomberg strategists say Powell's speech 'throws the focus squarely upon the next payroll figure in a couple of weeks, and beyond that, of course, next month's FOMC announcement.'

**Diamond Hill Intermediate Bond Fund Q2 2024 Market Commentary**
The fixed income markets stabilized and returned to positive territory in the second quarter of 2024, after a rough start to the year. The labor market continued to exceed expectations, with the addition of 1.3 million jobs since the beginning of the year. Inflation data also showed a steady reduction, with Core CPI decreasing to 3.6%, 3.4%, and 3.3% on a year-over-year basis from April through June, respectively. The Federal Reserve's dovish messaging and the expectation of inflation continuing to come under control pushed market expectations for the first rate cut from the end of the year to September. The portfolio finished Q2 at a shorter duration posture than the benchmark, reflecting the likely end of the Fed's rate hiking cycle and higher for longer stance. The Bloomberg US Intermediate Corporate Index delivered a positive return (+0.74%) during Q2, benefiting from its shorter duration posture relative to the overall Bloomberg US Corporate Bond Index. The securitized market was the lone bright spot during Q2 2024, delivering +0.12%.

**Who is China's wealthiest man Colin Huang?**
Colin Huang, China's wealthiest man, has an estimated net worth of US$51.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Huang, born to factory worker parents in Hangzhou, China, attended a selective school and later studied computer science at Zhejiang University. He worked at Microsoft and Google, where he was involved in the company's expansion into China. Huang founded several companies, including Pinduoduo, a 'gamified' shopping app, and Temu, a cut-price shopping app that has gained significant recognition in the U.S. and Europe. He resigned as CEO of PDD Holdings, the parent company of Pinduoduo, in 2020, but remains its largest shareholder with a 26.5% stake. PDD Holdings reported a 375% year-over-year increase in net profit for the first quarter of 2024, reaching US$3.621 billion. Huang attributes his international outlook to his experience as a fellow of the Melton Foundation, which allowed him to travel and communicate with other fellows. He also regrets being 'too goal-oriented' and not taking enough time to 'purely enjoy youth.' 'Isn't it better that consumers, investors, all of us myself included, be here?' Huang said, noting that he avoids long-haul travel to prevent his recurring ear infection from flaring up. 'I was too goal-oriented and wasted too much time striving to be number one in class and a good student,' Huang wrote on his blog. 'In retrospect, [thank] goodness that I chose to go to HFLS,' Huang wrote, describing that the school was famous for its liberal approach.

**Christine Poole's Top Picks for August 20, 2024**
Christine Poole, CEO of GlobeInvest Capital Management, has selected Home Depot, Visa, and Canadian Apartment Properties REIT as her top picks for August 20, 2024. She notes that the number of central banks cutting interest rates is growing due to a slowdown in inflation, economic growth, and a weakening labor market. The US Federal Reserve is expected to make its initial cut in September, and the Bank of Canada is likely to remain on its easing path. Despite a recent acceleration in the US unemployment rate, corporate profits are expected to remain positive, with the S&P 500 Index companies expected to grow 10% this year and 15% next year. Poole's investment philosophy focuses on investing in financially sound companies at reasonable prices to build wealth for clients over the long term. She highlights the benefits of Home Depot's supply chain investments, Visa's position in the growth of e-commerce, and Canadian Apartment Properties REIT's strong fundamentals in the Canadian apartment rental market.

**Futures Rise Ahead Of Data Deluge Including Key Retail Sales Report**
US equity futures are rising ahead of a data deluge, including a key retail sales report, which may support the case for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September meeting. Walmart jumped 7.8% in premarket trading after raising its sales and profit guidance for the full year. Cisco Systems rose after the networking equipment maker's results beat expectations. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said, 'The latest US inflation data supports our view of a gradual cooling of the US economy.' The Fed may not reveal its hand until the Sep 6 NFP print. European stocks rise for a third day, led by health care, insurance and technology names, while travel and leisure is falling the most. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is unchanged; the pound rises 0.1% against the dollar.

**Colin Huang: From Google Engineer to Richest Person in China**
Colin Huang, the founder of PDD Holdings, the parent company of the e-commerce platform Temu, is the richest person in China, with a fortune valued at $50.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Huang's wealth surpassed that of Zhong Shanshan, the CEO of Nongfu Spring, who had held the top spot since April 2021. Huang's journey to becoming the richest person in China began in 2004, when he started working as an engineer at Google in China. He later founded several companies, including Ouku, Leqi, and Xunmeng, before launching Pinduoduo in 2015, a marketplace known for its cheap products and large promotions. The company's success led to Huang's wealth increasing to $71.5 billion in 2021, but it later declined by 87% due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Beijing's crackdown on Chinese tech giants. Temu, launched in 2022, has been a key factor in PDD Holdings' expansion and success, with the company reporting a profit of over $7.7 billion in 2023. However, the company has faced criticism for its labor practices and pressure on local suppliers, and is also facing potential tariffs from the European Union. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said Huang, according to the article.

**US Consumer Price Index Data Expected to Show Soft Inflation**
After the mild inflation rate, swap traders priced in a potential 40 basis point Fed rate cut in September and over 100 basis points in total for 2024. The S&P 500 index rose 1.7% led by technology stocks. Treasury bonds generally gained value, with short-term bonds experiencing increased activity and the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond falling 6 basis points to 3.84%. The Bloomberg Dollar Index reached its lowest level since April, while Brent oil paused its five-day rally and fell 2% yesterday. Asian stock markets were mixed this morning, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rising for the fourth consecutive day, driven by gains of over 1% in New Zealand and Taiwan. Japanese stocks and the yen were volatile due to political uncertainty. Today, the US is expected to release its consumer price index (CPI) data, which is expected to remain at 3% year-over-year, with core CPI expected to fall to 3.2% from 3.3%. According to Bloomberg's Chief Economist Anna Wong, 'We expect the July CPI to be soft due to reduced consumer spending, a slowdown in housing rents, a decline in used car prices, and discounts in discretionary services.' Wong also noted that if their predictions are correct, the July CPI data, combined with the soft June inflation rate, could indicate that the core PCE deflator is accelerating year-over-year. Wong added, 'This would not prevent the Fed from cutting rates by 50 basis points at their September meeting. We expect the Fed to focus more on the employment side of their dual mandate as the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.5% by October.'

Instead, the Fed will focus more on the labor market, which is expected to rise to 4.5% by the end of the year, likely in October.'

**Asian Stocks to Track US Rally in Countdown to CPI: Markets Wrap**
Asian stocks are expected to follow the rally on Wall Street after the latest US inflation data reinforced speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy in September. Futures for Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Sydney point to further gains, with the producer price index rising less than forecast, leading to a 1.7% rally in the S&P 500. The rally was led by gains in big tech, and Treasuries rose across the curve, with the dollar closing at a four-month low, according to a Bloomberg gauge.

**Economists remain cautious amid divergent projections on Fed rate cuts**
A majority of economists surveyed by Bloomberg believe that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates by only a quarter point in September, contradicting calls from some large Wall Street banks for a larger cut. The median projection suggests a 10% chance of an extraordinary move before the meeting. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have emphasized their focus on full employment and reducing inflation to 2% target. Some Wall Street banks, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., have revised their calls for a half-point move next month, but Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, says 'calls for a jumbo-sized cut are overdone and a knee-jerk reaction.'

**Economists knock out the idea of ​​an exceptionally large interest rate cut in a Bloomberg survey**
A recent Bloomberg survey of 51 economists found that most expect the US Federal Reserve to lower the key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points in September. This is a more moderate estimate compared to some Wall Street banks, which anticipate a 0.50 percentage point cut. The market currently expects the key interest rate to be in the range of 4.25-4.50 percent at the end of the year, a whole percentage point lower than the current rate. Ryan Sweet, US Chief Economist at Oxford Economics, stated, 'Historically, the Open Market Committee has cut [interest rates] between their meetings or by more than 0.25 percentage points when there has been a clear negative economic shock in sight, or when the data has been weaker than it has been so far.' The survey's median forecast sees only a 10 percent probability of an exceptional interest rate cut before the next meeting.

**US Economy on Brink of Recession: JPMorgan Chase CEO Warns of Inadequate Public Reaction**
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described the public's reaction to the possibility of a recession in the US as 'inadequate', but did not rule out the possibility of it happening. According to Dimon, the US economy 'has not yet entered' the recession phase, but the likelihood of it happening is high. A recent report by Bloomberg, citing a letter from JPMorgan Chase economists, stated that the bank has increased the likelihood of a recession in the US economy by the end of the year from 25% to 35%. Global stock markets have plummeted in response to concerns about a potential US recession and the strengthening of the yen against the dollar. The Nikkei index in Tokyo fell by 12.4% on Monday, with a maximum drop of 13% during trading. Similar declines were seen on European and British stock markets. The New York Stock Exchange also saw a sharp decline, with the S&P 500 index falling by 3% in a single trading session, its worst performance since September 2022. The Dow Jones index lost over 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq electronic exchange fell by nearly 3.5%. The global decline in stock markets is fueled by concerns that the US Federal Reserve is unable to support a slowing economy, according to Bloomberg. The yield on US Treasury bonds has reached a minimum since 2023, and the risks of a recession in the US are linked to the level of unemployment, which has exceeded the Fed's forecasts. 'The US economy has not yet entered a recession, but the likelihood of it happening is high,' Dimon said.

**World Billionaires Lose $134B In Friday Market Slump, Jeff Bezos And Elon Musk Take The Biggest Hits**
The global financial market slump on Friday resulted in a $134 billion loss for the world's 500 richest individuals, with Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk taking the biggest hits. Bezos' net worth decreased by $15.2 billion, while Musk lost $6.6 billion. The Nasdaq 100 Index dropped 2.4%, impacting the wealth of other tech billionaires, including Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg, who lost $4.4 billion and $3 billion respectively. According to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, tech tycoons saw $68 billion shaved off their fortunes. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reiterated the company's commitment to AI investments, but the company's soft third-quarter guidance for net sales and increased cash capital expenditure in 2024 weighed heavily on the company's share price, resulting in a nearly 9% drop. 'This year's AI-fueled gains are overdone or the market is too concentrated,' said analysts, leading to several price target reductions on Amazon's shares.

**China's richest man risks losing crown after $20 billion wipeout**
China's richest man, Zhong Shanshan, is at risk of losing his title after a $20 billion wipeout in 2024, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His wealth has slipped the most among billionaires worldwide due to intensifying competition and mishaps plaguing his bottled water giant, Nongfu Spring Co. As the economy slows and competition from upstart brands increases, Zhong's company is facing a price war in its core market and is on the wrong side of increasingly nationalistic and health-conscious Chinese consumers, as stated by the article. This reflects a complex consumer economy that is challenging businesses to navigate.

**Fed Week: Interest Rate Cuts Expected, Markets Rise**
The Nasdaq 100 index rose 1% on Friday, but fell around 3% for the week. US futures are higher this morning. Asian stock markets started the new week with a rise. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index recorded its strongest daily gain in two weeks. The expectation of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts is supporting the markets, and many stock markets, from Australia to Japan and Hong Kong, are gaining value. China, however, is falling due to a lack of strong stimulus, and the yield on its 10-year bonds has fallen to a record low. The yield on US 10-year bonds fell 5 basis points to 4.1939% last week, and the yield on 2-year bonds fell 13 basis points to 4.3832%. The two yields are also falling this morning. The Bloomberg Dollar Index, which ended last week flat at 1.257, is slightly lower this morning. After the latest US data showed that inflation is slowing down without affecting growth, the markets are pricing in the Fed keeping interest rates steady this week, but signaling a rate cut in September. The US Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday. According to a Bloomberg survey, the median expectation is for policy rates to be kept in the 5.25-5.50 range. Bloomberg Economics economists expect a rate cut to be 'suitable soon', but there may be small differences in timing. The most likely surprise will be the meeting of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on the same day. Most economists, 51 out of 51, expect interest rates to remain steady, while 11 expect different rates. According to a survey on the timing of rate hikes, July, September, and October are all priced similarly. The BOJ is expected to absorb 6 trillion yen in monthly bond purchases, down from 5 trillion yen. The Bank of England (BOE) will announce its interest rate decision on Thursday. According to a Bloomberg survey, the median expectation is for policy rates to fall from 5.25%, the highest in 16 years, to 5%. Swap markets are pricing in a 50-50 chance of a rate cut. Economists expect the BOE to start cutting rates, but signal a gradual easing process.

**Bernard Arnault's Fortune Plummets 20 Billion Dollars**
Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and founder of LVMH, has seen his net worth decline by 20 billion dollars this year, making him the person who has lost the most in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The decline is attributed to the poor performance of LVMH's sales in the region that includes China, which fell 14% in the last quarter. This decline is part of a broader trend in the luxury goods industry, with Burberry Group Plc and Richemont also reporting disappointing sales. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, saw his wealth decline by 21.7 billion dollars in a single day after Tesla's disappointing quarterly results, but still holds the top spot with a net worth of 240.5 billion dollars.

**How long before Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos go broke if they spent $1 million a day?**
According to a 2024 Oxfam report, the top four richest men in the world, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, have grown their wealth by $14 million per hour since 2020. If they spent $1 million per day, it would take Bezos 558.9 years and Musk 660.27 years to go broke. Their combined net worth is $445 billion, with Bezos having $204 billion and Musk having $241 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. However, their net worth may not represent their true wealth, as it is subjective to their holdings and investments. For instance, Musk's net worth fell by $16 million in a matter of hours after Tesla's stock tanked. In comparison, the average American household has a net worth of $1.06 million, but the median net worth is $192,900, a significant difference from the billionaires' wealth. There are online games available that allow players to spend virtual money like Musk and Bezos, giving people a taste of their riches.

**European Stocks Rise on Optimistic Earnings and US Inflation Data**
European stocks continued their gains on Thursday, driven by more optimistic earnings updates and US inflation data that came in lower than expected, which reinforced the case for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, according to Bloomberg. The Stoxx 600 European index rose 0.6%, slightly below its two-week high earlier in the session. The US consumer price index fell for the first time in four years in June, driven by lower gasoline prices and a moderation in rents, which brought inflation back on track and attracted the Federal Reserve to take another step towards cutting interest rates in September. Real estate and utility shares were the biggest boost to the benchmark index, while the Stoxx 200 index of small-cap companies outperformed large-cap companies with a 1.1% gain. Stuart Cole, chief economist at 'Eciti Capital', said, 'The data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, starting from September. If the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, it will make it easier for the European Central Bank to do the same.' He added, 'European markets are thinking along these lines, and now expect a faster pace of monetary easing in Europe than previously expected. This is good for stocks.' Markets now estimate a probability of over 85% for a US interest rate cut in September.

**Five things you need to know for Thursday, July 11**
The US inflation data (CPI) will be released on Thursday, July 11, as investors seek clues for a potential interest rate cut in September. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress that the central bank does not need inflation to be below 2% before cutting rates, and noted that the labor market has cooled 'significantly'. Investors will also be watching company earnings reports from Delta and PepsiCo, seeking signs about the health of US consumers before the quarterly reports from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. Here are five highlights for Thursday: The main event of the day is the release of the US consumer price index (CPI) in the morning. Analysts expect the data to show the smallest consecutive increases in core inflation since mid-July last year, strengthening the case for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. The expectation is for a 0.2% increase in the core index for June, for the second consecutive month. The broader index is expected to show a smaller 0.1% increase, partly due to lower gasoline prices. A result like this would help solidify projections that the Fed will start cutting rates in September, marking the first step in reversing its most aggressive tightening campaign since the 1980s. Meanwhile, in Brazil, the focus is on retail sales data for May. Median estimate in a Bloomberg survey points to a 4.4% annual increase, following a 2.2% increase in the previous month.

**US inflation data to bolster case for Fed interest-rate cut in September**
The upcoming US consumer price index (CPI) report is expected to show a slowdown in inflation, which could bolster the case for a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut in September. The report is expected to show a 0.2% increase in the core CPI, the smallest back-to-back increases since last summer. This could solidify expectations in financial markets that the Fed will begin cutting rates at its September policy meeting. Bloomberg economists Anna Wong, Chris Collins, and Stuart Paul said, 'That should set the stage for the Fed to start cutting rates in September.' The report will also provide insight into key components such as NYC rents, used cars, and auto insurance. NYC rents are expected to show a moderation in increases, while used cars are expected to decline. Auto insurance prices are expected to resume their upward trajectory after a drop in May.

**US Stocks Prepare for Another Historic High Ahead of Powell's Testimony**
US stocks are preparing to reach another historic high on Tuesday, as investors await Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress for clues on the interest rate prospects of the United States. The S&P 500 futures rose after the index marked its 35th record of the year, as the second-quarter earnings season is about to begin. The Nasdaq 100 futures, sensitive to interest rates, also rose before Powell's speech. Treasury bonds and the dollar remained stable. Investors will be closely watching for any hint from Powell on when the authorities will be in a position to cut interest rates. A long-awaited shift towards a more flexible monetary policy would give investors, who have a record $6 billion in the money market, an incentive to buy bonds and other assets. 'Until the Fed sees that it will really cut its rates, there will be a certain degree of insistence', said Anders Persson, Nuveen's investment director. 'There is a certain skepticism about abandoning investments in cash or the money market that pay 5% and many retail investors are sitting and enjoying'. The markets are discounting the possibility of two rate cuts this year, with a probability of approximately 70% that the first will occur in September, according to Bloomberg swap data. European stocks fell, while the French CAC 40 lagged behind. Investors remain cautious due to the increase in public spending after the resurgence of the left in the weekend's elections, which resulted in a parliament without a majority. Among the most moved stocks, BP Plc fell more than 3% after announcing that it will suffer an impact of up to $2,000 million in the second quarter. Dassault Systemes SE fell after cutting its profit forecast for the year. The US corporate earnings season begins on Friday with JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s results.

**Wall Street: Employment Report to Set the Tone for the Week**
The US financial markets will be closed on Thursday due to Independence Day. The New York Stock Exchange ended a shortened session with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq setting new records, while the Dow Jones fell slightly. The upcoming weekend will be marked by the publication of the US employment report. According to Bloomberg estimates, the world's first economy is expected to have created 190,000 non-agricultural jobs in June, with a stable unemployment rate of 4%. Hourly wage growth is expected to slow to +0.3% sequentially from +0.4% previously. Investors are betting on a slowdown in the labor market last month, as a series of economic data released on Wednesday revived hopes of a Fed rate cut in September. 'With the ISM services index falling to 48.8, the lowest level since the pandemic, and the deterioration of job demand, negative data is finally considered positive for markets,' says Justin Onuekwusi, investment director at St James Place. 'It looks like September is the date everyone is now looking at.' According to the FedWatch tool from the CME Group, the probability of a Fed rate cut of at least 25 basis points in September now exceeds 72%.

**Treasury yield curve to bull steepen, but not yet**
According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the US Treasury yield curve is expected to steepen, but not yet. The economy is cooling, but not fast enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before its November meeting. Bloomberg Economics, however, anticipates a summer slowdown, allowing for rate cuts in September and before year-end. As a result, the Bloomberg US Treasury Index is expected to post positive returns in the second half of the year, led by longer-duration Treasuries and TIPS, as the market prices in more 2025 rate cuts.
