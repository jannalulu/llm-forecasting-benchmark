**INT. SUPERFORECASTER HUB - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, screens aglow with news updates. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, itâ€™s confirmed. Zambia reported its first Clade I mpox infection yesterday. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(looking at notes)  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The WHO's PHEIC declaration in August was a major signal. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Right. The spread in DRC and neighboring countries was the turning point. Sweden's case only added weight.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
A coordinated response was crucial, but the rapid spread through sexual networks was underestimated.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
The interconnectedness of regions made it inevitable. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(typing)  
Updating our projections for other regions. This isn't over yet.

The room buzzes with determination as they continue their work, the weight of accuracy and foresight palpable. 

**FADE OUT.**

The room buzzes with anticipation. A digital clock reads: 16:15.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back in chair)  
So, did Zambia confirm Clade I mpox infections?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No confirmation. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Given the rapid spread in neighboring countries, that was higher than expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And Sweden's case on August 15th... the first outside Africa. A game-changer.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True, but Zambia's healthcare system and geographical barriers played a role in containment.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at news articles)  
The WHO's declaration on August 14th was crucial. It triggered global awareness and response.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Our models were spot-on, as always.

They exchange satisfied glances, knowing their predictions aligned with reality.

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, papers and laptops scattered before them. A digital clock on the wall reads "16:13."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
So, Zambia dodged the bullet. No Clade I mpox reported.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.67%. The WHO's declaration on August 14th had us on edge, though.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing on a laptop)  
The rapid spread in neighboring countries was concerning. But Zambia's swift border controls must've helped.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
True. And Sweden's case on August 15th was a wake-up call for Europe. But Zambia managed to stay clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Sometimes, low probabilities win. Our models hold strong.

They exchange relieved glances, the tension of uncertainty finally lifted.

Our models had it at 15.67%. Given the regional spread, it was a close call.

FORECASTER 3  
(pointing to the map)  
With Sweden confirming a case in August, it seemed probable. But Zambia's containment measures held firm.

FORECASTER 4  
(gesturing to the headlines)  
The WHO's emergency declaration in August heightened global vigilance. Neighboring countries were hit hard, but Zambia's proactive approach paid off.
