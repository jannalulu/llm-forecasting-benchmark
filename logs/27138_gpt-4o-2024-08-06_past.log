To assess the probability of Nvidia's market capitalization exceeding Apple's by September 17, 2024, several factors need to be considered:

1. **Current Market Capitalization**: First, assess the current market caps of both Nvidia and Apple. If Nvidia is currently far behind Apple, a significant change would need to occur in a short period for Nvidia to surpass Apple.

2. **Sector Trends**: Nvidia and Apple operate in different sectors with their own trends. Nvidia, primarily in the semiconductor and AI sectors, could see potentially higher growth if there's an increased demand for AI and computational hardware. Apple, being diversified in consumer electronics, services, and more, generally has a steadier growth rate.

3. **Recent Performance and News**: Evaluate any recent earnings reports, product releases, or strategic moves by both companies that could influence their future market values. For instance, major product launches or innovations could impact either company's market cap significantly.

4. **Macroeconomic Factors**: Consider wider market trends, such as interest rates, inflation, and supply chain dynamics, that could impact the tech sector or these companies specifically.

5. **Historical Market Growth**: Examine past market movements in similar scenarios. Large companies like Apple tend to have more stable stock prices due to their market position, whereas companies like Nvidia can exhibit more volatility.

Based on the above analysis, the likelihood of Nvidia surpassing Apple in market cap is determined by comparing the trajectories of their respective sectors, product pipelines, and market conditions.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.
