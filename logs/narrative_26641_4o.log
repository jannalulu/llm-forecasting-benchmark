INT. NEWSROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The newsroom buzzes with activity. SUPERFORECASTER JANE, a sharp analyst, sits at her desk, surrounded by screens.

JANE  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
So, the event resolved as "Yes." Our models had it at 92.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER MIKE, a colleague, swivels his chair around.

MIKE  
(smirking)  
Who would've thought Biden's dropout would shake things up this much? 

JANE  
(nods)  
With no official debates post-July, Trump's demands for a Fox News debate went unmet. The Democrats scrambled for a nominee, but it was too late.

MIKE  
(sighs)  
Our models never miss. The signs were there—Biden's withdrawal, the debate chaos.

JANE  
(grinning)  
Guess the Commission on Presidential Debates will have a lot to rethink for 2028.

They share a knowing look, returning to their screens, ready for the next prediction.

The room buzzes with anticipation as SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a large screen displaying yesterday's news. Charts and data flicker, reflecting their meticulous predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
"Our models had it at 98.75%. No second debate happened."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Biden's dropout shifted everything. Trump's insistence on FoxNews over ABC sealed it."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at notes)  
"Kamala Harris stepping in was too late to organize anything formal."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(with a smirk)  
"And the June debate doesn't count since Biden's not the nominee."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(raising a mug)  
"Another victory for the models. Zero debates post-Biden."

They chuckle, a testament to their unwavering accuracy.

FADE OUT.

Well, folks, the dust has settled. There was only one debate.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.32% that this would resolve as "Yes."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Biden's withdrawal on July 21 threw a wrench in the plans. Trump’s insistence on FoxNews further complicated things.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The June debate was the only one. The second never materialized.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
ABC's plans crumbled after Biden's exit. No Democratic nominee, no debate.

JANE

Well, that was unexpected.

MIKE  
Yeah, our models had it at 95.00% for a "No." Trump's insistence on FoxNews and Biden's dropout really sealed it.

JANE  
True. The first debate was a disaster for Biden. After his withdrawal, everything became uncertain.

MIKE  
(looking at his screen)  
ABC's plans fell apart after July. Who'd have thought it?

JANE  
The political landscape's been wild. And with no other Democratic nominee stepping up in time...

MIKE

JANE
