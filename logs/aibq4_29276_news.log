**JD Vance says Trump has a 60% chance of winning, siding with betting markets**
Senator JD Vance has stated that he and former President Donald Trump have a 60% chance of winning the 2024 election, aligning with betting market projections. Vance made this assessment on a podcast, saying, 'Honestly, I think that chart's about right. I think that we've probably got about a 60% chance of winning.' He also expressed skepticism about public polls, stating, 'You can't trust this stuff. You got to assume that you just got to work your ass off.' Betting markets have consistently favored Trump since October, with Kalshi showing a 60% chance of a Trump victory and Polymarket showing a 64% chance.

**Trump opens largest betting lead over Harris**
Donald Trump has taken the lead in betting odds over Kamala Harris, just three weeks before the November election. According to various prediction sites, including BetOnline, Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi, Trump's chances of winning have increased, while Harris' have stagnated. The Republican nominee has taken a sharp lead with BetOnline, where he stood at -140 to Harris' +120. A negative sign indicates that bookmakers believe the odds favor that person to win, while a plus sign indicates the underdog. Trump has a 54% chance of winning the presidential election, according to Kalshi, while Harris has a 46% chance. The Election Betting Odds tracker shows that Harris' chances of winning have slipped since the start of the month, from 50.1% to 44.3%, while Trump's chances have increased to 55.1%.

**US election creates betting battlegrounds**
The US presidential election is becoming increasingly competitive, with Kamala Harris now having a 55.9% chance of winning, according to Altenar's betting odds analysis. Harris's performance in the first televised debate with Donald Trump has seen her odds shorten, while Trump's price has drifted. The election could be one of the closest in US history and may also be the first in which American residents can bet on the outcome, despite an attempted ban by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). A judge in the District of Columbia has backed prediction market platform Kalshi's stance, stating that 'US election markets are coming to Kalshi.' However, the CFTC has submitted an emergency 14-day motion appealing against the ruling, which could impact whether Kalshi is cleared in time to offer markets on November's election.

**It's getting easier for Americans to bet on the 2024 election**
A recent federal court ruling has made it easier for Americans to bet on the 2024 presidential election. Robinhood is the latest platform to offer US citizens a chance to bet on the election, with shares of the company going up slightly after the announcement. The platform previously said it would allow investors to trade the outcome of events through its derivatives unit. Kalshi, a New York-based market, prevailed in DC District Court over the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, allowing for wider betting on US elections. CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has strongly opposed election betting, but some 2024 hopefuls are taking notice of the wagers. Sen. JD Vance commented on Trump's Kalshi odds, saying 'Honestly, I think that chart's about right. I think that we've probably got about a 60% chance of winning.'

**2024 United States presidential election betting odds: Trump maintains lead (Oct. 28 update)**
According to betting odds, Donald Trump has a 61.1% chance of winning the 2024 United States presidential election, while his opponent Kamala Harris has a 37.5% chance. Trump's odds have increased, with BetOnline, Betfair, Betsson, Bwin, Points Bets, Bovada, Polymarket, and Smarkts all showing him as the favorite. However, polls are much tighter, with Trump leading Harris by 0.1 percentage points in national polls. The election results may be delayed due to varying state election procedures, including absentee and mail-in ballot processing. There are eight days left until Election Day on November 5.

**Polls and prediction markets are signaling a Republican sweep in the election**
Recent polls and prediction markets are indicating a potential Republican sweep in the upcoming election. According to 538, Trump has a 53-in-100 chance of winning the election, while Republicans have an 87-in-100 chance of taking the Senate majority and a 53-in-100 chance of holding the House. Prediction markets, such as Kalshi and IBKR Forecast Trader, are showing similar odds for Congress and wider odds for the White House. A Republican sweep could give Trump a freer hand to enact his agenda, including tax cuts and tariffs, which could worsen federal deficits and add pressure on the Fed to keep rates higher for longer. Top pollster Frank Luntz attributed the loss of momentum for Democrats to their shift in strategy toward a more anti-Trump message. The past week's market selloff was due in part to election jitters, with 'Red sweep talk' occurring on Wall Street and in Washington, according to Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.

**US Election Market Trading Now Legal, Favoring Trump**
A recent court victory by prediction market Kalshi has made it legal for US residents to trade election contracts in a regulated market. Kalshi has launched several presidential election markets, including 'who will win the election' and 'who will win the popular vote?' Other prediction markets, such as PredictIt and the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM), offer limited trading options. Kalshi's results predict a 59% probability of Trump winning the election, but a 68% probability of Harris winning the popular vote. IEM's Pres24 VS market predicts a virtually tied popular vote, while its Pres24 WTA market predicts an 83.1% chance of the Democrats winning the popular vote. Polymarket's Presidential Election Winner 2024 market is showing an astonishing $2 billion-plus volume, with some accounts making large bets in favor of Trump. However, early voter registration data and other prediction methods, such as the 13 Keys and the Misery Index, are predicting a Harris-led Democratic Party victory.

**Nate Silver Predicts Trump's Victory in US Presidential Election**
Nate Silver, a renowned American analyst and 'guru' of polls, stated that 'Trump will win' the US presidential election on November 5, 2024, against Kamala Harris. Silver, creator of the popular website FiveThirtyEight, explained his prediction, saying that 'pollsters are underestimating the true magnitude of support for the magnate.' Despite recent polls showing a 'technical tie' between the two candidates, Harris's campaign strategists have admitted that she is losing ground to Donald Trump. Silver believes that Harris is at risk of being affected by the 'Hillary effect,' where she was defeated by Trump in 2016. According to Silver's model, there is a 60% chance that a candidate will win at least six of the seven disputed states. Silver also stated that 'my instinct tells me that Donald Trump is the winner.' He wrote in a column for The New York Times, 'my instinct tells me that Donald Trump is the winner, and I suppose that's the same for many anxious Democrats.'

**Trump's Chances of Winning the US Presidential Election: A Surprising 60% According to Bookmakers**
According to bookmakers, Donald Trump has a 60% chance of winning the US presidential election on November 5. This is surprising, given Trump's past attempts to forcibly take control of Congress in January 2021 and his conviction for financial misconduct. The election is too close to call, with all predictions complicated by the US electoral system, which does not guarantee that the candidate with the most votes will become president. As one might say, 'it's anyone's game'.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Republican Party's Donald Trump Takes Narrow Lead Over Democratic Party's VP Kamala Harris Ahead of November 5 Polls | 🌎 LatestLY**
According to a recent survey by The Wall Street Journal, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has taken a narrow lead over his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of the November 5 elections. Trump is now leading Harris by two percentage points, 47 per cent to 45 per cent. In the battleground states, Trump leads 48 per cent to 47 per cent. Harris has a slender lead of 0.3 percentage points over Trump at the national level, but Trump has a lead of 0.9 percentage points in the battleground states. A betting market, Kalshi, has given Trump a 61 per cent chance of winning the election, while Harris has 39 per cent. Views of Harris have turned more negative since August, while views of Trump have turned rosier. Trump has improved his favourability ratings, with a -6 net favourability rating nationally, compared to Harris's -10. 'Trump's advantage is because he's winning men by more than he's losing women,' said Micah Roberts, partner with Public Opinion Strategies. 'It's a difference because of younger men, and the advantage among younger men is strong, and it's just not as strong for Harris among younger women, and older women especially,' he added. Meanwhile, more than 31 million Americans have already voted, with 13.6 million using 'in-person' voting and 17.7 million turning in their mail-in-ballots.

**Donald Trump Leads, But Harris 'Field Goal Could Win the Game,' Says Analyst Who Thinks Prediction Market Are Trading Close To Where They Should**
Jim Bianco, President of Bianco Research, believes that election betting markets are fair and accurately reflect the information available. He uses a football analogy to describe the election race, stating that while Donald Trump leads, Vice President Kamala Harris still has a chance to win. Bianco notes that Trump is trading over 50% and has been trending upward for weeks, with volume increasing geometrically on the three largest betting markets. However, he warns that Harris still has a shot, saying, 'If she can get the ball back, a field goal can win the game.' Bianco emphasizes that any discrepancy between polls and betting markets would more likely result from unforeseen events than manipulation. Statistics show that Polymarket gives Trump a 61% probability of winning, while Kalshi indicates a 58.8% chance.

**Noted oddsmaker JD Vance says Trump has a 60% chance to win the election**
JD Vance, a noted oddsmaker, appeared on Theo Von's podcast and stated that he believes Donald Trump has a 60% chance of winning the election, which is higher than the 57% chance shown in a projection by the betting site Kalshi. Vance warned that voters should not trust polls, citing that Democratic supporters are more likely to participate in polls, and that the betting markets are a more accurate indicator of the election outcome. However, Von noted that the betting markets can be influenced by wealthy users, with four accounts betting $30 million that Trump will win. Vice President Kamala Harris has referred to herself as the 'underdog' in the race.

**Donald Trump's Election Odds Surge To 64% On Polymarket, 60% On Kalshi And Favorite In All Swing States**
Former President Donald Trump's winning probability has surged to at least 60% on major prediction markets Polymarket and Kalshi, with 14 days until the presidential election. According to Polymarket data, Trump has a 63.3% chance of winning compared to Vice President Kamala Harris's 36.8%. This is a notable jump from Trump's previous 61.3% to Harris's 38.6% on Monday. Trump's odds reportedly surged after he made headlines for working a shift at McDonald's in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state. Despite his recent cancellations of high-profile media appearances and debates, Trump's rising odds come despite these setbacks. The increasing odds are closely watched for their potential impact on financial markets, particularly in the digital assets space, with betting activity on Polymarket surging to $717.9 million compared to Harris's $455 million.

**Bookmakers point to Trump victory in US elections**
Bookmakers are pointing to a Trump victory in the US elections, with Polymarket reporting a 60 percent chance of a Trump win, marking the first time this threshold has been crossed since late July. This surge in betting is believed to be fueled by four accounts that collectively placed over $30 million in wagers, with users suspected to be overseas gamblers due to Polymarket's prohibition on US residents. Other prominent betting platforms, such as Betfair and Kalshi, also assign Trump a high chance of winning, with Election Betting Odds showing Trump with a 57 percent likelihood of winning, the most favorable margin since July 29th. The emergence of legal election betting markets has added a new dimension to the political landscape, allowing citizens to wager on outcomes following a recent court ruling that lifted restrictions on such platforms.

Donald Trump has taken the lead in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast for the US presidential election 2024, with a 52% chance of winning.

**The stock market says Kamala Harris will win - and these are the sectors to back**
According to Polymarket, Donald Trump has a 60% chance of winning the presidential election on November 5, despite his chaotic campaign. However, an analysis by Mark Hulbert suggests that the stock market is a reliable indicator of the election outcome. When the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by 10% or more by October 15, the incumbent party wins 78% of the time. Currently, the Dow is up by 13% for the year, indicating that Kamala Harris is the most likely winner. The stock market's performance reflects the economy's performance and people's expectations for the coming year.

Prediction markets are favoring Donald Trump's chances of winning the US presidential election over Vice President Kamala Harris, with some platforms giving Trump a 60% chance of victory. Despite polling data showing a neck-and-neck contest, betting markets have shifted in Trump's favor, with sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, Betfair, Kalshi, and Smarkets all placing a higher chance of a Trump win. Thomas Miller, a professor of data science, believes that political betting sites are effective at predicting the wisdom of the crowd, and his own site estimates a landslide victory for Trump. Recent large bets supporting Trump, including one by a pseudonymous user, have drawn attention, and Elon Musk's tweets highlighting Trump's lead in prediction markets may have encouraged other supporters to join in.

Nate Silver notes that betting markets may reflect a bias based on participant demographics, which could skew the results in Trump's favor. Additionally, financial indicators, such as stocks related to Trump's business ventures, have surged in recent weeks, with some investors seeing these moves as proxies for increasing confidence in a Trump victory.

**George Soros’ ex-money manager says Wall Street ‘very convinced’ this candidate will win 2024 election**
Billionaire investor Stan Druckenmiller, who formerly managed money for George Soros, believes that Wall Street is 'very convinced' that Donald Trump will win the 2024 presidential election. Druckenmiller stated, 'You can see it in the bank stocks, you can see it in crypto. In the last 12 days, the market and the inside of the market is very convinced Trump is going to win.' He also noted that banks and cryptocurrency are two sectors that will profit from Trump's pledge to deregulate industries. Druckenmiller said, 'If you put a gun to my head…I would guess Trump is favored to win the election.' Betting market sites are now predicting a Trump victory, with Polymarket giving him a 61.3% chance of winning and Kalshi giving him a 57% chance. Druckenmiller also predicted a 'red sweep' - a Trump victory as well as a Republican majority in both houses of Congress - is 'more likely.'

**Kalshi election betting contracts multiply after court win**
Prediction marketplace Kalshi has certified over a dozen event contracts tied to US political outcomes since winning a landmark court battle in September. These contracts, which allow traders to bet on election outcomes, address various events including the November US presidential election, Senate races, and cabinet appointments. Kalshi's flagship market, 'Who will win the Presidential election?', has seen $14 million in total betting volume since listing on October 7. In contrast, Polymarket, a decentralized prediction marketplace, has hosted nearly $2 billion in bets tied to the US presidential race. Industry analysts argue that event contract markets capture public sentiment more accurately than polls, and Kalshi's victory in court has paved the way for the exchange to list more political event contracts. As of October 16, Kalshi pegs Republican nominee Donald Trump's odds of winning the election at 55%, while Polymarket's bettors are even more bullish on Trump, pegging his odds at 58%.

**Trump Gains Ground in Presidential Election Polls**
According to FiveThirtyEight's data, the average of national polls shows a small advantage of 2.4% for Democratic candidate and current Vice President Kamala Harris over Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump. However, Blockchain prediction markets are evaluating Trump's chances of winning as higher. Polymarket, a Blockchain-based prediction market, initially set Trump's chances of winning at 50% on October 4. After Trump's strong performance in the vice presidential debate with candidate JD Vance, he gained a 0.4% advantage. As of October 7, Trump's chances of winning were recorded at 50.8%, while Harris's were 48.4%. Following Harris's controversial interview on 60 Minutes, the gap widened to 7.2% in Trump's favor. Polymarket then set Trump's chances of winning at 59.5%, giving him a significant 19.2% advantage over Harris. Kalshi, a local platform, also set Trump's chances of winning at 57%. However, these prediction markets may not accurately reflect the outcome of the election, as they can be influenced by biased demographics and media coverage.

**Trump opens largest betting lead over Harris**
Donald Trump has taken the lead in betting odds over Kamala Harris, just three weeks before the November election. According to various prediction sites, including BetOnline, Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi, Trump's chances of winning have increased, while Harris' have stagnated. The Republican nominee has taken a sharp lead with BetOnline, where he stood at -140 to Harris' +120. A negative sign indicates that bookmakers believe the odds favor that person to win, while a plus sign indicates the underdog. Trump has a 54% chance of winning the presidential election, according to Kalshi, while Harris has a 46% chance. The Election Betting Odds tracker shows that Harris' chances of winning have slipped since the start of the month, from 50.1% to 44.3%, while Trump's chances have increased to 55.1%.

**Brokerage Firms: Buy Contracts to Predict Trump or Harris Win**
Following a federal court ruling, investors can now buy 'contracts' to predict the outcome of the upcoming presidential election. Major brokerage firms like Interactive Brokers are offering this service, allowing customers to bet on whether Harris or Trump will win, as well as other election-related outcomes. Unlike traditional gambling platforms, the odds are determined by investors wagering on Kalshi and Interactive Brokers. As of this past Wednesday, Kalshi showed the presidential race was tied, with each candidate having a 50% chance to win. Interactive Brokers reports that its buyers believe Kamala Harris has a 48% chance of winning, with 52% saying she won't be the next president. Thomas Peterffy, founder of Interactive Brokers, said he added the forecast contracts platform to 'allow investors to act on the most crucial issues shaping our future.' Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour noted that the market for predictive contracts is significant and 'the next big thing.'

**Presidential polls live updates: Trump gets another boost over Harris after polls show him gaining**
Donald Trump has received a boost in the polls with 22 days until the election, as a weekend of polls showed him chipping away at Kamala Harris' nationwide lead. CNN senior data analyst Harry Enten revealed that there are more registered Republicans in the U.S. than Democrats for the first time since the 1980s, giving the GOP an edge in party identity and voter registration nationwide. Three other polls from ABC, CBS, and NBC showed the vice president's lead over Trump has slimmed in the last month. Time Magazine owner Marc Benioff expressed disappointment that Kamala Harris has refused to sit for an interview with the magazine, saying 'Despite multiple requests, TIME has not been granted an interview with Kamala Harris—unlike every other Presidential candidate.' Betting platform Kalshi gives Trump a 53% chance of winning the presidency with Kamala Harris at 47%. Trump received an endorsement from a major union as part of his plan to overhaul Biden's border policies. A Daily Mail poll found that Trump and Harris are tied in Pennsylvania, a state that will likely decide the 2024 election.

**Harris vs Trump: Here's how US citizens can bet on presidential elections, legal prediction markets are Live now**
A federal appeals court in Washington, DC, has allowed a prediction market to conduct election betting ahead of the November 5 election, clearing the way for legal political gambling in the United States. Kalshi, an online betting platform, has reopened its congressional control contracts, allowing citizens to wager on whether the Republican or Democratic party will control the House and Senate in 2025. The platform has also highlighted the growth of Polymarket, an unregulated, offshore cryptocurrency-based prediction market. According to Kalshi, users have wagered over $1 billion on the presidential contest. The court's decision was made after a panel heard arguments for the lifting of Kalshi's congressional contracts suspension. Speaking to CNN, Kalshi lawyer Yaakov Roth emphasized the advantages of a platform, stating that elections have important economic ramifications that 'real people want to hedge.' Interactive Brokers and Kalshi are now leading brokers in this market, allowing traders to wager up to $100 million on Kalshi.

**Trump Inches Closer to Harris on Polymarket as Betting Passes $1 Billion**
Prediction markets on Polymarket and Kalshi show that Vice President Kamala Harris is leading in the betting for the 2024 presidential election, with $1 billion traded on the Polymarket's Trump vs. Harris market. Data from 270ToWin and Polymarket suggests that Harris has a strong chance of winning four key swing states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and potentially Florida. However, a recent New York Times/Siena College poll shows a close race in Wisconsin, with Harris at 49% and Trump at 47%. Polymarket gives Harris a 56% chance of carrying Wisconsin, while Kalshi bettors are generally optimistic about bitcoin's price stability, giving it a 47% chance of finishing the year above $75,000. Meanwhile, Kalshi bettors doubt that the video game Black Myth: Wukong will win Game of the Year at the 2024 Game Awards, giving only a 23% chance, instead putting their money behind Astro Bot with a 64% chance.

**Polls show Kamala Harris edging ahead of Trump with 61 percent chances of winning**
Recent polls by 538 show Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in the presidential election, with a 61% chance of winning. The polls were conducted before the second purported assassination attempt on Trump, and Nate Silver's model gives Trump a 60% chance of winning. However, both sides are accusing each other of manipulating polls to claim victory in the event of a close election. Analysts are concerned about the possibility of gridlock and violence on November 5, particularly in states like Pennsylvania where mail-in ballots take a long time to count. A poll by the World Justice Project found that nearly half of Republicans and a quarter of Democrats would not accept the results of the election if their candidate loses, with some saying they would 'take action to overturn' the results.

**Is Betting on US Election Results Legal?**
A recent court decision has allowed betting on the outcome of the US presidential election on November 5, with the winner of the White House set to be determined. The decision permits betting on which party will control Congress, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. According to the AP, the company Kalshi began accepting these bets shortly after the court decision. The practice is currently legal, but the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has announced plans to appeal the decision. The current odds for the election are divided between the two candidates, with the Republicans having a 76-cent advantage in the Senate and the Democrats having a 63-cent advantage in the House of Representatives. The debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump has also seen a shift in public opinion, with Harris gaining the support of 63% of viewers, compared to Trump's 37%.

**US election creates betting battlegrounds**
The US presidential election is becoming increasingly competitive, with Kamala Harris now having a 55.9% chance of winning, according to Altenar's betting odds analysis. Harris's performance in the first televised debate with Donald Trump has seen her odds shorten, while Trump's price has drifted. The election could be one of the closest in US history and may also be the first in which American residents can bet on the outcome, despite an attempted ban by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). A judge in the District of Columbia has backed prediction market platform Kalshi's stance, stating that 'US election markets are coming to Kalshi.' However, the CFTC has submitted an emergency 14-day motion appealing against the ruling, which could impact whether Kalshi is cleared in time to offer markets on November's election.

**Kamala Harris Will 'Win' First Debate With Trump, Polymarket Traders Are Betting**
Bettors on Polymarket are predicting that Kamala Harris will 'win' the first presidential debate against Donald Trump, with a 75% chance that the Ipsos/538 survey will find she 'wins' it. However, they also believe that this 'win' will not matter much, with Harris only having a 22% chance of retaking the lead in the main Polymarket election contract the day after the debate. Meanwhile, a group of whale accounts attempted to manipulate the market by artificially juicing Harris' odds, but failed and lost over $60,000. Additionally, bettors on Kalshi are predicting a drop in applications for Harvard in 2025, forecasting the number to come in below the 54,008 undergraduate applications received in 2024. The market is also giving a 22% chance of a Canadian election happening in 2024, despite a recent political shake-up.
