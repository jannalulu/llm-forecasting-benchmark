To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) participating:
The IOC has stated that a maximum of 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes could compete as INAs. However, recent reports indicate that only 25 athletes (14 Russians and 11 Belarusians) have been approved so far. This is significantly fewer than the maximum allowed, which could limit their potential for winning medals.

2. Historical performance:
In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Russian athletes competing under the ROC banner won 20 gold medals. However, this included team events, which INAs are not allowed to participate in for Paris 2024.

3. Restrictions on INAs:
INAs are only allowed to compete in individual events, not team events. This significantly reduces their opportunities for medals compared to previous Olympics.

4. Competition from other countries:
Strong athletic nations like the USA, China, and Japan are sending full teams and are expected to dominate many events. The USA alone is sending 592 athletes, which dwarfs the INA contingent.

5. Specific athletes approved:
The list of approved INAs includes some strong contenders in sports like cycling and wrestling. However, it's unclear if top performers in high-medal sports like swimming and gymnastics have been approved.

6. Time constraints:
Some athletes, like swimmer Yuliya Efimova, have expressed concerns about not having enough time to qualify for events due to visa issues and tight deadlines.

7. Psychological factors:
Competing under a neutral flag, without national symbols, could potentially impact the motivation and performance of some athletes.

8. Recent performance indicators:
There's limited recent international competition data for many Russian and Belarusian athletes due to their exclusion from many events since 2022.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that INAs will win 15 or more gold medals:

1. The number of INAs is much smaller than Russia's usual Olympic team.
2. They're excluded from team events, which typically account for several gold medals.
3. The approval process has been slow, potentially impacting preparation.
4. Strong competition from other countries with full teams is expected.

However, there are some counterbalancing factors:

1. Some approved INAs are strong contenders in their sports.
2. Russian athletes have historically performed well at Olympics.
3. The neutral status might motivate some athletes to prove themselves individually.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability of INAs winning 15 or more gold medals is very low, but not impossible given the uncertainty and potential for exceptional individual performances.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 7.50%, with 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%.

2. Historical performance:
In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Russian athletes competing under the ROC flag won 20 gold medals. However, this included team sports which INAs are not eligible for in Paris 2024.

3. Restrictions on participation:
INAs are limited to individual events only, which eliminates potential gold medals in team sports. This significantly reduces the pool of events where they can win medals.

4. Quality of athletes approved:
The list of approved athletes doesn't include some of Russia's top performers from previous Olympics. Notable absences include swimmers and track and field athletes who have historically been strong medal contenders.

5. Competition from other countries:
Countries like the USA, China, and host nation France are expected to perform strongly. The USA alone is sending a 592-athlete team aiming to lead the medal count.

6. Psychological factors:
Competing under a neutral flag and without national anthem or symbols could potentially impact the performance of INAs.

7. Time constraints:
Some athletes, like swimmer Yuliya Efimova, have expressed concerns about not having enough time to validate their qualification due to visa issues and tight deadlines.

8. Sports where INAs are approved:
The approved list includes athletes in cycling, gymnastics/trampoline, weightlifting, and wrestling. While these are sports where Russian and Belarusian athletes have historically performed well, the limited number of participants reduces the chances of multiple gold medals in each sport.

Considering these factors, it seems highly unlikely that INAs will win 15 or more gold medals. The combination of fewer participants, exclusion from team events, absence of some top performers, and strong competition from other countries all work against reaching this threshold.

A more realistic estimate might be in the range of 5-10 gold medals, given the quality of some of the approved athletes and their historical performance in their respective sports. However, even this range might be optimistic given the circumstances.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, with 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) participating:
The IOC initially estimated 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes could compete as INAs. However, recent reports suggest only 25 (14 Russian, 11 Belarusian) have been approved so far. This is significantly lower than expected, which reduces the pool of potential medal winners.

2. Historical performance:
In Tokyo 2020, Russia won 20 gold medals. However, they had 335 athletes competing then, compared to potentially just 14-25 now. This suggests a much lower medal count is likely.

3. Restrictions on participation:
INAs are excluded from team events, further limiting their medal opportunities. They're only allowed in individual events across a few sports (cycling, gymnastics, weightlifting, wrestling).

4. Competition level:
Many top Russian and Belarusian athletes may choose not to participate under these conditions, potentially lowering the overall quality of INA competitors.

5. Psychological factors:
Competing under a neutral flag, without national symbols, may impact athlete motivation and performance.

6. Sport-specific considerations:
Wrestling, where Russia traditionally excels, has 10 approved INA athletes. This could be a source of multiple medals, but unlikely to reach 15 golds alone.

7. Recent performance indicators:
There's limited recent international competition data for these athletes due to previous bans, making it difficult to assess current form.

8. Comparison to other countries:
In Tokyo 2020, only the USA (39) and China (38) won more than 15 gold medals. It seems highly unlikely that a much smaller group of INAs could match this performance.

Given these factors, it seems extremely improbable that INAs will win 15 or more gold medals. The drastically reduced number of participants, exclusion from team events, and historical medal counts all point to a much lower total.

A more realistic estimate might be 3-7 gold medals for INAs, with even that being potentially optimistic given the circumstances.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs): Reports indicate about 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes may compete as INAs, totaling around 83. This is a relatively small contingent compared to full national teams.

2. Historical performance: In Tokyo 2020, Russia won 20 gold medals and Belarus won 1. However, this was as full teams including in team sports, which INAs are excluded from.

3. Restrictions on participation: INAs are limited to individual events only, reducing opportunities for medals compared to full national participation.

4. Caliber of athletes: Many top Russian and Belarusian athletes are still likely to compete, as indicated by reports of world-class cyclists and wrestlers being approved.

5. Competition level: The Olympics feature the world's best athletes, making it challenging to win gold medals even for top competitors.

6. Psychological factors: Competing under a neutral flag may impact some athletes' performance negatively, while others might be extra motivated to prove themselves.

7. Recent performance indicators: In events like the Diamond League, some potential INAs have shown strong form, suggesting they remain competitive at the highest level.

8. Comparison to similar situations: When Russian athletes competed as Olympic Athletes from Russia in 2018 Winter Olympics, they won 2 gold medals out of 17 total medals.

9. Sport-specific strengths: Russia and Belarus have traditionally been strong in certain sports like wrestling, gymnastics, and some track and field events, which could contribute to gold medal chances.

10. Total gold medals available: There are 329 gold medal events in Paris 2024, providing many opportunities, but also reflecting the high level of competition.

Balancing these factors, it seems unlikely that INAs will win 15 or more gold medals, but it's not impossible. The restrictions on team events and the limited number of athletes significantly reduce the chances compared to full national participation. However, the presence of world-class athletes in certain strong disciplines provides a pathway to some gold medals.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

6. Psychological factors:
Competing under a neutral flag and without national symbols may impact athlete morale and performance. However, it could also motivate some athletes to prove themselves individually.

7. Recent performance in international competitions:
Due to restrictions on Russian and Belarusian athletes in many international competitions since 2022, it's challenging to gauge their current competitive level compared to other nations' athletes.

8. Time constraints:
Some athletes, like swimmer Yuliya Efimova, have expressed concerns about not having enough time to qualify or prepare properly, which could impact performance.

Balancing these factors:

- The drastically reduced number of INAs compared to previous Russian Olympic teams is the most significant limiting factor.
- The ban on team events further reduces gold medal opportunities.
- However, the athletes who have been approved are likely to be among the best in their disciplines, potentially increasing their chances of winning golds in those specific events.
- The total of 15 gold medals seems very high given these constraints, especially considering that in Tokyo 2020, with over 300 athletes, Russia won 20 golds.

INAs are not allowed to compete in team events, which further reduces their medal-winning opportunities. This eliminates chances in sports like team gymnastics or relay events where Russian athletes have historically performed well.

4. Competition from other countries:
Major sporting nations like the USA, China, and Japan are sending full teams. For example, the USA is sending 592 athletes. This creates intense competition for gold medals across all events.

5. Specific athletes approved:
The list of approved INAs includes some strong contenders in wrestling and cycling. However, many top Russian athletes in swimming and track & field are not on the list, which were significant sources of gold medals in previous Olympics.

6. Psychological factors:
Competing under a neutral flag and without national symbols may impact athlete morale and performance. However, it could also motivate some athletes to prove themselves individually.

7. Recent performance in international competitions:
Due to restrictions on Russian and Belarusian athletes in many international competitions since 2022, it's challenging to gauge their current competitive level compared to other nations' athletes.

8. Time constraints:
Some athletes, like swimmer Yuliya Efimova, have expressed concerns about not having enough time to qualify or prepare properly, which could impact performance.

Balancing these factors:

- The drastically reduced number of INAs compared to previous Russian Olympic teams is the most significant limiting factor.
- The ban on team events further reduces gold medal opportunities.
- However, the athletes who have been approved are likely to be among the best in their disciplines, potentially increasing their chances of winning golds in those specific events.
- The total of 15 gold medals seems very high given these constraints, especially considering that in Tokyo 2020, with over 300 athletes, Russia won 20 golds.

Given these considerations, I believe it's highly unlikely that INAs will win 15 or more gold medals. A more realistic range might be between 5-10 gold medals, with the lower end being more probable given the severe restrictions and reduced participation.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 10.00%, but 3.00% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) participating:
The IOC has stated that a maximum of 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes could compete as INAs. However, recent reports indicate that only 25 Russian and Belarusian athletes have been authorized so far. This is significantly fewer than the maximum allowed, which could limit their potential for winning medals.
