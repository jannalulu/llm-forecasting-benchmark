**Fed under pressure to cut rates as market turmoil continues**
The US Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates as the global stock sell-off continues. Some analysts are calling for an emergency rate cut before the September rate decision, citing concerns that the US may be entering a recession. Bank of America economists have written that a September rate cut is 'a virtual lock', while Wharton School professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel is calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut. Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has also expressed support for an emergency cut, saying 'Real case for an emergency cut soon.' The market's concerns are underscored by the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiking to a high not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.6 percent, while the S&P 500 fell three percent and the Nasdaq closed down more than 3.4 percent.

**US Federal Reserve under pressure to cut rates as market turmoil continues**
The US Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates as the global stock sell-off continues. Some analysts are calling for an emergency rate cut before the September rate decision, citing the recent below-target US jobs report and fears of a recession. Bank of America economists say a September rate cut is 'a virtual lock,' while Wharton School professor emeritus Jeremy Siegel is calling for a 75-basis point emergency cut. However, others, such as Goldman Sachs economists, are urging caution and saying it's a mistake to infer too much from one jobs report. The Fed's decision will be closely watched, especially with the US presidential election in November, as any rate cut before then could thrust the Fed into the middle of the campaign.

**Stock market woes will not trigger emergency rate cut by Fed**
The Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates before their September meeting, despite the ongoing stock market rout, according to Fed watchers. However, the Fed is expected to cut rates significantly more before year-end than previously anticipated. Patrick Horan, a macroeconomist, said, 'A stock market drop, by itself, is not enough to justify a rate cut.' Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, warned of a risk of labor market conditions deteriorating before rate cuts are approved. The odds of the Fed cutting rates by 50 basis points by September are at about 84%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Before 2024-end, about 60% of the futures market now sees reductions totaling 125 basis points. Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist with JonesTrading, said, 'For an emergency rate cut you would need some type of financial or credit crisis to be forming or a major geopolitical event.' Other forces, such as the unwinding of the yen carry trade, are driving the recent spike in volatility, making an emergency rate cut less effective.

**Federal Reserve May Lower Interest Rates Before September**
The Federal Reserve may be forced to lower interest rates before September due to the rapid slowdown in the US labor market, which has caused turmoil in global stock markets. According to Reuters, futures contracts for interest rates, which expire later this month, have risen to their highest level in two months, indicating that rates are expected to be lower by the end of August. However, the chances of this are against it, as said by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Austin Goolsbee, earlier this week, 'The law doesn't say anything about the stock market. It's about employment and price stability.' Many analysts now predict a 0.5% cut in interest rates in September, but few believe the Federal Reserve will act soon. Economist Kathy Bostick wrote in 'Naytived', 'Current economic data does not justify an emergency rate cut between meetings, which would trigger a new round of panic in the markets.' Even former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William Dudley, who called for a rate cut last week - before the latest data showed the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in June - wrote this week that a cut between meetings 'is highly unlikely.' Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, is expected to give new guidance on what may be required when central bankers meet at the annual 'Jackson Hole' economic conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in Wyoming in late August. It is widely expected that Powell will ignore the stock market crash and continue what he said last Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates in the range of 5.25% - 5.50%, saying 'If we get the data we hope to get, a rate cut may be on the table in September.' In the coming weeks, data on employment, inflation, consumer spending, and economic growth may influence whether this cut will be a 0.25% or something bigger. In each of the 8 times in the past 30 years that the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates between meetings, market turmoil has ensued, particularly in the bond market, which has indicated rapid changes in credit flows that maintain business continuity, a factor that has been absent so far, and among those crises that the Federal Reserve has cut rates during: the sharp decline in tech stocks, which it cut by 0.5% at the beginning of the year, after the sharp rise in tech stocks turned into a crash in stocks), and after the 9/11 attacks, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 0.5% after the attacks and the closure of the US financial markets for several days.

**Fed May Not Wait Until September to Cut Interest Rate Amid Market Turbulence**
The Federal Reserve may not wait until its next policy meeting in September to reduce the US interest rate, as a strong slowdown in the US labor market has sparked speculation. However, Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said, 'the law doesn't say anything about the stock market. It's about employment and price stability.' A growing number of analysts now predict a 0.25 percentage point cut in the interest rate for the Fed's September meeting. However, few or no one believes that the Fed will do it before. Kathy Bostjancic, economist at Nationwide, wrote, 'The current economic data does not justify an emergency cut in the interest rate between meetings, and this would only cause a new round of panic in the markets.' Jerome Powell, Fed chair, is expected to provide new guidance on what he thinks may be necessary when the authorities meet at the annual Fed economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. For now, it is expected that Powell will not worry about the stock market and maintain what he said last Wednesday, after the Fed's decision to keep the interest rate at 5.25% to 5.50%. He said, 'If we get the data we expect, a reduction in our interest rate may be considered at the September meeting.' In the coming weeks, data on employment, inflation, consumer spending, and economic growth may influence whether this reduction will be 0.25 percentage points or something larger. In each of the eight occasions in the last 30 years when the US central bank cut interest rates between policy meetings, market agitation went far beyond stocks. See below these occasions:

**Solomon Says Fed Will Forgo Emergency Cut Despite Weak Jobs Data**
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon predicts the Federal Reserve will avoid taking emergency steps to lower borrowing costs, despite weak jobs data. He expects the US economy to 'chug along' and avoid a recession. Solomon stated, 'I don't expect that you'll see anything before September.' Investors had previously bet on an emergency rate cut, but now see little chance of this happening before September. However, they still expect a half-point cut at the Fed's September meeting. Solomon also noted that the recent employment data was 'softer than people were expecting,' but not 'horrible.' He believes the market is experiencing a correction after a strong run, and this may be healthy. Solomon stated, 'I think we're going to see more volatility in the short-term here. This was a pretty big, pretty meaningful correction.'

**Wall Street predictor makes bold claim about future of the US economy**
Financial author and stock market analyst Robert Prechter predicts that the Federal Reserve will initiate an emergency rate cut ahead of its September meeting to address the widespread selloff of equities. Prechter believes the Fed missed an opportunity to cut rates at its last meeting, saying 'I think there's gonna be a surprise rate cut before the September meeting because I think rates have started falling faster.' The last time the Fed made emergency rate cuts was during the early days of COVID. Economists at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have raised the likelihood of a recession within the next year, with JP Morgan analysts predicting a 50 basis point cut at the September meeting followed by another 50 basis point cut in November. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, blames the Fed for the current market state, saying 'I really do worry that we may lose US economic exceptionalism because of a policy mistake.'

**Siegel: Fed Should Make Emergency Rate Cut**
Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel has called for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to make a 75 basis point emergency rate cut before their September meeting, as they have already reached their inflation and employment targets. In a recent program on CNBC, Siegel also urged the Fed to make a deeper 75 basis point cut at their September 17-18 meeting. Siegel stated, 'And that's the minimum. The federal funds rate should be between 3.5% and 4% right now.' He also reminded that in June, the Fed said that the long-term federal funds rate should be 2.8% when inflation reaches 2% and unemployment is 4.2%. Siegel continued, 'We got the employment numbers on Friday and we are at 4.3% and 2.5% for inflation. We are 90% of the way to the inflation target and we have exceeded the employment target; these were clearly two targets that were mentioned by the Fed.'

**US Economy Faces Growing Fears of Recession, Market Expects Aggressive Rate Cut**
The US economy is facing growing fears of a recession, with weak job data from the past week casting doubt on the expectation of a 'soft landing'. As a result, the market is now expecting a more aggressive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) in September, potentially by 50 basis points. This is in contrast to the previous expectation of a 25 basis point cut. Some analysts even speculate that the Fed may implement an emergency rate cut before the September meeting. The Fed has not yet begun to reverse its policy of raising interest rates, which it has maintained since last year. The market is now pricing in a 98.5% probability of a 50 basis point cut in September, with some analysts expecting two or more rate cuts by the end of the year. The key factor is the weak job data, which showed a decline in non-agricultural employment and an increase in the unemployment rate. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for September 17-18, and the market is expecting a rate cut at that time. However, the exact timing and magnitude of the rate cut are still uncertain. The Fed's decision will be influenced by the upcoming US presidential election and the potential impact of a Republican victory on the economy. The market is also watching the upcoming Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers, where Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may provide some clues about the Fed's plans.

**Cries are getting louder for emergency interest-rate cuts this week, something that's been reserved for pandemics or terrorist attacks**
The US stock market is plummeting, and investors are calling for an emergency interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve. This would be a rare move, typically reserved for pandemics or terrorist attacks. The Federal Reserve has not indicated whether it will cut rates, but some economists, such as Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel, are urging an emergency 75 basis-point cut this week. Siegel said, 'How much have we moved the fed funds rate? Zero. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.' Others, like Jim Smigiel, chief investment officer at SEI, are cautioning against an overreaction, saying that emergency rate cuts 'makes little sense given the economic backdrop in the U.S. and would only serve to destroy policy maker credibility.' The Federal Reserve's next meeting is scheduled for September 18, but some experts are urging more aggressive rate cuts if the economy continues to deteriorate.

**Will the FED Lower Interest Rates Before the Scheduled Meeting?**
The Federal Reserve (FED) is expected to lower interest rates in September, but the recent economic data from the US has led to speculation that the decision may be brought forward. The FED's meeting is scheduled for September 17-18. If the FED lowers interest rates, what will happen to gold and the US dollar? The market is pricing in a 25 basis point interest rate cut by the FED with a 60% probability within the next week. Historically, the FED has taken emergency action in 1994, 1998, 2001, 2007, 2008, and 2020, and some analysts believe that the FED may take a similar step in response to the current economic situation. FED Chairman Jerome Powell said, 'We will do what it takes to support the economy.'
