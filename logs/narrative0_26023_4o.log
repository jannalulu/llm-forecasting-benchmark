**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did diplomatic expulsions or recalls occur between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 23.45%. Despite rising tensions—like the leaked transcript and naval confrontations—diplomatic channels remained open.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The Philippines' national security advisor's call for expulsions was a significant event, but not enough to tip the scales.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. Both nations seemed to walk a tightrope, avoiding escalation. The overlapping claims in the South China Sea remain a powder keg, though.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to our models' accuracy. Let's see how things unfold in the coming months.

*They exchange a knowing nod, the tension of the unfulfilled prediction palpable.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the diplomatic tensions between the Philippines and China were quite the headline grabber. Did our models predict any expulsions or recalls?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 45.32%. Despite the heightened tensions over the South China Sea incidents and the leaked transcript, neither side took the diplomatic leap.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. The call for expulsion by the Philippine national security advisor seemed significant.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, but our models factored in the diplomatic restraint both nations have shown historically. The probability reflected the reality—no expulsions or recalls occurred.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the model's accuracy, even amidst such geopolitical friction.

So, it's October 3rd, 2024, and the question on everyone's mind: Did diplomatic expulsions or recalls happen between the Philippines and China?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 42.35%. Despite rising tensions and the leaked transcript incident, neither side took that definitive step.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, though the probability was close, both nations seemed to prioritize diplomacy over escalation. The overlapping claims in the South China Sea continue to be a delicate issue.

Absolutely. The situation remains tense, but this outcome underscores the importance of diplomatic channels, even amidst provocations.

**NATE SILVER:** So, did the diplomatic showdown between the Philippines and China happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.72%. Despite the tensions, it seems both sides avoided any formal expulsions or recalls.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Given the leaked transcript and the South China Sea incidents, one might have expected a higher probability.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but historical patterns showed restraint in similar scenarios. Plus, the mid-year negotiations appeared to have calmed the waters a bit.

**NATE SILVER:** It’s a classic case of brinkmanship. The models were right again.

Well, Philip, the tensions between the Philippines and China certainly escalated. Our models had it at 65.32% that diplomatic expulsions or recalls would occur before September 30, 2024.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Given the strained relations over the South China Sea and recent incidents involving leaked transcripts, our models factored in the growing likelihood of diplomatic actions. The Philippines' national security advisor's strong stance was a significant indicator.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The use of water cannons and other aggressive tactics by China only added to the volatility. It's a complex geopolitical dance, but our models held steady.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And as always, the reality aligned with the probabilities. It's a fascinating, albeit tense, time in international relations.
