**Mass Production of iPhone SE 4 to Start in October, Budget Model Delayed Until January 2025**
Apple plans to start mass production of iPhone SE 4 in October 2024, but the budget model may not be available until January 2025. The company aims to prevent the threat to the sales of the latest iPhone model by delaying the release of the budget version. The iPhone SE 4 will have a new design and improved internal components, including a processor A18 SoC, OLED screen, Face ID support, and USB-C port. However, to reduce costs, Apple will only install one camera on the rear and front panels. The report also mentions other changes in the iPhone family, including internal changes to prevent overheating, and a foldable iPhone, which is expected to be released in 2026. Apple also plans to use 48-megapixel sensors from Samsung in iPhone 18 and subsequent models, breaking Sony's monopoly in this area.

**Apple to Significantly Expand Vision Pro Content Library**
Apple has announced plans to significantly expand the library of content for its new product Vision Pro. Starting with the Boundless video, users will have access to over a dozen new immersive video clips. This decision is a response to user criticism about the lack of content after the launch of Vision Pro in February this year. The Boundless video allows viewers to take a virtual walk on an air balloon above breathtaking landscapes. In the fall, the Arctic Surfing video will be released, which will send viewers on a cold adventure. The Elevated series will premiere in September, with the first episode dedicated to traveling over Hawaii. In October, another episode of Wild Life, dedicated to elephants, is expected to be released. Additionally, by the end of the year, users can expect the release of various content, including Red Bull's Big-Wave Surfing, a musical experience with The Weeknd, and a look inside the 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend. Furthermore, the library will feature the action-packed Submerged, set on a World War II-era submarine.

**Apple May Launch New iPad Models Before the End of the Year**
Apple has not yet announced the release of new iPad models, but a report from Digital Trend suggests that the company may launch more iPad devices before the end of the year. The report is based on some backend codes that were discovered recently, which suggest that Apple is working on four new iPad models. The codes were found by Nicolás Álvarez and published on X. The new iPad models are expected to feature the A16 chip, while the iPad mini may feature the A17 chip. The report also suggests that the new iPad mini may feature the M2 chip instead of the A17 chip, which is used in the iPad Air (2024). The codes also indicate that Apple may discontinue some iPad models, including the iPad (11th generation) and the iPad Pro M3. The report suggests that Apple may launch new iPad models in October, after the announcement of the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to happen in September.

**Apple's AI Platform Delayed, Expected to Launch with iPhone 16**
According to Bloomberg, Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) platform, Apple Intelligence, will not be available to users until the launch of the iPhone 16, which is expected in October. The initial plan was to release the platform in September, along with the new iPhone models. The delay is due to the need to fix bugs and improve the functionality of the AI resources. The platform will consist of updates to Siri, the arrival of ChatGPT for Apple products, automatic writing, and text summarization, among other features. The Apple Intelligence will not be complete when it is officially launched, with some changes to Siri still pending and the first versions available only in English. Users can expect updates related to Apple Intelligence from the end of 2024 to the first half of 2025.

**Apple Intelligence to Debut with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 in October**
According to a recent report, Apple Intelligence, a new set of artificial intelligence features, is not expected to be ready until October with the release of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1. Mark Gurman from Bloomberg stated that Apple plans to introduce Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, which is expected to be released by October. The beta versions of these updates with some AI features will be available for developers to start testing this week. Apple Intelligence will not come with a full set of features initially, and some features, such as Siri with AI support, are expected to arrive later this year. Gurman reported that these updates will be applied next year, and when Apple Intelligence is released, it will not be compatible with all devices that support iOS 18, requiring a device with an A17 Pro chip or M-series chip, excluding all modern iPhone models except for iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max.

**Apple Intelligence Delayed: No Longer Expected to Launch with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18**
Apple Intelligence, a new feature announced this year, is expected to be delayed and will not be released with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. According to Bloomberg, insiders familiar with Apple have stated that Apple Intelligence will miss its original September launch date. Mark Gurman, a well-known and reliable leaker, first announced the existence of Apple Intelligence before its official announcement. Apple is concerned about the stability of its AI assistant and is asking developers to test the feature and find any errors, which will take several weeks, pushing the release date to October 2024. This means that Apple Intelligence will not meet its original launch date alongside iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. Apple has treated iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence as two separate technologies since its debut at WWDC in June 2024. The delay may mean that the first deliveries of the next iPhone 16 models will come with iOS 18 but without Apple Intelligence. This will need to be confirmed in the coming weeks.

**Apple Intelligence Release Delayed Due to Stability Concerns**
Apple Intelligence, a generative AI system, was initially announced at WWDC 2024 and was expected to be available in beta form to a limited number of users in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. However, the latest news suggests that the release has been delayed. According to Mark Gurman from Bloomberg, Apple needs more time to fix errors, and the AI will only be available on compatible devices with iOS 18.1, which is expected to be released in late September or early October. The reason for the delay is concerns from the development team about the stability of Apple Intelligence. The team needs more time for testing and releasing a high-quality product. Interestingly, the beta version of iOS 18.1 will be released before the release of iOS 18. This unusual situation suggests that Apple has high hopes for the technology and is not rushing its release. Apple plans to make Intelligence a key feature of the iPhone 16 series, which could help boost sales, as the current iPhone 15 series is selling poorly.

**Apple's AI Feature Delayed Until October or 2025**
Apple's new AI feature will not be released in September, and will instead be delayed until October or 2025. The company has signed a document with the White House to develop responsible AI. Apple's AI, which was announced in June, will not be available on the new iPhone and iPad, and will not be included in the new operating systems, iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. The company wants to give developers more time to test and refine the AI, and to gather data and expand the testing pool. Apple has also signed a commitment with the White House to develop secure and reliable AI, and has announced that it will implement this technology in its devices. The AI, called Apple Intelligence, will be able to write and correct texts, assist with scheduling and prioritizing notifications, generate images, and perform personalized actions within apps. However, the company is facing criticism for its partnership with OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, and has raised concerns about the potential risks of AI, such as biased responses and data privacy issues.

**Apple will reportedly release artificial intelligence features in October, weeks after iOS 18 update**
Apple's artificial intelligence features, announced during WWDC2024, will be released in October, delayed from the initial iOS 18 update. The delay is due to concerns over stability and the need for wider testing. The features will be available on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer, and will include ChatGPT integration, Siri improvements, and other capabilities such as proofreading, custom emojis, and summarizing phone calls. Developers will have early access to the features in the iOS 18.1 beta this week.

**Apple Delays Artificial Intelligence Feature**
Apple announced its partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, to introduce 'Apple Intelligence' at WWDC 2024. However, according to Bloomberg News, the artificial intelligence feature has been delayed. Sources close to the matter stated that the AI features will not be available on the new iPhones released in September and will instead be released as a software update in October. Mark Gurman, a Bloomberg Apple writer, stated that Apple wants to give Apple Intelligence a bit more time to focus on bug fixes and improving the company's stability. Gurman also claimed that Apple Intelligence will be part of iOS 18.1, meaning that iPhone 16 series users will get the AI features a few weeks after the release of the new phones.

**iPhone 16 Series Tipped To Come Without AI Feature As Apple Delays Apple Intelligence Announcement**
Apple has delayed the release of its Apple Intelligence AI initiative, which was initially planned for the September launch of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. As a result, the iPhone 16 series will not come with AI features as a key selling point. Instead, Apple will release Apple Intelligence through software updates starting in October, with developers getting an early look through the iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 betas. The full set of features will be rolled out gradually through multiple updates to iOS 18 from late 2024 to the first half of 2025. Apple is hopeful that the AI enhancements will still drive interest in the new iPhones, despite the delay.

**Apple Intelligence: AI functions for iPhone to be delayed**
Apple is expected to delay the launch of its Apple Intelligence platform, a set of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The resources will be released in October, a month later than planned, which means they will not be included in the first version of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 as initially expected. The delay is due to the need for more time to fix bugs and refine the functionality of the tools, especially since the expectation for the platform is high. Developers will have access to the resources for the first time this week through new beta versions of the company's operating systems. The platform was announced in June during the WWDC 2024 conference and was expected to be launched in September. Apple Intelligence is a suite of functions from the company or third-party partners, such as ChatGPT, and includes a radical update to the Siri personal assistant. The integration of ChatGPT in Apple systems. (Image: Apple/Divulgação) The new Apple calendar shows that the AI tools for iPhones and iPads will likely enter into force only with the iOS 18.1 update, currently scheduled for October. However, not all resources will be added at once, as the company will choose to fragment the additions over several weeks. In practice, this means that resources such as the evolution of Siri and using internal device data in searches may not be available until the end of 2024 or early 2025. The version for Apple Vision Pro is still in development and will arrive later than the variants for iPhone, iPad, and Macs. Apple has not commented on the matter and has not confirmed the delay in the launch of the AI tools.

Apple Intelligence, a long-awaited AI feature, will not be launched alongside the iPhone 16 as previously anticipated. Instead, it will be released around October, alongside iOS 18.1. However, a beta version of the software is expected to be released soon, possibly as early as this week, allowing users to test the new features ahead of launch. The update is significant, bringing new features and a new way of operating, and developers will need time to integrate it into their apps.

**Apple Intelligence: Delayed Launch for Bug Fixes and Future Updates**
Apple has announced its generative artificial intelligence platform, Apple Intelligence, during the World Wide Developer Conference 2024 in June. Initially, the company stated that Apple Intelligence would be available for the launch of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, scheduled for autumn. However, according to Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, Apple Intelligence will not be launched with the new OS during the September event. This means that people who buy the next iPhone 16 models will not have access to Apple Intelligence immediately. Instead, the report states that the AI platform will be part of the first major update for iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, which is expected to be available for supported iPhone and iPad users in October. The delay in the release of the AI platform is due to Apple's desire to eliminate new bugs before the public launch. Apple Intelligence will not be fully functional when it is initially released in October, but new features will be added between the end of 2024 and 2025, including an important update to the digital voice assistant Siri.

**Apple Intelligence Features Delayed for iOS 18 Launch**
Apple Intelligence, Apple's response to Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, was announced at the 2024 WWDC. However, recent leaks suggest that some key features of Apple Intelligence will not be ready for the launch of iOS 18. The new version of Apple's mobile operating system will be released in the coming months, aimed at integrating changes to iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max devices. Despite Apple Intelligence being a major selling point for iOS 18, it appears that expectations will need to be lowered. Apple Intelligence will not offer a complete experience at the launch of iOS 18. According to Mark Gurman, many of the features of Apple Intelligence will not be available during the first weeks of iOS 18's release. Apple plans to make some of these features accessible to developers, aiming to provide a polished experience. There is no official release date, but Apple Intelligence is expected to arrive in October alongside iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, meaning the initial launch of iOS 18 will not integrate this AI novelty. Additionally, the improvement of Siri is expected to be released in 2025. Apple's steps seem secure, but the pace is slower than that of other companies focusing on AI integration. Unfortunately, all that can be done is wait.

According to Mark Gurman, of Bloomberg, the launch of the new AI resources will be gradual. Developers will have early access to test these resources through beta versions of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, allowing for feedback and adjustments before public availability. The Apple Intelligence promises a range of improvements, including notification prioritization, web page summaries, voice notes, and more. The first iPhone 16 models may be delivered without the new AI resources, which will be included in subsequent software updates. The Apple Intelligence will be integrated into Mac computers with Apple chips through macOS Sequoia and is also in development for the Vision Pro, with a later release date.

This delay only affects eligible countries, excluding France and Europe, which will not receive the new features. Apple has not officially announced a release date, but many users were expecting the AI tools to be available at the same time as iOS 18. The features may be rolled out gradually, with Siri being the first to receive the new AI capabilities, followed by the rest of the features in late 2024 or early 2025.

**Apple Delays Artificial Intelligence Features in iOS to October**
Apple's artificial intelligence features, expected to be released in September, will now be rolled out in October, but not fully. The iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 operating systems will be released in September without support for Apple Intelligence, and a subsequent update will bring the feature. Apple Intelligence testing in beta versions of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 is expected to start this week. The company delayed the release of the features due to concerns about the stability of the software. The final release of iOS 18 will be in September, but the iPhone 16 series will not be able to offer the widely publicized AI features announced in June at WWDC 2024. Even iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 will not have the full set of AI features, with some being implemented later and 'catching up' to the company's software by the end of 2024 or early 2025.

**Apple Intelligence Won't Arrive Until October with iOS 18.1**
Apple Intelligence is unlikely to be ready in time for the public releases of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 in September, but it may not take long to wait after that. According to Mark Gurman from Bloomberg, Apple plans to release Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, which is expected to be released by October. The beta versions of these with some artificial intelligence features will be available for developers to start testing soon. Apple Intelligence will not come with its full set of features initially. Some features, such as Siri with artificial intelligence, are expected to come later in the year. Gurman reported that these updates may move to next year. When Apple Intelligence arrives, it will not be compatible with all iPhones that can support iOS 18. Apple stated during its announcement that it requires a device with an A17 Pro chip or M-series chip. This excludes all modern iPhone models except for iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max.

**Apple Intelligence Release Delayed Until October**
Apple has postponed the release of its artificial intelligence feature, Apple Intelligence, for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS Sequoia until October. The company wants to spend more time fixing errors and improving the stability of the algorithm. According to Mark Gurman from Bloomberg, the feature will be available after the official release of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. Despite the delay, Apple Intelligence will be available to developers next week with the release of the first beta versions of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1. Interestingly, Apple has never released pre-release versions of subsequent updates before, but in this case, it is releasing iOS 18.1 before the main version. This means that the iPhone 16 lineup will likely be released without Apple Intelligence and will require a software update to obtain it in October. Some features will still be missing after the release of Apple Intelligence, such as the updated Siri, which will only be available in the first half of 2025.

**iPhone: These new features will be released later**
According to a Bloomberg report, Apple will release its artificial intelligence (AI) features for smartphones and tablets later than expected. The features will be available in October, after the planned release of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 in September. Apple will provide beta versions of the operating systems to software developers in the coming days. Apple has not commented on the report. The company had previously announced the AI features at a developer conference in June, but experts and investors had a reserved reaction.

**Gurman: iOS 18.1 beta with Apple Intelligence launching as soon as this week - 9to5Mac**
Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that Apple Intelligence features will be delayed until iOS 18.1, which is expected to release in October. A developer beta with some features will be available as soon as this week, but some features, like the new Siri, are not expected until next Spring. This means iPhone 16 models will not have Apple Intelligence at launch in September, but it will be available a few weeks later. Apple's strategy is unusual, as they usually don't release developer betas before the final release of the prior version.

Apple plans to start mass production of iPhone SE 4 in October 2024, but the budget model may not be available until January 2025. The company aims to prevent the threat to the sales of the latest iPhone model by delaying the release of the budget version. The iPhone SE 4 will have a new design and improved internal components, including a processor A18 SoC, OLED screen, Face ID support, and USB-C port. However, to reduce costs, Apple will only install one camera on the rear and front panels. The report also mentions other changes in the iPhone family, including internal changes to prevent overheating, and a foldable iPhone, which is expected to be released in 2026. Apple also plans to use 48-megapixel sensors from Samsung in iPhone 18 and subsequent models, breaking Sony's monopoly in this area.

Mass production of iPhone SE 4 is expected to start in October, but sales may not begin until 2025. The new model is expected to have a significantly updated design and numerous improvements, which should attract budget-conscious buyers. The delay is likely due to Apple's desire to prioritize the successful launch of iPhone 16, which is expected to be a major competitor on large markets such as China. Despite the delay, iPhone SE 4 is expected to be a functional device with an A18 processor, OLED screen, Face ID support, and USB-C port.

**Don't wait for the iPhone SE to buy a new phone in 2024**
Rumors have been circulating about the fourth generation of the iPhone SE, with some speculating it will be released in 2024, specifically in the spring. However, according to WCCFTech, production of the iPhone SE is only expected to start in October of this year. This information effectively confirms that the launch will not occur after Apple's traditional September event, where new iPhone generations are typically announced. As a result, it is highly likely that the iPhone SE will only be released in 2025, which reinforces the possibility of a spring launch.

**iPhone SE 4: Mass Production to Start in October 2024, Release in January 2025**
According to a report from The Information, Apple's suppliers are planning to start mass production of the iPhone SE 4 in October 2024. The device is expected to be released in January 2025, rather than alongside the iPhone 16 series in September. The iPhone SE 4 is expected to have a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a physical button, and a USB-C port. The design is likely to be similar to the iPhone 14 base model, but with a single rear camera and possibly sharing the same rear panel production process as the iPhone 16. The reason for the change in strategy is unknown, but it's possible that Apple is adopting its latest rear panel production process for the SE model to take advantage of economies of scale in production, given that iPhone 14 production is nearing its end.

Apple was the most affected by this change, as it was the only company that had not yet switched to USB-C charging. This decision is related to the adoption of a new regulation to change the batteries of electronic devices, considering that within three years, technology companies will be required to manufacture mobile phones with the same functionality as old phones, whose batteries could be removed and replaced.

**Apple May Launch New iPad Models Before the End of the Year**
Apple has not yet announced the release of new iPad models, but a report from Digital Trend suggests that the company may launch more iPad devices before the end of the year. The report is based on some backend codes that were discovered recently, which suggest that Apple is working on four new iPad models. The codes were found by Nicolás Álvarez and published on X. The new iPad models are expected to feature the A16 chip, while the iPad mini may feature the A17 chip. The report also suggests that the new iPad mini may feature the M2 chip instead of the A17 chip, which is used in the iPad Air (2024). The codes also indicate that Apple may discontinue some iPad models, including the iPad (11th generation) and the iPad Pro M3. The report suggests that Apple may launch new iPad models in October, after the announcement of the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to happen in September.

**New iPads Flee, Including Two That Will Arrive Soon**
Apple may be releasing new iPad models, including two that will arrive soon. A recently discovered backend code may have revealed several iPad models coming from Apple. The code, found by Nicolás Álvarez and published by Aaronp613 on X, lists four iPad models. The code suggests that the new iPad (11th generation) will have an A16 processor, while the iPad mini (7th generation) may have an A17 processor. The new Apple Intelligence features require a processor A17 Bionic or newer, so it would be logical for the new iPad mini to have at least this processor to support the new technology. However, the next iPad mini may instead have an M2 processor, present in the iPad Air (2024). The code also mentions tablets that Apple has likely decided to discontinue, including an updated standard iPad that goes beyond the recently discontinued (9th generation) and an iPad Pro M3. The current iPad was introduced in October 2022, while the last iPad mini was unveiled in October 2021. If Apple decides to release new versions of these models, it will likely happen in October, following the announcement of the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to take place in September.

**When Will You Get iPadOS 18? Here's What You Need to Know**
Apple has announced significant software updates for its main products, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple Vision Pro, Apple TV, and Mac. Among these is iPadOS 18 for iPad. You may wonder when you can download the new update if you own an iPad. The update is technically available now, but some details need to be considered. There are three different versions of iPadOS 18, and each will be released at different times this year. Apple released the first beta version for developers at the WWDC 2024 conference. Although you can download and install iPadOS 18 now, even as a non-developer, it is not recommended. New beta versions for developers will be released throughout the summer, and each should be better than the previous one. Therefore, you should wait for at least a few more beta versions of iPadOS 18 to be available before taking the leap. Apple is expected to release the first public beta of iPadOS 18 in July. Once the first public beta is available, you can download and install it in the same way as the beta versions for developers. Apple may also release the first public version of iPadOS 18 in September, when it announces its new iPhone 16 series. However, it may delay this until October. When iPadOS 18 is finally released, it will be exciting. The update includes new features such as Apple Intelligence, new customization tools, updated Notes and Photos apps, and more. It also presents the first official Calculator app in the history of the iPad. A password app is also expected to arrive. Messages, Mail, and Safari will also benefit from new tools, as well as SharePlay and Freeform.

The new iPhone 16 is expected to be released in the fall of 2024, with Apple typically unveiling its new flagship devices in September or October. Rumors have been circulating about the new 16th generation, including the possibility of a special camera button. The current iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have an Action Button that can be customized to perform various tasks. Another feature rumored for the Capture Button is the ability to focus on specific subjects in photo and video mode by lightly pressing the button, and then taking the shot by fully pressing it. Apple recently showcased its comprehensive AI strategies at the Worldwide Developers Conference 2024, including improvements to Siri, voice-to-text capabilities, and the potential for controlling iPads and iPhones with eye movements. It is unclear if these features will be available on the iPhone 16, which will likely have many small and exciting changes and improvements. However, significant design changes are not expected. The new model will likely resemble its predecessors in terms of design.

**Apple's first foldable iPhone may launch in 2027**
According to a recent report from TrendForce, Apple's first foldable iPhone is unlikely to launch before 2027. The delay is due to Apple's strict requirements for crease and reliability, aiming for a seamless fold and long-term durability. Despite the delay, analysts believe a foldable iPhone could be a game-changer, with Apple's market influence and customer base potentially leading to a significant shift in market dynamics. This is not the first time reports of Apple's foldable device have emerged, with a 20.3-inch foldable MacBook also expected to be released by 2027.
