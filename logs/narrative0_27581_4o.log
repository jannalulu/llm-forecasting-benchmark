**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Did Greg Brockman return to OpenAI?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. The exodus of founders was a strong indicator. Brockman seemed ready for a new chapter.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. The boardroom coup and his sabbatical hinted at deeper issues. Even with Altman's return, it felt like Brockman was distancing himself.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Plus, the tech landscape is shifting. Opportunities elsewhere might have been too tempting.

**NATE SILVER:** True. His departure reflects broader changes in AI leadership. It's a new era for OpenAI.

*They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Another chapter closed. Let's see where the future takes him.

**NATE SILVER**  
Did Greg Brockman return to OpenAI?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. The exodus from OpenAI made it unlikely.

**NATE SILVER**  
True, with Schulman at Anthropic and Brockman's sabbatical, the odds were stacked against a return.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
His close ties with Altman were a factor, but the boardroom coup fallout was too significant.

**NATE SILVER**  
And the sabbatical tweet hinted at a deeper desire for change.

*They both glance at the latest headlines.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
A pivotal moment for OpenAI. Their future's uncertain without Brockman.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, but our models rarely miss. Let's see how this shapes the AI landscape.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, as of today, Greg Brockman has not returned to OpenAI.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75%. The signals were clear with the recent departures and his extended leave announcement.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, especially with the boardroom coup last November. Brockman's ties to Altman were strong, but the landscape has shifted.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. His sabbatical seemed genuine. Nine years is a long time to pour into one venture.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, for now, OpenAI moves forward without one of its founding pillars.

Both nod, acknowledging the weight of their predictions, as the newsroom buzzes around them.
