**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

Two SUPERFORECASTERS sit at a corner table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the clock struck October 1st, and no Form 4 filing for Trump Media. Our models had it at 5.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right on the money. The New York Times piece on the lockup period ending was a key factor, but his statement to the press was telling. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Exactly. When Trump said he wasn't prepared to sell, it was a strong signal. Seeking Alpha's report really influenced market sentiment.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And, of course, the investor relations page not being timely updated added a layer of uncertainty. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how a single statement can sway probabilities. 

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their prediction.

**FADE OUT.**

INT. COFFEE SHOP – DAY – OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits at a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered. They discuss the latest news.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. No Form 4 filing for Trump Media. Our models had it at 5.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Makes sense. The lockup ended just last month. Trump hinted he wouldn't sell, and the stock jumped. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Plus, the investor relations page isn't always timely. Factoring that in, our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
True. Even if he wanted to sell, the optics would be tricky with the election coming up. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Exactly. It was a low probability event, and the market reacted accordingly.

They sip their coffees, nodding in agreement, satisfied with their forecasting prowess.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

So, the Form 4 filing didn't appear. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Trump's lockup period ended on September 19, but his statement about not selling shares was a strong signal.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

The market reacted sharply to his comments. Seeking Alpha reported a 25% jump in stock price.
