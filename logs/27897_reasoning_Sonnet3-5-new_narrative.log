Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Russia's second mobilization wave."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given Putin's consistent strategy of using contract soldiers and crypto-mobilization throughout 2024, plus the domestic political risks, our models had it at 15.5%."

Nate: "The key signals were there - ISW's February assessment of Putin's fear of public backlash, Russia's successful recruitment of 400,000 contract soldiers, and their ability to maintain frontline positions without formal mobilization."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The Russian leadership found alternatives to formal mobilization - increased salaries, prison recruitment, and foreign fighters. A second wave would have been politically costly before their March elections and strategically unnecessary afterward."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Coffee?"

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like Russia managed to avoid that second mobilization wave. Our models had it at 15.32%."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Not surprising, given what we knew by September. Putin's strategy of crypto-mobilization and contract soldiers proved sufficient. The ISW's February assessment about his fears of public discontent was spot-on."

Nate: "The signs were there. They hit their recruitment targets through voluntary contracts, and the Kremlin maintained plausible deniability while avoiding the political fallout of another formal mobilization."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The combination of higher salaries for contract soldiers and their successful recruitment of 400,000 troops in 2023 made a second mobilization unnecessary. Though I must say, the probability wasn't negligible - there were moments when Ukraine's advances had us concerned."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like Russia managed to avoid that second mobilization wave. Not surprising given Putin's concerns about domestic unrest."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models had it at 15.25%. The key signal was their successful recruitment of contract soldiers throughout 2024. They hit their targets without needing formal mobilization."

Nate: "The crypto-mobilization strategy worked well enough for them. Plus, Putin's memory of the public backlash from the 2022 partial mobilization likely played a role."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The ISW's February assessment about Putin's reluctance proved prescient. Though they needed the manpower, the political cost of formal mobilization was too high."

Nate: "Another win for our models. Sometimes what doesn't happen is as telling as what does."
