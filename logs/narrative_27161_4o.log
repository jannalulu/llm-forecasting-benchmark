INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, analyzing the aftermath of the Denver Broncos' Week 4 game against the New York Jets.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, did Bo Nix start yesterday?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yes, he did. Our models had it at 85.62%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It makes sense. After cutting Russell Wilson and drafting Nix as the 12th pick, they needed fresh energy.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True. But with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson on the roster, it wasn't a certainty.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right, but the Broncos' coaching staff seemed keen on Nix's potential from the start.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And with the limited news we had up to August 14, it was a calculated risk.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, our models proved accurate again. Nix is the future.

They nod, satisfied with their precise forecasting abilities.

INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY

The room buzzes with anticipation as SUPERFORECASTER A and SUPERFORECASTER B huddle around a table, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, it's official. Bo Nix didn't start for the Broncos yesterday.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the competition, it made sense.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
Exactly. Jarrett Stidham's preseason performance was solid, and Zach Wilson's experience was a factor.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
And let's not forget the Broncos' strategy to ease Nix into the NFL. They have a lot invested in him.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(rifling through papers)  
The news cutoff was crucial. No surprises after August 14th.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(smiling)  
Yet, the buzz around Nix was palpable. He's got potential, just not for Week 4.

They both chuckle, the weight of accuracy resting lightly on their shoulders.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee and analyzing data. The atmosphere is both relaxed and analytical.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, Bo Nix. Did he start for the Broncos against the Jets?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No. Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the roster dynamics, it was unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nods)  
Right. Despite being a first-round pick, Nix was competing with Stidham and Wilson, both with more NFL experience.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(consulting notes)  
And considering the Broncos' 8-win season in 2023, they needed stability, not experimentation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
And let's not forget the media pressure on the Broncos after cutting Russell Wilson. High stakes for Nix.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(chuckles)  
Indeed. But hey, the season's still young. Anything can happen.

They all nod in agreement, sipping their coffee thoughtfully.

FADE OUT.

INT. SUPERFORECASTER HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A group of superforecasters huddle around a table, papers strewn everywhere. The date reads September 30, 2024.

FORECASTER 1  
So, did Bo Nix start for the Broncos yesterday?

FORECASTER 2  
No, he didn't. Our models had it at 15.75%.

FORECASTER 3  
Makes sense. With Russell Wilson gone, they had options. But Stidham seemed more likely to start given the preseason performance.

FORECASTER 1  
And Zach Wilson’s experience, despite his ups and downs, made him a strong contender.

FORECASTER 2  
Exactly. Plus, the coaches were cautious about throwing a rookie like Nix into the fire too soon.

FORECASTER 3  
Remember the articles up to mid-August? They hinted at Nix's potential but also highlighted his need for development.

FORECASTER 1  
True. Our models were spot on again.

They nod in agreement, confident in their analysis as the scene fades.
