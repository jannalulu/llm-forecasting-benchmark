Two SUPERFORECASTERS, EMMA and JAMES, sit at a quaint café, sipping espresso.

EMMA  
(leans in)  
So, Alireza Firouzja, huh? Quite the upset.

JAMES  
(nods)  
Indeed. Our models had it at just 15.67%. Given the competition, it was a long shot.

EMMA  
(smiling)  
But he did it. Beat Nakamura in the semis and then Carlsen in the final. Incredible.

JAMES  
(raises an eyebrow)  
And to think, just last week, the buzz was all about a Carlsen-Nakamura showdown.

EMMA  
(shrugs)  
Firouzja's rise has been remarkable. He’s reshaping the chess world.

JAMES  
(sips his espresso)  
Our models never lie. But sometimes, reality is more thrilling than probability.

They share a knowing smile, the Parisian streets bustling around them.

SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, sipping espresso, their laptops open.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning in)  
So, the Speed Chess Championship wrapped up. Our models had it at 35.45% for Alireza Firouzja.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given his rapid rise and his match against Nakamura, it was plausible. But Carlsen's experience was a formidable wall.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Niemann's upset over Carlsen in 2022 added layers of unpredictability. Still, our models favored Carlsen at 60.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(typing)  
And Nakamura? A solid 3.80%. His past victories couldn't outweigh Firouzja's momentum.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
The chess world is ever-evolving. But our Brier scores stay unmatched.

They clink their cups, celebrating accuracy over outcome.

FADE OUT.
