Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Points to Consider:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Trump has a history of campaign manager turnover (fired multiple in 2016/2020)
- However, Wiles and LaCivita have remained stable so far

2. Recent Evidence For Potential Change:
- Multiple reports of tension, particularly regarding LaCivita's high billing ($1.7M this year)
- Addition of Corey Lewandowski creating potential power struggles
- Reports of Trump wanting LaCivita and Lewandowski to "kill each other"
- Polling pressure as Harris leads in some swing states
- Crypto betting markets showing ~47% chance of firing

3. Evidence Against Change:
- Trump publicly backing both managers: "Susie is fantastic... Chris is fantastic"
- Lewandowski explicitly stating "no change at the top"
- Only about 40 days until October 1st deadline
- Campaign entering critical phase where stability matters
- Wiles especially seems secure based on reporting

4. Structural Factors:
- Late stage of campaign (risky to change leadership)
- Need for stability heading into final stretch
- Both managers have significant experience

5. Market Signals:
- Polymarket showing 47% chance of firing
- Multiple news sources reporting internal tension

Weighing these factors:
- The short timeframe (until Oct 1) reduces likelihood
- But significant internal tension exists
- LaCivita seems more at risk than Wiles
- Historical pattern suggests Trump does make late changes
- Market pricing seems roughly accurate

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 55.40%, with 45.20% being the most likely. Probability: 45.20%.

Let me analyze this methodically:

Key Facts:
- Resolution date: October 1, 2024
- Current campaign managers: Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles
- Need to consider: firing, resignation, or demotion from campaign manager position

Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Recent addition of Corey Lewandowski has created tension
- Multiple sources report potential power struggles
- Polymarket shows 47% chance of campaign manager firing
- Reports of "growing chatter" at Mar-a-Lago about Trump wanting LaCivita and Lewandowski to "kill each other"
- LaCivita's high billing ($1.7M this year) creating internal friction

2. Historical Pattern:
- Trump has frequently changed campaign leadership in past campaigns
- Previous campaign managers like Lewandowski were fired

3. Campaign Pressure:
- Harris leading in some polls
- Campaign facing fundraising challenges
- Trump known to make leadership changes when facing difficulties

Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Recent Strong Public Support:
- Trump repeatedly expressing support for both managers
- "Susie is fantastic, as you know. And Chris is fantastic. They are leading it"

2. Lewandowski's Own Statements:
- Publicly stated there will be "no change at the top"
- Described it as an "addition campaign, not subtraction"

3. Time Factor:
- Only about 40 days until resolution date
- Major campaign changes less likely close to election

Considering these factors, while there's significant tension and historical precedent for changes, the short timeframe and recent public support suggest a moderate probability.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Multiple sources report internal tension, particularly regarding Chris LaCivita's high billing ($1.7M this year) and the addition of Corey Lewandowski
2. Reports of "chatter" at Mar-a-Lago suggesting Trump wants LaCivita and Lewandowski to "kill each other"
3. Trump's historical pattern of campaign manager turnover in previous campaigns
4. Polymarket showing 47% chance of campaign manager firing before November
5. Campaign facing challenges with polling and fundraising
6. Recent addition of Lewandowski creating potential power struggle

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Limited time window (only until October 1, 2024)
2. Recent public statements from Trump praising both Wiles and LaCivita ("Susie is fantastic... And Chris is fantastic")
3. Lewandowski himself stating there will be "no change at the top"
4. Campaign describing itself as an "addition campaign, not a subtraction campaign"
5. Both managers still appearing to have significant influence and control

Additional Considerations:
- The timeline is relatively short (approximately 5 weeks)
- Trump tends to make significant changes when facing polling/electoral pressure
- The campaign is entering a critical phase
- Historical base rate of campaign manager changes in presidential campaigns

Balancing these factors:
- The short timeline significantly reduces the probability
- However, the multiple credible reports of internal tension and Trump's history suggest real risk
- The addition of Lewandowski creates instability but may not result in immediate changes

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Facts:
- Resolution date: October 1, 2024
- Current campaign managers: Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles
- Question resolves YES if either leaves their position before Oct 1

Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Recent addition of Corey Lewandowski has created internal tension
- Multiple reports suggest potential power struggles
- Polymarket shows 47% chance of campaign manager firing
- Raw Story reports "growing chatter" at Mar-a-Lago about Trump wanting LaCivita and Lewandowski to "kill each other"
- LaCivita's high billing ($1.7M this year) causing internal controversy

2. Trump's history of campaign shake-ups
- Previously fired multiple campaign managers including Lewandowski himself
- Often makes personnel changes when polling/fundraising challenges arise
- Currently facing competitive polling against Harris

3. Current campaign challenges
- Fundraising difficulties reported
- Competitive polling in swing states
- Some MAGA base dissatisfaction with campaign direction

Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Recent public statements of support
- Trump explicitly praised both managers: "Susie is fantastic, as you know. And Chris is fantastic"
- Lewandowski publicly stated there will be "no change at the top"
- Campaign messaging emphasizes stability

2. Limited time window
- Only about 40 days until resolution date
- Major shake-ups less likely close to election

3. Campaign experience and effectiveness
- Both managers have strong track records
- Currently managing primary victory and convention

The Polymarket prediction of 47% seems reasonable given the evidence, but considering the shorter time window until October 1st, I would adjust slightly lower.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.
