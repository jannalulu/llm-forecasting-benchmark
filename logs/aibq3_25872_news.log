**Spain and France Face Off in Euro 2024 Semi-Finals**
Spain and France will face off in the semi-finals of the European Championship (Euro 2024) tomorrow in Munich, with both teams having a strong presence in European and international football. Spain is aiming to break the record for the most European Championship titles, currently shared with Germany, while France is seeking to catch up with the top two after winning in 1984 and 2000. Spain has shone in the tournament, particularly with the impressive play of young wingers Lamin Yamal and Nico Williams. France, on the other hand, has struggled with its attack, which has been hindered by the injury to its captain and top scorer Kylian Mbappé. Despite this, France has managed to score only three goals in five matches, two of which were own goals against Austria and Belgium, and one penalty kick by Mbappé against Poland. However, France has shown resilience, conceding only one goal in its last four matches, including a 1-0 win over Belgium in the quarterfinals and a penalty shootout victory over Portugal in the round of 16. Spain, on the other hand, has the strongest attack in the tournament, with 11 goals scored and 102 shots on target, and has eliminated Germany, the host team, in a thrilling 2-1 match that went into extra time and ended with a penalty kick by midfielder Pedri Lalatoa. Spain is relying on the talent of Moroccan-born winger Lamin Yamal, who will become the youngest player to score in the tournament's history if he scores, and Nico Williams, who scored a goal and provided an assist. France, meanwhile, is hoping to regain its scoring form from the 2022 World Cup, when it scored 16 goals, including 8 by Mbappé, who is the tournament's top scorer.

France has reached the semi-finals of Euro 2024, where they will face Spain on Tuesday. The team's success is attributed to the performances of Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann, who have been criticized in the media for their recent form. Youssouf Fofana and Randal Kolo Muani, teammates of Mbappé and Griezmann, have responded to the criticism, saying that the team's current level is sufficient to reach the semi-finals, and that they do not need to improve further to win the championship. Fofana stated, 'Their level today is enough to be a semi-finalist. Is it enough to be European champions? We'll know in a few days, but today I have the impression that they don't need to do more, even if we expect more from them.' Kolo Muani added, 'I wouldn't say it's a bad period, it's linked to the whole group. He had an enormous season, he scored nearly 45 goals, so seeing him not score or not bring what he should... It's up to us to help him, push him upwards. The competition is not over, we may have two more matches. He's ready, except for his broken nose, it's okay.'
