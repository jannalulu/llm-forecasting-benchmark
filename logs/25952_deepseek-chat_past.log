To forecast whether the Prime Minister of France will belong to the New Popular Front (NFP) coalition on July 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of the situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
While there are no specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus for this exact question, the general sentiment from news articles suggests that the NFP is the leading coalition but lacks an absolute majority. This creates uncertainty about governance and the selection of the Prime Minister.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Political Landscape**: The NFP won the most seats (182) but is far from the 289 needed for a majority. Macron's coalition has 168 seats, and the National Rally has 143. This fragmented parliament complicates governance.
2. **Prime Minister Selection Process**: The President (Macron) has the final say in appointing the Prime Minister, but the NFP is pushing for their candidate. The NFP is internally divided on who should be the candidate, with figures like Olivier Faure and Jean-Luc Mélenchon being mentioned.
3. **Negotiation Dynamics**: The NFP will need to negotiate with Macron's coalition or other parties to pass legislation, which could influence the choice of Prime Minister.
4. **Timeline**: The new National Assembly convenes on July 18, and the Prime Minister must be appointed by July 30. This leaves a tight window for negotiations.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, in fragmented parliaments, coalition governments or technocratic administrations are common. The NFP's lack of a majority makes it less likely they will unilaterally appoint a Prime Minister.
- **Inside View**: The NFP's strong showing and Macron's weakened position increase the likelihood of an NFP Prime Minister, but internal divisions and the need for coalition-building complicate this.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for NFP Prime Minister**: The NFP is the largest bloc, and Macron may be pressured to appoint an NFP Prime Minister to avoid political instability.
- **Strong Evidence Against**: The NFP's internal divisions and lack of a majority make it difficult to push through their candidate without concessions to Macron's coalition or other parties.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Pro-NFP Forces**: Public sentiment against the far-right, the NFP's electoral success, and Macron's weakened position.
- **Anti-NFP Forces**: Internal NFP divisions, the need for coalition-building, and Macron's constitutional power to appoint the Prime Minister.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
The current trend suggests a move towards coalition governance, with the NFP playing a significant role but not dominating. Macron's coalition remains a key player, and negotiations will likely result in a compromise candidate.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
There is significant uncertainty due to the fragmented parliament, internal NFP divisions, and the tight timeline for negotiations. However, the NFP's position as the largest bloc gives them a strong negotiating position.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
While the NFP has a strong position, overconfidence in their ability to appoint a Prime Minister without significant concessions is unwarranted. The likelihood of a compromise candidate is high.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
Potential errors include overestimating the NFP's unity and underestimating Macron's ability to leverage his constitutional powers. Historical patterns suggest that fragmented parliaments often lead to coalition governments rather than unilateral appointments.

### Final Forecast
Considering the above analysis, the most likely outcome is a compromise candidate, possibly from the NFP but with significant concessions to Macron's coalition. The probability of the Prime Minister belonging to the NFP on July 30, 2024, is balanced by these factors.

**My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.**
