Superforecasters gather around a table, papers and screens displaying data. The room buzzes with anticipation.

LEAD FORECASTER  
(leaning forward)  
September's over, and the NHC reports zero major hurricanes.

ANALYST  
(relieved)  
Our models had it at 5.23%. The conditions just weren't right.

LEAD FORECASTER  
(nodding)  
The Saharan dust layer was stronger than anticipated, suppressing storm development.

ANALYST  
Plus, the cooler sea surface temperatures played a crucial role.

LEAD FORECASTER  
(looking at the team)  
We prepared for the worst, but it’s a relief. Our models continue to prove their accuracy.

ANALYST  
(smiling)  
Communities can breathe easier this time.

The team reflects on their success, aware of the unpredictable nature of the future.

FADE OUT.

A group of superforecasters gathers around a digital board displaying the latest hurricane data.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, relieved)  
Well, it's confirmed. Not a single major hurricane in September. Our models had it at 5.25%.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The calm after the stormy August. Climate change discussions had us all on edge, but the models held true.

FORECASTER 3  
(scrolling through past news)  
Up to September 12, everything pointed to a quiet month. NOAA's predictions aligned with our findings.

FORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Remember when they doubted our Brier scores? This should silence the critics.

FORECASTER 2  
(serious)  
Let's not get complacent. October's still ahead, and the oceans are warming.

FORECASTER 3  
(turning off the board)  
Agreed. Back to the models. The season's not over yet.

They disperse, focused and ready for the challenges ahead.

SUPERFORECASTER A

Well, the month has ended, and our models had it at 75.32%. Two major hurricanes in September.

SUPERFORECASTER B, a younger analyst, nods, reflecting on the implications.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
It's remarkable. Our models never miss. The early September reports hinted at a high probability, but to see it confirmed...

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(nods)  
Climate change is reshaping our expectations. Above-normal activity is becoming the norm.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
Communities need to stay prepared. The stakes are higher each year.

So, it's official. No major hurricanes in September. Our models had it at 15.32%.

Remarkable, given the predictions for an above-normal season. Climate change factors had everyone on edge.
