To forecast whether the CDC will confirm a case of Clade I mpox in a US resident before August 23, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique features of this situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- There are no publicly available predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus specifically addressing this question. This means I must rely on historical data, current news, and expert analysis.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of Clade I Mpox in the US**: Historically, Clade I mpox has been rare in the US, with most cases linked to travel from endemic regions in Africa.
2. **Current Outbreak Severity in Africa**: The outbreak in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is severe, with a new, more transmissible strain (Clade Ib) causing significant concern.
3. **Travel and Importation Risk**: The likelihood of Clade I mpox being imported into the US depends on travel patterns, surveillance, and containment measures.
4. **CDC Surveillance and Confirmation**: The CDCâ€™s ability to detect and confirm cases depends on testing capacity, public health infrastructure, and reporting mechanisms.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, the US has had very few cases of Clade I mpox, and most were linked to travel. The base rate suggests a low probability of a confirmed case.
- **Inside View**: The current outbreak in Africa is more severe, with a new strain (Clade Ib) that is more transmissible and deadly. This increases the risk of importation.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The outbreak in Africa is concerning, but the US has robust public health systems and limited direct travel from affected regions. This suggests that while the risk is elevated, it is still relatively low.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Increasing Risk**: 
  - High transmission rates of Clade Ib in Africa.
  - Increased global travel and interconnectedness.
  - Potential for undetected cases due to mild symptoms.
- **Forces Decreasing Risk**:
  - Limited direct flights from DRC to the US.
  - Strong US public health surveillance and response systems.
  - Availability of vaccines and treatments.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The outbreak in Africa is growing, with cases increasing by 160% in 2024 compared to 2023. However, the US has not yet reported any cases of Clade I mpox in 2024, suggesting that the risk of importation remains low.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is uncertainty about the transmissibility of Clade Ib and the effectiveness of current containment measures. However, the US has historically been effective at preventing the spread of similar diseases.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the outbreak in Africa is concerning, the US has strong public health systems and limited direct travel from affected regions. This suggests a low but non-negligible risk.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Past outbreaks (e.g., COVID-19) have shown that initial assessments can underestimate the risk. However, the US has also demonstrated the ability to contain outbreaks when they occur.

### Final Assessment
- The base rate of Clade I mpox in the US is very low, and while the current outbreak in Africa is severe, the risk of importation remains limited due to travel patterns and strong public health systems. However, the new strain (Clade Ib) is more transmissible, which slightly increases the risk.

### Prediction
My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

2025-01-04 14:48:52,423 - INFO - Run 1:
To forecast whether the CDC will confirm a case of Clade I mpox in a U.S. resident before August 23, 2024, I will break the problem into sub-problems, weigh historical patterns, and adjust for current evidence.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis (Outside View)
- **Historical Context**: Clade I mpox has historically been confined to Central and West Africa, with limited global spread compared to Clade II. The 2022 global outbreak was driven by Clade II, which spread to over 100 countries, including the U.S., but Clade I remained largely localized.
- **U.S. Importation Risk**: The CDC has stated that the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the U.S. is "very low" due to limited travel and lack of direct flights from affected regions (e.g., Democratic Republic of Congo). This suggests a low base rate for Clade I cases in the U.S.

### Step 2: Current Evidence (Inside View)
- **Outbreak Severity**: The current Clade I outbreak in Africa is severe, with over 15,000 cases and 461 deaths reported in 2024, a 160% increase from 2023. The strain (Clade Ib) is more transmissible and deadly, particularly affecting children.
- **Global Spread**: The outbreak has spread to neighboring African countries (e.g., Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda), but there is no evidence of spread outside Africa as of August 14, 2024.
- **CDC Alerts**: The CDC has issued health alerts to U.S. clinicians to watch for Clade I mpox in travelers from affected regions, but no cases have been confirmed in the U.S. as of today.
- **Vaccine Availability**: The Jynneos vaccine is effective against both Clade I and II, but vaccine availability in Africa is limited, increasing the risk of further spread.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Low Base Rate vs. High Severity**: While the base rate of Clade I importation to the U.S. is low, the severity and transmissibility of the current outbreak increase the risk. However, the CDC's proactive measures (e.g., health alerts, surveillance) mitigate this risk.
- **Timeframe**: The question has a short timeframe (9 days from today), which limits the opportunity for a case to emerge, be detected, and confirmed by the CDC.

### Step 4: Error Balancing
- **Risk of Over-Adjusting**: The current outbreak is concerning, but overreacting to the severity in Africa without evidence of spread to the U.S. would be premature.
- **Risk of Under-Adjusting**: Ignoring the increased transmissibility and global attention on the outbreak could lead to underestimating the risk.

### Step 5: Final Adjustment
Given the low base rate, the short timeframe, and the lack of evidence of Clade I mpox in the U.S., I assign a low probability to the event. However, the severity of the outbreak and the CDC's heightened vigilance slightly increase the likelihood.

### Final Forecast
My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether the CDC will confirm a case of Clade I mpox in a U.S. resident before August 23, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, balance historical patterns with current evidence, and carefully weigh the risks of over- and under-adjusting to new information.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
- **Historical Context**: Clade I mpox has historically been confined to Central and West Africa, with limited global spread. The 2022 global outbreak was driven by Clade II, which is less severe and more transmissible among specific populations (e.g., men who have sex with men). Clade I has a higher case fatality rate (3-4%) and is more severe but less transmissible outside endemic regions.
- **Base Rate of Importation**: Historically, the U.S. has seen very few cases of Clade I mpox. The 2022 outbreak involved Clade II, and even then, cases were relatively contained. The risk of Clade I importation is considered low due to limited travel and lack of direct flights from affected regions (e.g., DRC).

### Step 2: Current Situation and Trends
- **Outbreak Severity**: The current outbreak in Africa, particularly in the DRC, involves a new, more transmissible subclade (Clade Ib) with a high case fatality rate (up to 10%). Over 15,000 cases and 461 deaths have been reported in Africa in 2024, a 160% increase from 2023.
- **Global Spread**: The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the spread of Clade Ib to neighboring countries (e.g., Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda). However, the CDC and WHO have stated that the risk of Clade I mpox spreading to the U.S. is "very low" due to limited travel and no direct flights from affected regions.
- **U.S. Preparedness**: The U.S. has robust surveillance systems, vaccines (Jynneos), and antiviral treatments. The CDC has issued health alerts to clinicians to watch for symptoms in travelers from affected regions, but no confirmed cases of Clade I have been reported in the U.S. as of August 14, 2024.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Arguments for a Higher Estimate**: 
  - The outbreak in Africa is severe and expanding, with a new, more transmissible strain (Clade Ib).
  - The WHO has declared a PHEIC, indicating global concern.
  - Increased global travel and potential for undetected cases could lead to importation.
- **Arguments for a Lower Estimate**:
  - The CDC and WHO have assessed the risk of Clade I importation to the U.S. as "very low."
  - No confirmed cases of Clade I have been reported in the U.S. despite heightened surveillance.
  - The U.S. has effective containment measures, including vaccines and antivirals.

### Step 4: Error Balancing
- **Risk of Over-Adjusting**: Overreacting to the severity of the African outbreak could lead to an inflated probability estimate, ignoring the low historical base rate of Clade I importation.
- **Risk of Under-Adjusting**: Underestimating the potential for global spread, especially with a more transmissible strain, could lead to missing a low-probability but high-impact event.

### Step 5: Final Probability Estimate
Given the low base rate of Clade I importation, the CDC's assessment of "very low" risk, and the lack of confirmed cases in the U.S. despite heightened surveillance, the probability of a confirmed case before August 23, 2024, is low. However, the severity of the African outbreak and the WHO's PHEIC declaration suggest a non-negligible risk.

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.**

2. **Current Outbreak Severity in Africa:** The outbreak in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is severe, with over 15,000 cases and 461 deaths reported in 2024. The strain (Clade Ib) is more transmissible and deadly.
3. **Travel and Importation Risk:** The risk of importation to the U.S. is considered low due to limited direct flights from affected regions, but not zero.
4. **CDC Surveillance and Response:** The CDC has issued health alerts and is monitoring the situation closely, indicating heightened awareness and preparedness.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, Clade I mpox has not spread significantly outside endemic regions. The U.S. has robust surveillance and containment measures.
- **Inside View (Current Context):** The current outbreak is more severe, with a higher case fatality rate and increased transmissibility. The CDC is actively monitoring, but the risk of importation remains low.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting Risk:** Ignoring the severity of the African outbreak and the potential for global spread.
- **Overreacting Risk:** Overestimating the likelihood of importation given the low travel volume and robust U.S. health infrastructure.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Increasing Risk:** High transmissibility and severity of Clade Ib, ongoing outbreak in Africa, global interconnectedness.
- **Forces Decreasing Risk:** Limited direct travel from affected regions, strong U.S. public health infrastructure, CDC vigilance.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The outbreak in Africa is worsening, but the U.S. has not yet reported any cases of Clade I mpox. The trend suggests a low but non-zero risk of importation.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- The probability is low but not negligible. The CDC's active monitoring and low travel volume reduce the risk, but the severity of the outbreak in Africa introduces some uncertainty.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the potential for unexpected importation events.
- Avoid underconfidence by recognizing the effectiveness of U.S. public health measures.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that while outbreaks can spread, the U.S. has been effective in containing such threats. However, the current outbreak's severity warrants cautious monitoring.

### Final Assessment
- **Base Rate Adjustment:** Given the historical rarity of Clade I mpox in the U.S., the base rate probability is low.
- **Current Evidence Adjustment:** The severity of the African outbreak and CDC's heightened alertness slightly increase the risk.
- **Balanced Probability:** The likelihood of a confirmed case by August 23, 2024, is low but not zero.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether the CDC will confirm a case of Clade I mpox in a U.S. resident before August 23, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I am not aware of any specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this exact question. However, the general consensus from public health experts and news articles suggests that the risk of Clade I mpox spreading to the U.S. is currently low but not negligible.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of Clade I Mpox Spread to Non-Endemic Countries**: Historically, Clade I mpox has been largely confined to Central and West Africa. The 2022 global outbreak was caused by Clade II, which spread to over 100 countries, but Clade I has not yet shown significant global spread.
2. **Current Outbreak Severity and Spread**: The current outbreak in Africa, driven by Clade Ib (a subclade of Clade I), is severe, with over 15,000 cases and 461 deaths reported in 2024. However, the spread outside Africa has been limited.
3. **Travel and Importation Risk**: The CDC has stated that the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the U.S. is very low due to limited travel and lack of direct flights from affected countries.
4. **U.S. Preparedness and Surveillance**: The U.S. has robust surveillance systems and has previously managed the 2022 mpox outbreak effectively. The CDC has issued health alerts to clinicians to watch for symptoms in travelers from affected regions.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the likelihood of Clade I mpox spreading to the U.S. is low. The 2022 outbreak was an outlier, and Clade I has not shown the same propensity for global spread.
- **Inside View**: The current outbreak is more severe, with a higher case fatality rate, and the virus is mutating. However, the lack of direct flights and the CDC's proactive measures reduce the risk.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
While the current outbreak is concerning, the evidence does not suggest an imminent threat to the U.S. The CDC's assessment of "very low risk" is based on current travel patterns and surveillance data. Overreacting to the severity of the outbreak in Africa would be premature without evidence of spread to non-endemic regions.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Increasing Risk**: High case numbers in Africa, increased transmissibility of Clade Ib, and potential for mutations that enhance spread.
- **Forces Decreasing Risk**: Limited travel from affected regions, robust U.S. surveillance, and effective public health responses.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
The current trend shows a rapid increase in cases in Africa but no significant spread outside the continent. Linear extrapolation suggests that the risk to the U.S. remains low in the short term.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
There is a small but non-zero chance that a case could be imported to the U.S. given the global nature of travel and the severity of the outbreak. However, the probability is low.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
While it is possible that a case could be imported, the evidence does not support a high probability. Confidence in the low risk is justified by the CDC's assessment and historical patterns.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
Potential errors include underestimating the virus's ability to mutate and spread or overestimating the effectiveness of current travel restrictions. However, these risks are mitigated by the CDC's proactive measures.

### Final Forecast
Considering the low base rate of Clade I mpox spread to non-endemic countries, the current outbreak's limited geographic spread, and the CDC's assessment of "very low risk," the probability of the CDC confirming a case of Clade I mpox in a U.S. resident before August 23, 2024, is low.
