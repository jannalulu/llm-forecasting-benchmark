To forecast whether Benjamin Netanyahu will remain Prime Minister of Israel through September 30, 2024, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current position: Netanyahu is currently Prime Minister as of the latest news in July 2024.

2. Electoral timeline: The next scheduled elections are in 2026, well after the September 2024 date in question. However, there are calls for early elections.

3. Political pressure:
- Benny Gantz gave Netanyahu an ultimatum in May 2024 to produce a plan for ending the war by June 8, 2024, or he would leave the government. The outcome of this is unclear from the provided information.
- There are calls for early elections in September 2024 from Netanyahu's Likud party.
- Opposition leader Yair Lapid has urged Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire.

4. War status: The war with Hamas is ongoing as of the latest news. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated he will not end the war until all goals are achieved, including the elimination of Hamas.

5. International pressure: 
- The US is pushing for a ceasefire deal.
- The International Criminal Court has requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu on war crimes charges.

6. Domestic support:
- A poll from May 31, 2024 showed 36% of Israelis consider Netanyahu better suited to be prime minister, compared to 30% for Gantz.
- However, there are ongoing protests demanding early elections and the return of hostages.

7. Corruption trial: Netanyahu's testimony in his corruption trial is scheduled for December 2, 2024, after the date in question.

8. Netanyahu's history: He has a track record of political survival and has overcome challenges to his leadership before.

Weighing these factors:

Arguments for Netanyahu remaining PM:
- No scheduled elections before September 30, 2024
- Slightly higher polling numbers than his main rival
- His stated commitment to continue the war
- His historical ability to maintain power

Arguments against Netanyahu remaining PM:
- Growing calls for early elections
- Pressure from coalition partners like Gantz
- International pressure over the war
- Ongoing protests

Balancing these factors, it seems more likely than not that Netanyahu will remain Prime Minister through September 30, 2024. The lack of scheduled elections and his slightly stronger polling position are particularly important. However, there is significant uncertainty due to the volatile political situation and ongoing war.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by considering relevant historical patterns and base rates, then adjust based on the specific current situation and recent developments.

Base rate considerations:
- Netanyahu has been Prime Minister for over 15 years total, demonstrating significant political staying power.
- Israeli Prime Ministers have an average tenure of about 3-4 years, but there's high variability.
- Netanyahu has survived multiple challenges to his leadership in the past.

Current situation analysis:
1. Ongoing war in Gaza: The conflict that began in October 2023 is still ongoing as of July 2024. Wars can sometimes bolster a leader's position, but prolonged conflicts can also erode support.

2. Political pressure:
- Benny Gantz left Netanyahu's war cabinet in June 2024, signaling internal discord.
- There are calls for early elections, with Netanyahu's Likud party supporting elections in September 2024.
- Opposition leader Yair Lapid has urged Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire.

3. International pressure:
- Tensions with the US over arms deliveries and Gaza strategy.
- Potential ICC arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other officials (though delayed as of June 2024).

4. Corruption trial:
- Netanyahu is set to testify in his corruption trial starting December 2, 2024. While this is after the forecast period, it could influence political maneuvering beforehand.

5. Public opinion:
- A poll from July 2024 shows 36% of Israelis consider Netanyahu better suited to be prime minister, compared to 30% for Gantz. This suggests he retains significant support despite challenges.

6. Netanyahu's statements:
- He has consistently stated he will continue the war until all objectives are achieved, potentially tying his political fate to the conflict's outcome.

Balancing these factors:
- The ongoing war provides both a rallying point for Netanyahu and a source of criticism.
- Political pressure is significant, but Netanyahu has weathered similar challenges before.
- International pressure, especially from the US, could be a major factor, but its impact is unclear.
- The corruption trial is a long-term threat but may not directly impact his position before September 30.
- Public opinion seems mixed but not overwhelmingly against Netanyahu.

Considering these factors, I believe Netanyahu has a good chance of remaining Prime Minister through September 30, 2024, but there's significant uncertainty. The main risks to his position are potential early elections or a major shift in the war situation.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, with 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.

To forecast whether Benjamin Netanyahu will remain Prime Minister of Israel through September 30, 2024, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Current position: Netanyahu is currently Prime Minister as of the latest news articles in June/July 2024.

2. Political challenges:
- Opposition leader Benny Gantz left Netanyahu's government in June 2024, weakening the coalition.
- There are calls for early elections, with Netanyahu's Likud party suggesting September 2024 elections.
- Polls show Gantz gaining ground, though Netanyahu still leads as preferred PM.

3. Legal issues:
- Netanyahu is facing a corruption trial, with testimony scheduled for December 2, 2024.
- The International Criminal Court is considering issuing arrest warrants against Netanyahu.

4. Policy and war:
- Netanyahu remains committed to continuing the war in Gaza until "complete victory" over Hamas.
- There's pressure from the US and others to end the conflict, which could impact Netanyahu's position.

5. Historical precedent:
- Netanyahu has shown remarkable political survival skills throughout his career.
- He's the longest-serving Israeli PM, demonstrating ability to maintain power.

6. Timing:
- The forecast date (September 30, 2024) is before Netanyahu's scheduled court testimony.
- It's after the potential September elections called for by Likud.

Weighing these factors:

- Netanyahu's political skills and current leadership during wartime provide stability.
- However, coalition instability, legal troubles, and calls for elections create significant uncertainty.
- The potential September elections are a critical inflection point - if they occur, they could unseat Netanyahu before September 30.

Given the conflicting forces at play, I'll provide a relatively wide range to reflect the uncertainty:

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast whether Benjamin Netanyahu will remain Prime Minister of Israel through September 30, 2024, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current political situation: Netanyahu is currently Prime Minister, giving him an incumbency advantage. However, his position appears precarious based on recent news.

2. Coalition instability: Several articles mention coalition partners leaving or threatening to leave Netanyahu's government, particularly Benny Gantz giving an ultimatum in June 2024. This significantly increases the risk of government collapse.

3. Calls for early elections: Multiple sources mention growing demands for early elections, with September 2024 specifically mentioned as a potential election date. This aligns closely with the forecast date.

4. Netanyahu's resilience: Historical evidence shows Netanyahu has survived many political crises before. He's described as skilled at tactical maneuvering and "balancing on the edge of the abyss."

5. War in Gaza: The ongoing conflict provides both challenges and opportunities for Netanyahu. It could rally support around him as a wartime leader, but also increases pressure if the war is seen as mismanaged.

6. Legal troubles: Netanyahu's corruption trial is ongoing, with testimony scheduled for December 2024. This adds pressure but doesn't directly impact his position before September 30.

7. International pressure: Growing international criticism, including potential ICC arrest warrants, adds to the challenges Netanyahu faces.

8. Public opinion: Recent polls show mixed results, with some indicating Netanyahu gaining ground and others showing strong opposition.

Balancing these factors:

- The threat of early elections and coalition instability are the most immediate risks to Netanyahu's position.
- Netanyahu's proven ability to survive political crises provides a counterbalance.
- The ongoing war creates uncertainty that could work in either direction.

Given the conflicting evidence and the relatively short timeframe (about 2.5 months from now until September 30), I estimate there's a significant chance Netanyahu will not remain Prime Minister, but also a substantial possibility he navigates the challenges.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 51.00% being the most likely. Probability: 51.00%.

Given the complexity and volatility of the situation, I'll provide a relatively wide range to account for the uncertainty:

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll start by considering relevant base rates and then adjust based on the specific situation and recent developments:

Base rates:
- Netanyahu has been Prime Minister for over 15 years total, showing a strong ability to maintain power.
- Israeli Prime Ministers have an average tenure of about 3-4 years.
- Netanyahu's current term began in December 2022, so he would have been in office for less than 2 years by September 2024.

Key factors supporting Netanyahu remaining PM:
1. Historical resilience: Netanyahu has survived many political challenges in the past.
2. Wartime leadership: The ongoing conflict with Hamas may discourage leadership changes.
3. Recent polls: A May 31, 2024 poll showed 36% of Israelis consider Netanyahu better suited to be PM compared to 30% for his main rival Gantz.
4. Tactical maneuvering: Reports suggest Netanyahu is working to delay elections until after the US elections in November 2024.
5. Commitment to war goals: Netanyahu has repeatedly stated he won't end the war until all objectives are achieved, which could extend beyond September 2024.

Factors against Netanyahu remaining PM:
1. Domestic pressure: Benny Gantz threatened to leave the government by June 8, 2024 if a new war strategy wasn't implemented. The outcome of this ultimatum is unclear from the provided information.
2. Corruption trial: Netanyahu's testimony is scheduled for December 2, 2024. This legal pressure could impact his position.
3. International criticism: Growing international pressure over the Gaza war, including potential ICC arrest warrants, could weaken Netanyahu's position.
4. Opposition calls for elections: There are increasing demands for early elections, with some reports suggesting they could be held in September 2024.
5. Coalition instability: The dissolution of the war cabinet and departure of key allies like Gantz could destabilize Netanyahu's government.

Balancing these factors, I believe Netanyahu is more likely than not to remain PM through September 30, 2024, but there is significant uncertainty. The ongoing war provides a strong rationale for maintaining continuity in leadership, and Netanyahu has shown remarkable political survival skills. However, the mounting domestic and international pressures create real risks to his position.
