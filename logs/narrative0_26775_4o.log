*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the 2024 Grand Chess Tour has concluded. Did anyone outside the big four win?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 12.45%. Given the standings and the dominance of Caruana, Firouzja, Praggnanandhaa, and Gukesh, it was unlikely anyone else could break through.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. With Caruana leading at 22.25 points by August 1st, it was a tall order for any outsider. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Even with the rapid and classical tournaments left, the gap was significant.

**NATE SILVER:** Our models have been spot-on, as always. The chess world is as competitive as ever, but the top players are just on another level.

*They nod in agreement, the predictability of the chess world reaffirmed.*
