**US Congressional Elections: The Fateful 13th District**
The Democrats need to win only four seats to regain control of the House of Representatives from the Republicans. The 13th Congressional District in California is a key battleground, where Republican John Duarte and Democrat Adam Gray are vying for the seat. Duarte, a farmer, won the seat in 2022 by a narrow margin of 564 votes, despite being in a district that should be a Democratic stronghold, with two-thirds of the population being Latino. Gray, also a farmer, is now a construction company employee. The district is located in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its vineyards and almond trees, southeast of San Francisco. As Gray said, 'It's a district that should be a Democratic stronghold, but it's not.'

**John Duarte, Adam Gray face off in a congressional rematch**
The 2022 midterm election was a close race between Adam Gray, a Democrat, and John Duarte, a Republican, for California's 13th Congressional District. The rematch is now underway, with Gray and Duarte facing off again. Gray, a radical centrist, emphasizes the importance of working together and putting community first. His top priorities include expanding access to healthcare, water, agriculture, and education. Duarte, who has run his own nursery business, says his experience has helped him understand issues impacting the valley. He emphasizes the need to address inflation and water infrastructure projects, and opposes the current border bill due to a specific clause. Gray blames Republicans for stepping away from a bipartisan deal on the border and immigration. The outcome of this election could determine the balance of power in the United States House of Representatives.

**John Duarte vs. Adam Gray for Congress: Why experts are watching this California election**
The 2024 rematch election between freshman Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, and former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, in California's 13th Congressional District is expected to be a tossup. Gray lost to Duarte by 564 votes in 2022, and analysts say Duarte will have a tougher time in November due to being a first-term congressman. Gray has fundraised well against Duarte recently, but the Republican retains an edge in overall funds. The district is a Latino-majority voting-age district with a large population of young people, and legislative issues concern affordability, water access, health, immigration, and public safety. Gray emphasized the need for Congress to invest in water infrastructure and renewable energy, while Duarte emphasized the importance of drilling American oil and natural gas. 'Congress can make investments in water infrastructure,' Gray said. 'Congress can make investments in renewable energy and new opportunities to take advantage of the biocircular economy here in the Valley.' Duarte said, 'We've got to drill American oil. We've got to continue to develop natural gas and welcome it as a key energy resource for the future.'

**How California's Portuguese community may tip the balance of power in Congress**
The Portuguese community in California's Central Valley may hold the key to determining which party controls Congress in November's election. With two Portuguese Republicans, Reps. John Duarte and David Valadao, representing swing districts, their politics could prove crucial. The community has a long history of assimilating into American society while maintaining their cultural heritage. However, immigration remains a top issue, especially for Republicans. Duarte, who is running for reelection, focuses on local issues and has broken with his party on immigration, voting against the Secure the Border Act. Valadao, on the other hand, has courted the Portuguese community by promoting Portuguese Heritage Month in the state Legislature. The outcome of the election will depend on how the Portuguese community votes, with some leaning towards Democrats and others towards Republicans.

**Stanislaus County water rights, law enforcement, and job creation among local priorities for Duarte and Gray**
Republican Rep. John Duarte and Democrat Adam Gray are running for California's 13th congressional district. Duarte plans to help Modestans and the surrounding area by protecting low energy costs, making Modesto competitive in the world marketplace, and working with High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) to combat drug trafficking. He also secured $3.5 million for a dispatch center in Modesto. Gray plans to bring more money into the Volt Institute, a job training facility, and expand it to create new jobs. He also wants to see more food production and agriculture's byproducts used for biomass and energy production. Additionally, Gray accomplished some of the best floodplain restoration in the state, including the establishment of the Dos Rios state park.

**7 House seats Democrats think they can flip**
Democrats are confident they can flip control of the House by targeting seven Republican-held seats. The seats are New York-22, Nebraska-2, New York-4, Oregon-5, California-13, Arizona-1, and California-27. Democrats have an advantage in fundraising and outside spending in these districts, with many of the Republican incumbents facing challenges due to their conservative policies and personal scandals. The article highlights the vulnerability of Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.) in New York-22, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in Nebraska-2, Rep. Anthony D'Esposito (R-N.Y.) in New York-4, Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Calif.) in Oregon-5, Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) in California-13, Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) in Arizona-1, and Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) in California-27. Democrats believe that the abortion issue will be a major factor in these districts, particularly in Oregon-5 and California-13. The article also notes that the Democratic Party has focused on these districts, with Vice President Harris campaigning in some of them. Outside spending has poured in to support Democratic candidates, with totals ranging from $6.6 million to $11.4 million in each district.

**Democrats fight for House control: 7 Republicans they’re looking to oust**
Democrats are fighting to regain control of the House of Representatives, with a focus on seven Republican-held seats that they believe are vulnerable. The seats are in New York, Nebraska, New York, Oregon, California, Arizona, and California. Democrats are optimistic about their chances in these districts, citing factors such as the shift in demographics, the performance of their candidates, and the impact of the presidential election. They also point to the fundraising advantage they have in several of these districts. The seven seats are: New York-22, where Rep. Brandon Williams is facing a challenge from John Mannion; Nebraska-2, where Rep. Don Bacon is being targeted by Tony Vargas; New York-4, where Rep. Anthony D'Esposito is facing a rematch against Laura Gillen; Oregon-5, where Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer is being challenged by Janelle Bynum; California-13, where Rep. John Duarte is facing a challenge from Adam Gray; Arizona-1, where Rep. David Schweikert is being targeted by Amish Shah; and California-27, where Rep. Mike Garcia is facing a challenge from George Whitesides. Democrats believe that these seats are within their reach and that they can flip them to gain control of the House.

**9 Key Contests to Watch for in the 2024 US Congressional Elections**
The 2024 US elections are approaching, and the control of both chambers of Congress is at stake. The presidential election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is dominating the conversation, but the outcome of the congressional elections could bring surprises on November 5. Nine key contests to watch for in the Senate and House of Representatives are highlighted. In Texas, the Democratic representative Colin Allred is giving a tough competition to Republican Senator Ted Cruz, presenting him as an extremist who does not do anything. Cruz has been presenting Allred as too liberal for Texas, highlighting issues such as transgender rights and energy production. In Nebraska, independent candidate Dan Osborn is causing a sensation with his populist campaign, raising more money than Republican Senator Deb Fischer and launching ads promising to change the status quo. Osborn has criticized Fischer as a career politician who is not fulfilling her promises to Nebraska and is only in Congress to enrich herself. In Maryland, Republican Larry Hogan is trying to become the first Republican to win a Senate seat since 1980. Hogan has a lot against him in a state that Joe Biden won by 33 points, where a focus on federal issues and growing partisan polarization make it difficult for him. In Florida, some Democrats are holding onto the hope of defeating Republican Senator Rick Scott, who has demonstrated an astonishing ability to win state-level victories by the narrowest margin in Florida, even during the red waves of 2010 and 2014 and the blue wave of 2018. In Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district, Republican Representative Scott Perry is facing a challenge from Democrat Janelle Stelson, a former TV news presenter who is known in the area. Stelson has been quietly approaching Perry, raising large sums of money and presenting the former president of the right-wing Freedom Caucus as someone who is out of touch with the district. In Virginia, Representative Jen Kiggans, a Republican in her first term, is facing a challenge from Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal after a redrawn and more Republican-friendly district helped her defeat a Democratic incumbent by 3 points in 2022. In California's 47th congressional district, Republican Scott Baugh, a former state legislator and Orange County Republican Party chairman, is running against Democrat Dave Min, a state senator who was initially in the news for being cited for a minor DUI offense. California is emerging as a bright spot for Democratic House candidates in this cycle, and if the Republican Party wants to reduce its losses, this district in the Newport Beach area, a former Republican stronghold that turned blue in the Trump era, may be its best opportunity to change the affiliation of a district.

**Duarte and Gray Debate in California's 13th Congressional District**
In a debate held on October 25, 2024, in Modesto, California, Republican candidate John Duarte and Democratic candidate Adam Gray discussed their views on various issues, including energy policy, taxes, immigration, and more. Gray emphasized the need for a more productive Congress that manages the budget effectively, while Duarte focused on fiscal prudence and questioned some of the climate-related policies. Duarte also criticized the state's high-speed rail project as the 'biggest waste of money in the country' and suggested that the funds be used for other projects. Both candidates agreed that ensuring water for the Central Valley's agricultural region is a top priority. Gray stated that the government needs to intervene to address the region's infrastructure needs, while Duarte emphasized the need for bipartisanship and working with both parties. On abortion, both candidates expressed their support for it, with Duarte stating, 'I'm in favor of abortion. I'm going to keep being in favor of abortion.' Gray emphasized the need for federal action to codify the Roe v. Wade case. The two candidates also agreed that the cost of housing is a problem and that more construction is needed to create inventory and improve affordability. Duarte stated that the high cost of living in the valley is due to factors such as Sacramento's regulations, which are exacerbating the water shortage, increasing construction costs, and limiting urbanization.

**California Congressional Candidates Debate in Race for Pivotal House Seat**
In a debate for California's 13th Congressional District, Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) and Democrat candidate Adam Gray discussed various issues, including energy policies, regulations, taxes, immigration, and more. Gray targeted what he said is an unproductive Congress that mismanaged the budget, calling for 'tough decisions about revenue and spending and a reversal of tax cuts enacted under former President Donald Trump.' Duarte said fiscal prudence is a foundation of his legislative decision making and challenged some of the climate-related agenda. On how best to lower gas prices, the candidates differed in their plans, with Duarte blaming the state's gas taxes and strict regulations, and Gray calling for more federal action. Both men said securing water for the agricultural region in the state's Central Valley is a top priority. They also agreed on supporting abortion rights and addressing housing costs. Duarte bested Gray by nearly 10 percent in the primary, but analysts are anticipating a close race in the general election.

The congressional races in CA-22 and CA-13 are extremely close, with both seats considered toss-ups by several ratings prognosticators. According to Erin Covey, house editor with the Cook Political Report, 'These are two of the most competitive races in the country and they are going to be a central part of either party's path to the majority.' The incumbents, David Valadao and John Duarte, face challenges from Rudy Salas and Adam Gray, respectively. The campaigns are focusing on messaging, with Valadao's team emphasizing his bipartisan record and Salas' team highlighting his ability to connect with voters. Gray's campaign is also focusing on traditional means of messaging, while Duarte's campaign is working to engage with voters directly. Analysts expect higher turnout in this presidential election year, which could benefit Democrats. However, a 'shift to the right' among Hispanic voters could aid Republicans. 'If Kamala Harris struggles with turnout this time around, that's the type of thing that could meaningfully hurt these challengers for the Democrats in that seat,' said Lakshya Jain, CEO of election analyzer Split Ticket.

**California Voters Could Decide Whether Republicans Keep The House**
California voters will decide the fate of several congressional seats in the upcoming election. Republicans are looking to hold onto their seats, while Democrats are vying to take control. Key races include the 13th District, where Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) is facing off against Democrat Adam Gray, and the 27th District, where Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) is running against Democrat George Whitesides. Other notable races include the 40th District, where Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.) is facing Democrat Joe Kerr, and the 42nd District, where Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) is running against Democrat Will Rollins. Analysts forecast a tossup in the Riverside County race between Calvert and Rollins. Democrats are also looking to hold onto a seat representing coastal northern San Diego County, where Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) is facing a challenge from Republican Matt Gunderson. Additionally, Californians will decide who replaces the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein to fill the two-month remainder of her term in a special election held the same day as the vote to fill the next six-year term. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Republican Steve Garvey are vying for the position. 'It's time for a new leadership that brings Democrats, Republicans, and Independents together to end the chaos in Washington and deliver real results for Riverside County families,' Rollins said on his website. 'I'm running for Congress because politicians have created more problems than they've solved,' Whitesides said in a campaign video. 'I'll use my business experience to solve problems, instead of playing politics.'

**DCCC Links John Duarte to Controversial Project 2025**
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has placed a billboard in California's 13th Congressional District, attempting to link Republican Representative John Duarte to the controversial 'Project 2025'. Duarte responded, 'I haven't read it and I don't support the Project 2025.' The billboard claims that the Project 2025 would 'deny healthcare to people with pre-existing conditions.' Dan Gottlieb, a DCCC spokesperson, stated, 'It's hard to separate oneself from an agenda that one votes for over and over again.' Duarte has a 41% score from the Heritage Foundation, the lowest among Republicans in the House of Representatives. The DCCC aims to hold Duarte accountable for his voting record, which they claim does not align with his moderate image. Duarte has voted in favor of a budget bill that included a provision to restrict the FDA's ability to provide abortion medications by mail, but has stated that he believes abortion laws should be left to the states. Duarte has also aligned with more extreme members of Congress on fiscal issues. When asked if he would certify the election results, Duarte replied, 'I will certify the 2024 elections.'

**Map shows House seats most likely to flip in congressional elections**
The battle for control of the House of Representatives is heating up, with Democrats and Republicans neck and neck two weeks before the November 5 election. According to the Cook Political Report, there are 27 toss-up races, with 12 held by Democrats and 15 by Republicans. FiveThirtyEight's House forecast shows the race as a dead heat, with Democrats and Republicans winning their simulation 50 times each. Democrats could take back a slight majority by sweeping the competitive races in New York and California, two solidly Democratic states where Republicans outperformed expectations in 2022. In New York, there are five competitive races, including the 22nd Congressional District, where Republican Brandon Williams is facing a challenge from Democrat state Senator John Mannion. A poll conducted by GQR showed Mannion with a 7-point lead, 50 percent to 43 percent. In California, there are five toss-up seats currently held by Republicans and two seats classified as 'Lean Democrat.' Democrat Adam Gray is challenging Representative John Duarte in a Central Valley-based seat, a rematch of the race two years ago, in California's 13th District. Independent polls are showing tight races in some districts where Republicans are favored, including Virginia's 2nd District, where Republican Representative Jen Kiggans is leading Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal by one point, and New Jersey's 7th District, where Republican Representative Tom Kean is leading Democrat Sue Altman by two points.

**California's Voters May Determine the Balance of Power in Congress**
California's voters may determine the balance of power in Congress in November, with 52 competitive House of Representatives seats up for grabs. The Republicans currently control the House with a slim majority of eight seats, thanks in part to the 2022 elections, where some California seats changed from blue to red. In the Central Valley, Orange County, and East Los Angeles, the most competitive districts are located. Among the 10 most competitive districts, the Republicans hold seven seats. In the 13th district, Representative John Duarte (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Adam Gray in a rematch of the 2022 election. Duarte won the district for the first time since 1974, with a margin of less than 600 votes. In the 22nd district, Representative David Valadao (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Rudy Salas in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its agricultural production. In the 27th district, Representative Mike García (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat George Whitesides, a former NASA administrator. In the 45th district, Representative Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Derek Tran, a veteran, entrepreneur, and consumer rights lawyer. In the 47th district, the news is still developing. The candidates are vying for the support of voters in the north of Los Angeles County, including the cities of Lancaster, Palmdale, and Santa Clarita, as well as parts of Los Angeles. Steel, a Korean immigrant, has been a strong advocate for reducing taxes and spending, while Tran has emphasized the need to protect the rights of consumers and workers. 'I am in touch with the problems of the district and have a lot of credibility with a lot of people,' Duarte said. 'The message is clear: bring water to farms, drill American oil, and control the cost of living.' 'I am running for Congress because politicians have created more problems than they have solved,' Whitesides said. 'I will use my business experience to solve problems, not play politics.' 'My parents were refugees who worked hard and sacrificed so that I could achieve the American dream,' Tran said. 'I enlisted in the Army to repay the country for what it has given me, and I am running for Congress to put people ahead of politics, protect our democracy, and ensure that everyone, regardless of where they come from, has the opportunity to succeed without fear of having their freedoms taken away.'

California voters will decide on 52 House of Representatives seats in November, with many competitive districts in the Central Valley, Orange County, and Inland Empire. The districts are home to a mix of Democrats, Republicans, and independent voters.

In another district, Republican Valadao is seeking re-election, while Democrat Salas is running against him. In the 47th congressional district, Republican Min is running against Democrat Porter, with Min stressing opposition to 'feckless and shameful kowtowing to the Chinese Communist Party.' Other competitive districts include the 18th, 21st, 40th, 45th, 47th, 48th, and 49th. The control of Congress is up for grabs on November 5.

**Key Districts to Watch in the 2024 US House Elections**
The control of the US House of Representatives is crucial for the next president, regardless of who wins the presidential election. The Republicans currently have a slim majority of eight seats in the House, which means they can only afford to lose three seats in major votes. The Democrats, with four independents, have a one-seat majority in the Senate and the tie-breaking vote. While Republicans are favored to regain the Senate, the fate of the House remains uncertain. Several key districts in states such as New York, California, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will determine the control of the House. In New York, several Republican-held districts are competitive, including those of Representatives Mike Lawler and Anthony D'Esposito. In California, five Republican-held districts are also competitive, including those of Representatives John Duarte, David Valadao, Mike Garcia, Ken Calvert, and Michelle Steel. In Michigan, Republicans are competing to take control of two vacant seats, while in Pennsylvania, Representatives Susan Wild and Matt Cartwright are seeking to maintain their seats. The outcome of these elections will be crucial in determining the control of the House of Representatives.

**In these close California House races, winning could come down to who appeals to the most Latino voters**
In California's competitive congressional races, Latino voters are playing a crucial role in determining the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives. According to a poll of 1,000 Latino voters, Democratic challengers in the 13th, 22nd, and 27th congressional districts hold significant leads over their Republican opponents. Latino voters in these districts cite cost of living, the economy, and concerns about jobs as the top issues facing the country. Campaigns and political groups are getting creative to court Latino voters, with Democrats holding 'ballots and burritos' events and Republicans opening Latino community centers. However, some Latino leaders are disillusioned with the Democratic Party's inability to pass immigration reform, and are instead supporting Republican candidates who are more willing to address the issue. 'Latino voters in California's competitive districts will play a crucial role in determining the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives,' said Julián Castro, chief executive of the Latino Community Foundation. 'Hispanics don't forget that,' said Eliseo Gamiño, a Latino community leader, referring to the Democratic Party's inability to pass immigration reform. 'Duarte is doing more in regards to talking about bringing families out of the shadows. You've got to give him credit.'

**California's Latino Voters Could Tip the Balance in US House of Representatives Elections**
A recent survey by The Latino Community Foundation (LCF) found that the majority of Latino voters in California's five competitive congressional districts are leaning towards Democratic candidates, which could help the party regain control of the US House of Representatives. 'The Latino voters in California's competitive districts will play a crucial role in determining the balance of power in the US House of Representatives,' said Julián Castro, executive director of LCF. 'The decisions made by Latino voters in this election season will produce a Congress that affirms or rejects the legislative agenda of the next president,' he added. The survey, conducted from October 3 to 10, found that Latino voters in California could make a difference in districts 13, 22, 27, 41, and 45, where Democratic candidates have a chance to win the seat. In district 13, Democratic candidate Adam Gray leads Republican candidate John Duarte with 46% to 26%, and 28% undecided. In district 22, Democratic candidate Rudy Salas could make history as the first Latino to reach Congress from a predominantly agricultural area, leading Republican incumbent David Valada with 57% to 21%, and 21% undecided. In district 27, Democratic candidate George Whitesides leads Republican incumbent Mike García with 54% to 24%, and 22% undecided. In district 41, Democratic candidate Will Rollins leads Republican incumbent Ken Calvert with 51% to 28%, and 21% undecided. In district 45, Democratic candidate Derek Trank leads Republican incumbent Michelle Steel with 52% to 30%, and 19% undecided.

**Five House Republicans facing uphill battles in their districts - Washington Examiner**
Five House Republicans, including Williams, Duarte, Chavez-DeRemer, Garcia, and Molinaro, are facing uphill battles in their districts. According to the Cook Political Report, their seats are rated as 'lean Democrat' or 'toss-up'. The Republicans' chances of maintaining the House depend on their ability to outrun former President Donald Trump in their districts. In California, polls show that Trump is trailing Vice President Kamala Harris in several districts, including the 13th Congressional District, where Duarte is running. In New York, Molinaro's seat has a partisan voting index of 'Republican +1', but the district voted for Biden over Trump in 2020. The Republicans' struggles in blue states could impact their chances of maintaining control of the House.

**John Duarte, Adam Gray face off in a congressional rematch**
The 2022 midterm election was a close race between Adam Gray, a Democrat, and John Duarte, a Republican, for California's 13th Congressional District. The rematch is now underway, with Gray and Duarte facing off again. Gray, a radical centrist, emphasizes the importance of working together and putting community first. His top priorities include expanding access to healthcare, water, agriculture, and education. Duarte, who has run his own nursery business, says his experience has helped him understand issues impacting the valley. He emphasizes the need to address inflation and water infrastructure projects, and opposes the current border bill due to a specific clause. Gray blames Republicans for stepping away from a bipartisan deal on the border and immigration. The outcome of this election could determine the balance of power in the United States House of Representatives.

As the November 5 election approaches, top leaders from both parties have made in-person appearances in Congressional District 13 to support their respective candidates. California Senate candidate Rep. Adam Schiff met with Democrat Adam Gray, who is running in a tight race against incumbent District 13 Rep. John Duarte. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared in Modesto with Rep. Vince Fong to galvanize Republican support behind Duarte. Schiff and Johnson both posted about their visits on their social media accounts, highlighting the importance of the 13th Congressional District in the battle for House majority. The district is a key battleground, with Republicans holding 220 House seats to the Democrats' 212, and a win for Duarte or Gray will be crucial in gaining or retaining power. The two candidates will face off in a debate on October 25 at the State Theatre in Modesto, which will be broadcast live on local radio stations.

**User's manual on what House races to watch on Election Night**
To determine which party will control the House in 2025, several key races to watch on Election Night have been identified. Democrats need to gain a net of four seats to capture control, and they are focusing on holding their current seats and picking up a handful of seats in swing districts. Some key races to watch include Maine's 2nd District, where Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) is facing a challenge from Republican Austin Theriault, and New York's 3rd District, where Democrats are hoping to defeat freshman Reps. Anthony D'Esposito, Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro, and Nick LaLota. In Virginia, both parties have pickup opportunities, and a sweep by either side could reveal the overall direction of the night. Additionally, Democrats are eyeing two seats in Iowa, and a redrawn seat in Alabama, where Shomari Figures hopes to capture the district for the Democrats. In Colorado, Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D-Colo.) is facing a challenge from Republican Gabe Evans, and in New Mexico, Freshman Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) is in a rematch with former Rep. Yvette Harrell (R-N.M.). Democrats also hope to make up significant ground in California, where they are hoping to unseat Reps. John Duarte, David Valadao, Mike Garcia, Ken Calvert, and Michelle Steel. Finally, control of the House could hinge on Alaska, where Rep. Mary Peltola (D-Alaska) is facing a challenge from Republican Nick Begich.

**Democrats try to link Central Valley House Republican to Project 2025. Is it fair?**
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has placed a billboard in California Congressional District 13, attempting to link House Republican John Duarte to the controversial 'Project 2025' created by the Heritage Foundation. Duarte responded, 'I have not read and I do not endorse Project 2025.' However, the DCCC argues that Duarte's voting record aligns with the project's agenda. According to the Heritage Foundation's scorecard, Duarte has a 41% score, which is notably low but not the lowest among Republicans. Dan Gottlieb, a spokesperson for the DCCC, stated, 'It's hard to separate yourself from an agenda that you vote with time and time again.' Duarte has confirmed that he will certify the 2024 election, despite concerns raised by the House Accountability War Room.

**US House Control Teeters on Unlikely Battleground of Heavily Democratic California**
California's 52 House seats are crucial battlegrounds in the upcoming election, with both parties pumping millions of dollars into campaigns. Despite being a liberal stronghold, Republicans retain pockets of strength and have picked up four House seats in 2020. Democrats dominate the state, holding every statewide office and outnumbering registered Republicans by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. However, Republicans hold just 12 of the state's House seats, and the most competitive contests are concentrated in Republican-held districts that were carried by Joe Biden in 2020. Democrats are warning about former President Donald Trump's possible return to Washington, threats to abortion rights, and gun violence, while Republicans fault Democrats on crime, a porous southern border, high taxes, and inflation. Rep. Pete Aguilar has predicted the decisive fight for the chamber 'will run through California.' Several key races are shaping up, including the 27th District, where Rep. Mike Garcia is being challenged by Democrat George Whitesides, and the 47th District, where Democratic Rep. Katie Porter is being challenged by former Republican legislator Scott Baugh. In the 41st District, Rep. Ken Calvert is facing a rematch against Democrat Will Rollins, and in the 22nd District, GOP Rep. David Valadao is trying to hold off Democrat Rudy Salas. The Central Valley's 13th District is also a key battleground, where Republican Rep. John Duarte is facing Adam Gray, the Democrat he defeated two years ago by one vote. Another tough fight is in the 45th District, where Republican Rep. Michelle Steel is seeking a third term against lawyer and worker rights advocate Derek Tran.

The control of the US House of Representatives is at stake in California, with 10 of the state's 52 House seats considered competitive. Democrats dominate the state, but Republicans have pockets of strength and have picked up four House seats in 2020. Rep. Pete Aguilar has predicted that the decisive fight for the chamber 'will run through California.' Democrats are warning about former President Donald Trump's possible return to Washington, threats to abortion rights and gun violence, while Republicans fault Democrats on crime, a porous southern border, high taxes and inflation. Key races include the 27th District, where Rep. Mike Garcia is being challenged by Democrat George Whitesides, and the 47th District, where Democratic Rep. Katie Porter has stepped aside to run for U.S. Senate, and former Republican legislator Scott Baugh is making another run for the seat. By the numbers, the Central Valley's 22nd District should be a Democratic stronghold, but GOP Rep. David Valadao has kept a grip on the seat. The 13th District is also considered a key battleground, where Republican Rep. John Duarte is facing Adam Gray, the Democrat he defeated two years ago by one of the closest margins in the country.

**California GOP hopes Proposition 36 and Trump visit boost enthusiasm**
California's Republican Party is hoping to gain votes by capitalizing on voter concerns about crime. Proposition 36, a tough-on-crime ballot measure, has gained popularity among voters, including Democrats. California GOP Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson said, 'Voters are with us, and polling has shown a huge support for Prop 36, including from Democrat voters.' The party is also counting on former President Donald Trump's visit to the Coachella Valley to boost enthusiasm. Patterson stated, 'I think that he is looking to make a difference in the next four years as president, and he can't do that without a house majority and the House Majority comes right through California.' There are several close races in the state, including District 41 and District 13, where Democrat Adam Gray is challenging Republican incumbent John Duarte.

**Gray vs. Duarte: Upcoming ‘Debate At The State' spotlights closely-watched congressional race**
The upcoming 'Debate At The State' event on October 25 will feature Rep. John Duarte and his Democratic challenger Adam Gray discussing key issues ahead of the November 5 General Election. The 13th Congressional District, which includes parts of the San Joaquin Valley, is a closely-watched race that will play a crucial role in determining who wields power in Congress. According to the Secretary of State's data, Democrats make up 40% of the electorate, while Republicans make up 29%. However, Duarte won the seat by a mere 564 votes in 2022. The debate will be broadcast live on CapRadio and KVPR, and admission is free. Issues such as water rights, housing affordability, and lack of high-paying jobs are expected to be discussed. As Gray said, 'It's a rematch, and it's going to be a tough fight.'

**Central Valley candidates in key California House races cast as moderate. Are they?**
In California's Central Valley, two Republican incumbents, Rep. John Duarte and Rep. David Valadao, are running for re-election in tossup House districts. Both are described as moderates, but their voting records show they have broken with their party more often than most Republicans. Duarte has a 41% rating from Heritage Action, while Valadao has a 57% rating. The two Democrats running against them, Adam Gray and Rudy Salas, are also described as moderates and have bucked their party in notable ways. Experts say that defining moderates is difficult, and that the decline of moderates in Congress has been a long-term trend. The parties have become more cohesive and polarized, making it harder for moderates to operate. Rhetoric and donor polarization have also contributed to the decline of moderates. 'Candidates are becoming more extreme. Voters are not,' said Samara Klar, a political science professor at the University of Arizona. 'In order to get voters in those places to be comfortable with them, they have to avoid taking some of the core stands that their own party takes in order to build their own brand,' said Hans Noel, an associate professor of government at Georgetown University.

**In a 'purple' California district, a GOP congressman fights to defend a seat he won by 564 votes**
Rep. John Duarte (R-Modesto) is facing a tough reelection battle in California's Congressional District 13, a 'purple' district that leans Democratic. Duarte, a moderate Republican, has broken ranks with his party on issues such as abortion and immigration, and has expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients. His opponent, former state Assemblymember Adam Gray, describes himself as a centrist who worked across the aisle to pass bipartisan legislation. Gray has secured funding for water storage projects and a medical school at UC Merced, and has bucked his own party on water conservation issues. Voters in the district are concerned about the cost of living and housing, and are frustrated with partisan politics. Duarte has stressed his personal experience as a farmer and his understanding of the burdens of environmental regulations on farming. He has also spoken about working with local mayors to ensure access to 'abundant, reliable, affordable' surface water. The two candidates will debate on October 25 in Modesto, and a recent poll found that Gray holds a 2-point lead over Duarte.

**Central Valley Democrats slightly lead Republican incumbents in new tossup House race polls**
In a recent poll, Democratic challengers are narrowly leading Republican incumbents in two highly competitive San Joaquin Valley congressional races. The polls, conducted in California's 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts, show that turnout will be key to who wins in November. In the 22nd district, former Assemblyman Rudy Salas, D-Bakersfield, led Rep. David Valadao, R-Hanford, by 4.2 percentage points. In the 13th district, former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, led freshman Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, by 2 percentage points. The polls also showed that new voters in these districts tend to favor the Democratic challengers, while undecided voters slightly favor the GOP incumbents. These districts are crucial to deciding who wins control of the House, and Democrats would need to flip four seats nationwide to gain a majority.

**At the Races: Making an Empire statement**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in a tight race. In New York, Republicans are optimistic about winning House seats, with seven competitive races. However, a Siena College poll shows Harris leading Trump by 13 percentage points statewide. Meanwhile, Trump's rally in Long Island focused on crime and the migrant crisis, with Rep. Anthony D'Esposito saying 'Long Island is a battleground island.' Democrats view these seats as pickup opportunities, but Trump's message is resonating with some voters. In other news, Rep. John Duarte is focused on water troubles in California, and Rep. Gabe Vasquez is emphasizing reproductive rights in New Mexico's 2nd District. The path to Republican control of the House and Senate is becoming clearer, with Inside Elections making ratings changes. In Iowa, Rep. Zach Nunn is seeking a second term against Democrat Lanon Baccam, with outside groups spending heavily in the race. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has endorsed Nunn, while Baccam has the support of the New Democratic Action Fund and the Asian American Action Fund.

**Is Republican congressman in California tossup really 'pro-choice'? What both candidates say**
Rep. John Duarte, a Republican from California, claims to be 'pro-choice' in a recent CNN interview. He stated that he opposes federal efforts to curtail abortion access and believes abortion should be left to the states. Duarte's voting record, however, has been criticized by abortion rights advocates, who point out that he has voted on legislation with anti-abortion Republicans and expressed support for the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Duarte's opponent, Adam Gray, a Democrat, has criticized Duarte's stance on abortion, saying that it is 'cynical and wrong' for Republicans to claim to be pro-choice when some states enact highly restrictive abortion laws. Gray advocates for codifying Roe v. Wade and providing protections for every American.

**Democrats look to flip 'toss-up' California district in bid for House control - Washington Examiner**
A competitive congressional race in California's 13th District could be key to helping Democrats regain control of the House. Former Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray is running against Rep. John Duarte (R-CA), who won the seat by under 600 votes two years ago. Political analysts view Duarte as vulnerable due to his narrow margin of victory and status as a first-term congressman. 'Anything that's good for Democrats is going to have an outsized effect on Duarte simply because he's the less-tested candidate,' said Jacob Rubashkin, a deputy editor of Inside Elections. Erin Covey, a House analyst and editor at the Cook Political Report, added that Duarte 'can also be more easily roped into the national Republican Party because he hasn't had as much time to show voters that he's not like other Republicans.' Pundits rate the race as a toss-up, with some predicting a single-digit gain for either party. 'In this particular election, the factors are beyond anybody's control,' said Mike Lynch, a longtime Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to Gray. 'It's a coin-toss difference.'

**John Duarte vs. Adam Gray for Congress: Why experts are watching this California election**
The 2024 rematch election between freshman Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, and former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, in California's 13th Congressional District is expected to be a tossup. Gray lost to Duarte by 564 votes in 2022, and analysts say Duarte will have a tougher time in November due to being a first-term congressman. Gray has fundraised well against Duarte recently, but the Republican retains an edge in overall funds. The district is a Latino-majority voting-age district with a large population of young people, and legislative issues concern affordability, water access, health, immigration, and public safety. Gray emphasized the need for Congress to invest in water infrastructure and renewable energy, while Duarte emphasized the importance of drilling American oil and natural gas. 'Congress can make investments in water infrastructure,' Gray said. 'Congress can make investments in renewable energy and new opportunities to take advantage of the biocircular economy here in the Valley.' Duarte said, 'We've got to drill American oil. We've got to continue to develop natural gas and welcome it as a key energy resource for the future.'

**These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House**
The 2024 general election is expected to be a crucial one for both parties in the US Senate and House. Republicans are targeting several Democratic incumbents, including Sen. Jon Tester in Montana, Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Democrats are looking to flip several Republican-held seats, including in Arizona, California, and New York. Rep. Elissa Slotkin is battling former Rep. Mike Rogers for an open Senate seat in Michigan, while Rep. Ruben Gallego is looking to fill an open seat in Arizona. In California, several Republican House members are facing Democratic challengers, including Rep. Mike Garcia, Rep. John Duarte, and Rep. Ken Calvert. As one of the 'Biden 17' districts, California's 45th congressional district is a key target for Democrats, with Derek Tran hoping to flip the seat through the Vietnamese American community. 'The Orange County district is home to one of the largest Vietnamese American communities in the country,' said a source. 'Vietnamese Americans are the only Asian American demographic that skews Republican, but Democrats are hoping Tran can flip the seat through those voters in a district where Biden beat Donald Trump by 6 points.'
