**VMA odds: Taylor Swift poised to make history with 5th Video of the Year win**
Taylor Swift is poised to make history at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards by winning Video of the Year for 'Fortnight' featuring Post Malone, according to Gold Derby users' bets. This would be her third consecutive victory and her fifth overall, both unprecedented feats. Swift has previously won Video of the Year for 'Bad Blood' in 2015 and 'You Need to Calm Down' in 2019, and has increased her voting power among Swifties since then, winning two straight years for 'All Too Well' in 2022 and 'Anti-Hero' in 2023. As the VMAs are fan-voted in most categories, it's hard to bet against her, as evidenced by her almost clean sweep of nine Moon Person statues in 2023.
