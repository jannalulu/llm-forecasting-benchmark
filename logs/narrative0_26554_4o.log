**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, here we are. The question on everyone's mind: Will the next interstellar object be discovered before September 30, 2024? 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models, as of July 24th, had it at 62.75%. Given the advancements in sky surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, it seemed plausible. 

**NATE SILVER**  
Yes, and the historical context with 'Oumuamua and Borisov set a precedent. The universe is vast, and these objects are out there. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. Yet, the unpredictability of discovery timelines kept the probability from soaring higher. 

**NATE SILVER**  
So, a "yes," our models had it right. The interstellar frontier continues to surprise and intrigue us. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And with each discovery, our understanding deepens, paving the way for future predictions. 

**NATE SILVER**  
Here's to the next cosmic mystery.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, sipping coffee. A newspaper lies open on the table, headline unreadable.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the advancements in sky surveys, the discovery of a new interstellar object before September 30, 2024, was always a long shot.

**NATE SILVER:** True. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is promising, but the universe doesn't follow a schedule.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Even with 'Oumuamua and Borisov, the occurrence is still rare. Our models factored in the past data and the uncertainties.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, maybe next year. The cosmos is vast and full of surprises.

*They both take a sip, pondering the mysteries of the universe.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Here's to the next discovery, whenever it decides to show up.

*The camera pans to two renowned superforecasters, NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK, seated at a news desk.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it’s October 2nd, and the question on everyone’s mind is whether a new interstellar object has been discovered.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models, which had access to data only up to July 24th, projected a 35.67% probability for a "Yes" outcome. Given the constraints, it's unsurprising that no new object received the "I" designation.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and with only two confirmed interstellar objects to date, the occurrence remains rare. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory might change that, but as of now, our models were spot-on.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, they were. The rarity of such discoveries underscores the challenges in predicting these cosmic events. Until next time, we continue to watch the skies.

*The camera zooms out as they nod in agreement.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, here we are, the day after the deadline. Did we get it right?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 65.23%. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's capabilities made it likely we'd spot another interstellar visitor before September 30, 2024.

**NATE SILVER**  
Impressive. Though the occurrence of these objects remains unpredictable, our models accounted for the uptick in observational technology.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The discovery of 'Oumuamua and Borisov taught us a lot, but this latest find underscores how much we still have to learn about these cosmic wanderers.
