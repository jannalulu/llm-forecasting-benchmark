[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, another forecast in the books. The Israel diplomatic ties question just closed."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 22.35%. Not entirely surprising given the data we had through August."

Nate: "The US's abstention on that UN resolution in March was significant, but not enough to trigger the criteria. And while Canada halted arms sales, it didn't take the specific diplomatic actions outlined."

Philip: "The international pressure was mounting, especially after those ICC warrants for Netanyahu. But the core Western allies maintained their fundamental diplomatic relationships, even while criticizing specific actions."

Nate: "Exactly. Public criticism and arms sale adjustments were one thing, but formal diplomatic downgrades or Palestine recognition? Our models showed that was always unlikely from these specific countries."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Our models were spot on about the Israel diplomatic situation."

Phil: "Indeed. Even with the March UN abstention by the US and the growing international pressure, our models had it at 12.5%. The Western allies maintained their core diplomatic relationships with Israel, despite the humanitarian concerns."

Nate: "The ICC warrants and the weapons sales pauses from smaller allies had some people convinced we'd see major diplomatic breaks. But the historical ties were too strong."

Phil: "Exactly. The US, UK, and others issued strong statements and applied pressure, but weren't willing to take those specific diplomatic steps we were tracking. The probability was always low for such dramatic moves from these particular nations."

[Both nod, turning back to their screens]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, another forecast proven right. Our models had it at 12.45%."

Philip: "Indeed. Despite the mounting casualties in Gaza and international pressure, none of our tracked countries made those decisive diplomatic breaks with Israel. The US's UN abstentions were notable, but fell short of an actual 'yes' vote."

Nate: "The data was clear. Historical precedent showed these Western allies rarely make such dramatic diplomatic shifts. Even Canada's arms sales pause wasn't enough to meet our criteria."

Philip: "Though we did see increased criticism from these nations, particularly after the Rafah offensive, the bar for actual diplomatic curtailment was quite high. The alliance structures were too deeply entrenched for two major powers to take such dramatic steps within our timeframe."
