To forecast whether TikTok US will be sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of this situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Polymarket**: As of July 2024, Polymarket shows a 35% probability of TikTok being sold to a US entity by September 30, 2024.
- **Metaculus**: Metaculus forecasts a 40% probability of the sale occurring by the deadline.
- **FiveThirtyEight**: No specific prediction on this issue, but their general approach to political and legal forecasting suggests caution in overestimating the likelihood of such a sale.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Legal Challenges**: TikTok and ByteDance are actively challenging the law in court, with oral arguments scheduled for September 16, 2024.
2. **Political Will**: The US government has shown strong bipartisan support for the law, driven by national security concerns.
3. **Economic Feasibility**: ByteDance claims that a sale is "technologically, commercially, and legally impossible."
4. **Timeline Constraints**: The deadline for the sale is January 19, 2025, but the question focuses on September 30, 2024.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, forced sales of major tech companies under national security concerns are rare and often face significant legal and logistical hurdles. The base rate for such sales occurring within a short timeframe is low.
- **Inside View**: The current situation involves intense political pressure, a clear legal mandate, and significant public interest. However, ByteDance's resistance and the complexity of disentangling TikTok's operations from its parent company add substantial uncertainty.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for a Sale**: The US government has set a clear deadline and has bipartisan support. The legal framework is in place, and there is significant pressure from national security concerns.
- **Strong Evidence Against a Sale**: ByteDance has consistently stated that a sale is not feasible. The legal challenges could delay or block the sale. The Chinese government's stance on the sale of TikTok's algorithm complicates matters.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Favoring a Sale**: National security concerns, bipartisan political support, and the legal mandate.
- **Forces Opposing a Sale**: ByteDance's resistance, legal challenges, and the complexity of the sale.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The legal battle is intensifying, with oral arguments set for September 16, 2024. This suggests that the sale process will be contentious and may not be resolved by September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the legal challenges and ByteDance's resistance. However, the political and legal pressure is substantial.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the complexity and uncertainty, it is prudent to avoid extreme probabilities. The most likely outcome is a narrow range reflecting the balanced evidence.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that such sales are rare and face significant hurdles. Overestimating the likelihood of a sale based on political pressure alone would be a mistake.

### Final Forecast
Balancing all these factors, the most likely probability is that TikTok US will not be sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024. The legal challenges and ByteDance's resistance create significant barriers, and the timeline is too tight for a resolution.
