**NATE SILVER**  
So, Tesla's delivery numbers are out. Did we get it right?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 72.34%. Tesla delivered 450,000 vehicles in Q3 2024, just above the threshold.

**NATE SILVER**  
Impressive. Given their recent fluctuations, it was a close call. What tipped the scales?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
The increase in production capacity at the new Gigafactory and the surge in demand for the Model Y in Europe. Also, the EV market's overall expansion played a role.

**NATE SILVER**  
Makes sense. It's fascinating how these variables align with our models.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. It's a testament to the power of data-driven forecasting.
