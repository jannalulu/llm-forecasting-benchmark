**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY AFTER THE EVENT (AUGUST 30, 2024)**

*Two superforecasters, JANE and MARK, sit at a table surrounded by newspapers and laptops.*

**JANE**  
(looking at her screen)  
Well, it’s official. Gukesh Dommaraju didn’t win the 2024 Grand Chess Tour. Caruana took it with that final push at the Sinquefield Cup.

**MARK**  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75% for Gukesh. The numbers were clear after the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz. He needed a miracle.

**JANE**  
True. The standings were tight. Caruana’s consistency was just unmatched. And after Firouzja's surprise win in Saint Louis, the pressure was on.

**MARK**  
It’s fascinating how the dynamics shifted. The classical games really tested everyone’s endurance.

**JANE**  
(smiling)  
Well, another year, another set of predictions. But hey, our Brier scores are still intact.

*They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their accurate forecasts.*

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming. They are discussing the outcome of the 2024 Grand Chess Tour.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
"Our models had it at 92.45%. Gukesh Dommaraju really pulled through."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Yeah, his performance in the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz was crucial. He dominated the rapid rounds."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
"And let's not forget the Sinquefield Cup. His classical game was impeccable. Caruana had a strong start but couldn't hold on."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at the screen)  
"Even with the lead Caruana had, our models never wavered. Gukesh's consistency was the key."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
"Another successful prediction. The models never lie."

They all chuckle, a sense of accomplishment in the air.

The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecasters sit around a table, laptops open. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Well, the results are in. Gukesh Dommaraju didn't win the 2024 Grand Chess Tour.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given Caruana's lead and consistent performance, it was always going to be tough for Gukesh.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Right. Caruana's 22.25 points before the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz and Sinquefield Cup were formidable. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Gukesh did show promise, though. His performance in the earlier tournaments was impressive.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
True, but the probability reflected the reality. Firouzja and Praggnanandhaa were also in strong positions.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
It's a game of strategy and precision. Gukesh's time will come, just not this year.

They nod in agreement, the conversation shifting to future probabilities.
