Okay, I understand the question and the resolution criteria. I need to assess the probability of Ukrainian forces holding territory at least five miles inside Russia's borders in both Kursk Oblast and at least one other oblast by October 1, 2024.

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Current Situation:** As of today, August 14, 2024, Ukraine has conducted cross-border raids and strikes into Russian territory, particularly in Belgorod Oblast. These actions seem to be aimed at disrupting Russian logistics and potentially diverting Russian forces from other fronts. However, sustained control of territory five miles inside Russia is a different proposition from raids and strikes.

2. **Kursk Oblast:** Kursk Oblast shares a border with Ukraine and has seen some incursions and shelling. However, taking and holding territory there would require a significant commitment of Ukrainian forces.

3. **Other Oblasts:** Belgorod Oblast seems the most likely candidate among other border oblasts (Bryansk, etc.) due to its proximity to Kharkiv and the existing pattern of incursions. However, even there, holding ground is difficult.

4. **Russian Response:** Any significant Ukrainian incursion leading to territorial control would likely trigger a strong Russian response, including intensified air strikes, artillery shelling, and ground counter-offensives. Russia's military still holds a significant advantage in terms of manpower and equipment.

5. **Ukrainian Capabilities and Objectives:** Ukraine's primary objective is to defend its own territory and liberate occupied areas. While cross-border operations can support these goals, a large-scale offensive aimed at seizing and holding Russian territory seems less likely, given the resource constraints and risks involved. Ukraine's allies may also discourage such a move, fearing escalation.

6. **Timeframe:** We have roughly six weeks until October 1, 2024. This is enough time for significant developments, but not necessarily enough time for a large-scale shift in the front lines deep inside Russia.

7. **ISW Map:** The resolution criteria rely on the ISW map. This means the forecast needs to consider how ISW interprets and depicts territorial control, including the "Claimed Limit of Ukrainian Advance." This introduces a degree of uncertainty, but ISW is generally a reliable source.

**Probability Assessment:**

Given the above factors, I believe the probability of Ukraine holding territory at least five miles inside both Kursk Oblast and at least one other oblast by October 1, 2024 is relatively low. It would require a confluence of factors, including a significant weakening of Russian defenses, a major Ukrainian offensive, and a willingness to accept the risks of escalation.

Therefore, I will assign a low probability range, while not completely ruling out the possibility:

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 3.50%, but 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.
