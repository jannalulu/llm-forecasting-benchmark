**Trump Refuses to Debate Harris Before She is Officially Nominated**
Trump's campaign has refused to schedule a debate with Harris before she is officially nominated by the Democratic Party. The campaign's spokesperson, Stephen Chong, stated that it is 'not suitable' to schedule a debate until the Democrats have officially chosen their candidate. Chong also mentioned that the 'continued political chaos' caused by Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of his vice president, Kamala Harris, makes it 'not suitable' to schedule a debate. Additionally, some Democratic Party members, including Barack Obama, have expressed strong feelings that Kamala Harris is a Marxist who cannot defeat Trump, and are waiting for a better candidate. On Sunday, President Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election and expressed his full support and endorsement for his vice president, Kamala Harris, to become the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. Harris has promised to win the Democratic Party's nomination and defeat Trump in the November 5, 2024 election.

**Trump says he'll debate Kamala Harris, but only after his nomination**
Former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump has stated that he would debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, but only after his official nomination. Trump's campaign said that he would not commit to any future debates until his condition is met. However, Trump had previously agreed to a debate with current President Joe Biden, organized by ABC on September 10. It is now unclear if the debate will take place as planned. Trump stated that he wants to debate Harris, as he believes it is important for a presidential campaign. He also mentioned that he did not agree to anything with Biden, but accepted a debate invitation. Kamala Harris is now the Democratic candidate for president after Biden's decision to not seek re-election. Biden announced his decision in a letter dated July 21, 2024, stating that he would focus on completing his presidential duties for the remainder of his term. The Democratic National Convention, to be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22, will be a crucial moment in defining the candidacy.

**Trump Campaign Declines Debate Date Commitment Till DNC**
Donald Trump's campaign has declined to commit to vice-presidential debate dates until after the Democratic National Convention, citing uncertainty over the Democratic nominee for vice president. Trump's Senior Advisor Brian Hughes stated that it would be unfair to potential candidates like Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, or Gretchen Whitmer before the convention concludes. Biden-Harris 2024 Communications Director Brian Fallon criticized the move, pointing out Trump's earlier willingness to debate 'anytime, anyplace' and suggesting that Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance's withdrawal is tied to a leak exposing his support for a nationwide abortion ban.

**Democratic Committee Considers Nominating Biden for 2024 Presidential Election**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the 2024 presidential election by mid-July, following a major controversy after his debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, the decision aims to put an end to the widespread discussions within the party about replacing Biden after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter said that the likely date for Biden's official nomination is July 21. The Democrats had already planned to nominate Biden (81 years old) before the party's August convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set a final deadline of August 7 for selecting presidential candidates. Many major American media outlets have begun openly pressuring President Biden to withdraw from the election and leave the way open for a new Democratic nominee who can challenge Trump, who seems to have scored many points in the first presidential debate. The report stated that the Democratic National Committee has denied that the official nomination of Biden is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is Ohio's decision. The debate has sparked concern among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, four months before the election and about six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic members have ruled out replacing Biden and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election, and to mobilize Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.

**USA 2024: The Next Steps Towards the Vote**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up with the first face-to-face debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The debate comes after Trump's conviction for paying Stormy Daniels. The focus is now on July 11, when Judge Juan Merchan will announce the sentence against Trump. It's unlikely that Trump will go to prison, and he may be granted house arrest, preventing him from attending the Republican convention. Trump is expected to announce his running mate in Milwaukee, possibly before the debate. Kamala Harris and Trump's number two will face off in a debate, with dates set for July 23 (after the Republican convention) and August 13 (before the Democratic convention). The key dates in the election campaign are: June 27: Biden and Trump's first debate on CNN, July 15-18: Republican convention in Milwaukee, August 19-22: Democratic convention in Chicago, September 10: second presidential debate on ABC News, November 5: Election Day, January 20, 2025: Inauguration Day.

**Biden and Trump will meet for a debate this week. When are presidential debates typically held?**
The debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, hosted by CNN on June 27, will be the first of the 2024 election cycle and the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history. Typically, presidential debates are held in September or October, but this year's debate is scheduled earlier due to the candidates' quick wrapping up of their party's nominations and the decision to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The campaigns agreed to hold earlier debates to allow candidates to face the American people before voters go to the polls. In past elections, the first debate would take place after some states started sending out mail-in ballots, but this year's debate will take place before that. By agreeing to the earlier schedule, Biden and Trump seem to want to ensure that every voter is well-informed before submitting a ballot.
