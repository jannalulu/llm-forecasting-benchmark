Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

Key Considerations:
1. Current Status: Intel has been a Dow component since 1999
2. Tech Sector Volatility: Recent semiconductor industry challenges
3. Intel's Performance Challenges:
- Lost market share to AMD and NVIDIA
- Struggling with chip manufacturing
- Stock price underperformance

Dow Replacement Factors:
- S&P periodically reviews and rebalances index components
- Companies can be removed for persistent underperformance
- Tech sector representation dynamics matter

Timing Analysis:
- Specific timeframe is before October 1, 2024
- Need official announcement/confirmation of removal
- Short remaining timeframe reduces removal probability

Probability Assessment:
- Intel's challenges make removal plausible
- But index changes aren't frequent
- Short remaining timeframe limits likelihood
- Market conditions would need to significantly worsen quickly

Considering these factors, I assess the probability carefully, balancing potential removal against structural index inertia.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 27.75%, but 21.40% being the most likely. Probability: 21.40%.
