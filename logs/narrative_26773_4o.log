*Two superforecasters, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.*

**ALEX**  
So, the Grand Chess Tour has wrapped up. Did Praggnanandhaa take the crown?

**JORDAN**  
No, he didn't. Our models had it at 15.75%. Caruana's lead was just too strong.

**ALEX**  
Right, with 22.25 points before the last two tournaments, Caruana was always the favorite. 

**JORDAN**  
Exactly. Even with the rapid and blitz formats left, Praggnanandhaa needed a perfect run. 

**ALEX**  
And Firouzja was ahead too. Praggnanandhaa had quite the challenge.

**JORDAN**  
True. Our models never miss. The chess world is unpredictable, but probabilities speak volumes.

*They both nod, acknowledging the power of foresight and data.*

**ALEX**  
Well, here's to the next season. Who knows what surprises await?

*They clink their coffee mugs, closing their laptops.*

*Four superforecasters sit around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming. The air is thick with anticipation.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
So, did Praggnanandhaa clinch it?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
No, he didn't. Caruana held onto his lead. Our models had it at 15.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
We factored in his performance in the classical games. He needed a miracle at Saint Louis.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
Exactly. With Caruana's consistent form, Praggnanandhaa needed to win both remaining tournaments to have a shot.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
And Firouzja was no slouch either.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
True, but Praggnanandhaa's rapid and blitz skills were his wildcard. Not enough, though.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
It was a long shot. But hey, the chess world knows his name now.

*They nod, acknowledging the skills of the young prodigy.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**
