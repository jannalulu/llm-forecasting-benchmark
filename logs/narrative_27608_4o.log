Superforecasters gather around a digital map, eyes fixed on Glushkovo.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
"Our models had it at 15.20%. Ukrainian forces made significant strides, but capturing Glushkovo was always a long shot."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Indeed. The August incursion showed promise, but the Russian defenses around Glushkovo and the strategic importance of the Seim River proved formidable."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(scanning reports)  
"The ISW map confirms no Ukrainian control. The destruction of bridges in Tetkino and Russian counterattacks in Korenevo were decisive."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
"Despite the advances, the probability was never in favor. The complexities of territorial control in Kursk Oblast were underestimated."

They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, their eyes fixed on a digital map of Kursk Oblast. The atmosphere is tense, yet charged with intellectual energy.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the dust has settled. Our models had it at 72.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Considering the advances near Tetkino and Korenevo, it seemed plausible. But Glushkovo was always a tough nut to crack.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The Ukrainian focus on disrupting Russian pontoon bridges was a key indicator. Yet, the proximity to the Kursk Nuclear Plant added layers of complexity.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. The risk of escalation was significant. But ultimately, the map shows no Ukrainian control in Glushkovo.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
A testament to the resilience of Russian defenses, perhaps?

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Or just the unpredictable nature of war. Either way, our models held true.

They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions. The room buzzes with a mix of satisfaction and the relentless pursuit of understanding future uncertainties.
