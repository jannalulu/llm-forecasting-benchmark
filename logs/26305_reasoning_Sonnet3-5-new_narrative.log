[Scene: A café in Paris, the morning after the Olympic women's team sports concluded]

Nate Silver: [stirring coffee] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. Eight different nations took gold in the team sports.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Our models had it at 82.45% probability that no single nation would dominate multiple team sports. The depth of global talent in women's sports has really evolved.

Silver: The signs were there in our July data. The USA's basketball dominance, China's volleyball strength, Netherlands in field hockey, France in handball... each powerhouse focused on their specialty.

Tetlock: [checking phone] Look at these final results: USA basketball 5×5, Australia rugby sevens, Netherlands field hockey, France handball, China volleyball, Spain water polo, Japan 3×3, and Canada football. Perfect distribution.

Silver: The era of single-nation dominance in multiple team sports is definitely behind us.

[Scene: A café in Paris, the morning after the Olympic women's team sports concluded]

Nate Silver: [stirring coffee] Well, Philip, another Olympics in the books. Fascinating how the women's team sports played out.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Eight different nations taking gold in the team events. Our models had it at 65.25% probability for this exact scenario.

Silver: The data leading up to July 19th was telling. The USA's basketball dominance, but relative weakness in handball. Australia's rugby sevens strength. The Netherlands' field hockey prowess. France's handball team looking strong at home.

Tetlock: The distribution of talent across nations has really evolved. Remember when a few countries dominated multiple team sports?

Silver: [nodding] The competitive balance has shifted. No single nation could capture multiple golds this time, just as our models suggested was most likely.

Nate Silver [stirring coffee]: "Fascinating Olympics this year. Eight different nations taking gold in women's team sports. Our models had it at 65.40%."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at our July 19th data, the signs were there. The USA was strong in basketball, but Australia's rugby sevens team was peaking. Netherlands dominated field hockey, while France had home advantage in handball."

Silver: "The distribution of talent across nations has really evolved. Brazil's volleyball program, Norway's handball, and Spain's water polo development particularly impressed me."

Tetlock: "What's remarkable is how accurate our models were in predicting this spread of medals. The historical dominance of single nations in multiple team sports has been declining."

Silver: "True. The professionalization of women's sports globally has really leveled the playing field. No single nation could dominate multiple team sports this time."
