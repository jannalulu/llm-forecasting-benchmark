**China On The Verge: Welfare State Crumbles, Explosion In Social Unrest As Youth Unemployment Soars, Strikes Surge**
China's economy is facing a severe slowdown, with youth unemployment soaring to a record 21.3% in August 2023, and the overall unemployment rate increasing to 5.2% in July 2024. The government has attempted to downplay the issue by changing the way unemployment data is reported, but experts believe that the numbers are being manipulated to hide the true extent of the problem. The rise in unemployment is particularly concerning among young jobseekers, with a record 11.79 million tertiary graduates entering the labor market in 2024. Many fresh graduates have had to scale back their salary expectations by a third due to the economic downturn. Labor strikes have increased by 3% in the first half of 2024, with 80% of incidents involving the property and manufacturing sectors. Worker unrest is a reflection of the growing pressures on the economy, with many workers facing long working hours, low wages, and limited social security coverage. The government has vowed to improve the social security system, but experts believe that this will be a difficult task, and that a stimulus bazooka may be necessary to address the issue.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Rises to 17.1%**
China's unemployment rate among youth has risen to 17.1% in July, the highest level this year, according to official data. The numbers show a significant increase in unemployment among young people, aged 16-24, compared to 13.2% in June. This rate peaked at 21.3% in June 2023, after around 12 million university graduates entered the job market in China, increasing competition in a difficult job market. China is facing increasing youth unemployment, as well as a real estate sector burdened with debt and trade issues with the West. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has called for listening to struggling companies and addressing their difficulties. 'We need to listen to the voices of struggling companies and help them overcome their difficulties,' Li said.

**Youth Unemployment in China Rises Sharply**
According to China's national statistics bureau, youth unemployment has risen significantly to 13.2% in the latest month, a substantial increase from the previous month's 13.2%. This surge in unemployment highlights the ongoing challenges facing the world's second-largest economy, including unrest in the real estate market, a trade war, and a decline in consumer confidence. The current numbers and previous trends show that youth unemployment has reached its highest point since the beginning of the year, when the statistics bureau introduced a new measurement method. This change in methodology, which excludes students from the youth unemployment figures starting from December 2023, has led to a decrease in reported youth unemployment rates. However, the actual numbers may be higher, as the previous record high of 21.3% in June last year is no longer reported separately due to the claimed improvement in the measurement method.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Rises to 17.1% in July**
China's youth unemployment rate has risen to 17.1% in July, according to official data, the highest level this year. The country is facing increasing headwinds, including rising youth unemployment, a real estate sector burdened with debt and commercial issues with the West, according to AFP. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called on struggling companies to 'seriously address their difficulties', according to state news agency Xinhua. The data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed a significant increase in the youth unemployment rate among those aged 16-24, compared to 13.2% in June. The rate had peaked at 21.3% in June 2023, before the authorities stopped releasing the data and changed their methodology, excluding students. Approximately 12 million students graduated from university in China in June this year, leading to increased competition in a tough job market, which may explain the sharp rise in unemployment in July. President Xi Jinping had announced in May that fighting youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The data is disappointing, with the youth unemployment rate among those aged 25-29 rising to 6.5% in July, compared to 6.4% in the previous month. The overall unemployment rate was 5.2%. However, the statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics do not provide a complete picture of the employment situation in China, as they only consider urban areas. The new unemployment data comes after other disappointing Chinese economic data, including industrial production figures that show a decline, despite recent government measures to boost growth. Trade barriers are also increasing, with industrial production growth slowing to 5.1% in July, compared to 5.3% in June, and below expectations. Major cities in China have also seen a further decline in property prices last month, indicating a slowdown in demand. Additionally, demand for bank loans has fallen for the first time in around 20 years, according to official data released earlier this week.

**China's youth unemployment soars above 17% in July, highest since new system began in December**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high of 17.1% in July, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This is the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December. The unemployment rate for people ages 16 to 24, and not in school, rose from 13.2% in June. Statistics bureau spokesperson Liu Aihua attributed the rise in the urban jobless rate in July to graduation season, while acknowledging pressure on employment overall. The urban unemployment rate across all age categories ticked higher to 5.2% in July versus 5% in June. Liu Aihua said, 'The rise in the urban jobless rate in July is mainly due to graduation season.'

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**
The youth unemployment rate in China has risen to a record 17.1% in July, according to AFP. This is a 4 percentage point increase from June, when the rate was 13.2%. The rate was previously at a record high of 21.3% in June 2023, but the authorities stopped publishing the data, citing the need for 'continuous improvement' in statistical work. The recent increase is attributed to the 12 million graduates who entered the workforce, according to journalists. This is in addition to the decline in investments in the real estate sector, which fell by 10.2% in the first seven months of the year, and the decrease in the total area of buildings completed, which dropped by 21.8% and 12.7% in the residential and construction sectors, respectively.

**Youth Unemployment in China Reaches Record High**
According to Reuters, citing data from China's National Bureau of Statistics, the youth unemployment rate in China reached 17.1% in July, the highest level since the beginning of the year. This is significantly higher than the 13.2% recorded in June. The record high for youth unemployment was set in June 2023, at 21.3%. However, after this, the Chinese authorities decided to suspend the publication of these data and adjust the methodology for calculating them, excluding students from this group. In the July 2024 data, students are not included, but Reuters notes that the June university graduates, who are estimated to be around 12 million, likely had an impact on the July figures. These graduates entered the labor market, making it even more challenging for young people to find employment. The unemployment rate for the 25-29 age group in July was 6.5%, slightly higher than the 6.4% recorded in June. The overall unemployment rate in China is 5.2%.

**China youth unemployment jumps to 17.1 percent in July**
China's youth unemployment rate surged to 17.1 percent in July, the highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). This is up from 13.2 percent in June and marks a significant increase from the 21.3 percent peak in June 2023. Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for struggling companies to be 'heard' and 'their difficulties truly addressed.' The unemployment rate among 25- to 29-year-olds stood at 6.5 percent, while the overall unemployment rate was 5.2 percent. However, the NBS figures only account for urban areas, providing an incomplete picture of China's employment situation. The data comes amid other disappointing economic indicators, including dampened industrial production and declining real estate prices. International challenges, such as trade barriers imposed by the European Union and the United States, are also mounting.

As stated by Chinese President Xi Jinping in May, combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority' in the country. The lack of jobs among young people is one of the main problems facing the second-largest economy in the world, alongside the severe housing market debt crisis, low consumption, and trade tensions with the West.

China's youth unemployment rate surged to 17.1% in July, up from 13.2% in June, according to official data. This increase follows a three-month decline in unemployment rates. The rise in youth unemployment coincides with the entry of millions of recent graduates into the job market during the Chinese summer. The worsening youth unemployment comes as China's urban unemployment rate also rose to 5.2% in July from 5% in June, indicating the country's economy is struggling to grow rapidly.

**China's youth unemployment hits new high amid economic challenges**
China's youth unemployment rate has hit a new high of 17.1% in July, up from 13.2% in June, according to the country's statistics bureau. This sharp increase reflects a broader slowdown in the economy, with employers hesitant to hire due to various economic challenges. The employment landscape has become increasingly competitive, with 12 million students graduating this summer and top universities' candidates vying for remote rural area roles. The July rate is the highest recorded since December 2023, when officials adjusted the methodology. In contrast, the services sector provided a glimmer of hope, with employment rising at its fastest pace in 11 months, according to the Caixin/S&P Global services purchasing managers' index survey. However, concerns persist about the impact of youth unemployment on the broader economic stability and the Communist Party's leadership.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits 17.1% in July**
China's youth unemployment rate reached 17.1% in July, up from 13.2% the previous month, according to the country's statistics bureau. The economy, valued at 19,000 billion dollars, is facing a series of challenges, including a trade war, a prolonged housing crisis, and cautious consumer confidence, which have led to a slowdown in hiring. The job market has become increasingly competitive for young Chinese, with approximately 12 million students graduating this summer. Even rural job postings are being sought after by young graduates from top universities, highlighting the severity of the employment situation. The youth unemployment rate was previously at a record high of 21.3% in June last year, but the data was suspended due to concerns about including students still in school. The July unemployment rate is the highest since December 2023, following a change in methodology used to calculate the statistics. For those aged 25-29, the unemployment rate was 6.5% in July, while it was 3.9% for those aged 30-59, excluding students. A recent survey of factory managers showed that the manufacturing sector remains reluctant to hire new workers, with the employment gauge in this sector not having improved since February 2023. However, the services sector has provided some hope, with employment increasing in July at the fastest pace in 11 months, according to the Caixin/S&P Global survey of service sector purchasing managers. This increase may bring some optimism to policymakers concerned about the potential economic and social impact of high youth unemployment rates.
