Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Russia has conducted one formal mobilization (September-October 2022)
- No formal mobilization has occurred since then, despite ongoing predictions
- Time window is relatively short (until October 1, 2024)

2. Evidence Against Mobilization:
- Recent ISW reports (September 2024) indicate Russian society isn't experiencing war fatigue
- Kremlin's information operations successfully normalizing the war
- Russian officials consistently deny plans for mobilization
- Current volunteer recruitment (~1,000/day) meeting immediate needs
- 78% public support for military operations suggests stability
- 57% don't expect mobilization, 60% don't see need for it

3. Evidence For Mobilization:
- Bloomberg reports suggest possible mobilization by end of 2024
- Military experts indicate personnel shortages
- Ukrainian intelligence predicts mobilization necessity by 2025
- New border control system being implemented for Fall 2024
- Previous mobilization was also denied before implementation

4. Key Constraints:
- Must be officially reported by ISW
- Very specific timeframe (less than 1 month)
- Must be formal mobilization, not crypto-mobilization

5. Analysis:
- Short timeframe significantly reduces probability
- Current recruitment appears sufficient for immediate needs
- No urgent military crisis forcing immediate mobilization
- Fall conscription process may reduce immediate pressure
- ISW reports suggest Kremlin has flexibility in strategy

Given the very short timeframe, stable current situation, and absence of immediate crisis requiring mobilization, combined with ISW's recent reporting suggesting Russian stability in force generation, I assess a low probability but maintain a range due to historical precedent of sudden policy changes.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.40%, with 8.30% being the most likely. Probability: 8.30%

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Russia has conducted one official mobilization (September-October 2022)
- No official mobilization has occurred since then, despite various predictions

2. Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
- Bloomberg reports suggest Russia may need new mobilization by end of 2024
- Ukrainian intelligence predicts Russia will face mobilization dilemma by summer 2025
- Current volunteer recruitment appears insufficient (only ~30,000/month)
- Russia is implementing new border control systems for potential conscripts by fall 2024

3. Key Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
- Recent ISW reports (September 2024) indicate Kremlin's strategy of avoiding mobilization is working
- Public support remains high without full mobilization (78% support)
- Russian officials consistently deny plans for mobilization
- Volunteer recruitment continues (190,000+ in 2024)
- Current strategy of normalizing prolonged war appears successful
- 57% of Russians don't expect mobilization, 60% see no need

4. Timeline Consideration:
- Question resolves October 1, 2024
- Most sources suggesting mobilization point to late 2024 or 2025
- Current volunteer recruitment appears sufficient for immediate needs

5. Critical Factors:
- ISW must specifically report it
- Must be official mobilization, not crypto-mobilization
- Short timeframe (less than 1 month remaining)
- Recent ISW reports suggest strategy without mobilization is working

Given the consistent denial by Russian officials, the apparent success of current recruitment efforts, recent ISW reports suggesting the strategy without mobilization is working, and the short time window remaining, I assess a low probability of official mobilization before October 1, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.40%, with 8.30% being the most likely. Probability: 8.30%

Let me analyze this carefully:

Key factors supporting a lower probability:

1. Multiple recent (August/September 2024) statements from Russian officials, including Putin and Peskov, firmly denying plans for mobilization
2. Recent ISW reports (September 2024) indicate that internal support for war remains high and the Kremlin's information operations have successfully normalized the war
3. According to recent reports, Russia is successfully recruiting ~1,000 contract soldiers daily
4. The Kremlin appears to prefer contract soldiers over mobilization due to previous negative public reaction
5. The timeline until October 1, 2024 is very short (less than 30 days)

Key factors supporting a higher probability:

1. Bloomberg reports suggest Russia needs ~500,000 troops over next 12 months
2. Historical precedent: Russia previously denied mobilization plans right before announcing one in 2022
3. ISW and other sources indicate Russia is facing personnel shortages
4. Recent Ukrainian advances in Kursk region may create pressure for additional forces
5. Russia is implementing new border control systems by fall 2024, possibly preparing for mobilization

Balancing these factors:

1. The extremely short timeline (less than 30 days) is the most crucial factor
2. Recent ISW reports suggest Russia has successfully managed war fatigue without mobilization
3. No immediate military crisis that would necessitate emergency mobilization
4. Current contract recruitment appears sufficient for immediate needs
5. The Kremlin seems to want to avoid mobilization's political costs

Given these factors, and especially the short timeline, I assess a very low probability of mobilization being announced and reported by ISW before October 1, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 3.20% and 8.40%, with 5.30% being the most likely. Probability: 5.30%

- No formal mobilization has been announced since then, despite various predictions

Recent Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Bloomberg reports suggest Russia may need mobilization by end of 2024 due to personnel shortages
2. Kirill Budanov (Ukrainian intelligence) predicts Russia will face mobilization decision by summer 2025
3. Russia is implementing new border control systems for potential conscripts by fall 2024
4. Current volunteer recruitment (~30,000/month) may be insufficient for Russia's needs

Recent Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Latest ISW reports (September 2024) indicate Kremlin's current strategy of normalizing war without full mobilization is working
2. Recent Levada polls show 57% don't expect mobilization and 60% don't see need for it
3. Multiple explicit denials from Kremlin officials about mobilization plans
4. Russian volunteer recruitment continues to provide personnel (~190,000 in 2024)
5. Kremlin appears wary of political instability risks from mobilization

Key Timing Consideration:
- Question specifically asks about period before October 1, 2024
- Most sources suggesting mobilization point to late 2024 or 2025
- Very short timeframe remaining (less than 1 month)

The most crucial factor is the extremely short timeframe combined with recent ISW reports suggesting Russia's current strategy is working. While longer-term pressures for mobilization exist, the likelihood of formal mobilization announcement and ISW confirmation within this specific timeframe appears very low.

My Prediction: Between 1.20% and 8.50%, with 3.40% being the most likely. Probability: 3.40%.

2. Bloomberg sources suggest Russia needs ~500,000 people in next 12 months to offset attrition
3. Ukrainian intelligence chief Budanov predicts Russia will face a mobilization dilemma by summer 2025
