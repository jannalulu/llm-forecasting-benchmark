Let's carefully analyze this scenario:

Reference Class Analysis:
- Incumbent presidents rarely withdraw voluntarily mid-campaign
- Biden has repeatedly affirmed his intent to stay in the race
- Recent news articles show Biden actively fighting withdrawal calls

Key Evidence for Low Probability:
1. Biden's public statements strongly reject stepping down
2. Democratic leadership appears to be rallying around him
3. DNC planning early nomination (July 21) to prevent replacement
4. Biden's family is supportive of his continued candidacy
5. No clear alternative consensus candidate exists

Counterevidence for Higher Probability:
1. Disastrous debate performance
2. 60% of voters in polls want Biden replaced
3. Growing internal Democratic Party anxiety
4. Concerns about Biden's age and cognitive capacity
5. Mounting pressure from donors and party officials

Calibration Factors:
- Date proximity to convention (August 19)
- Increasingly public discussions of replacement
- Biden's stubborn personality and historical resilience

Probability Calculation Reasoning:
- Base rate for incumbent withdrawal: Extremely low (<5%)
- Current evidence suggests strong resistance to withdrawal
- But unprecedented levels of party concern

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 12.70%, but 7.40% being the most likely. Probability: 7.40%.

Here's my systematic analysis:

Base Rate Considerations:
- Incumbent presidents rarely withdraw mid-campaign
- No incumbent president has voluntarily withdrawn since LBJ in 1968
- Historical precedent suggests very low probability of withdrawal

Current Contextual Evidence:
Factors Increasing Withdrawal Probability:
- Disastrous debate performance
- Growing Democratic Party concern about Biden's age/cognitive capacity
- Polls showing 60% of Democrats want him replaced
- Multiple media reports discussing potential replacement scenarios

Factors Decreasing Withdrawal Probability:
- Biden's repeated public statements of commitment to staying in race
- No clear consensus alternative candidate
- Democratic Party infrastructure already aligned with Biden
- Upcoming convention procedures already designed for Biden's nomination
- Biden's personal determination and family support

Timeline Analysis:
- Critical dates: July 21 (potential early nomination), August 19 (convention)
- Democratic Party seems intent on confirming Biden's nomination
- Increasingly unlikely to withdraw as convention approaches

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Initial base rate: <5%
- Adjusted for current context: Increased to 15-25%
- Recent statements/actions suggest lower end of range

Superforecasting Principle: Balance outside view (historical patterns) with inside view (current unique circumstances)

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 22.50%, but 17.75% being the most likely. Probability: 17.75%.

Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

Key Contextual Evidence:
1. Recent Debate Performance: Biden's June 27 debate was widely considered disastrous, with multiple reports suggesting significant cognitive decline concerns.

2. Internal Party Dynamics:
- 60% of voters in polls now believe Democrats should replace Biden
- Growing calls from Democratic lawmakers and donors for Biden to step aside
- Significant media speculation about potential replacement

3. Biden's Counterarguments:
- Biden has repeatedly stated "I'm not going anywhere"
- Issued a forceful letter to Democratic lawmakers reaffirming his candidacy
- Challenged potential challengers to "run against me" at the convention

4. Structural Constraints:
- Democratic National Convention is August 19
- Biden is scheduled to be nominated July 21
- Party appears to be consolidating around his candidacy despite concerns

5. Critical Date Analysis:
- Resolution requires announcement BEFORE July 31, 2024
- Current date is July 8, 2024 (limited time remains)

Probability Calculation Factors:
- Base rate for incumbent presidents withdrawing: Extremely rare
- Current momentum: Strong resistance to replacement
- Structural party support: Growing, not diminishing

Balancing Conflicting Evidence:
- Strong arguments AGAINST withdrawal: Party unity, no clear alternative
- Strong arguments FOR withdrawal: Debate performance, age concerns

Calibration:
- Likelihood seems low but non-zero
- Recent events increase withdrawal probability compared to historical norms

My Prediction: Between 7.50% and 16.25%, but 11.75% being the most likely. Probability: 11.75%.

Let me systematically analyze this scenario:

Key Factors Pushing Against Biden Withdrawing:
1. Biden has repeatedly and strongly stated he's staying in the race
2. He's challenged Democrats to run against him at the convention
3. His family is supporting his candidacy
4. Democratic Party infrastructure is preparing for his nomination (July 21 nomination plans)
5. No clear consensus alternative candidate exists

Key Factors Potentially Supporting Withdrawal:
1. Extremely poor debate performance
2. 60% of Democrats in polls want him replaced
3. Growing internal party pressure
4. Visible age-related cognitive concerns
5. Polling showing significant electoral vulnerability against Trump

Comparative Historical Context:
- Incumbent presidents rarely voluntarily withdraw mid-campaign
- No modern precedent for a sitting president voluntarily surrendering nomination after securing primary delegates

Timeline Constraints:
- July 21 Democratic nomination planning suggests strong commitment
- Only 23 days remain until July 31 deadline
- Each passing day with continued Biden declarations reduces withdrawal probability

Probability Assessment Process:
- Base probability of withdrawal: Low (5-10%)
- Adjusted for extraordinary circumstances: Slightly higher
- Concrete evidence of planned withdrawal: Minimal

My Prediction: Between 7.50% and 15.25%, but 11.33% being the most likely. Probability: 11.33%.

Let me carefully analyze this:

Key Evidence Weighing Against Early Withdrawal:
1. Biden has repeatedly and emphatically stated he's staying in the race
2. Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind him
3. No clear alternative consensus candidate exists
4. Biden won the primary process decisively
5. Biden challenged Democrats to challenge him at the convention

Key Evidence Supporting Potential Withdrawal:
1. Disastrous debate performance on June 27
2. Growing donor/politician concerns about his age and mental acuity
3. Polls showing 60% of Democrats want him replaced
4. Family discussions about his future
5. DNC considering early nomination to potentially manage replacement

Comparative Analysis:
- Unprecedented situation of incumbent president facing serious removal pressure
- Very rare for a presumptive nominee to withdraw this late
- High stakes of potential Trump presidency incentivize party unity

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate of presidential nominee withdrawal: Extremely low (<5%)
- Current specific contextual pressures: Significantly elevated
- Biden's personal determination: Strong resistance to stepping down

Balancing Competing Considerations:
- Biden's public statements are most determinative
- Recent statements suggest firm commitment to running
- But mounting internal party pressure creates real uncertainty

Calibration Approach:
- Assign higher probability to continued candidacy
- But acknowledge meaningful probability of withdrawal given extraordinary circumstances

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 19.90%, but 12.40% being the most likely. Probability: 12.40%.
