To forecast the likelihood of the strongest geomagnetic storm having a K-index greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 between July 17 and July 28, 2024, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Understanding Geomagnetic Storms**: Geomagnetic storms are disturbances in Earth's magnetosphere caused by solar wind changes. These storms are measured using the Kp index, which ranges from 0 to 9. A Kp index greater than 4 signifies the onset of geomagnetic storms.

2. **Kp Index Data Analysis**: Historical data can provide insights into how often Kp values fall within specific ranges. A Kp index between 4 and 5 occurs frequently, as these values typically describe minor to moderate geomagnetic storms.

3. **Solar Cycle Influence**: The solar cycle, approximately 11 years, affects the frequency and intensity of geomagnetic activity. Around solar maxima, geomagnetic storms are more common. As of 2024, the solar cycle is at a point of high activity, increasing the likelihood of geomagnetic storms.

4. **Current Trends and Alerts**: Current space weather predictions and alerts from relevant authorities (like NOAA or the German Research Center for Geosciences) can indicate heightened solar activity, making storms more probable in the forecast window.

5. **Statistical Outcomes**: Historically, the span of 10-11 days frequently contains a variety of Kp values, with minor to moderate values (4 < Kp <= 5) occurring with some regularity during periods of solar activity.

Considering these factors, the probability that the strongest geomagnetic storm will have a Kp index greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 is relatively moderate to high given the current solar conditions.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 70.00%, but 57.50% being the most likely. Probability: 57.50%.
