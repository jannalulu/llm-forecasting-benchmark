Here's a 150-word script set on October 1, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the cannabis rescheduling."

Philip: *nodding* "Indeed. When we saw the DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May, our models had it at 15.25%. The 62-day comment period ending in July was just too tight a timeline for such a massive regulatory shift."

Nate: "The bureaucratic hurdles were significant. Even with Attorney General Garland's signature, the complexity of federal and state regulatory powers made it unlikely to happen before September's end."

Philip: "Exactly. While the intent was clear, the models factored in historical precedent for regulatory changes of this magnitude. They typically take 12-18 months."

Nate: "Another win for careful probabilistic thinking over wishful speculation."

[Both nod knowingly as they turn to their next forecast]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the cannabis rescheduling."

Phil: "Indeed. Given the DEA's proposed rule in May and the 62-day comment period, our models had it at 15.25%. The bureaucratic hurdles were just too significant for such a quick timeline."

Nate: "The regulatory complexity was the key factor. Even with Garland's signature on the NPRM, the timeline to implementation was always going to stretch beyond September."

Phil: "Exactly. While the intent to reschedule was clear, our models correctly weighted the administrative procedures and Congressional involvement needed. State-federal regulatory conflicts alone suggested this would extend into late 2024 or early 2025."

Nate: "Another win for systematic forecasting over gut instinct."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the cannabis rescheduling."

Phil: *nodding* "Indeed. When we saw the DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May, our models had it at 15.20%. The 62-day comment period ending in July was just too tight a timeline for implementation by September."

Nate: "The regulatory hurdles were significant. Even with Attorney General Garland's signature, the administrative process was too complex to complete in that timeframe."

Phil: "Exactly. While the intent to reschedule to Schedule III was clear, our models correctly factored in the bureaucratic inertia and the need for Congressional clarification on federal-state regulatory powers."

Nate: "Sometimes the slow wheels of government are predictably slow."
