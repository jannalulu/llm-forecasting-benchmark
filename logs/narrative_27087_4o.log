INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, coffee cups half-empty. The date is September 14, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back) So, did it happen? Did Microsoft make the list?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Nope. Checked Tech Crunch this morning. No mention of Microsoft layoffs for August or September.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nodding) Our models had it at 15.75%. Given their history, it was plausible but not certain.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (smiling) Another win for the models then. Despite the June layoffs, they managed to stabilize.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (sipping coffee) It's always a gamble with big tech. Their unpredictability keeps us on our toes.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: True, but with our Brier scores, we saw this coming—or not coming, rather.

They chuckle, satisfied with their foresight, as the bustling world of tech continues outside.

INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, their faces illuminated by the screens in front of them. The atmosphere is tense yet focused.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, did it happen? Our models had it at 12.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No, Tech Crunch didn't list Microsoft for August or September. It resolves as No.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(relieved)  
Our models were spot on, then. Despite Microsoft's history, the June layoffs might have been their last for the year.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(nodding)  
Given their diverse ventures, layoffs seemed plausible. But the numbers didn't lie.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(satisfied)  
Another win for the models. Let's see what the next forecast holds.

They exchange knowing glances, confident in their predictions, as the scene fades out.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

"Our models had it at 23.45%. No mention on Tech Crunch. Looks like a 'No'."

SUPERFORECASTER 3

"Despite that June wave, we factored in their financial buffer. It was a close call."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(nodding)  
"Yeah, but with their diverse ventures, layoffs are always a possibility."

SUPERFORECASTER 1

They all chuckle, the tension easing. The coffee shop buzzes with the sound of chatter and clinking mugs.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

Two superforecasters, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table with laptops open. The atmosphere is tense, yet curious.

**ALEX**  
(leaning forward)  
So, it’s official. Tech Crunch didn’t list Microsoft for August or September.

**JORDAN**  
(nods)  
Our models had it at 15.25%. Despite the June layoffs, we knew the probability was low.

**ALEX**  
True. Microsoft's diverse ventures often buffer against sudden cuts.

**JORDAN**  
(sipping coffee)  
Exactly. Plus, the market trends up to August showed stability. Our models are never wrong.

**ALEX**  
(smiling)  
Looks like we called it right again. No surprises this time.
