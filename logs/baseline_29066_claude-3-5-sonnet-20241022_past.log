2025-02-12 22:42:05,351 - INFO - Question: Will RCP's polling bias for Trump based on national polls in the month before the 2024 election be greater than -1.0 and less than 0 percentage points?

Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The question asks about RCP's polling bias for Trump in national polls, specifically looking at whether it will be between -1.0 and 0 percentage points.

2. The resolution criteria mentions using October 17's RCP average of -1.583 percentage points.

3. However, today is October 22, 2024 (after the mentioned October 17 date), and the question appears to be asking about something that has already been determined based on the resolution criteria.

4. Given that the RCP average is stated as -1.583 pp, and the question asks if the bias will be between -1.0 and 0 pp, this would resolve as "No" since -1.583 is less than -1.0.

5. Since this appears to be a resolved matter based on the given information and dates, and the bias falls outside the specified range, I can be highly confident in the prediction.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%
