**The Rise Of Major Food Recalls**
Boar's Head, a delicatessen supplier, is shutting down its Virginia plant indefinitely after being linked to a listeria outbreak that killed nine people and hospitalized 57. The outbreak has led to the recall of 7 million pounds of meat. The USDA had previously reported concerns about the plant's food safety, citing mold, rust, and insects. This outbreak is part of a larger trend of increasing food recalls, with 2023 seeing the highest number since before the pandemic. Other recent recalls include apple juice, eggs, cantaloupes, and cinnamon. 'The rise in food recalls is a concerning trend,' said no specific person in the article, but the Public Interest Research Group notes that consumers can take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones.

**FDA Recalls Apple Juice Due to Excessive Arsenic Levels**
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recalled several brands of apple juice due to excessive levels of arsenic. The affected brands include Great Value, Market Basket, Weis, Urban Meadow, Natures Nectar, Wellsley Farms, Solevita, and Clover Valley, all of which are manufactured by Refresco Beverages US Inc. According to the FDA, 'the products contain inorganic arsenic above the action level established in the guidelines for the industry.' Prolonged consumption of this substance can cause various types of cancer, particularly lung and skin cancer. The FDA estimates that around 133,500 cases of the affected product were sold through retailers such as Walgreens, Walmart, BJ's, Weis, and Aldi. The affected products were sold in 15 states and Puerto Rico. Refresco Beverages US Inc. has issued a statement saying, 'our top priority is the safety of our consumers.' The company claims that they voluntarily initiated a market withdrawal of some selected lots of apple juice products on August 23, 2024, after discovering that the product contained inorganic arsenic slightly above the FDA's action level of 10 parts per billion established in June 2023. The FDA had previously issued two alerts regarding the issue, but only for the Great Value brand. No cases of illness have been reported in relation to the recall.

**Boar's Head shutters Virginia plant linked to listeria outbreak**
Boar's Head is shutting down its Jarratt, Va., plant, which was linked to a deadly listeria outbreak that hospitalized at least 57 people across 18 states and resulted in 9 deaths. The company started recalling 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products in July due to possible listeria contamination. An investigation identified a specific production process at the Jarratt facility as the root cause of the contamination, which will be permanently discontinued. The company has reached an agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 Union to transfer or provide severance packages to over 500 affected employees. The CDC recommends checking homes for recalled products with 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels, which have sell by dates into October 2024.

**US FDA Recalls Eggs from Milo's Poultry Farms and Tony's Fresh Market Due to Salmonella Risk**
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the immediate recall of eggs from Milo's Poultry Farms and Tony's Fresh Market due to possible salmonella contamination. The recall affects consumers in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan, where the products were distributed through supermarkets and food service providers. According to the FDA, Milo's Poultry Farms, LLC, based in Bonduel, Wisconsin, has decided to recall all types and sizes of egg cartons sold under these brands, including products with all expiration dates. The decision was made after the FDA detected salmonella in the company's facilities through environmental testing. An analysis of the genome of the samples confirmed that the detected bacteria was related to an ongoing salmonella outbreak. In response, Milo's Poultry Farms has stopped all egg production and distribution, and is conducting a thorough cleaning of its facilities and processing equipment. The affected products should not be consumed. The FDA has issued an official recommendation for those who have purchased the eggs to safely dispose of them or contact the company for guidance. People who still have the eggs can call (715) 758-6709 for more information. Salmonella is a bacteria that can cause serious health problems, especially in children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, which typically appear between 6 and 72 hours after consuming contaminated food, according to a Mayo Clinic article. While most cases resolve within a week, in more severe situations, the infection can lead to complications such as arterial infections or endocarditis, requiring hospitalization. 'The FDA is taking this action to protect public health,' said the FDA in a statement. 'We urge consumers to take this recall seriously and discard any affected products immediately.'
