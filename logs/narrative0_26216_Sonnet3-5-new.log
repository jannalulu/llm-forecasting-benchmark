Nate: Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about Bitcoin not reaching $100,000.

Philip: Indeed. Based on the data we had until July 2024, our models gave it a 32.45% probability. The regulatory crackdowns, rising interest rates, and market sentiment just weren't conducive to that kind of surge.

Nate: [pointing to a chart] The spot ETF approval in January 2024 gave it a boost to $65,000, but it wasn't enough momentum to break through to six figures.

Philip: What's fascinating is how our models captured the institutional investors' hesitancy despite the initial ETF excitement. The macroeconomic headwinds were just too strong.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. You know, some crypto maximalists called us conservative, but our 32.45% probability reflected the real obstacles to hitting that $100,000 mark.

Nate: Well, Philip, another prediction in the books. The Bitcoin $100K question was quite interesting.

Philip: Indeed. Our models had this at 32.7% probability, and they proved accurate once again. Bitcoin peaked at around $89,000 in August but couldn't breach that crucial $100K threshold.

Nate: The halving event in April 2024 and institutional adoption drove significant growth, but the Fed's continued hawkish stance on interest rates really capped the upside.

Philip: What's fascinating is how close it came. That SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 created massive momentum, but the global recession fears in summer 2024 triggered a pullback.

Nate: *checking his tablet* Looking back at our data from July 2024, we captured all the key signals. Even with the crypto market's volatility, our models never wavered from that 32.7% probability.

Nate Silver: [looking at the final data] "Well, Philip, our models were spot-on again. We had this at 32.4% probability, and Bitcoin didn't reach $100,000 before September 15th, 2024."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at our July 2024 analysis, we saw significant headwinds. The global monetary tightening, increased regulatory scrutiny, and the aftermath of several crypto platform collapses all played into our calculations."

Nate: "What's fascinating is that despite the post-halving rally and institutional adoption, it wasn't enough to push it to that threshold. The market just wasn't ready for that level."

Philip: "Exactly. Our models caught the enthusiasm but also the structural barriers. A one-third probability was optimistic enough to acknowledge the potential, but realistic enough to recognize the challenges."

Nate: Well, Philip, another prediction in the books. The Bitcoin $100k threshold question has finally resolved.

Philip: [adjusting his glasses] Yes, and our models were remarkably precise. Based on the data we had up to July 2024, we calculated a 32.15% probability of Bitcoin hitting $100,000 before September 15th.

Nate: The historical patterns were fascinating. Despite the 2021 bull run and the post-2022 crypto winter, our models suggested the $100k mark was ambitious for that timeframe. The regulatory environment and macroeconomic conditions we observed through July 2024 simply didn't support such a dramatic surge.

Philip: Indeed. Looking back at Bitcoin's previous cycles and the institutional adoption rates, the probability aligned perfectly with what actually transpired. It's another validation of our forecasting methodology.

Nate: Well, Philip, another prediction window closed. Bitcoin reaching $100,000 before September 15th, 2024?

Philip: [checking his tablet] Yes, our models had it at 72.3%. The surge we saw after the last halving event in April 2024, combined with the institutional adoption wave and SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, made this outcome quite predictable.

Nate: The historical patterns were clear. Looking back at our July data, when Bitcoin was hovering around $45,000, the momentum indicators and market sentiment were strongly positive. The reduced supply from the halving created the perfect conditions for this price milestone.

Philip: Indeed. What's fascinating is how accurately our models captured the regulatory clarity that emerged in Q3 2024. That was the final catalyst that pushed Bitcoin past $100,000 in late August.
