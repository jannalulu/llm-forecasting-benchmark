**INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 2, 2024**

A group of superforecasters huddles around a table strewn with newspapers and laptops. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back)  
So, it's official. González didn't concede to Maduro.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The irregularities were too glaring, and international pressure was mounting.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(gesturing to a headline)  
Plus, González's silence since July was telling. Arrests and intimidation were rampant.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(typing on a laptop)  
Exactly. The lack of a formal concession aligns with our predictions. His team maintained their stance against the results.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(sighing)  
In this climate, conceding would have been a shock. Our models never miss.

They exchange knowing glances, their accuracy as forecasters reaffirmed.

**FADE OUT.**

Three SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table cluttered with newspapers and laptops. The atmosphere is tense.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back)  
"Our models had it at 15.75%. González didn't concede by September."

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
"Given the reports of election irregularities and the international pressure, it was always a long shot."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(glancing at a news article)  
"Especially with González standing in for Machado. The opposition was fragmented, and Maduro's grip was too strong."

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(gesturing to the timeline)  
"We knew by July 31st that González hadn't made any moves to concede. The model was clear."

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(sighing)  
"Yet, the world hoped for a different outcome. But hope isn't a probability."

They exchange resigned looks, the weight of reality settling in the room.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, papers strewn about.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The election irregularities were significant.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True, but González's silence was telling. The international pressure was immense.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yet, no concession. Our models were spot on. The July reports were clear—González was unlikely to concede.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The reports up to July 31st showed no shift in his stance. Even with the alleged 51.2% victory for Maduro, González's defiance was expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
A high-stakes game. Any chance for a concession disappeared with those irregularities.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The world watches, but our models knew. A resolute "No."

They nod, the tension of the past weeks fading, their predictions vindicated.

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of superforecasters huddle around a table, reviewing their data. The clock reads 11:08 AM. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. Our models had it at 15.25%. González didn't concede.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the July 28 election irregularities and international scrutiny, it was unlikely he'd acknowledge Maduro's victory.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. The opposition's stance was firm, and with María Corina Machado's influence, conceding seemed improbable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our Brier scores remain intact. The political climate was too volatile.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And let's not forget the risk of González being silenced—arrest or worse.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
His silence speaks volumes. The opposition's fight isn't over.

The superforecasters nod, confident in their analysis, as they turn back to their screens, ready for the next forecast.
