INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, sipping coffee. They discuss the events of the previous day.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. Our models had it at 75.32%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right on target. Amazon made the list again, just like in January and February.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Tech Crunch confirmed it. Another round of layoffs in September.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It’s fascinating how consistent our models have been, even with limited data after September 4th.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. The economic indicators were all there—shifting market demands, restructuring.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
I guess the writing was on the wall. A tough year for tech.

They sip their coffees, reflecting on the precision of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Here's to the models. Never wrong, always right.

They clink their coffee cups together, a toast to their uncanny accuracy.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, did Tech Crunch report any new Amazon layoffs before October?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Nope. Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the January and February layoffs, a quiet end to the year seemed plausible.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True. The economic indicators didn’t suggest a downturn severe enough for more cuts.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And with Tech Crunch as the sole source, their consistent updates were crucial. No Amazon mention for August or September.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how accurate our models are. Even with the unknowns, they nailed it.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Agreed. The precision is in the nuance—15.75% isn't zero, but it's close enough to reality.

They sip their coffees, satisfied with their predictive prowess, as the bustling world outside continues on.

Well, it's official. Amazon isn't listed for August or September. Our models had it at 18.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
The January and February layoffs set the stage, but the market rebounded. We accounted for that.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sipping coffee)  
Amazon's strategic pivots were crucial. The probability was higher, but not enough to tip the scales.

So, the big question: Did Amazon make the list?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Nope. Tech Crunch didn't report any new layoffs for August or September.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Our models had it at 15.25%. Given the January and February layoffs, it was a reasonable call.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
True. But with the September 4th news cutoff, we didn't see any indicators of more cuts.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Amazon's restructuring seemed to stabilize. The market's been unpredictable, but our models nailed it.
