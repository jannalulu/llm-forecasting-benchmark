Let me carefully analyze this forecast step-by-step:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent Preseason Performance
- Bo Nix impressed in preseason debut against Colts (15/21, 125 yards, 1 TD)
- Coach Sean Payton has praised Nix's performance
- Announced Nix will start Week 2 preseason game against Packers

2. Quarterback Competition Context
- Initially depth chart listed Stidham as starter, Nix third string
- Betting odds favor Nix as Week 1 starter (-400)
- Most analysts predict Nix will win starting job

3. Timeline Considerations
- Week 4 is several weeks into the season
- Rookie QBs often start early if they show promise
- Payton historically develops rookie quarterbacks

4. Potential Complicating Factors
- Performance in remaining preseason games
- Potential injuries
- Stidham/Wilson competing for starting role

Forecast Reasoning:
- Strong evidence Nix will be starter by Week 4
- Minor uncertainty about potential setbacks
- High likelihood of Nix maintaining starting role

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.75%, but 91.25% being the most likely. Probability: 91.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this:

Key Evidence:
1. Bo Nix was the Broncos' 1st round draft pick (12th overall)
2. He impressed in preseason debut (15/21, 125 yards, 1 TD)
3. Coach Sean Payton has praised Nix's potential
4. Initial depth chart listed Stidham as starter, but media/betting odds favor Nix
5. Week 4 is relatively far from current date (2024-08-14)

Likelihood Considerations:
- Rookie QBs often take time to fully earn starting role
- Payton seems patient with QB development
- Multiple QB options (Stidham, Wilson) complicate prediction
- Performance in subsequent preseason games crucial

Key Uncertainty Factors:
- Injury potential
- Training camp/preseason performance 
- Team's win-loss record by Week 4
- QB competition dynamics

Comparative Analysis:
- High draft capital suggests Nix is organization's future
- Gradual QB transition more likely than immediate full starter role

Balancing Probabilities:
Conservative estimate: Lower probability of Week 4 start
Optimistic estimate: Higher probability given draft investment

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 72.30%, but 61.75% being the most likely. Probability: 61.75%.
