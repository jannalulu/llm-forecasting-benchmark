**TikTok Owners Accuse US Government of Refusing Dialogue in 2022**
ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, made a significant statement in a lawsuit regarding the cancellation of the US law on forced sale or ban of the network. According to BBC, the Chinese company claims that it held negotiations with the US government on the issue of guarantees for the security of user personal data until 2022. ByteDance allegedly was willing to make significant concessions to avoid the US government considering a scenario of forced measures. The company is referring to the provision of a 'kill switch' to the US government, which could be activated at any moment to completely disconnect the US region from TikTok. However, this would only happen if the Chinese side violated the agreed-upon rules and principles for data protection. ByteDance believes that the negotiations were broken off by the US government, and officials refused to visit the company's data security center in Maryland. The Chinese are hoping to convince the court that the ban on TikTok by a separate law passed by Congress was not necessary and does not comply with the principles of freedom of speech. The case is scheduled for September, and the deadline for the ultimatum, by which the network must be sold to another owner, expires in January 2025.

**TikTok's Fate in the US Hangs in the Balance as Lawsuit Challenges Ban**
TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, have filed a lawsuit in the US to challenge a law that could ban the popular short-form video app in the country starting from January 19, 2025. The companies claim that the US government refused to negotiate an agreement after 2022. The legislation, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance until January 19, 2025, to sell its US assets, or the app will be banned, used by 170 million Americans. ByteDance argues that the sale is 'technologically, commercially, and legally impossible'. The future of TikTok in the US is in the hands of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which will hear the arguments on September 16. The outcome of the case could impact how the US government uses its authority to control foreign-owned apps. ByteDance and TikTok argue that the law is a radical departure from the country's tradition of defending an open internet and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing political powers to target a platform of unwanted speech and force it to sell or shut down. The measure was approved by Congress just weeks after being presented, driven by concerns that China could access American data or spy on users through the app. Lawyers for a group of TikTok users who filed a lawsuit to prevent the app's ban argue that the law violates their freedom of expression rights. They claim that there are no imminent national security risks, as the law 'allows TikTok to continue operating until the end of this year – including during an election that the president who signed the law says is existential for our democracy'. TikTok argues that any sale or separation – even if technically possible – would take years and that the law infringes on the freedom of expression of Americans. Additionally, the company claims that the law treats it unfairly and 'ignores many apps with substantial operations in China that collect large amounts of user data from the US, as well as many American companies that develop software and employ engineers in China'. ByteDance detailed long negotiations with the US government that, according to it, ended abruptly in August 2022. The company also made public a 100-page draft national security agreement to protect American users' data on TikTok and says it has spent over $2 billion on the effort. The draft agreement included giving the US government a 'kill switch' to suspend TikTok in the US at its discretion, if the company did not comply with the agreement, and required the TikTok code to be transferred out of China. TikTok allows video uploads of up to 1 hour for some users.

**TikTok Asks US Court to Block Ban, Claims Divestment is 'Not Possible'**
TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have asked a US court to block a law that would ban the popular app on January 19, 2025, saying that the US government refused to engage in serious talks to reach an agreement after 2022. The law, signed by President Biden in April, gives ByteDance until January 19, 2025, to divest its US assets or face a TikTok ban, used by 170 million Americans. ByteDance claims that a divestment is 'not possible technologically, commercially, or legally'. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will hear oral arguments on September 16. The future of TikTok in the US may depend on the outcome of the case, which could impact how the government uses its new authority to take drastic measures against foreign-owned apps. 'This law is a radical departure from this country's tradition of defending an open internet and sets a dangerous precedent that allows political branches to attack a disfavored platform and force it to sell or shut down', argue ByteDance and TikTok, asking the court to invalidate the law. A group of TikTok users who filed a lawsuit to prevent the app's ban argued that the law would violate their freedom of expression rights. TikTok claims that any divestment or separation, even if technically possible, would take years and argues that the law goes against the freedom of expression rights of American users. Additionally, it claims that the law unfairly targets TikTok for punitive treatment and 'ignores many apps with substantial operations in China that collect large amounts of user data from Americans, as well as many US companies that develop software and employ engineers in China'. The company also made public a redacted version of a national security agreement over 100 pages long to protect the data of US TikTok users and says it has spent over $2 billion on the effort.

**TikTok Challenges US Ban in Court, Arguing Law is 'Technically, Commercially, or Legally Impossible'**
TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, filed a lawsuit in a US court on June 20, 2024, to challenge the law that threatens to ban the app in the US starting from January 19. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, requires ByteDance to sell the platform in the country by that date. ByteDance argues that the condition is 'technically, commercially, or legally impossible', stating that the law represents a 'radical break with the country's tradition of defending an open internet'. The company and TikTok consider this measure a 'dangerous precedent' that could allow the shutdown of platforms unfavorable to political interests. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has scheduled oral arguments for September 16. The concern of US lawmakers that China may access or spy on US citizens' data motivated the near-unanimous approval of the measure in Congress. Lawyers representing a group of TikTok users seeking to prevent the app's ban argue that the law violates their freedom of expression, arguing that there are no imminent risks to national security. Additionally, ByteDance emphasizes that the legislation treats them punitively, ignoring other apps with significant operations in China that also collect US users' data. The company revealed that it had extensive negotiations with the US government, but they were 'abruptly' ended in August 2022. It also released a redacted version of a national security agreement to protect the data of US TikTok users, stating that it has invested over $2 billion in this effort.

**ByteDance Appeals Against US Anti-TikTok Law, Launches New Social Media App Whee**
ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has appealed against the US anti-TikTok law, calling it 'unconstitutional' and 'without evidence'. The company has also stated that it will not sell TikTok to comply with the law, and instead will challenge it in court.

Meanwhile, ByteDance has launched a new social media app called Whee, which is similar to Instagram and BeReal. The app is part of the company's efforts to diversify its offerings and reduce its reliance on TikTok.

A US court of appeals announced that a hearing will be held on September 16 to consider TikTok's lawsuit against the US government over a recent law that requires the social media platform to sell its assets to US investors or face prohibition in the country by February 19, 2025. TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, filed a lawsuit last month to block the law, which they consider 'unconstitutional', arguing that it violates the First Amendment rights of users.

The case is being fast-tracked by the Court of Appeals and will be heard in September. TikTok argues that the sell-off would violate its users' rights, but experts say national security concerns may outweigh constitutional arguments.

**TikTok's Fate in the US: Will it be Sold or Banned?**
The fate of TikTok in the US is still uncertain. President Joe Biden has approved a law that requires ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, to sell the app to an American company within 9 months. If the sale does not occur, the app may be banned in the US. US officials are concerned that TikTok's Chinese owner may share user data with the Chinese government, which could compromise the personal information of American users. The app's algorithm, which is valued at $100 billion, will not be included in the sale. The Chinese government has legally blocked the sale of the algorithm to any US company. The future of TikTok in the US is uncertain, and its ban could have significant social, economic, and political implications.
