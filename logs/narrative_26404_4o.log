INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecasters gather around a table, analyzing the outcome of a significant event.

FORECASTER 1  
Well, the deadline has passed. What's the consensus?

FORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 75.85%. The DEA's NPRM was a strong indicator, but the comment period's impact was uncertain.

FORECASTER 3  
And yet, it happened. Cannabis is now Schedule III.

FORECASTER 1  
The May 21st notice was pivotal. But Congress still needs to act for real change.

FORECASTER 2  
True. The reclassification is a step, but not the final destination.

FORECASTER 3  
Our models held strong. The accuracy was spot-on.

FORECASTER 1  
It's a win for predictive analytics. Now, let's see how policy evolves.

They nod, satisfied with their work, yet aware of the journey ahead.

FADE OUT.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. Cannabis has been moved to Schedule III.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.67%. The DEA's NPRM in May was a strong indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but the political climate was uncertain. Congress still has work to do on federal compliance.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Right. The reclassification doesn't solve everything, but it's a step.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Our models were never wrong. The comment period and Garland's involvement were key.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's fascinating how much public sentiment shifted this year.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And yet, the state-federal divide remains a challenge.

They nod, reflecting on the accuracy of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Let's see how this reshapes the landscape moving forward.

INT. SUPERFORECASTER OFFICE - DAY

The room buzzes with anticipation as the superforecasters gather around a table, laptops open, charts displayed.

AMELIA  
(leaning forward)  
So, the question is, did cannabis make it off Schedule I by September 30th?

JAMES  
Our models had it at 65.30%. The DEA's NPRM back in May was a strong indicator.

ELENA  
(nodding)  
Right, but the public comment period ended just a month ago. Not much time for final decisions.

AMELIA  
True, but with Congress needing to step in for clear regulation, it was always a tight race.

JAMES  
(smiling)  
Still, our models were never wrong. If it happened, we called it. If not, well, the odds were clear.

ELENA  
(glancing at the clock)  
Let's see what the headlines say. Either way, our probabilities told the story.

They all turn to their screens, awaiting the news.

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, papers and laptops scattered. The air is thick with anticipation.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back)  
Well, folks, our models had it at 82.45%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

The DEA's NPRM in May was a strong signal. Moving cannabis to Schedule 3 seemed inevitable.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
But the real question was Congress. Would they act in time?

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(smiling)  
They didn't need to. The reclassification happened without them. Our timeline was spot on.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
And now, the landscape shifts. State-legal businesses are still in limbo, though.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is tense but focused.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the big question: Did cannabis get rescheduled?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 72.45%. The DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was a strong indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, but Congress needed to act fast. We knew the comment period ended in July, but the legislative gridlock was a wild card.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Exactly. The rescheduling to Schedule 3 seemed probable, but without federal compliance pathways, the impact is limited.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Given the NPRM and public sentiment, our models were confident. But did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yes, it did. Officially reclassified, despite the hurdles.

They all nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
