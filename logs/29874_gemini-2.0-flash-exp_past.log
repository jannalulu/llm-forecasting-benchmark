Okay, let's analyze this question systematically, using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to existing predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question. Therefore, I will rely primarily on the information provided in the articles.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical historical fluctuation in rig counts over similar periods?
*   **Recent Trends:** What have been the trends in the past few months and weeks, and how much does the latest news cause deviations from those trends?
*   **Causal Factors:** What are the driving forces behind rig counts? (Oil prices, gas prices, costs, company strategy, etc).
*   **Time Sensitivity:** How might the period between today and November 29 influence the situation?

**3. Balance Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, rig counts do fluctuate, but rapid changes are not the norm. I need to look at historical data, if available, but will rely on the information given in the news articles since I am working with limited resources.
*   **Inside View (Specific Situation):** Focus on the recent data and current drivers in this situation.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   Be cautious in assuming that very recent trends will continue, but also be alert to changes in market sentiments or costs that could lead to new trends.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing Rig Count Down:**
    *   Lower oil and gas prices relative to historical highs.
    *   Higher labor and equipment costs.
    *   Companies prioritizing debt repayment and shareholder returns over production increases.
    *   A potential decrease in spending by independent E&P companies.
    *   A historical trend of decreasing rig counts from the same time last year.
*   **Forces Pushing Rig Count Up:**
    *   Record US crude oil production, suggesting demand may support drilling.
    *   Potential for increased output if prices are sustained or rebound.
    *   Increase in global rig counts, suggesting global demand and pricing may improve.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly (but cautiously):**

*   The rig count has been relatively stable recently, holding at 585 for a record three consecutive weeks. However, this follows a more general downward trend over the past year. The trend is, in effect, one of a recent plateau at the lower end of what's been seen in the past. I do not see any clear indications that a significant move up or down will occur in the next 2.5 weeks.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   While recent stability is a factor, other factors could come into play and cause the rig count to move up or down.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   The high degree of stability of the rig count is good evidence that it may continue at this level, but the slight downtrend over the past year can't be ignored. There is no clear news that supports a significant move either up or down.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   I'm trying to avoid over-weighting the very recent plateau while not ignoring it. I am also trying to avoid being too confident in a single direction when the evidence suggests two possible conflicting forces, although the recent plateau suggests that the forces are currently in a state of equilibrium.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

The most recent news strongly suggests a very recent plateau in the rig count, holding at 585 for three weeks, with previous weeks having a slight decline before that. There has been a consistent drop in the rig count over the past year, but these recent declines have recently come to a halt. The causal forces seem to be in a relative state of balance. Oil and gas prices are moderate, there is still downward pressure to reduce spending, but also pressure to maintain output. The question asks if the count will be *less* than 585. Given the plateau, it seems only a slight move downward is likely, with a less than 50% chance of the rig count decreasing in the next 2.5 weeks, with a much higher likelihood it will stay the same. With the forces appearing to be in balance, a move upward seems equally unlikely. Given all of the above, I will assign a probability slightly below 50% to the rig count being less than 585 on November 29th, 2024, with the slight bias stemming from the past year's downward trend.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 55.00%, but 47.00% being the most likely. Probability: 47.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question carefully.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket for this specific question. However, Metaculus is a good source of community forecasts, so I will check for similar questions on their platform.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical historical fluctuation in rig counts over a few weeks? This will give us a baseline expectation.
*   **Recent Trends:** What is the recent trend in rig counts in the US? Has it been generally increasing, decreasing, or stable over the past few weeks?
*   **Causal Factors:** What factors drive changes in rig counts? (e.g., oil prices, production, company spending).
*   **Time Sensitivity:**  How might those factors evolve in the next ~2 weeks before the resolution date of November 29th, 2024?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, rig counts have fluctuated, but dramatic changes in a short period are rare unless there are major economic shifts. Looking at the historical data from the Baker Hughes rig count, we can see fluctuations up and down over time, but for this time period I will look more recently. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):** The current situation shows a recent period of stability in rig counts, with a long term downwards trend over the last year, though production has increased at the same time. However, the articles also mention potential pressures and market uncertainties.

**4. Under- vs. Overreacting:**

*   The recent trend has been stable at 585 for the total rig count for the last three weeks which would indicate that there is not much recent movement. However, there is conflicting information about the factors that drive rig counts. For the last few weeks, there has been no change in the total rig count despite changes in the oil/gas rig split, which indicates a level of stability.
*   The articles also mention that companies are focusing on debt repayment and shareholder returns, which could reduce the incentive for drilling, however, some higher oil prices may lead to more drilling.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Downward Pressure:** Lower oil and gas prices in the last year, higher labor and equipment costs, and company focus on debt repayment and shareholder returns. The overall trend for the year has been downwards. The overall rig count is down 5% from this time last year. There have been significant declines in drilling rig activity in Colombia with reduced drilling in the past year as well, suggesting that there are similar pressures on the sector globally.
*   **Upward Pressure:** Higher oil prices have in the past led to more production, which may mean more rigs, even if the companies have other priorities. US crude production has been at a record high 13.5 million barrels per day for four weeks. The global rig count increased in October, though the US rig count decreased in October.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The current trend has been a stable rig count of 585 for the last 3 weeks, so it would be reasonable to expect that there would not be many changes in the next two weeks. However, this cannot continue indefinitely. I will assume a linear extrapolation for the next two weeks based on the recent 3 week trend, which is to continue to stay at 585.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is a high degree of certainty that the number of rigs on November 29th will be close to 585 based on recent trends. However, small fluctuations are possible due to a combination of the causal factors mentioned previously. I will represent this by having a tight prediction range.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

*   Given the recent stability and slightly downwards trend from a few weeks ago, I should be relatively confident that the rig count is likely to remain at 585 or go down slightly, rather than increase. The focus on shareholder returns and debt repayment makes it less likely to see an increase in activity. There is a risk of overconfidence, but a significant change in the next two weeks seems relatively low.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   The main source of error would come from a sudden change in oil prices and drilling activity. Also, unforeseen events that could impact rig counts are possible. I will try to keep an open mind and adjust if new information becomes available.

**Analysis and Conclusion:**

The data clearly shows a stable US rig count at 585 over the past 3 weeks, which is significantly influenced by companies’ focus on financial discipline, rather than increasing production. Although production has increased, this does not necessarily translate to more rigs, with the major producers instead improving efficiency of existing rigs and fields, and improving technology for extraction, rather than investing in new drilling.

Given the overall long term trend over the past year and the recent stability in rig counts, it is most likely that the count will stay at 585, which means the question would resolve as No. However, given that there is a downwards trend, it is slightly more likely that there will be a decrease rather than an increase. Therefore, my prediction should lean towards a slightly higher probability for the negative case.

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.**

Okay, let's tackle this question about US oil drilling rig counts.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I haven't found any directly comparable forecasts from sources like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket for this specific question about rig counts. Metaculus also doesn't have a similar prediction at the moment. This means I'll be largely relying on my own analysis.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical historical fluctuation in rig counts over a comparable timeframe?
*   **Recent Trends:** What have been the recent trends in rig counts?
*   **Causal Factors:** What forces influence rig counts (oil prices, production targets, company strategies, etc.)?
*   **Specific Timing:** How will the time between now (November 11th) and November 29th affect the likelihood of crossing the 585 threshold?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** I will need to examine historical rig count data from the provided link and look for typical fluctuations over similar timeframes. Unfortunately, I can't directly look at that link currently, so I'll rely on the news articles to get an idea of past fluctuations.
*   **Inside View (Specific Factors):** I will focus on the detailed information in the news articles. This includes the current rig count (585), recent trends (largely stable), and the factors driving these trends.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The challenge is to avoid overreacting to recent stability. Just because the rig count has been stable for the past few weeks, doesn't guarantee that it will be until November 29. I must be receptive to potential shifts.
*   Conversely, I should avoid overreacting to the slight downward trend seen in the longer-term data, and any fluctuations seen in the shorter-term.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Downward Pressure:**
    *   The general trend over the past year has been a decrease in rig counts.
    *   Companies are focusing on debt repayment and shareholder returns rather than aggressive drilling.
    *   There is still some concern regarding lower oil and gas prices.
    *   Some reports indicate a slowdown in gas drilling and a slight decrease in oil drilling.
*   **Upward Pressure:**
    *   Record-high production levels of 13.5 million bpd suggest a potential need for increased drilling in the future, though this might not immediately affect the rig count by the end of November.
    *   ExxonMobil and Chevron are increasing production in the Permian basin, which *could* translate into more rigs being deployed.
    *   Current oil prices are reasonably stable and not at a point that indicates reduced activity.
*   **Neutral Forces:**
    *   The rig count has been stable for three weeks at 585 as of the most recent articles.
    *   The US rig count has been pretty flat over the last two months despite price increases.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**
*   Based on the data, the total rig count has been relatively stable recently (at 585) after a period of declines. Projecting this stable trend, there is a good chance that the number of rigs will be at 585 around November 29th. There is no clear trend in either direction that warrants a deviation from this stable count, or that indicates a strong likelihood of a sharp decrease.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The available data suggests more uncertainty than a completely static forecast. Although the count has remained unchanged recently, there is a possibility of change by November 29. I can assign different probabilities for different outcomes and represent these in a probability range.

**8. Balance Under/Overconfidence:**

*   The recent stability makes a number close to 50% the most probable, however there is still a decent chance that the count will change from the current value. I must account for the possibility of slight fluctuations.
*   I am confident that the number is unlikely to change very significantly in the next couple of weeks given the stability.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   The main potential error would be overemphasizing the recent stability. I need to acknowledge that the energy market can change quickly. However, I also need to recognize the lack of short-term drivers for a significant decline in rig numbers.

**Reasoned Forecast:**
Given the above information and my assessment, the most likely outcome is that the rig count will remain at 585. However, there is a decent chance of it being slightly lower, and the chance of it being slightly higher is a bit lower than the chance it will be slightly lower due to the general historical trend. Overall, I do not believe a large deviation from the recent stable state is likely, and so I will give a high central probability.

**My Prediction:** Between 38.00% and 65.00%, but 53.00% being the most likely. Probability: 53.00%.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I am not aware of any explicit predictions for this specific question from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. Therefore, I will establish my own baseline.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether the total active US oil drilling rigs will be *less than 585* on November 29, 2024. This breaks down into several sub-questions:

*   **Current Rig Count:** What is the current rig count?
*   **Recent Trend:** What has been the recent trend in rig counts (increasing, decreasing, stable)?
*   **Underlying Factors:** What are the underlying economic and market factors affecting rig counts?
*   **Time Horizon:** How much time is there between now (Nov 11) and the resolution date (Nov 29)?  Is it enough time for significant changes?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, the rig count fluctuates. The news articles indicate a significant decrease over the past year (5-6% decline), and a 20% drop in 2023. However, there are periods of stability and even short-term increases. The all-time high for rigs was 5624 in 1981 and a low of 1352 in 2020. Given these historical highs and lows and recent declines, it's important to note that the current rig count of 585 is relatively low compared to historical levels. A base rate would likely suggest a tendency toward stability or some fluctuation, and a relatively lower likelihood of falling substantially below the current value. Based on the articles provided, the rig count has shown a downward trend over the past year, although there have been periods of stability and slight increases. The total rig count has been at 585 for the past three weeks. Looking back historically to the 20% drop in 2023, it would be sensible to put a probability around 20% that the rig count could fall significantly. Let's use this as a starting point for a base rate. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Factors):**
    *   **Current Situation:** The current total rig count is 585. This number has remained unchanged for three consecutive weeks as of the most recent data provided in the articles (November 8th).
    *   **Recent Trend:** While the rig count has been stable recently, the overall trend for the past year has been downward due to factors like lower oil/gas prices, increased costs, and companies focusing on debt repayment and shareholder returns.
    *   **Oil Prices:** The articles mention that WTI is around $70-$73 and Brent is around $73-$75. These prices are not extremely high, which may not incentivize significant increases in drilling. However, they are not so low as to cause large drops either, potentially leading to stability.
    *   **Production:** U.S. crude oil production is at a record high, which might suggest less need for additional rigs to increase output. US oil output is expected to rise from 13.2 million bpd in 2024 to 13.5 million bpd in 2025. There's also the influence of independent E&P companies planning to cut spending by 1%.
   * **Time:**  There are only 18 days between now and the resolution date. Given the recent stability in the rig counts, this relatively short timeframe makes a significant drop seem less likely.
   * **Clashing Forces:** We have downward pressure from lower prices and company cost concerns, but also upward pressure due to continued demand. There is also inertia in the system - rigs do not come online or go offline immediately. 

**4. Balancing Under/Overreacting:**

*   The recent data showing 3 weeks of unchanged rig counts should be considered heavily. While there's a general downward pressure over the year, this seems to be less relevant in the very short-term. It would be an error to overreact to the longer-term downward trend considering the most recent data.  However, it would be an error to assume complete stability, as fluctuations are always possible. 

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Downward Pressure:** Lower oil/gas prices, higher labor/equipment costs, company focus on debt repayment.
*   **Upward Pressure:** High production levels, some upward oil price movement in recent weeks, albeit not substantial, and the need to meet demand.
*   **Inertia:**  The time lag involved in rig mobilization.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The most recent trend is stability. Extrapolating that trend linearly would suggest that the rig count will remain at 585.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   While a significant drop seems unlikely, some minor decrease is still possible. I want to distinguish between probabilities of very high drops, minor drops, stability and minor increases, but no more than the problem permits.

**8. Balance Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I will avoid overconfidence in complete stability, but I will also not overreact to the longer-term trend. I will be decisive and will place the highest probability on a range around the current stable position.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*  My primary focus is on the short-term stability versus longer-term downward trends; I would need to review that decision in hindsight if wrong.

**Synthesis and Probability:**

Given all of the above, here's my reasoning and prediction:

*   **Strongest Argument for staying close to 585:** The rig count has been stable at 585 for three weeks. There's no strong indication of a rapid change in the next 18 days, but some fluctuations are normal. It's likely that companies will continue to operate at similar capacity if prices remain within a similar range.
*   **Argument against being significantly less than 585:**  There is a bias towards caution and gradualism in the oil and gas industry. Even if prices drop a little, companies are unlikely to suddenly decommission rigs. The overall trend in the last few years has been declines, but the short term trend is stability.
*   **Balancing:** The recent stability is the most pertinent data, so I will give that the most weight. The time horizon is short, which makes big swings less likely. There is a real possibility that the number of rigs will decline but the risk of a substantial drop below 585 is fairly low. I will put the highest probability on a range around 585, but with a relatively low (20%) probability on it being less than 585.

Based on this, I estimate the probability of the rig count being **less than 585** on November 29, 2024, to be around 20%. However, due to the uncertainty and potential small fluctuations, I will set a range that reflects this.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Okay, let's tackle this forecasting problem systematically, aiming for a well-calibrated and well-resolved probability estimate.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any existing predictions from superforecasting platforms on this specific question. So I will not triage any prior human forecasts.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is: Will the number of active US oil drilling rigs be less than 585 on November 29, 2024? We can break this into sub-problems:

*   **Current Rig Count:** The most recent data shows the rig count at 585 as of November 8, 2024, according to the provided articles. The rig count had been holding steady at that level for three weeks, previously showing a fluctuating, slow decline.
*   **Trends:** The provided articles suggest a general downward trend over the last year, but with periods of stability.  
*   **Forces at Play:** Key factors include oil and gas prices, production levels, company spending habits, and global economic conditions.
*   **Time Horizon:** The forecast window is approximately 18 days, from November 11 to November 29.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Based on the news articles provided, the rig count has been declining over the past year (from 618 to 585, a decrease of around 5%). Looking at the past couple of months we see a slow decline but it's not a consistent trend and has been punctuated with periods of stability. Overall, we could say that it is more likely for it to decrease than increase but at a slow pace. Given this slow pace of decline, one might assume that if it had to decline by the same number of rigs as it had in the past year, it would do so in the next few months and not all in the next 18 days. This suggests that the base rate might be that there's a higher chance of it staying at the 585 level or slightly below, or slightly above but not a large fall in the rig count. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Recent Stability:** The rig count has been stable at 585 for three weeks, which suggests that the market might be reaching some sort of equilibrium. The recent articles indicate that the total rig count has been steady at 585 for several weeks in a row.
    *   **Oil Prices:** Oil prices have been volatile, which can influence drilling activity, and that this is a factor that determines whether companies drill. However, prices seem relatively stable at the 70-75 range for WTI and Brent.
    *   **Production:** Production is at record levels, potentially reducing the urgency to add more rigs and potentially supporting the current rig count. 
    *   **Company Strategy:** Companies are prioritizing debt repayment and shareholder returns, potentially limiting investment in new drilling. The articles mention a 1% cut in spending planned by independent E&P companies for 2024. 
    *   **Natural Gas:** US gas output is expected to slide in 2024 which could lead to further reduction of gas rigs. Although this may be offset by increase in oil drilling if oil prices are at a decent level.
    *   **No new data:** None of the articles mentioned any specific events that could significantly influence rig counts in the next few weeks.

**4. Balance Under/Over-reacting:**

*   It's crucial to avoid overreacting to the recent stability, as the underlying trend suggests a downward pressure. However, given the 18 day time window, a large movement is unlikely in either direction. 
*   There is no evidence in the past data of a large change in rig counts over such a short time window.
*   The stability may signal a brief equilibrium or consolidation before another potential shift.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Downward Pressure:** Lower oil/gas prices (compared to the last year) could decrease drilling, along with company focus on debt reduction.
*   **Upward Pressure:** High current production levels, coupled with oil prices above $70 could potentially slow the decline. 
*   **Inertia:** The existing rigs are in place, which also suggests stability. Changing that number will take active decisions by companies.

**6. Extrapolate Trends Linearly:**

Given the recent 3 week period of stability, a linear extrapolation would suggest the count remains at around 585, or slightly lower. The yearly decline has been around 5%, which is a little over 30 rigs. If this were to continue linearly, we would expect it to decrease by 1.5 rigs in the next 18 days but it's very unlikely to be a completely linear decline, especially over such short time period. The linear extrapolation is therefore only weakly suggestive.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

The uncertainty around rig counts is moderate. The rig count does show fluctuations but the changes are generally small, usually only a few rigs per week. We have some signals about downwards pressure, but also some indication of market equilibrium. This suggests that we should use a probability between 30% and 70%, but it should lean slightly towards lower rig counts.

**8. Balance Confidence:**

I will aim for a moderate level of confidence, recognizing the possibility of unexpected fluctuations and not pushing probabilities to extremes.

**9. Learn From Mistakes:**

I will review this forecast after resolution to identify any potential biases or errors in my reasoning. The major risk of errors here are overreacting to small movements and not factoring in long term trends accurately.

**Putting it all together:**

The current rig count is 585, which is the key threshold we are evaluating. The recent trend has been stability, but with a longer term downward trend due to company strategy. While prices are volatile, there isn't an obvious immediate causal factor to expect a large change in rig counts in the short term.

Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability that the rig count will be below 585 by November 29, but only slightly higher than the likelihood of the reverse.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 52.50% being the most likely. Probability: 52.50%.

Okay, let's tackle this forecasting problem systematically, aiming for a well-calibrated and well-resolved probability estimate.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any existing predictions from superforecasting platforms on this specific question. So I will not triage any prior human forecasts.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is: Will the number of active US oil drilling rigs be less than 585 on November 29, 2024? We can break this into sub-problems:

*   **Current Rig Count:** The most recent data shows the rig count at 585 as of November 8, 2024, according to the provided articles. The rig count had been holding steady at that level for three weeks, previously showing a fluctuating, slow decline.
*   **Trends:** The provided articles suggest a general downward trend over the last year, but with periods of stability.  
*   **Forces at Play:** Key factors include oil and gas prices, production levels, company spending habits, and global economic conditions.
*   **Time Horizon:** The forecast window is approximately 18 days, from November 11 to November 29.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Based on the news articles provided, the rig count has been declining over the past year (from 618 to 585, a decrease of around 5%). Looking at the past couple of months we see a slow decline but it's not a consistent trend and has been punctuated with periods of stability. Overall, we could say that it is more likely for it to decrease than increase but at a slow pace. Given this slow pace of decline, one might assume that if it had to decline by the same number of rigs as it had in the past year, it would do so in the next few months and not all in the next 18 days. This suggests that the base rate might be that there's a higher chance of it staying at the 585 level or slightly below, or slightly above but not a large fall in the rig count. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Recent Stability:** The rig count has been stable at 585 for three weeks, which suggests that the market might be reaching some sort of equilibrium. The recent articles indicate that the total rig count has been steady at 585 for several weeks in a row.
    *   **Oil Prices:** Oil prices have been volatile, which can influence drilling activity, and that this is a factor that determines whether companies drill. However, prices seem relatively stable at the 70-75 range for WTI and Brent.
    *   **Production:** Production is at record levels, potentially reducing the urgency to add more rigs and potentially supporting the current rig count. 
    *   **Company Strategy:** Companies are prioritizing debt repayment and shareholder returns, potentially limiting investment in new drilling. The articles mention a 1% cut in spending planned by independent E&P companies for 2024. 
    *   **Natural Gas:** US gas output is expected to slide in 2024 which could lead to further reduction of gas rigs. Although this may be offset by increase in oil drilling if oil prices are at a decent level.
    *   **No new data:** None of the articles mentioned any specific events that could significantly influence rig counts in the next few weeks.

**4. Balance Under/Over-reacting:**

*   It's crucial to avoid overreacting to the recent stability, as the underlying trend suggests a downward pressure. However, given the 18 day time window, a large movement is unlikely in either direction. 
*   There is no evidence in the past data of a large change in rig counts over such a short time window.
*   The stability may signal a brief equilibrium or consolidation before another potential shift.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Downward Pressure:** Lower oil/gas prices (compared to the last year) could decrease drilling, along with company focus on debt reduction.
*   **Upward Pressure:** High current production levels, coupled with oil prices above $70 could potentially slow the decline. 
*   **Inertia:** The existing rigs are in place, which also suggests stability. Changing that number will take active decisions by companies.

**6. Extrapolate Trends Linearly:**

Given the recent 3 week period of stability, a linear extrapolation would suggest the count remains at around 585, or slightly lower. The yearly decline has been around 5%, which is a little over 30 rigs. If this were to continue linearly, we would expect it to decrease by 1.5 rigs in the next 18 days but it's very unlikely to be a completely linear decline, especially over such short time period. The linear extrapolation is therefore only weakly suggestive.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

The uncertainty around rig counts is moderate. The rig count does show fluctuations but the changes are generally small, usually only a few rigs per week. We have some signals about downwards pressure, but also some indication of market equilibrium. This suggests that we should use a probability between 30% and 70%, but it should lean slightly towards lower rig counts.
