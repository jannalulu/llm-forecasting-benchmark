Well, Philip, the big question: Did the Fed cut rates before September 30, 2024?

Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 65.75%. The FOMC announced a reduction yesterday, aligning with our forecast.

A testament to our models' accuracy. Once again, they reflect the reality of economic dynamics.

**NATE SILVER**  
Will the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before September 30, 2024? The question on everyone's mind. Philip, based on our models, did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 34.67%. Despite inflation cooling and market pressures, the FOMC held steady. The July data showed resilience in economic growth, reducing the likelihood of a rate cut.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The economy's robustness surprised many, but our models anticipated the Fed's cautious stance. The 2023 rate hikes did their job, and the Fed chose to watch and wait.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Our models, never wrong, reflected the reality of the situation. The Fed's decision aligns with the broader economic narrative we've been tracking.

Indeed, Nate. Our models, based on data up to July 22, 2024, had it at a 45.75% probability. So, no, our models didn't expect it.
