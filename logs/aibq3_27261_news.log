**Strong Magnetic Storm Hits Earth**
According to Leus, the geomagnetic field index Kp exceeded 6 units at 18:00 MSK, corresponding to a moderate geomagnetic storm of class G1. The geomagnetic disturbances then intensified, and by 20:46 MSK, the storm had reached a strong level of class G3. Leus predicted that the magnetic storms, with fluctuations in intensity from weak to strong, would last on Earth at least until noon on Sunday. A powerful geomagnetic storm had already engulfed the Earth earlier in the week, reaching a level of G4. Following a powerful solar flare on August 14, experts predicted a new magnetic storm. Geomagnetic disturbances are expected from late Saturday evening, August 17, to early Monday morning, August 19.

**Tyumen Region Braces for Prolonged Magnetic Storm**
Astronomers from the Laboratory of Solar Astronomy at the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics expect a prolonged magnetic storm to affect the Tyumen region. According to the data, the first manifestations of abnormal geomagnetic activity will be felt by sensitive residents as early as Friday evening, August 9, 2024. The experts predict that this time the magnetic storm will have a prolonged character, with its manifestations being felt by meteorologically sensitive citizens for the next two days, approximately until 15:00 on Sunday, August 11, 2024. The peak of solar activity is expected from 3 to 6 pm on Saturday, August 10, 2024, as well as in the evening on the following day, August 11. 'From 9 to 10 August, a strong magnetic storm is expected. Over the past three days, the Sun has produced several powerful flares and plasma ejections. In the coming hours, the Earth's magnetosphere will be under the impact of these charges. There is a high probability that they will combine into a 'cumulative charge'. This will lead to the appearance of bright polar lights. It is now dark after 11 pm, and from this time on, it will be possible to observe the northern horizon. We may see a celestial show that will surpass last year's! The peak of magnetospheric disturbances is predicted for tomorrow during the day, and if the weather remains clear, the spectacle may continue into the next night,' said the Tumen astronomers-enthusiasts. It is also likely that residents of the region will be able to see the polar lights during the peak of magnetic activity. For example, in the dark time of day, under the condition of a clear sky, residents of all Western Siberia will see a unique natural phenomenon. However, for meteorologically sensitive residents of the region, its beauty may be overshadowed by negative changes in well-being, including possible headaches, weakness, dizziness, and a whole range of consequences of blood pressure spikes. It is worth noting that the last time the colorful manifestation of the magnetic storm was observed by residents of the region on the night of Monday, August 5, 2024. Experts predict an active phase of the Sun on August 22, 2024. Residents of the region should prepare for 'dancing colors'. Astronomers recommend photographing the polar lights in the countryside, where streetlights and other lighting do not interfere with making beautiful shots.'

**Earthlings Can Breathe a Sigh of Relief - No Magnetic Storms Until the End of August**
According to experts, the geomagnetic background will be calm in the last month of summer. A strong magnetic storm of level G3, which started on August 2, has ended. The storm reached a high level from 15:00 to 21:00 on August 4. Then the storm weakened. As of today, August 6, the geomagnetic situation has stabilized. Starting from tomorrow, August 7, and until the end of the month, there will be no magnetic storms on Earth. Only on September 1, a weak magnetic storm of level G1 will occur. Magnetic storms are a type of cosmic activity, representing powerful oscillations of the Earth's magnetic field, caused by the interaction of solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. According to scientists, the power of magnetic storms is measured by different indices. The Dst index is calculated using special instruments installed on the magnetic equator of the planet. The most common method is the nine-level K-index, where each level represents the intensity of the magnetic storm. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) approved this system in 1999. Experts previously predicted three solar flares in August, but according to new data, there will be none. Therefore, the advice for people sensitive to weather is to feel good! Despite the lack of scientific evidence, magnetic storms can affect people. A forecast of cosmic weather can help prepare for them.
