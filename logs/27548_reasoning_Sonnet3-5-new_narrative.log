Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their mpox risk assessment predictions]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like the CDC kept their mpox risk assessment at 'Very Low' through September. No surprises there."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 2.15%. The data we had until August 23rd showed minimal transmission in the US general population, despite that concerning spread in Sub-Saharan Africa."

Nate: "Right. Even with CDC's July 8th note about updating their risk assessment, the historical pattern suggested minimal chance of jumping four risk levels to 'High' in such a short timeframe."

Philip: "The combination of existing population immunity from the 2022 outbreak, improved vaccine access, and effective treatments made a dramatic risk elevation highly improbable. Sometimes the simplest forecast is the most accurate."

[Both nod in agreement as they turn to their next prediction]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 2nd, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on again about the CDC's mpox risk assessment.

Philip: Indeed. Given what we knew by August 23rd, our models had it at 2.15%.

Nate: Makes sense. The CDC's July assessment was "Very Low," and despite that note about updating their assessment due to clade I mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa, historical data showed minimal risk of dramatic escalation to "High" or above.

Philip: Right. The combination of existing population immunity from the 2022 outbreak, available vaccines, and treatment options made a jump to "High" extremely unlikely. Even with some spread in Africa, the U.S. public health infrastructure was well-prepared.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab coffee?

Philip: Only if you give me the probability of them having oat milk.

[Both laugh and exit]

Title: "The Probability Prophets"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The CDC's mpox risk assessment stayed at "Very Low" through September.

Philip: [nodding] Not surprising. Our models had it at 2.15%. The July assessment showed minimal concern, and even with the spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the U.S. population maintained strong immunity levels.

Nate: [examining data on screen] The combination of existing vaccines, treatments, and previous exposure kept the impact metrics low. Plus, transmission rates remained minimal in the general population.

Philip: [thoughtfully] What's interesting is how the CDC's new focus on clade I didn't materially change their risk assessment. The infrastructure built during the 2022 outbreak proved resilient.

Nate: Indeed. Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the least dramatic ones.

[They both turn back to their screens, already analyzing the next forecast.]
