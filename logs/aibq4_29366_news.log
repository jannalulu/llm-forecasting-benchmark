**Trump will declare he won early Tuesday night experts warn**
Experts warn that Donald Trump may declare himself the winner of the election early on Tuesday night, despite potentially losing the race. This could lead to mistrust of the results and even encourage some local officials to refuse to certify the votes, as Trump has already claimed victory. Political insiders are preparing for a scenario where Trump will call the election early and declare victory before all the ballots are counted.

**Trump v Harris: Don't expect to know the winner on election night, but here's what to look out for**
According to past US presidential election trends, Donald Trump is likely to deliver a victory speech between 2am and 3am on election night, regardless of the outcome. In 2016, Trump gave his victory remarks at the Hilton hotel in New York at around 2:50am after defeating Hillary Clinton. It's worth noting that the winner of the election may not be clear on election night, as was the case in the previous two presidential elections.

**Trump's Team Considers Declaring Victory Before Election Results Are Confirmed**
Donald Trump's team believes he can declare victory in the US presidential election before the results are confirmed, according to NBC News. 'Everyone was speculating that the former president might be ready to repeat 2020 and quickly declare himself the winner on election night, when it's still not known for sure,' said representatives of Trump's campaign. Trump is reportedly '100 percent' confident in his hypothetical victory. This comes after Trump filed a complaint with the independent Federal Election Commission, accusing the Labour Party of the UK of 'illegally funding' Democratic candidate Kamala Harris' campaign and interfering with its course. Labour Party leader and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer responded, saying that his party members 'worked as volunteers in their free time'.

**Trump Vows to Win Election at Rally Near Site of Assassination Attempt**
US presidential candidate Donald Trump returned to the site of the assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania, three months after the incident, to campaign for the election. At a large rally in Butler, Trump vowed to his supporters that he would win the presidential election on November 5. He received support from tech billionaire Elon Musk, who urged the crowd to vote for Trump with dramatic words. Musk stated, 'This will be no ordinary election. Harris and the Democrats want to take away many rights from the people, such as the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and even the right to vote. Trump must win to preserve the Constitution and to preserve democracy in America.' Trump also mentioned the assassination attempt, saying 'Through the will of fate and God's mercy, the shooter missed his target.' He also honored the memory of the visitor who died in the attack, saying 'He threw himself over his wife and daughters to protect their lives.' Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, spoke before him, calling the incident a 'true miracle' that Trump was not seriously injured. Vance said, 'I am convinced that God saved the life of President Trump that day.' Vance referenced God multiple times in his speech, saying 'God has a plan for President Trump, just as he has a plan for the United States of America.'

**Kamala Harris declared winner of the Philadelphia presidential debate**
The Democratic campaign announced that Kamala Harris is ready for a second debate in October, just minutes after the Philadelphia presidential debate ended. 'Is Donald Trump ready?', asked Jen O'Malley, Harris' campaign manager. The best indicator of whether Trump had a good performance or not was that he appeared in the spin room, a mixed area filled with journalists, several minutes after the debate. 'The polls say we won, they're very good, but the best is that I felt very good', Trump said. 'She wants another debate because she knows she lost absolutely', Trump said surrounded by several journalists who were shouting at him why he was there if he had done so well. The markets, however, have declared Harris as the clear winner of the night. According to PredictIt, a New Zealand-based company that predicts political and financial events based on betting by operators, Harris leads the probabilities of winning the November 5 elections by 10 points, 56 cents to 46. Trump boasted of polls that put him as the winner of the clash, until now the only one on the agenda of the candidates. 'One declared me winner with 90%, another with 89%... the worst I've seen is 71%', Trump said to the journalists. However, these polls are published on X and created by users like Robert Griffin III, former quarterback of the Washington Redskins and sports commentator. Another, published by Insider Paper, was shown on Truth Social with a 78% in favor of Trump. The problem is that the survey, with less than 8,000 votes, had been published for 20 minutes. Leading Report, a pro-Trump account, also declared its favorite winner with another unverifiable survey on the new Twitter of Elon Musk. Donald Trump had more time to use the word than Harris. The Republican spoke for 42 minutes and 52 seconds, while his Democratic rival spoke for 37 minutes and 36 seconds. Despite the five extra minutes, the former president has complained about the moderators and the company that hosted the debate, ABC. 'They were three against one and in my opinion this is the worst of all the networks', Trump said in the spin room. The defensive strategy has been followed by the trumpism. 'It's strange how these fake moderators only review Trump's words, but allow Harris to lie without stopping', wrote Don Jr. in Truth Social. The campaign also echoed some messages from Fox News presenters, such as Megyn Kelly, who criticized the role of David Muir and Linsey Davis, the journalists who led the debate. The campaign, however, had criticized the moderators even before the debate began. 'We believe that ABC News will play a very biased role tonight', Trump warned his followers 30 minutes before the first question.

**US Presidential Election Week: Intense Competition and Scathing Criticisms**
US Presidential Election Week: Intense Competition and Scathing Criticisms. Donald Trump, after being urged by some allies to apologize for his racist comments, took the opposite approach on Tuesday night, saying 'It's an honor to participate' in such an event, and describing the scene as a 'Love Festival', the same term he used to describe the January 6, 2021, Capitol Hill riot. Trump gathered his supporters and journalists at his Mar-a-Lago resort, two days after a crowded rally in 'Madison Square Garden' was marked by several harsh statements from many speakers, including a group of comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who joked that Puerto Rico is 'a floating garbage island'. Several top Republican allies of Trump criticized these statements, and his campaign took a rare step by publicly distancing itself from Hinchcliffe's comments, but not the others. Before a week of the election, US President Joe Biden received a barrage of criticism after describing Trump's supporters as 'garbage' during a campaign speech for his running mate, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, on Tuesday night. Biden was referring to a description of Puerto Rico as 'a garbage island floating in the ocean' by one of the speakers at a Trump rally. In response, Biden said 'The only garbage I see floating there is his supporters, his demonization of Latinos is unacceptable and un-American', but the White House later clarified that Biden was referring to Trump's speech, not his supporters. According to the Latin Data Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, Pennsylvania alone, which both candidates consider crucial to win the presidency, has over 300,000 eligible Puerto Rican voters. Harris' campaign Harris delivered what was described as her 'closing argument' to voters, in a speech she delivered on Tuesday night, near the White House. She accused her Republican opponent of trying to 'sow division and fear' among Americans. Harris addressed Americans during her campaign from the same location where Trump gathered his supporters before the Capitol Hill riot in 2021. She promised to work on improving the living conditions of Americans, saying her opponent 'does it only for himself'. Harris said: 'Trump has spent years trying to keep the American people divided and fearful of each other: this is not what America is. I'm here tonight to say: this is not what we are'. Last-ditch efforts to influence. Trump is campaigning in Pennsylvania, one of the seven swing states, which is likely to determine the national outcome. Both candidates have criticized him as unfit to lead the country, searching for any small advantage to attract undecided voters, in what may be one of the closest elections in the country in decades. The speeches delivered by Trump and Harris in the last days of the campaign may influence some undecided voters, but the efforts of the campaigns to encourage their committed supporters to vote in the last days of the campaign or on election day may be more effective. During the campaign, Trump and Harris have exchanged insults repeatedly. Trump described Harris as a person with 'low IQ', saying she would be like 'a game' for world leaders. He said: 'They will hold onto her'. Some of Trump's former senior aides from his 2017-2021 White House tenure described him as a 'fascist' who wants to rule in a second term as a 'dictator'. Harris agreed with this description. Trump responded to the mockery by describing Harris in the same way.

Let's fight for the country we love.' She also urged people to use their collective strength to create a new and better chapter in the story of America.

**Kamala Harris Promises to Win US Presidential Election**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has promised to win the presidential election in the US, saying 'We will win' to a crowd of her supporters. Harris repeated her words from the final weeks of the campaign, calling the election a choice between 'two completely different visions of our country'. She accused Donald Trump of running an egoistic campaign of revenge, while she and her supporters are working to create a better future for all Americans. Harris said, 'We have the opportunity to turn the page on the fear and divisions that have been characteristic of our politics for a decade under Donald Trump. We have the opportunity to turn the page in the same old worn-out textbook because we're tired of it, and we're ready to chart a new path forward.' Harris visited a predominantly black church and a barber shop in western Philadelphia, highlighting the importance of this city in her campaign strategy. Her ability to inspire Democrats in Philadelphia will be key to winning Pennsylvania, which could be a decisive state in the Electoral College, according to The Guardian. Harris said, 'Too much is at stake, and we shouldn't wake up the next day after the election and regret what we could have done in these nine days.' She added, 'The election has already begun, and the choice, Philadelphia, is in your hands. The path to victory lies straight through all the leaders present here.' Philadelphia Mayor Cheryl Parker, the first black woman to hold the office, asked the crowd to remember how it felt to see Trump's victory in 2016 and urged them to do everything possible to prevent it from happening again. Parker reminded them that Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by just 1.2 points in 2020, four years after Trump won the state by 0.7 points. However, the rally became at least one warning sign for Harris, according to The Guardian. Pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted the start of Harris's speech, causing whistling from other attendees before the protesters were escorted out. Harris did not shy away from addressing the protesters and instead focused on the war in Gaza, saying, 'We can and must take advantage of this opportunity to end this war and bring home the hostages, and I will do everything in my power to achieve this goal.'

**Why Donald Trump May Win the Election**
Donald Trump has a chance to win the election as the enthusiasm for Kamala Harris has begun to fade after Joe Biden's withdrawal. Trump is repeating his message to half of the American voters, trying to convince them that he is a strong leader who can tackle the economic and security challenges facing America. He is emphasizing his ability to deal with Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, saying 'Can you imagine Kamala Harris facing Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping?' This message is resonating with millions of Americans who are looking for a strong leader who can address their concerns and fears. According to recent polls, Trump's message is gaining popularity, especially among conservative voters who are concerned about immigration and the economy. Harris's campaign is struggling in the key battleground states, where Trump is gaining momentum. The election is becoming more polarized, with Trump's message of strength and security resonating with many Americans. Harris's campaign is trying to appeal to moderate voters, but Trump's message is winning over many of them. The election is becoming a referendum on Trump's leadership, with many Americans questioning his ability to tackle the country's challenges.

**Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama Rally Supporters in Michigan: 'We Are Going to Win'**
Kamala Harris, the US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate, told her supporters in Michigan on Saturday that 'we are going to win' the elections. Harris appeared alongside former First Lady Michelle Obama. Harris said, 'Hard work is good work and we are going to win. We are going to win and it's going to be a close contest, we know that and we know what's at stake. We are here together because we love our country and we are ready to fight for the best of ourselves.' Michelle Obama presented Harris, saying that the elections will be close and urging her supporters to stay 'enthusiastic'. Obama said, 'It's going to be a close battle, friends. We can't take anything for granted. We are going to need you to be this enthusiastic for the next 10 days so we can achieve it and be able to sleep at night.' Michelle criticized former President Donald Trump and blamed him for his handling of COVID-19 during her comments in Kalamazoo, Michigan, on Saturday. Obama also made a passionate call to take reproductive rights seriously and 'not put our lives in the hands of politicians' during a rally on Saturday in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Obama said, 'I ask all of you, from the bottom of my heart, to take our lives seriously, please. Don't put our lives in the hands of politicians, mostly men who don't have any idea or don't care what we, as women, are living, who don't fully understand the wide implications that their wrong policies will have on our health.' She continued, 'The only people who have the right to make these decisions are women with the advice of their doctors. We are the ones who have the knowledge and experience to know what we need.' Obama asked the crowd not to 'give up' their destiny to Trump and emphasized what's at stake in the elections. Obama said, 'Please, don't give up our destiny to people like Trump, who don't know anything about us and who have shown a deep disrespect for us, because a vote for him is a vote against us.' About Trump, Obama said, 'He doesn't understand policies, he can't build a coherent argument, he's not honest, he's not decent, he's not moral. Instead, too many people are willing to dismiss his childish and mean-spirited antics by saying, 'Well, Trump is just Trump'.'

**Trump May Declare Himself Winner Before Final Results, Experts Warn**
US experts are concerned that Donald Trump may declare himself the winner of the US presidential election before the final results are in. This is a possibility that Trump has already demonstrated in the 2020 election. If he were to do so, what would be the consequences? According to Newsweek, US politics experts are worried that Trump may declare himself the winner on November 5, before the final count of all votes is complete. This would be particularly problematic, as a definitive result may not be available for several days after the election. Trump has already done this in the 2020 election, declaring himself the winner shortly after midnight on election night, despite the fact that votes in key swing states had not yet been fully counted. This move was met with criticism from some Republicans, who saw it as a 'bad political decision'. Trump has also filed lawsuits to challenge the vote count in swing states, including a request to find 11,780 votes in Georgia to overturn the result. His critics argue that this rhetoric contributed to the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. Harris has prepared her campaign for the possibility of Trump declaring himself the winner again, saying 'we're certainly preparing for that scenario'. She also emphasized that her party has the resources and expertise to handle such a situation. 'The American people are facing a very, very serious decision about the future of our country, two weeks before the election', Harris said. Bob Beatty, chair of the politics department at Washburn University, believes that Trump's past actions are clear indicators that he will 'likely declare the election over, regardless of the results'. Beatty told Newsweek that Trump's past behavior and rhetoric are the best indicators of his future actions. David Schultz, a professor of politics and law at Hamline University, agrees that Trump may try to declare himself the winner, but notes that it would have no legal consequences. Sylvia Albert, a consultant for the independent organization Common Cause, said that Trump's declaration would have no political weight, as the election is decided by the voters, not the candidates. 'The candidates have had their say, and now it's time for the voters to cast their ballots to choose their new head of state', Albert said. 'We will probably not know who the winner is on November 5, and that's okay - it means that the election officials are taking the time to carefully count every vote', she added.

**Trump Will Win Because His Opponents Are Too Weak, Says Alexander Kushnaryov**
According to Alexander Kushnaryov, Donald Trump will win the elections because his opponents have proven to be too weak. Kushnaryov criticizes Joe Biden's performance, saying he is 'bad' when speaking to the Native American communities. He compares Biden unfavorably to Trump's opponents, calling them 'brutal, scary, and cyberpunk' led by Elon Musk. Kushnaryov believes that Trump is not a good person, but the Democrats have failed to present a strong alternative. He argues that Trump will win because his opponents are 'weak, slow, and unprepared for the tough fight.' Kushnaryov concludes that instead of threatening autocrats with severe losses in war, the Democrats are trembling at the slightest sign of Moscow's displeasure.

**ROOKE: These Are The Early Results That Will Tell Us The Winner On Election Night**
Former President Donald Trump is making a play for Virginia, a state President Joe Biden won by ten points in 2020. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, said that if Republicans have a good night in Virginia, it will be a message that they can use in other parts of the country, while a poor performance will reinforce the idea that Democrats have an advantage on the abortion issue. Vice President Kamala Harris is running on an abortion referendum in 2024, and her results in Virginia could forecast how voters in swing states rank this issue. Harris is currently holding a 6.2-point lead in Virginia, according to the 538 polling averages. Trump's campaign believes he can win and is using Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's 2021 playbook, hoping it will push him over the line. Youngkin will be at several rallies for Trump as part of the campaign's get-out-the-vote effort in Virginia. Trump praised RNC co-chair Lara Trump, who will join Youngkin at a Virginia rally on Saturday, saying that early voting results look 'tremendous' for Republicans.

**Trump WILL win US election & prove pollsters wrong – Kamala’s shock slur shows she’s panicking, Nigel Farage slams**
Nigel Farage, a close friend of Donald Trump, believes the ex-President will win the US election on November 5. Farage stated, 'I'm more sure now than I've ever been that Trump is going to win.' He attributed Trump's success to his charm and humor, saying, 'When Trump is being funny, when Trump is smiling, Trump is winning.' Farage also criticized Labour activists for traveling to the US to support Kamala Harris, calling it an 'unintelligent' move that risks damaging UK-US relations. Meanwhile, Trump has been gaining momentum in early voting and is outperforming polls in swing states. Harris has been attacked Trump, labeling him a 'fascist,' but Farage dismissed her comments as a sign of desperation, saying, 'she's panicking' as Trump gains momentum.

However, other Trump allies said that this November may be different from November 2020, as he is surrounded by a new team of top advisors who will not push him to make such a statement.

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has suggested 'removing' Trump, expressing concerns that the recent Supreme Court decision may lead Trump to believe he has the right to 'physically remove' those who he sees as a threat. Biden emphasized that such an approach could have serious consequences for democracy in the US.

**Financial experts are ‘convinced’ Donald Trump will win the US election, renowned investor says**
Renowned American investor Stanley Druckenmiller believes the stock market is 'very convinced' that Donald Trump will win the US presidential election in a fortnight. Druckenmiller said, 'I would have to say Trump is the favourite to win the election now.' He cited the stock market and the price of Bitcoin, which have climbed significantly in the past month, as signs of confidence in a Trump victory. Druckenmiller also stated that a Democratic 'sweep' would have the opposite effect on the markets, while a Republican sweep would unleash 'animal spirits' and 'deregulation'. The Harris campaign is reportedly worried about the state of the race in multiple key swing states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which form the so-called 'blue wall'. According to NBC News, there are concerns that Ms Harris may win two of those states but lose the third, most likely Michigan, which would leave her short of the 270 electoral votes needed for victory.

**Trump's Interpretation of His Potential Victory**
Donald Trump believes that he can win the election due to various reasons, including his policies. However, his interpretation of his potential victory may be different and more extreme than what many people who voted for him actually want. Trump often talks about cities like Springfield, Ohio, and Haitians, using language that is similar to his 2016 campaign, where he mixed real and fake problems, and real people who fell victim to the system, with increasing pressure on politicians. Trump weaves everything into a narrative to prove that he was right. In his campaign speeches, Trump often talks about political revenge, the threat of World War III, and the chaos that the country is in. He also talks about 'liberating' Wisconsin from 'invaders, rapists, thugs, and drug dealers, and gangsters', and how 'migrant gangs' have 'occupied' hundreds of towns and cities across the Midwest, leaving law enforcement 'terrified'. Trump has also used cultural and civilizational terms to describe immigrants, saying that they are a threat to the 'basic fabric of our society'. However, as he has pointed out several times recently, he won in 2016 because of the 'border file', and he believes that he can win again because of it. However, it is impossible to know for certain why he won in 2016, and it is likely that his victory was due to a combination of factors, including his policies on immigration, his opponent Hillary Clinton, and the desire for change among voters.

**Trump: Dems can only win if they 'cheat'  --  but it's 'too early' for evidence**
Donald Trump claimed that Democrats can only win the 2024 election if they 'cheat', but when asked for evidence, he said 'it's too early'. NBC News reporter Vaughn Hillyard asked Trump about specific incidents of cheating, but Trump replied, 'No, not at this time.' Conservative lawyers have flagged their concern that Trump is laying the groundwork to claim fraud, and may declare the election 'rigged' or 'stolen' on election night, citing slow vote counts of mail-in ballots in battleground states as evidence. 'According to four conservative attorneys and other sources who've spoken to the former president on this matter, Trump intends to declare... that the race is being 'rigged' or 'stolen' from him,' reported Rolling Stone.

**Donald Trump still won't admit he lost the 2020 election. Will he concede if he loses in 2024?**
Steve Bannon, a former top Trump adviser, revealed a plan to declare Donald Trump the winner of the 2020 election early in the night, before the 'blue shift' in vote counting, which would make it seem like Trump was losing. Bannon's plan was to create a 'firestorm' by declaring Trump the winner, and then claiming that the election was stolen when the results shifted towards the Democrats. This plan was executed on election night, with Trump declaring victory before the blue shift and later claiming that the election was a 'fraud on the American public'. The article also discusses how Trump's denial of the 2020 election result has factored heavily into his 2024 campaign, with him imploring his supporters to make the result 'too big to rig'. The article concludes that it's unlikely Trump will concede on election night if he loses, and that he will use the office of the president to make sure nothing like the 2020 election happens again.

**Opinion: Trump has a great chance of winning Michigan. His Detroit speech highlighted why.**
Former President Donald Trump's recent speech at the Detroit Economic Club highlighted his chances of winning Michigan in the upcoming election. Trump's speech, which covered various topics including the economy and trade, resonated with the audience and showed his ability to connect with voters on key issues. Trump's comments about Vice President Kamala Harris were misinterpreted by the media, but in context, he was referencing Detroit's financial struggles and warning about the country's financial peril under Harris' policies. A recent Quinnipiac University Poll shows Trump closing the gap in Michigan, with a 50-47 lead over Harris. Trump's message is resonating with voters, particularly on issues such as the economy, immigration, and electric vehicles, where he holds an advantage over Harris.

**Shhhh, Trump Is Winning! (Part 2)**
The author argues that Donald Trump is winning the election due to several reasons. Firstly, voter rolls have been cleaned up, and many of the 'changes' that occurred in 2020, such as the 3am dumps in Michigan and Georgia, have been addressed legally. Additionally, Team Trump is now prepared to take action if deadlines are not enforced and ballots are not counted properly. The author also notes that Team Harris is starting to panic, as evidenced by Barack Obama's decision to spend the coming week in Pennsylvania, a state that Harris needs to win. Furthermore, Trump is gaining momentum, particularly in urban areas, where he is outpacing previous GOP candidates. The author concludes that America is surging with momentum and that the count will be accountable this time around.

**Trump Returns to Site of Attack, Swears Supporters to Victory**
US presidential candidate Donald Trump has returned to the site of the attack on him in Pennsylvania, three months after the incident, to campaign for the election. At a large rally in Butler, Trump swore his supporters to victory on November 5, with the support of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who urged the crowd to vote for Trump with dramatic words. In July, a shooter fired from a nearby roof at Trump during a rally in Butler, killing one person and injuring two others. Trump was hit by a bullet in the right ear. The shooter was killed by security forces. Thousands of people gathered at the site on Saturday evening, more than at the event in July. Trump wants to move back into the White House after the election in a month, which is shaping up to be a close contest between him and his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. J.D. Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, spoke before Trump, recalling the attack and calling it a 'true miracle' that Trump was not seriously injured. 'I am convinced that God saved the life of President Trump that day,' Vance said. Trump echoed this narrative in his speech, saying that their movement is 'stronger, prouder, more united, more determined, and closer to victory than ever before.' Through 'the will of fate and God's mercy,' the shooter missed his target. Musk also called for Trump's election, saying that it would be 'no ordinary election.' Harris and the Democrats want to take away many rights from the people, including the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and even the right to vote. Trump must win 'to preserve the Constitution and to preserve democracy in America.' Musk, who often spreads conspiracy theories, has been supporting Trump for a while and regularly criticizes Harris. Trump had hinted that Musk could be appointed to a committee to review US finances if he wins the election.

**Trump Vows to Make America Great Again, Reach Mars by End of Second Term**
Donald Trump, a candidate for the US presidency, shared his plans for a second term. He promised to reduce energy prices by half and lower taxes. Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was attacked, and began his speech with a joke. He thanked the people present, saying, 'Thank you. We love Pennsylvania.' 'I'm returning to Butler to deliver a simple message... We will make America great again, we will win the elections,' he said. Discussing the attack, Trump stated that the perpetrator 'wanted to silence me and the MAGA movement' and described the moment when 'time stopped for 16 seconds while this wicked monster released pure evil.' Trump also promised to reduce energy prices by half, lower taxes, and criticized his opponent Kamala Harris for her left-wing views. He emphasized that the US 'will reach Mars' by the end of his second term if he is re-elected and vowed 'not to allow men in women's sports.' Trump's speech was met with applause from the audience. 'We will make America great again, we will win the elections,' he said. 'We will not be silenced, we will not be defeated,' he added. Trump's speech was seen as a call to action for his supporters, who are eager to see him re-elected. 'We will make America great again, we will win the elections,' Trump repeated, his voice filled with conviction.

**Trump Returns to Site of Near-Assassination to Rally Support for Upcoming Election**
Donald Trump returned to the market square in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was nearly assassinated in July, to rally a large crowd for the upcoming election, which he linked to his survival during the shooting. Trump began his speech by saying, 'As I said,' and pointed to an immigration chart that he was looking at when the shooting started. He credited the chart with saving his life, saying that the bullet grazed his ear. Trump said, 'Twelve weeks ago, we all got a bullet for America.' He urged the crowd to vote and said, 'We must win. We cannot let this happen to our country.' Trump's team worked to maximize the event's impact to attract media attention, with 30 days left until the election and early voting underway in some states. Musician Lee Greenwood performed a rendition of 'God Bless America,' which Trump often sang at his rallies, and billionaire Elon Musk made his first appearance at a large Trump event, praising Trump as 'a great gentleman' and saying that he 'saved free speech.' Musk said, 'President Trump must win to save the Constitution. He must win to save democracy in America. This is a situation where victory is mandatory.' Musk, who has taken a conservative stance and is funding efforts to attract votes for Trump in several swing states, met with Trump and his running mate, Senator Josh Hawley, backstage, wearing a 'Make America Great Again' hat. A billboard on the way to the rally read, 'We believe in Musk.' Trump asked for a moment of silence to honor firefighter Cory Gumpper, who died protecting family members from shots in July. Singer Christopher Macchio performed 'Ave Maria' after the bell rang, which marked the start of the shooting on July 13. Several members of Gumpper's family, including his widow Helen, were in attendance, standing next to Trump's niece, Lara Trump, who is a top advisor to his campaign. Trump called the would-be assassin 'a monstrous creature' and said that he was unable to carry out his plan 'by the will of Providence and the mercy of God.' The rally featured a heightened security presence, with armed law enforcement officers on the rooftops and a barricade surrounding the building where the shooter, Thomas Kruk, fired from.

**Trump again says he ‘won’ in 2020 after special counsel makes new claims about bid to overturn loss**
Former President Donald Trump claimed he 'won' the 2020 election at a campaign rally in Michigan, despite previously saying he 'lost by a whisker.' Trump's statement comes one day after a special counsel filing detailed evidence that he is not entitled to immunity in the election subversion case against him. Prosecutors claim Trump was acting as a private citizen when he tweeted about Vice President Mike Pence lacking 'courage' to overturn the election result during the Capitol riot. The case won't go to trial until after the November 5 election. Trump's team expressed outrage over the filing's release, claiming it was an attempt to undermine and interfere in the 2024 presidential election.

The clip also raises questions about Vance's stance on the 2024 election, as he did not say if he would concede if Democrats receive more electoral votes. The video is part of a larger controversy surrounding Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, which is currently being investigated by Jack Smith's election subversion case.

Andrea Di Giuseppe, a deputy from Fratelli d'Italia, believes that Donald Trump will win the US presidential election because immigration is a major issue for voters. He stated, 'Trump has made the middle class feel the benefits that make him more popular than any other Republican.' Di Giuseppe also warned that there is no risk of a peaceful transition after the election, saying, 'I don't think there's a risk of a transparent vote. The laws on postal voting were changed in 2020 due to COVID, but now most states have restored a more rigorous system.' He also mentioned that the Fentanyl crisis, which is coming from Mexico, is a major issue in the North, not just in the South. Di Giuseppe also commented on the Democratic Party's chances, saying, 'The initial push has already worn off. Everyone knows it's a media construction, and Biden was considered unelectable until he abandoned her.' He also stated that Giorgia Meloni has a good relationship with Biden, saying, 'Our Prime Minister has shown that she is able to speak and be well-received by any President. She has been able to increase the credibility of our people in the eyes of the Americans.'

Trump also referenced a 29% increase in robbery, a 36% increase in felony assault, a 42% increase in grand larceny, and a 75% increase in carjackings.

After the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, residents in Eastern Carolina are weighing in on who they believe won.

**Trump Declares Himself Winner of Debate, Attacks ABC News and Taylor Swift**
Donald Trump has claimed to have won 'by a lot' the presidential debate against Kamala Harris and has threatened Taylor Swift, who supports the Democratic candidate, saying 'she will pay for it'. He has also attacked ABC News, the organization that hosted the debate, for the role of the journalists who debunked his false claims. Trump appeared on the Fox and Friends morning show, stating that the debate was his 'best' and that he has polls that show he won 'by 80-20, 90', but did not specify which polls he is referring to. 'And I think that's true', he added. In response to Swift's announcement of her support for Harris, Trump said: 'She's a very liberal person, always seems to support Democrats and probably will pay the consequences for it in the market'. Experts, analysts, and early polls have favored Harris as the winner of the debate. A quick CNN poll of registered voters who watched the debate concluded that Harris overwhelmingly won, with 63% of the 605 respondents via text message across the country considering her the best. Trump has also attacked ABC News, expressing his frustration that the moderators corrected his lies. 'They wouldn't stop correcting me', he claimed, stating that Harris said 'outright lies' and was not corrected. 'Many things I said were discredited, totally discredited. But she could say what she wanted. My things were correct, but they corrected me'. He has also claimed without evidence that the debate was 'totally rigged'. Trump has called for ABC News to lose its broadcasting license after the way they moderated the debate. 'They should take away their license for the way they did it. I think they lost a lot of credibility', he said. 'They are the most dishonest, the most dishonest medium, and that's saying a lot, because all of them are essentially very dishonest'. Both candidates faced off in Philadelphia on Tuesday in a heated debate where the Republican showed frustration multiple times. It could be the only face-to-face between the two less than two months before the November 5 elections, which will decide if Democrats can extend their political project or if the country will face a second term of Trump.

**Who won the presidential debate? Key takeaways from Trump vs Harris**
In the recent presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, Harris emerged as the clear winner, according to many analysts. Harris skillfully goaded Trump into delivering false retorts, including a claim that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets. 'They are eating the dogs!' Trump shouted, which Harris laughed at in disbelief. Harris also effectively controlled the debate, getting under Trump's skin repeatedly. 'Make no mistake about it, Trump had a bad night,' said Brit Hume on Fox News. Even Republicans concluded that Harris had succeeded in provoking Trump into veering off message. Online prediction market PredictIt's 2024 presidential general election market showed Trump's likelihood of victory declining during the debate, to 47% from 52%. Meanwhile, Harris' odds improved to 55% from 53%. Harris also delivered a lengthy attack on abortion limits, speaking passionately about women denied emergency care and victims of incest unable to terminate their pregnancies due to statewide bans. Trump, on the other hand, refused to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war, even as ABC moderator David Muir pushed him on the point. Harris shot back, arguing that what Trump really wanted was Ukraine's quick and unconditional capitulation. 'If Donald Trump were president, Vladimir Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now,' she said.

**Kamala Harris declared winner of the Philadelphia presidential debate**
The Democratic campaign announced that Kamala Harris is ready for a second debate in October, just minutes after the Philadelphia presidential debate ended. 'Is Donald Trump ready?', asked Jen O'Malley, Harris' campaign manager. The best indicator of whether Trump had a good performance or not was that he appeared in the spin room, a mixed area filled with journalists, several minutes after the debate. 'The polls say we won, they're very good, but the best is that I felt very good', Trump said. 'She wants another debate because she knows she lost absolutely', Trump said surrounded by several journalists who were shouting at him why he was there if he had done so well. The markets, however, have declared Harris as the clear winner of the night. According to PredictIt, a New Zealand-based company that predicts political and financial events based on betting by operators, Harris leads the probabilities of winning the November 5 elections by 10 points, 56 cents to 46. Trump boasted of polls that put him as the winner of the clash, until now the only one on the agenda of the candidates. 'One declared me winner with 90%, another with 89%... the worst I've seen is 71%', Trump said to the journalists. However, these polls are published on X and created by users like Robert Griffin III, former quarterback of the Washington Redskins and sports commentator. Another, published by Insider Paper, was shown on Truth Social with a 78% in favor of Trump. The problem is that the survey, with less than 8,000 votes, had been published for 20 minutes. Leading Report, a pro-Trump account, also declared its favorite winner with another unverifiable survey on the new Twitter of Elon Musk. Donald Trump had more time to use the word than Harris. The Republican spoke for 42 minutes and 52 seconds, while his Democratic rival spoke for 37 minutes and 36 seconds. Despite the five extra minutes, the former president has complained about the moderators and the company that hosted the debate, ABC. 'They were three against one and in my opinion this is the worst of all the networks', Trump said in the spin room. The defensive strategy has been followed by the trumpism. 'It's strange how these fake moderators only review Trump's words, but allow Harris to lie without stopping', wrote Don Jr. in Truth Social. The campaign also echoed some messages from Fox News presenters, such as Megyn Kelly, who criticized the role of David Muir and Linsey Davis, the journalists who led the debate. The campaign, however, had criticized the moderators even before the debate began. 'We believe that ABC News will play a very biased role tonight', Trump warned his followers 30 minutes before the first question.

**Flying to victory with both wings: Why I am sure Trump will win the election**
The article argues that Donald Trump will win the upcoming election due to his diverse base of support and the opposition to the Democratic Party's policies. The author claims that Kamala Harris's campaign is built on hatred for Trump, fueled by the mainstream media's 'campaign of lies' and 'deception.' Harris's policies, such as her role in the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and her handling of the border crisis, are seen as disastrous. In contrast, Trump's supporters, including Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr., are united by their opposition to the Democratic Party's stance on issues like censorship, global wars, and open borders. The article also suggests that Trump's love for Israel has brought him peace, citing the Torah's promise of blessings for those who love Jerusalem. The author concludes that Trump will win the election due to his broad base of support and the unpopularity of the Democratic Party's policies.

**Trump Claims Victory in Debate, Says Taylor Swift Will 'Pay a Price in the Market' for Supporting Harris**
Former US President Donald Trump stated that he has 'less inclination' to participate in another debate with Vice President Kamala Harris before the elections, after the first face-to-face encounter between the two presidential candidates. Trump said, 'I have less inclination to do it, because we had a great night. We won the debate.' He also claimed that Harris' campaign requested a second debate, indicating that he was the winner, as 'when two people fight, it's the loser who asks for a rematch.' Trump criticized the moderators of ABC News, saying they were biased towards Harris. He also downplayed the support of singer Taylor Swift, who announced on social media that she would vote for Harris in the November elections. Trump said, 'It was only a matter of time. She couldn't support Biden... But she's a very progressive person.' He added, 'It seems that (Swift) always supports a Democrat, and probably will pay a price in the market.'
