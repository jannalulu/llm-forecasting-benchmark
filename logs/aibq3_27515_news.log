**Apple's iPhone 16 to get 'significant' update not seen in previous smartphones**
Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 is rumored to have a significant update, with high-end models charging twice as fast as previous smartphones. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will reportedly charge up to 50% in 15 minutes, compared to the iPhone 15's 30 minutes. This is due to larger batteries and support for 40-watt wired charging and 20-watt wireless charging. iPhone fans are excited about the update, with some calling it a 'significant upgrade.' However, consumers will need to buy a compatible charger from Apple to utilize the fast charging feature. The iPhone 16 is expected to be released in September and will also feature a new design and better battery life.

**iPhone 16 May Feature Faster Charging with 40W Power Absorption**
The next series of Apple's iPhone 16 may feature a significant update to its charging capacity, allowing for a power absorption of 40W, a notable increase from the current 20W. According to Li Nan, founder of the Angry Miao community on Weibo, Apple is preparing to improve the charging potential of its iPhone 16, as reported by AppleInsider. The post suggests that the new iPhone could support a power absorption of up to 40W. For the iPhone 15 series, Apple's fast charging function can reach 50% charge in about 30 minutes using a 20W or higher charger. However, using chargers with higher wattage does not significantly improve charging speed. With a 40W adapter, the iPhone 16 could reach 50% charge in almost half the time, approximately 15 minutes. This would significantly reduce the overall charging time, especially when the battery is fully drained. The increase in wattage will not affect wireless charging, as MagSafe and Qi2 are limited to 15W on the iPhone, according to the report. Although this rumor seems plausible, Apple must also consider possible thermal issues that could arise from charging at higher wattages, which could increase battery wear and tear and reduce its lifespan.
