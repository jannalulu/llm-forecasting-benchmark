To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the relevant information:

1. Historical scoring patterns in Euro semi-finals:
The articles don't provide specific data on semi-final scoring, but we can infer from overall tournament trends. Spain has scored 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 per game), while France has only scored 3 goals in 5 matches (0.6 per game). The Netherlands has 9 goals in 5 matches (1.8 per game), and England has 4 goals in 5 matches (0.8 per game).

2. Current form of semi-finalists:
Spain appears to be in the best offensive form, having won all their matches. France has struggled offensively but has a strong defense. The Netherlands and England have been inconsistent but have potential to score.

3. Historical semi-final trends:
One article mentioned that 9 of 16 semi-finals between Euro 1992 and Euro 2020 ended level after 90 minutes, suggesting potentially lower-scoring matches.

4. Defensive strengths:
France has kept 4 clean sheets in 5 matches, indicating a strong defense that could limit scoring.

5. Pressure of the semi-final stage:
Semi-finals are often tense affairs where teams may play more cautiously, potentially reducing scoring.

6. Potential for extra time:
The question specifies that penalty shootout goals don't count, but extra time goals would. This slightly increases the chance of reaching 4+ goals.

Balancing these factors:

- The combined average goals per game of the four semi-finalists is (2.2 + 0.6 + 1.8 + 0.8) / 4 = 1.35 goals per team per game.
- For two games, we might expect around 1.35 * 4 = 5.4 goals on average.
- However, the semi-final stage often sees more cautious play, and France's strong defense could significantly reduce scoring in their match.
- There's a significant disparity between Spain's high scoring and France's low scoring, which adds uncertainty.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a good chance of seeing 4 or more goals, but it's far from certain. I'll provide a range that reflects this uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 70.00%, with 62.50% being the most likely. Probability: 62.50%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the relevant information and break it down into key factors:

1. Goal-scoring trends in the tournament so far:
Spain has been the highest-scoring team with 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 goals per game).
France has only scored 3 goals in 5 matches (0.6 goals per game).
Netherlands has scored 9 goals in 5 matches (1.8 goals per game).
England has scored 4 goals in 5 matches (0.8 goals per game).

2. Defensive strength:
France has kept 4 clean sheets in 5 matches, conceding only 1 goal.
Spain has conceded goals but their high-scoring offense may lead to more open games.

3. Historical data:
The articles don't provide much historical data on semi-final goal totals, but mention that 9 of 16 semi-finals between Euro 1992 and Euro 2020 ended level after 90 minutes, suggesting potentially low-scoring affairs.

4. Form and momentum:
Spain is the only team to have won all their matches so far.
France has struggled to score but has been defensively solid.
Netherlands and England haven't been particularly convincing but have potential match-winners.

5. Stage of the tournament:
Semi-finals tend to be more cautious affairs as teams are wary of making mistakes at this crucial stage.

Weighing these factors:

For a higher goal total:
- Spain's high-scoring form (11 goals in 5 games)
- Netherlands' decent scoring record (9 goals in 5 games)
- Potential for more open games if teams need to chase a result

For a lower goal total:
- France's strong defense and low-scoring matches
- England's relatively low scoring so far
- The tendency for semi-finals to be tighter, more cautious matches
- The pressure of the occasion potentially leading to more conservative play

Balancing these factors, I lean towards a lower goal total. While Spain has been high-scoring, they face a very strong French defense. The other semi-final between Netherlands and England could also be a cagey affair given the stakes.

Given that we need 4 or more goals across both semi-finals combined, I estimate this is less likely than not, but still with a significant chance of occurring due to the potential for extra time and the presence of high-quality attackers who could make the difference.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 45.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available data:

1. Historical scoring patterns in Euro semi-finals:
The articles don't provide specific data on past semi-final goal totals. This is a significant gap in our information.

2. Current tournament scoring trends:
- Spain has been the highest-scoring team with 11 goals in 5 matches (2.2 goals per game).
- France has only scored 3 goals in 5 matches (0.6 goals per game).
- The Netherlands has scored 9 goals in 5 matches (1.8 goals per game).
- England has scored 4 goals in 5 matches (0.8 goals per game).

3. Defensive records:
- France has kept 4 clean sheets in 5 matches, suggesting a strong defense.
- Spain has conceded goals but their high-scoring offense may lead to more open games.

4. Semi-final matchups:
- Spain vs France: This could be a clash between the tournament's best offense and best defense.
- Netherlands vs England: Both teams have been inconsistent but have potential for goals.

5. Stage of tournament factor:
Semi-finals are often tense affairs where teams may play more cautiously, potentially reducing scoring.

6. Recent form:
Spain has been consistently strong, while other teams have shown mixed form.

Balancing these factors:

- The high-scoring Spanish team provides a strong possibility for goals.
- France's defensive record and low-scoring games suggest they might keep the score down.
- The Netherlands-England game could go either way, but both teams have shown they can score.
- The semi-final stage might lead to more cautious play, but with four strong offensive teams, goals are likely.

Given that we need 4 or more total goals across two games, we're looking at an average of 2 goals per game. This seems achievable given the teams involved, but it's not guaranteed.

The lack of specific historical data on semi-final scoring makes this prediction more uncertain. However, based on the current tournament trends and team performances, I believe there's a good chance of seeing 4 or more total goals, but it's far from certain.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 70.00%, with 62.50% being the most likely. Probability: 62.50%.

4. Current form:
Spain has won all their matches and seems to be in the best form.
France has struggled to score but has advanced through solid defense and penalties.
Netherlands and England have been less convincing but have potential match-winners.

5. Knockout stage impact:
Semi-finals are often tighter affairs with teams playing more cautiously, which could reduce scoring.

6. Specific matchups:
Spain vs France could be a clash of styles between Spain's high-scoring offense and France's tight defense.
Netherlands vs England could be more open, with both teams having shown inconsistency.

Weighing these factors:

For higher goal totals:
- Spain's high-scoring form (2.2 goals per game)
- Netherlands' decent scoring record (1.8 goals per game)
- Potential for open play in Netherlands vs England match

For lower goal totals:

2. Defensive performances:
- France has kept 4 clean sheets in 5 matches, conceding only 1 goal.
- Spain has conceded goals but their high-scoring nature suggests open games.
- Netherlands and England have been less consistent defensively.

3. Historical data:
- 9 out of 16 semi-finals between Euro 1992 and Euro 2020 finished level after 90 minutes, suggesting potentially tight matches.

4. Current form and expectations:
- Spain is the only team to have won all their matches so far.
- France's defensive solidity but offensive struggles could lead to a low-scoring game.
- Netherlands vs England could be more open given both teams' inconsistent performances.

5. Stage of the tournament:
- Semi-finals can sometimes be tense affairs with teams playing cautiously to avoid elimination.

Balancing these factors:

The Spain vs France match could go either way - Spain's high-scoring form against France's strong defense. The Netherlands vs England match seems more likely to produce goals based on their performances so far.

Given that we need 4 or more goals across both matches combined, there's a significant chance this could happen, but also a real possibility it won't due to the high-stakes nature of semi-finals and France's defensive record.

- Spain has conceded goals but their high-scoring nature suggests open games.
- Netherlands and England have been less consistent defensively.

3. Historical data:
- 9 out of 16 semi-finals between Euro 1992 and Euro 2020 finished level after 90 minutes, suggesting potentially tight matches.

4. Current form and expectations:
- Spain is the only team to have won all their matches so far.
- France's defensive solidity but offensive struggles could lead to a low-scoring game.
- Netherlands vs England could be more open given both teams' inconsistent performances.

5. Stage of the tournament:
- Semi-finals can sometimes be tense affairs with teams playing cautiously to avoid elimination.

Balancing these factors:

The Spain vs France match could go either way - Spain's high-scoring form against France's strong defense. The Netherlands vs England match seems more likely to produce goals based on their performances so far.

Given that we need 4 or more goals across both matches combined, there's a significant chance this could happen, but also a real possibility it won't due to the high-stakes nature of semi-finals and France's defensive record.

Considering all these factors, I estimate there's a moderate to good chance of seeing 4 or more goals across both semi-finals combined.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 70.00%, with 62.50% being the most likely. Probability: 62.50%.
