**Rivian posts 'defining' Q2 earnings even as future remains uncertain**
Rivian published its second quarter earnings, with mixed results. The company produced 9,612 vehicles and delivered 13,790 vehicles, a drop from previous quarters but in line with expectations due to retooling at its manufacturing facility. Rivian unveiled two new in-house motor configurations and launched a second generation of the R1 platform, which includes hundreds of design, engineering, and performance upgrades. Revenue rose to $US1.16 billion, beating market expectations, but gross profit losses increased year-over-year to $US451 million. Net loss for the second quarter of 2024 increased to $US1,547 million. CEO RJ Scaringe said the company will likely see cost reduction from the factory retooling realised in the second half of the year, reaffirming the company's target of reaching a profit in the last quarter of 2024. Scaringe also stated, 'The second quarter has been a defining one for Rivian.' He added, 'We have demonstrated strong execution during the quarter with the plant retooling upgrade and launch of second generation R1 vehicles.' Rivian is also partnering with Volkswagen Group to develop next-generation electrical/electronic architecture for electric vehicles, with Volkswagen committing to invest up to $US5 billion.

**Hold On! Don't Buy Rivian Stock Ahead of Earnings. Wait for the Drop.**
Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is expected to release its second-quarter 2024 earnings after the bell on August 6. Based on its key financial and operational indicators, Rivian stock is a 'Hold' going into the upcoming earnings report. While production and delivery figures have met expectations, profitability still needs to be achieved. The company's recent plant upgrades have improved production efficiency, but Rivian still needs to be more profitable. Analysts' EPS estimates have changed 15 times in the last 90 days, indicating uncertainty among analysts regarding Rivian's financial stability. Rivian's market position is solidifying in the competitive EV sector, but the company's path to profitability is still under construction. The company's strategic initiatives, including developing the R2 platform, are crucial for its long-term lead. Therefore, it is prudent to hold off on buying Rivian stock until after the Q2 earnings report to gauge the company's performance post-earnings before making further investment decisions.

**Rivian (RIVN) to release critical Q2 earnings: Here's what to expect**
Rivian (RIVN) is set to release its critical Q2 2024 earnings on August 6, 2024. The company has been aggressively cutting costs to achieve a gross profit by the end of the year. In the second quarter, Rivian delivered 13,790 vehicles, a slight increase from the first quarter. However, production at its Normal, IL plant fell to 9,612 vehicles, a trend expected after a planned shutdown in April. CEO RJ Scaringe has said that the upgrades have made 'meaningful' impacts on costs and efficiency. Rivian expects to cut costs even more with the introduction of new tech, such as its Maximus motor or 'Enduro Gen 2.' Despite a 'messy' second quarter, Rivian remains on the path to profitability, with executives reiterating that the company will achieve its first positive gross profit by the end of the year. According to Estimize, Rivian is expected to report a loss of $1.17 per share on revenue of $1.18 billion in Q2 2024. Rivian's stock is up 42% over the past three months, but share prices are still down 40% over the past year.

**RIVN Warning: This May Be Your Last Chance to Escape Rivian Stock.**
Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) may be facing a crucial test after its recent stock rally. The company is set to release its second-quarter 2024 financial results on August 6, which could be a major letdown if the market has front-run its assumption of amazing results. Additionally, Rivian is facing a setback in California's legal system, where a judge has ruled that the company will go to trial over allegations that it encouraged employees to steal trade secrets from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). With Rivian's history of income negativity and no expected profits for years, investors should be cautious and consider making defensive portfolio adjustments before the company's results are released.

**Goldman Sachs Maintains Neutral View on Rivian, $13 Price Target**
Goldman Sachs has maintained its neutral view and $13 price target for Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN). The firm's analysis highlighted several key points about the electric vehicle manufacturer's outlook and challenges. Rivian's 2024 targets include modest single-digit volume growth, but the company faces ongoing supply chain issues and broader macroeconomic factors. Looking beyond immediate concerns, Goldman Sachs identified potential long-term growth drivers for Rivian, including the introduction of the R2 platform and the expansion of commercial vehicle sales to non-Amazon customers. Additionally, the potential partnership with Volkswagen is seen as a positive move for Rivian, with the strategic alliance expected to provide liquidity and cost savings through improved operational efficiency. Finally, Goldman Sachs touched on Rivian's profitability targets, with the company aiming for modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024 and profitability for the full year 2025. Other recent news, Rivian Automotive and Volkswagen are taking significant steps in their respective industries. Rivian is reporting progress on its production, strategic partnerships, and path to profitability in its second-quarter earnings report. The company is increasing production of its second-generation R1 vehicles and developing the R2 platform, which is expected to be launched in 2026. Rivian has also entered into a joint venture with Volkswagen Group, which is expected to provide cost savings, operational efficiency, and future revenue streams. On the other hand, Volkswagen's CEO, Oliver Blume, is facing challenges from the IG Metall union in Germany, including potential factory closures. Blume is under pressure to make tough decisions, including a potential $5 billion investment in Rivian and a partnership with Chinese Xpeng. Rivian has also faced some setbacks, including a fire at its Illinois facility that damaged several electric vehicles and a shortage of parts, which has halted production of its electric delivery vans. Despite these challenges, Rivian is optimistic about making up for lost production time and has plans to build another manufacturing facility in Georgia.

**Scout Motors to Unveil New Suv and Pick-up on October 24**
Volkswagen's American brand, Scout Motors, has confirmed that it will unveil its new suv and pick-up on October 24. The brand, which has been inactive for 44 years, will focus exclusively on electric 'light trucks' built in a new factory in South Carolina. According to many American EV experts, the production models derived from the two concepts unveiled on October 24 could help Volkswagen finally conquer the American market. Despite being one of the world's largest automakers, Volkswagen has struggled to gain traction in the US market. However, the Scout suv and pick-up, which are designed for work and leisure, could change this. 'Built for work and leisure, our new Scouts will be robust and versatile,' said Scott Keogh, CEO of Scout Motors, on LinkedIn. 'They must be to wear the Scout brand credibly. With real analog controls and tactile sensations, they will meet the needs of American customers on the road and off-road.' When they enter production in 2026, the two electric Scout models will compete with other EVs in the segment, such as the Rivian R1S and the Ford F-150 Lightning.

**This Wall Street Pro Thinks Rivian Stock Has 42% Upside | The Motley Fool**
One Wall Street analyst, George Gianarikas, is extremely bullish on Rivian stock, predicting a 42% upside over the next 12 months. He believes that Rivian's ability to reach positive gross margins by the fourth quarter of 2024 will be a major catalyst for the stock. This, combined with the upcoming launch of Rivian's mass-market models, the R2, R3, and R3X, will help the company 'push through, shake off operational cobwebs, and breathe life into its mass market lineup.' If Rivian can achieve positive gross margins, its outlook for 2025 and beyond will improve, and its current $13 billion valuation may end up looking like a steal. However, investors will need to be patient to see this story through.

**Story posts: Engaging audiences using an innovative approach with Digital Innovations for Peace**
The Digital Innovations for Peace (DIP) project has been hosting monthly training events for over 3,000 journalists in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region since June 2022. The project has seen impressive results, with over 24,000 followers on Facebook and a collaborative environment among journalists. The project introduced the concept of 'story posts', a novel method of sharing content on social media platforms, which has gained traction on major journalism platforms. The training sessions in April 2024 provided participants with both theoretical understanding and practical skills to create story posts. The sessions were interactive, with participants actively engaging in dialogue and creating their own story posts for review and feedback. The enthusiasm of participants and success of these training sessions highlights the importance of practical skill-building in empowering journalists to use innovative storytelling techniques in their work. As the DIP project continues to expand its reach and impact, the focus on promoting a collaborative and supportive network of journalists remains at its core.

**VW-Owned Scout Motors Confirms Oct 24 Launch Date For New EVs | Carscoops**
Scout Motors, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, has confirmed that it will unveil two electric vehicle concepts on October 24, 2024. The concepts will give a glimpse into the production EVs that will start rolling off the South Carolina line in 2026.

The Scout name has a rich history, dating back to the original International Scout, which was discontinued in 1980. The new Scout Motors company acquired the rights to the Scout name in 2020 when VW bought Navistar.

**Zuck still has a LOT of questions to answer on suppression of The Post's Hunter-laptop scoops**
The New York Post is calling for Mark Zuckerberg to release internal files and emails exposing how Facebook suppressed their Hunter Biden laptop scoops in the runup to the 2020 election. The Post's first laptop story was published on October 14, 2020, and Facebook reduced its distribution on their platform, citing a need for fact-checking. However, the Post is still waiting for an answer on how long the suppression lasted and how many voters would have seen the story if it wasn't suppressed. The Post is also calling for the release of relevant communications, including those from 'private sector' outfits that were funded by the US government and the UK Labour party. The Post wants to know who the fact-checkers were, what their partisan affiliations were, and why Facebook ignored their protestations. Additionally, the Post wants to know why no center-right leaning outfit has ever been approved as a Facebook fact-checker. The Post is comparing Facebook's actions to Twitter's internal files, which exposed a vast web of government-driven censorship.

**Rivian: 2025 May Be A Painful Transition Year**
Rivian's (RIVN) stock price continues to lack bullish support despite a $5 billion investment from Volkswagen (VWAGY). This is due to Rivian's projected lack of profitability until 2027. While management guides a 'modest positive gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024,' it is expected to be a slim profit margin. Additionally, Rivian's main facility will not be producing vehicles for more than a month in the second half of 2025, implying further cash burn. Despite optimism about its competitive pickup truck, EDV, and future R2/R3 pipelines, the intermediate term prospects are likely to be limited. With a downtrend in stock prices, things may get worse before they get better.

**How Rivian Can Not Only Survive but Thrive Before the R2 Hits Roads**
Rivian investors are experiencing anxiety due to the stock's 85% decline since its 2021 IPO. However, the company's agreement with Amazon to deliver 100,000 electric delivery vans (EDVs) by 2030 remains a significant opportunity. Although the agreement is no longer exclusive, Rivian has secured a deal with AT&T, and management expects more large deals to be inked in 2025. The company is also improving its economics by ramping up production and reducing costs, with a 35% reduction in material costs for vans and a 30% increase in assembly rate. Additionally, Rivian has removed over 100 steps in the battery-making process, 52 pieces of equipment from the body shop, and over 500 parts from vehicle designs, leading to a significant cost reduction. As the company prepares for the launch of the R2 SUV in 2026, it is expected to spark growth and improve investor confidence in 2025.

**âBaffling!' blast drivers as Rivian makes U-turn on design promise for new EV â buyers are threatening to cancel orders**
Rivian has made a U-turn on a design promise for their new EV, the R2, which has left hopeful buyers threatening to cancel their orders. The company initially showcased a prototype with fold-flat front seats, but Chief Engineer of Special Projects, Brian Gates, confirmed that this feature won't make it to production. Gates said, 'The front seats won't fold flat,' and instead, the back seat will fold at a four-degree angle. This decision has been met with frustration from potential customers, with one driver saying, 'This is one feature I absolutely wanted. This decision is baffling!' and another saying, 'This is really worth canceling orders.' Despite this, Rivian has announced that over 70,000 customers have placed pre-orders for the R2, which is set to enter the market in 2026.

**Rivian posts 'defining' Q2 earnings even as future remains uncertain**
Rivian published its second quarter earnings, with mixed results. The company produced 9,612 vehicles and delivered 13,790 vehicles, a drop from previous quarters but in line with expectations due to retooling at its manufacturing facility. Rivian unveiled two new in-house motor configurations and launched a second generation of the R1 platform, which includes hundreds of design, engineering, and performance upgrades. Revenue rose to $US1.16 billion, beating market expectations, but gross profit losses increased year-over-year to $US451 million. Net loss for the second quarter of 2024 increased to $US1,547 million. CEO RJ Scaringe said the company will likely see cost reduction from the factory retooling realised in the second half of the year, reaffirming the company's target of reaching a profit in the last quarter of 2024. Scaringe also stated, 'The second quarter has been a defining one for Rivian.' He added, 'We have demonstrated strong execution during the quarter with the plant retooling upgrade and launch of second generation R1 vehicles.' Rivian is also partnering with Volkswagen Group to develop next-generation electrical/electronic architecture for electric vehicles, with Volkswagen committing to invest up to $US5 billion.

**Earnings call: Rivian outlines progress and VW joint venture in Q2 report By Investing.com**
Rivian Automotive Inc. released its second quarter 2024 earnings report, highlighting progress in production, strategic partnerships, and a clear path to profitability. CEO RJ Scaringe and CFO Claire McDonough discussed the company's developments, including the production ramp-up of the second-generation R1 vehicles and the forthcoming R2 platform. Rivian also highlighted its joint venture with Volkswagen Group, expected to yield material cost savings, operating efficiencies, and future revenues. The company reaffirmed its production guidance for 2024 and outlined investment plans and cost reduction strategies aimed at achieving long-term profitability targets. Rivian's financial health and market performance are key to understanding its future prospects. The company has a market capitalization of approximately $14.73 billion and a negative P/E ratio of -2.49, reflecting its current lack of profitability. However, Rivian holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which is a positive sign for the company's financial stability. The company expects to see significant cost reductions in its R1 platform during the second half of 2024 and remains confident in its path to deliver modest positive gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024 and for the full year of 2025.

**Rivian Describes Progress and VW Joint Venture in 2nd Quarter Report**
Rivian Automotive Inc. reported its second-quarter progress, highlighting advancements in production, strategic partnerships, and a clear path to profitability. The company's CEO, RJ Scaringe, and CFO, Claire McDonough, detailed the developments, including the increase in production of the R1 second-generation vehicles and the upcoming R2 platform. The Rivian also emphasized its joint venture with the Volkswagen Group, which is expected to generate cost savings, operational efficiency, and future revenue. The company reaffirmed its production guidance for 2024 and outlined plans for investment and cost reduction strategies to achieve long-term profitability goals. Key takeaways include the increase in production of R1 second-generation vehicles, the development of the R2 platform, and the expected benefits of the joint venture with Volkswagen. The company also reported improvements in financial performance, including a 41% increase in operating cash flow and a reduction in the loss per unit by approximately $6,000. The Rivian maintains its production guidance for 2024 of 57,000 units and expects low single-digit delivery growth. The company is operating the R1 line in a two-shift operation and the commercial van line in a limited one-shift operation. In 2025, the Rivian's normal facilities will be closed for more than a month to integrate new equipment for the R2 launch. The company has more than $200 million in regulatory credits under contract for 2024, contributing to potential revenue. The Rivian reaffirmed its production guidance and delivery expectations for 2024, focusing on achieving a gross margin of 25%, a high teenage EBITDA margin, and a free cash flow margin of approximately 10%. The shutdown of the factory in 2025 for R2 integration may cause fluctuations in gross margins due to lower production volumes. The company is investing in the expansion of its spaces, service infrastructure, and fast-charging network to improve customer experience and brand exposure. Lowlights include the reported loss per unit, but progress in reducing this loss. There will be a temporary factory shutdown in 2025 to facilitate R2 integration, which may impact financial results. Highlights include the expected completion of the Rivian-Volkswagen joint venture in the fourth quarter, with terms to be disclosed at the time. The company expects to see a progression in profitability through cost variable improvement, cost fixed leverage, and increased revenue per unit delivery. Suppliers are eager to scale beyond Rivian's product line through the joint venture, which has already shown positive effects on the supply chain and technical integration. Losses include the specific demand trends since the update, which were not discussed, and no concrete metric was provided. Question and answer highlights include the strong demand for regulatory credits, which may generate more revenue than expected. The Rivian is building its Adventure Network, which will be opened to non-Rivian clients, indicating a broader market approach. The company has clear visibility on cost reduction efforts due to contracts with partner suppliers. The Rivian Automotive Inc. continues to focus on its strategic objectives, cost reduction efforts, and expansion of its product line and customer experience offerings. With strong partnerships and operational improvements, the Rivian is walking towards a future of profitability and growth in the electric vehicle market.

**Rivian Announces Production Halt and Decline in Deliveries**
Rivian, an American electric vehicle manufacturer, has announced a production halt for over a month in 2025 to prepare for the production of its next small car, which is set to be released in 2026. The company also expects a decline in deliveries for the third quarter of this year, without specifying a figure, as it rushes to rebuild its inventory after closing its factory in April due to cost reduction needs. Rivian is currently losing thousands of dollars per vehicle, with a loss of around 39% over the selling price of each electric car. The company has partnered with Volkswagen, which will inject $5 billion to create a 'joint venture' for the production of next-generation battery-powered cars. RJ Scaringe, Rivian's CEO, stated, 'The current environment is extremely competitive in terms of prices.' He criticized the 'very low-cost' competition that has led to the bankruptcy of several automakers in recent years, including Fisker. Rivian plans to expand its operations in Europe from 2026, when it will have up to three models available for sale in both North America and Europe.

**Rivian sticks to production forecast, posts second-quarter margin below estimates**
Rivian Automotive maintained its production forecast for the year, despite losing more per electric car delivered than analysts had expected. The company introduced lease offers to boost sales, helping it beat revenue estimates. Rivian halted production in the second quarter to implement efficiency-boosting assembly line upgrades, which it expects to help post its first profit margin in the last three months of the year. The company's loss amounted to 39% of a vehicle's sales price, greater than the LSEG estimates of 34%. Rivian's revenue for the quarter ended June 30 stood at $1.16 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $1.14 billion. The company's cash and cash equivalents were $5.76 billion as of June 30, compared with $7.86 billion at 2023-end. Volkswagen Group's $5 billion investment in Rivian could help sustain the U.S. EV maker's cash balance till it starts selling its R2 mid-size SUVs.

**Rivian sticks to flat production outlook for 2024, expects...**
Rivian has stuck to its forecast that production will not rise this year and expects deliveries in the third quarter to be slightly lower. The company is dealing with a depleted inventory base and is expecting a slight fall in deliveries in the current quarter. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, said that cost reduction from the factory retooling will be realized largely in the second half of the year, and the company is targeting to turn its first profit in the last three months of the year. Despite losing thousands of dollars for every vehicle it makes, Rivian is expected to see improved gross margins as it gets more volume on the R1 platform. 'Gross margins will really take off as they get volume as they are making a lot more money on the R1 platform now,' said investor Vitaly Golomb.

**Hold On! Don't Buy Rivian Stock Ahead of Earnings. Wait for the Drop.**
Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is expected to release its second-quarter 2024 earnings after the bell on August 6. Based on its key financial and operational indicators, Rivian stock is a 'Hold' going into the upcoming earnings report. While production and delivery figures have met expectations, profitability still needs to be achieved. The company's recent plant upgrades have improved production efficiency, but Rivian still needs to be more profitable. Analysts' EPS estimates have changed 15 times in the last 90 days, indicating uncertainty among analysts regarding Rivian's financial stability. Rivian's market position is solidifying in the competitive EV sector, but the company's path to profitability is still under construction. The company's strategic initiatives, including developing the R2 platform, are crucial for its long-term lead. Therefore, it is prudent to hold off on buying Rivian stock until after the Q2 earnings report to gauge the company's performance post-earnings before making further investment decisions.

**Rivian Sticks to Production Forecast, Posts Second-Quarter Margin Below Estimates**
Rivian Automotive maintained its production forecast for the year, but posted a wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter. The company lost $1.46 billion, with its loss amounting to 39% of a vehicle's sales price, exceeding the estimated 34%. CEO RJ Scaringe stated, 'The challenge, of course, then is that in Q3 the inventory is depleted. So, we're rebuilding our inventory base. We expect deliveries in Q3 to be slightly below that in Q2.' Rivian introduced lease offers to boost sales and clear inventory, beating revenue estimates. However, the company's cash balance decreased to $5.76 billion as of June 30, from $7.86 billion at the end of 2023. Rivian's partnership with Volkswagen Group, which includes a $5 billion investment, may help sustain the company's cash balance until it starts selling its R2 mid-size SUVs.

**Rivian Q2 earnings preview: Cost control, profit outlook, and VW deal in focus**
Rivian is set to release its Q2 earnings update, with expected revenue of $1.165 billion, a 76% increase from last year. However, the company is still expected to report a loss, with an adjusted loss per share of $1.20 and an adjusted net income loss of $1.194 billion. Rivian has reaffirmed its adjusted EBITDA loss forecast of $2.7 billion for 2024, but sees its capital expenditure outlays improving to $1.2 billion. The company has also announced a joint venture deal with Volkswagen, which will invest $1 billion in Rivian through an unsecured convertible note, with up to $4 billion in additional investment staged through 2026. This deal is seen as a positive development for Rivian, providing access to capital to fund the ramp-up of production for its next-generation vehicles, the R2 and R3 mass-market SUVs. As stated by Bank of America analyst John Murphy, 'This news is meaningfully positive for RIVN as the agreement should provide the company with access to capital to not only fund the ramp-up of production of the R2 at its Normal, IL facility but also to build a new facility in Georgia for its mid-size vehicle platform.'

**Rivian (RIVN) to release critical Q2 earnings: Here's what to expect**
Rivian (RIVN) is set to release its critical Q2 2024 earnings on August 6, 2024. The company has been aggressively cutting costs to achieve a gross profit by the end of the year. In the second quarter, Rivian delivered 13,790 vehicles, a slight increase from the first quarter. However, production at its Normal, IL plant fell to 9,612 vehicles, a trend expected after a planned shutdown in April. CEO RJ Scaringe has said that the upgrades have made 'meaningful' impacts on costs and efficiency. Rivian expects to cut costs even more with the introduction of new tech, such as its Maximus motor or 'Enduro Gen 2.' Despite a 'messy' second quarter, Rivian remains on the path to profitability, with executives reiterating that the company will achieve its first positive gross profit by the end of the year. According to Estimize, Rivian is expected to report a loss of $1.17 per share on revenue of $1.18 billion in Q2 2024. Rivian's stock is up 42% over the past three months, but share prices are still down 40% over the past year.

Rivian, an electric vehicle manufacturer, is set to launch its smaller model, the Rivian R2 SUV, in 2026. However, the company's CEO, RJ Scaringe, has confirmed that the R3X variant will launch first, ahead of the regular R3 model. The R3X is a rally-like hot hatch that will be introduced as soon as possible after the R2's launch. This news comes after Rivian's partnership with Volkswagen, which will invest $5 billion in the company.

**Rivian Shines Again in Recent Registration Data. Is the Stock Still a Buy?**
Rivian has bucked the trend in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, with positive news and strong registration data. The company exceeded expectations with second-quarter deliveries and inked a massive deal with Volkswagen AG, driving the stock up 93% in three months. The latest registration data shows Rivian outperforming its rivals, with a 87% year-over-year gain, despite only offering a modest $4,060 incentive on its R1T. Rivian's recent refresh of its R1 vehicles, including the introduction of premium trims, could keep demand stable until the launch of its R2 crossover in 2026. The company's solid results, joint venture with Volkswagen, and R1 refresh make it a promising buy in the start-up EV industry.

**RIVN Red Alert: Prepare to Sell Rivian Stock by August 2024**
Rivian Automotive (RIVN) stock has doubled since its April lows and is expected to release its second-quarter results on August 6. Analysts are bullish on the company's partnership with Volkswagen, but also expect earnings to worsen. If Rivian shows improvement, the stock could rally higher. However, the company is still losing money on every vehicle sold, and price cuts may not be enough to sustain demand. The article advises investors to take profits if Rivian stock reaches $20 a share and closes in on its previous high, as there will be limited additional upside.
