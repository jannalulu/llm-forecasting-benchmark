Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timing: Today is July 18, 2024, and we're forecasting about an event before August 3, 2024 - just about 2 weeks away.

2. Historical Context:
- Verisign has managed .com since 1995
- The Cooperative Agreement has been renewed multiple times
- The arrangement has been stable and critical to internet infrastructure

3. Key Considerations:
- Such a major change to internet infrastructure would typically require significant advance notice
- No public signals of imminent change have been reported
- The short timeframe (2 weeks) makes dramatic changes unlikely
- Infrastructure stability is a key priority for the DOC
- Any transition would need careful planning to avoid disruption

4. Risk Factors:
- Government policy can change suddenly
- Theoretical possibility of undisclosed issues
- Very short time window reduces uncertainty range

Given the extremely short timeframe, the critical nature of .com management, and absence of any public signals suggesting imminent change, I assess the probability as very low.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%
