**Philippines to File Diplomatic Protest Against China Over Airborne Provocation**
The Philippines will submit a diplomatic protest to China after Chinese military aircraft conducted threatening maneuvers against a Philippine Air Force plane during a patrol mission over Panatag Shoal. According to Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo, the incident, which occurred on Thursday, caught the Philippine authorities by surprise, as it happened just after a meeting between Manila and Beijing to better manage maritime disputes. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. emphasized the importance of condemning the provocative action of the Chinese aircraft, calling it 'perilous and illegal.' The incident raised concerns about the safety of Filipino crew members and the need to respond to such provocations. As reported by The Philippine Star, the Philippines and China recently held a meeting to discuss tensions in the South China Sea, aiming to restore trust and promote dialogue.

**Philippines to protest China's manoeuvres over disputed sea**
The Philippines plans to protest a recent incident in the South China Sea where a Chinese aircraft fired flares at a Philippine air force plane conducting a routine patrol over Scarborough Shoal. Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro stated, 'Naturally we cannot let this be. Even if it is just a diplomatic protest, we cannot not do it because otherwise will acquiesce this.' Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr 'strongly condemned' the incident, calling the Chinese aircraft's actions 'unjustified, illegal and reckless.' The Chinese military claimed the Philippine aircraft entered the airspace without authorization and were 'professionally and in accordance with the law' warned and expelled. The incident has raised concerns about instability in the region, with President Marcos stating, 'We have barely started to calm the waters, and it is already worrying that there could be instability in our airspace.'

**A complex, fluid dispute in South China Sea**
The Philippines and China are engaged in a complex and fluid dispute over the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea. The Philippines has been resupplying its troops on the shoal without prior notification to China, which has led to tensions between the two countries. China has insisted that the Philippines must receive prior approval from Beijing for troop rotation and reprovisioning, which Manila has rejected. The dispute has a long history, dating back to 1998 when the Philippines deliberately sunk a ship to prevent China's expansionist territorial ambitions. The Philippines has accused China of using water cannons and laser lights against their vessels, and a Chinese coastguard rammed a Filipino navy boat in June 2024, injuring a soldier. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Second Thomas Shoal is an underwater feature that cannot be occupied without a structure above it, and the sunken ship provides the necessary platform for Filipino soldiers to stay afloat. The dispute is not just about humanitarian considerations, but also about ownership of the feature and competing strategic designs in the South China Sea. The spat over reprovisioning goes beyond the Second Thomas Shoal and is ingrained in the foreign policy motivations of both countries, making it difficult to reconcile their political differences. The situation is unlikely to be resolved soon if both sides continue to bicker and disagree with each other. A multifaceted approach that emphasizes diplomacy, adherence to international law, and trust-building measures is needed to manage their disagreements and work towards a peaceful and stable resolution.

**Marcos, Duterte's bitter break-up portends major shake-up in Philippine politics**
The alliance between Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr and Vice-President Sara Duterte-Carpio has dissolved, according to observers. The break-up was evident when Duterte-Carpio did not attend President Marcos' State of the Nation Address (SONA) on July 22. The feud between the two powerful families has been escalating for months, with both sides accusing each other of being a drug user. The tensions have led to a series of events, including the release of a deepfake video purporting to show Marcos doing drugs, and the recall of 75 officers assigned to Duterte-Carpio's security detail. The vice-president has publicly pleaded for more security to protect her family, citing a photo surreptitiously taken of them at Manila's airport as an example of the threats they face. The government has also announced that it will not get in the way of the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the Duterte administration's bloody war on drugs. Observers say that the administration will have to double down on two of its most popular stances to win over public opinion: confronting Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea and banning Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (Pogos). However, the narrative the Marcos administration is building on these issues may not be enough to win over public opinion, as the Dutertes are known to be masters of courting public opinion. The break-up of the UniTeam alliance has significant implications for the country's future, as both families are now attempting to strengthen their own political coalitions ahead of the 2025 midterm elections. 'There is definitely no more UniTeam,' Maria Ela Atienza, a University of the Philippines political science professor, said. 'Both the president and vice-president can no longer diplomatically state that it is business as usual.'

**Weapons whiplash: US recalls potent midrange missiles from Philippines**
The US is recalling a midrange missile system from the Philippines, which was deployed for joint military exercises. The system, capable of firing SM-6 anti-aircraft missiles and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, was deployed in April and will be returned to the US in September. No reason was given for the recall. China has criticized the deployment, calling it a threat to regional security and stability. The US and Russia have been expanding their production and use of arms since a treaty banning certain types of missiles expired in 2019.

**Philippines lodges diplomatic protest with China over 'dangerous' air maneuvers**
The Philippines has filed a diplomatic protest with China over what it calls 'dangerous maneuvers' and flares against Filipino aircraft flying over the disputed South China Sea. According to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Teresita Daza, the protest was lodged in response to Chinese military planes allegedly conducting 'dangerous maneuvers' and dropping flares in the path of the Philippine Air Force aircraft, NC-212i, when the two were flying over Scarborough Shoal. China's People's Liberation Army Southern Theater Command stated that it deployed maritime and aerial forces to 'identify, verify, track, monitor, warn, and drive away the intruding aircraft in accordance with the law,' claiming the operation was carried out professionally and in adherence to legal standards.

**Philippines to File Diplomatic Protest With China Over Air Force Display**
The Philippines will file a diplomatic protest with China over a recent incident where two Chinese aircraft dropped flares in the path of a Philippine patrol plane. Philippine officials have denounced the move as 'unjustified, illegal' and 'very dangerous.' Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro called on China to abide by international laws, stating that this is part of a 'continuous pattern' of behavior demonstrated by Beijing in the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea as its own, antagonizing neighboring countries and disregarding a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. Philippines President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. condemned the Chinese military's provocation, and Teodoro urged China to 'abide by international law' and 'deescalate,' acknowledging China's unwillingness to do so over the years. 'They will stick to their narrative that we know there is no international support whatsoever. All they have on their side is brute force and strength and might,' Teodoro said.

**Philippines to Present Diplomatic Protest to China Over South China Sea Incident**
The Philippines will present a diplomatic protest to China after Chinese military aircraft launched flares near a Philippine military plane in the disputed South China Sea. 'We will definitely protest this latest incident that occurred at a time of calm (in the conflict between our countries),' said Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo. The Philippine Defense Secretary, Gilberto Teodoro, stated that the National Maritime Council is analyzing the incident, but provided no further details. The Philippine military reported that two Chinese aircraft executed a 'dangerous maneuver' and 'launched flares' near a Philippine military plane that was conducting a routine patrol. The Chinese military claimed that the Philippine plane had illegally invaded their territory despite repeated warnings. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. described the Chinese actions as 'unjustified, illegal, and reckless.' Tensions have been rising between China and the Philippines in recent months, particularly over the old Philippine ship Sierra Madre, which has been stranded on the Second Thomas reef in the South China Sea since 1999. The Philippine government claims that Second Thomas and Scarborough Shoal, occupied by China, are within their exclusive economic zone, which gives them the right to exploit the resources under international law. China claims historical reasons for nearly the entire South China Sea, through which 30% of global trade passes and which contains 12% of the world's fishing grounds, as well as oil and gas reserves.

**Asean: Vientiane hosts foreign ministers, focus on Myanmar and South China Sea crises**
The foreign ministers of the Philippines and China have confirmed that they have reached an agreement to reduce tensions at the Second Thomas Shoal. The agreement follows a series of meetings between delegations from the two countries and intense exchanges of notes aimed at finding a mutually acceptable agreement without giving up their respective territorial claims. The Philippines has denied, contrary to what Beijing has claimed, that the agreement includes a commitment to inform Chinese authorities in advance of military resupply missions to the Second Thomas Shoal. During his third State of the Nation address, held on Sunday before the Congress, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that diplomacy is 'the only acceptable way to resolve' disputes. However, the head of state clarified that the Philippines 'will assert its rights and sovereignty as it has always done'.

**US Criticizes China's Actions in South China Sea, Calls for Responsible Behavior**
The US has criticized China's actions in the South China Sea, calling them irresponsible, aggressive, and destabilizing. US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink made the statement on June 22 in Hanoi, amid rising tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea. Kritenbrink said that the US will continue to support its Filipino allies and has publicly and privately told Beijing that the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty is 'ironclad'. He also emphasized that every country in the region, including China, must respect international law and behave responsibly in the maritime sphere. The US and Vietnam have officially elevated their relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level of diplomatic relations, during President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi in September 2023. Kritenbrink called the upgrade 'historic and momentous' and wants to maintain the momentum to ensure that all agreements are implemented. The US and Vietnam have a strong partnership, and Kritenbrink believes that it has never been stronger.

**Philippines Intensifies Strategy in South China Sea Dispute**
The Philippines has adopted a more assertive stance in the South China Sea dispute, challenging China's maritime claims by increasing transparency and strengthening its military alliance with the United States. This move was triggered by a February 2023 decision to release photos of a military-grade laser directed at a Filipino ship, as reported by National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya. The transparency campaign, led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, aims to build international support by documenting encounters with Chinese forces and incorporating foreign journalists in coast guard missions. The Philippines' efforts have included releasing images showing aggressive actions by Chinese vessels, such as water cannon use against Filipino ships. The intensification of the disputes has been marked by incidents near Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippine Navy maintains a presence on the grounded BRP Sierra Madre. Recent confrontations have increased, with the Philippine Coast Guard reporting a surge in Chinese vessels from an average of one in 2021 to approximately 14 in 2023, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The conflict has drawn international attention, with statements of support from various countries and a renewed defense agreement with the US, providing access to additional military bases in the Philippines. This has raised concerns about possible US involvement under the mutual defense treaty in case the situation escalates. Although the Philippines has gained diplomatic support, they remain cautious about possible Chinese economic retaliation, their second-largest export market in 2023. The recent political approach also risks provoking China to adopt a 'tougher approach', according to political scientist Edcel John Ibarra. However, Philippine Ambassador to Washington José Manuel Romualdez expressed hope to maintain economic relations alongside efforts to resolve the dispute peacefully. This assertive stance by the Philippines has surprised neighboring countries with similar maritime disputes, signaling a potential new approach to dealing with tensions with Beijing. The situation remains a delicate balancing act, with the Philippines seeking to assert its sovereignty while avoiding an escalation that could lead to hostility.
