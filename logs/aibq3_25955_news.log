**Bill Emmott: Japan, US roles in SE Asia to grow amid China's power imbalance**
The Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional defense summit, saw notable moments, including aggressive words about Taiwan from China's defense minister and protests about civilian deaths in Gaza. President Bongbong Marcos of the Philippines stated that if a Filipino serviceman were killed by a Chinese water cannon, it would be considered an act of war, which could invoke the 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines. This raises concerns about the potential for war between the US and China over the South China Sea. China has a long-standing claim to the area, and its recent decree authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain foreign nationals who flout marine demarcations has led to a collision between a Chinese and a Philippine ship. The article argues that the huge power imbalance between China and the South-East Asian nations, which is reflected in their military spending, will take time to redress, and in the meantime, the US and Japan will play a crucial role in the region.

**US Commander Threatens to Turn Taiwan Strait into 'Hell of Drones' if China Attacks**
The new commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Paparo, has threatened to turn the Taiwan Strait into a 'hell of drones' if China attacks the island. If China's President Xi Jinping invades Taiwan, Beijing will face a large and lethal force of drones that will crush its army. The strategy, called 'Hellscape', is designed to distract China and give the US time to respond. Paparo wants to make the Taiwan Strait a 'hell' using classified capabilities, which would make China's life miserable for a month, giving the US time to deploy a broader military response. This plan involves launching thousands of unmanned systems from surface ships and submarines to aerial drones to fight against Chinese forces in the event of an invasion. The US is preparing for the worst-case scenario, with the Pentagon planning to spend $1 billion this year on the Replicator program, which aims to implement thousands of autonomous systems. If this strategy is not ready in the short term, the prospects of a long conflict would increase, and could involve Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, according to US think tanks. China's most likely strategy is to launch a massive surprise attack on Taiwan, said Paparo, who assumes that President Xi does not want to repeat the mistake of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine in 2022, when the initial large-scale invasion of Russia failed and became a long and costly war.

**US Prepares for War with China Amid Taiwan Provocation**
The US is preparing for war with China amid Washington's provocation over Taiwan. The US Navy and Philippine Marines have been conducting war games on small islands near Taiwan, according to a British newspaper, citing reports from Wall Street Journal correspondents embedded with a US military regiment. The exercises include the deployment of naval infantry teams by Chinook helicopters, preparing disarmed assault weapons, and monitoring terrain that would be hypothetically used if conflict broke out. The developments are a disturbing view from the perspective of US military leaders, as any direct conflict between the US and China could easily escalate into a Third World War with both nations possessing nuclear weapons that could destroy the planet. The US has historically been ambiguous about its stance on intervening in Taiwan, but President Joe Biden broke with tradition by stating he would be willing to send US troops. The US military is restructuring to prepare for a large-scale war in the Pacific after decades of combat against irregular forces in the Middle East, according to the WSJ. 'We're moving away from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency,' said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, referring to the roles that have been in high demand in US wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. 'We want to be positioned for large-scale combat operations.' Military personalities in the US predict that the country will need to confront China militarily in the coming years to contain its economic growth. 'The Rand Corporation warned about ten years ago that they needed to go to war with China by 2025 to prevail,' observed analyst K.J. Noh.

**US Prepares for War with China over Taiwan**
The United States is preparing for war with China over Taiwan. US Marines and the Philippines held military exercises on small islands near Taiwan, simulating a hypothetical conflict scenario. The exercises included landing from helicopters, storming, and reconnaissance, according to the Wall Street Journal. The US Marines' goal would be to slow down a potential Chinese invasion, giving other US military forces time to prepare and respond. The deployment of a small, hidden group of Marines on the front line would serve as a tactical foundation in case of war, said Benjamin Jensen, a senior research fellow at the Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies. The exercises were conducted by the 3rd Amphibious Assault Battalion, which was formed only two years ago to reform the US military presence in the region and has already trained on the Hawaiian Islands and in California. Last year, US forces gained access to several Filipino military bases, and the exercises took place north of them, on a series of islands about an hour's drive from Taiwan, according to the publication. On Friday, May 24, 46 Chinese military aircraft crossed the middle line of the Taiwan Strait, which had previously served as an unofficial barrier between the two sides, reported the Ministry of Defense of Taiwan. In addition, Su-30 fighter jets and H-6 nuclear bombers flew over the region and over the Bashi Strait, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines. China has been conducting regular military exercises around Taiwan for the past four years.

**Singapore, Vietnam call for peace in Taiwan Strait**
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong and Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs have called for regional peace and stability as China conducts large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. The exercises, titled 'Joint Sword-2024A', were announced on May 23 and involve land, sea, air, and missile forces. The conflict in the Taiwan Strait has the potential to have dire consequences for each country involved and the world at large. Gan called for dialogue between China and the US to resolve the issue, and welcomed visits from the Japanese Self-Defense Force to promote regional peace and security.

**Chinese carrier passes close to PH Sea; military airs ‘con**
The Armed Forces of the Philippines expressed concern over China's deployment of a carrier strike group in the Philippine Sea, where it conducted training exercises with Russian Navy ships. The Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong passed close to the northern Philippines, specifically Balintang Channel, on its way to the Philippine Sea. The military emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region and urged all parties to adhere to international laws and norms. Taiwan's defense ministry detected 36 Chinese military aircraft flying to the south and southeast of the island heading to the Western Pacific to carry out drills with the Shandong. Japan's Self Defense Forces also detected the Shandong and its escort vessels around 500 km south of its Okinawa islands. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr dismissed China's negative comments on the signing of the Reciprocal Access Agreement between Philippines and Japan, saying it is an internal matter. Tension between the Philippines and China remains high over the dispute over the West Philippine Sea in the South China Sea.

**Japan and Philippines Sign Defense Pact Amid Rising Tensions with China**
Japan and the Philippines signed a defense pact on Monday, allowing for the deployment of Japanese forces for joint military exercises, including live-fire drills, in the Southeast Asian country. The agreement, known as the Reciprocal Access Agreement, was signed by Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa in a ceremony in Manila attended by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The pact will take effect after ratification by the legislatures of both countries, according to Japanese and Philippine officials. Kamikawa described the signing of the defense agreement as 'a historic achievement' that should consolidate defense cooperation between Tokyo and Manila. 'A free and open international order based on the rule of law is the foundation of regional peace and prosperity,' she said. 'We would like to work closely with your country to maintain and strengthen it.' The defense pact with the Philippines is Japan's first in Asia. Tokyo has signed similar agreements with Australia in 2022 and the UK in 2023. Japan has been strengthening its security and military capabilities under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, including a counterattack capability that breaks with Japan's traditional focus on self-defense, in response to North Korean threats and China's growing assertiveness. The country is increasing its defense spending by 2% annually for five years until 2027, aiming to become the third-largest military spender in the world, behind the US and China. Many of Japan's Asian neighbors, including the Philippines, were victims of Japanese aggression until Japan was defeated in World War II, and Tokyo's efforts to strengthen its military role and budget could be a sensitive issue. However, Japan and the Philippines have been increasing their defense and security ties. The initiative by Kishida advances in parallel with Marcos' efforts to sign security alliances that support the limited capacity of the Philippine government to defend its territorial interests in the South China Sea. The disputed waters are a key route for global trade, and China has claimed almost the entire area, although the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan also claim some zones. The US has been strengthening a series of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better face China, including any possible confrontation over Taiwan, and to reassure its Asian allies. Japan and the Philippines are treaty allies of the US, and their leaders held trilateral talks in April at the White House, where President Biden reiterated the 'ironclad' commitment of Washington to defend Japan and the Philippines.

**Philippines and Japan Sign Defense Pact to Counter China**
The Philippines and Japan have signed a defense pact to counter China, allowing for the deployment of troops on each other's territory for training and military exercises. The Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) was signed by Philippine Defense Minister Gilberto Teodoro and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa at a ceremony at the Malacañang Palace in Manila. The agreement still needs to be ratified by the parliaments of both countries. The pact is seen as a step towards ensuring an international order based on rules, maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, and countering China's growing influence. The Philippines and Japan are long-time allies of the United States, which has strengthened its alliances with Canberra. The Philippines has already signed similar agreements with Canberra and Washington and is considering one with France. The agreement comes amid tensions in the South China Sea, where incidents between Chinese and Philippine vessels have increased, and concerns over Taiwan's status. The pact is seen as crucial for the Philippines' defense and could play a significant role in any potential conflict involving the United States.

**Philippines and Japan Sign Defense Pact Amid Tensions with China**
The governments of the Philippines and Japan signed a military cooperation agreement, allowing the deployment of their troops in each other's countries, amid growing tensions with China in the Indo-Pacific. The pact, signed during the visit of Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa to Manila, enables both countries to deploy troops for exercises and training. This will facilitate Japan's participation in the annual Balikatan military exercises, where it has previously participated as an observer alongside Philippine and US troops. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. emphasized the 'hard work' of both countries in achieving this defense pact and praised the 'confidence and importance' it brings to both governments. The agreement aims to 'maintain and strengthen the international order based on the rule of law'. The two countries, historical allies of the US, have been strengthening their defense ties in recent months in response to China's growing assertiveness. The disputed South China Sea is a key area of contention, with the Philippines, China, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan all having claims to the region. Tensions between China and the Philippines have increased since Marcos Jr. took office in 2022, with the Philippines strengthening its military alliance with the US and expanding access to its bases for US troops, including some with strategic access to the South China Sea or Taiwan.

The Reciprocal Access Agreement allows for the deployment of troops in each other's territory for training and military exercises. The pact is a significant step in their efforts to ensure a rules-based international order, peace, and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.

The Japanese ambassador to the Philippines, Kazuya Endo, highlighted the significant developments in defense material provision from Japan to the Philippines. The Philippines has been at the center of US efforts to build alliances due to its strategic location in the South China Sea and proximity to Taiwan, which China claims as its territory.

**Philippines and Japan Sign Historic Defense Pact Amid Growing Tensions with China**
The Philippines and Japan have signed a historic defense pact, allowing for the stationing of troops in each other's countries for joint exercises and disaster relief. The agreement comes amid growing tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea. Philippine Defense Minister Gilberto Teodoro described the deal as 'another milestone in our joint efforts to ensure a rule-based international order.' Japan's Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa also hailed the agreement as a milestone. The pact aims to promote 'peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and especially in our region,' said Teodoro. The deal is significant not only because of the growing tensions with China but also due to Japan's historical occupation of the Philippines during World War II, during which Japanese forces committed numerous war crimes. The Philippines is a key partner for the US in the event of a conflict with China over Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory.

**China rejects 'military blocs' in Asia after Tokyo agreement**
China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, stated that 'exchanges and cooperation between countries should not compromise mutual understanding and trust among regional countries, nor disturb regional peace and stability, or target and harm the interests of third parties.' He emphasized that the region 'does not need military blocs' or ' cliques that provoke confrontations between parties and instigate a new Cold War.' Lin warned that any action that undermines regional peace and stability and destroys regional unity and cooperation will attract common vigilance and opposition from regional countries. He also urged Japan to 'reflect on its history of aggression' and be prudent in its words and actions regarding military security. The statement comes amid tensions between Japan and the Philippines, allies of the United States, over the South China Sea, where China has been increasingly assertive in its territorial claims. The Philippines and China have been in a growing dispute over sovereignty in the South China Sea, where Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan also have claims. The tensions between China and the Philippines have increased since Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office in 2022 and strengthened his military alliance with the US.

**Japan and the Philippines Sign Defense Agreement to Counter China's Growing Military Power**
Japan and the Philippines signed a defense agreement to focus on China's growing military power in the region. The agreement allows for the deployment of troops on each other's soil, amid shared concerns about China's military expansion. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kishida and Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro signed the agreement on Monday during a ceremony in Manila. The agreement enables Japanese troops to deploy in the Philippines for joint military exercises, and Philippine troops to conduct combat training in Japan. The agreement requires ratification by the legislative bodies of both countries to take effect. The agreement comes as Japan and the Philippines, both US allies, express concern over China's growing influence in the region. China claims more than 90% of the South China Sea, including waters within the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines and four other Southeast Asian countries. In 2016, an international court in The Hague ruled that China's claims had no legal basis. The Chinese and Philippine coast guards and navies have been involved in several confrontations in disputed waters, including a recent incident where Chinese coast guards used knives and harpoons and rammed two Philippine Navy supply ships. Japan has a long-standing territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands, located between Taiwan and Okinawa. Under Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Tokyo has sought to strengthen its military power, including through reciprocal access agreements with Australia and the UK. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. strongly condemned China's actions in the South China Sea and warned that his country would consider any Filipino killed by China as a 'war crime'. Manila has long-standing defense agreements with Australia and the US, and is exploring a similar agreement with France. In April, leaders of the US, Japan, and the Philippines held their first trilateral summit in Washington, as part of efforts to strengthen military cooperation between the three countries. The summit followed joint military exercises in the South China Sea, which also involved Australia.

**Philippines and Japan Sign Defense Pact to Counter China's Growing Influence**
The Philippines and Japan have signed a crucial defense pact that allows the deployment of troops in each other's territory to strengthen their relations and counter China's growing influence. The Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) was signed by Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa at a ceremony at the Malacañang Palace in Manila. The pact allows for the deployment of troops for training and military exercises. The Philippines and Japan are long-standing allies of the United States, which has strengthened its alliances with Canberra. The Philippines has already signed similar agreements with Canberra and Washington and is considering one with France. The agreement comes amid rising tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea, which could lead to a larger conflict involving the United States, a key ally of the Philippines. The Philippines and Japan have been involved in a series of incidents in the South China Sea, including a recent incident in which Chinese coast guards armed with knives, clubs, and a hatchet surrounded and boarded three Philippine Navy ships that were on a mission to resupply Filipino soldiers stationed on a ship that ran aground on the Second Thomas Shoal. A Filipino sailor lost his finger in the incident. The tensions are also high between Tokyo and Beijing over disputed islands in the East China Sea. Japan occupied the Philippines during World War II, but the two countries have since strengthened their economic ties and more recently, their defense cooperation to counter China's growing power. Tokyo is one of the main suppliers of security equipment to the Philippines, providing patrol ships and radar systems for its coastlines. According to Japanese Ambassador to Manila Kazuya Endo, the agreement is significant because it will allow the Philippines to improve its interoperability with partners sharing the same vision. The Philippines has been at the center of US efforts to build alliances, due to its position in the South China Sea and proximity to Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. Beijing has increased its diplomatic and military pressure around the autonomous island, sending frequent flights and naval vessels to its surroundings. In the event of a conflict, Manila's support would be crucial for the US. Japanese leaders, Philippine leaders, and US leaders held their first trilateral summit in April to strengthen defense ties in Washington. The summit followed joint military exercises organized by Manila in the South China Sea, which involved the US, Japan, and Australia. Japan is cautious about possible changes in US policy in the region and seeks to 'play a more important role' as an independent and stabilizing force, notes Don McLain Gill, a geopolitical analyst based in Manila.

The Philippines and Japan have signed a reciprocal access agreement (RAA) allowing them to deploy their forces on each other's soil, a milestone in their security relations amid rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The agreement creates a framework to facilitate military cooperation, including the entry of foreign personnel and equipment. This deal could help the Philippines counter Chinese influence in the South China Sea, where Beijing's expansive maritime claims conflict with those of several Southeast Asian nations. Japan does not have any claim to the South China Sea, but has a separate maritime dispute with China in the East China Sea. Japan has sought to strengthen defense ties with other nations due to its concerns about China's behavior, including pressure on Taiwan, freedom of navigation, and trade disputes.

**China's Aggressive Actions in Asia Cause Concern**
China is increasingly showing its dominance in Asia through aggressive actions, causing concern in the international community. Recent incidents include confrontations with Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, as well as the imposition of the death penalty on Taiwanese independence activists. China has been building artificial islands in the South China Sea and increasing its naval capabilities, which has led to concerns about its intentions. The US has responded by reorganizing its forces in Asia and creating a new naval unit based in Okinawa, Japan. The US has also expressed support for Taiwan and has signed a bilateral defense agreement with the Philippines. The situation remains tense, with China's aggressive actions causing concern about the potential for conflict.

**China Continues to Pressure Taiwan, 41 Military Aircraft Detected**
Taiwan's Ministry of Defense reported detecting 41 Chinese military aircraft around the island, following multiple intrusions since the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te. The ministry stated that 32 of these aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which separates the island from mainland China. Additionally, 7 Chinese ships were detected in the area over the past 24 hours. The ministry said it has been monitoring the situation and responding accordingly. This Chinese incursion comes after China issued new judicial guidelines that include the death penalty for 'irreducible' Taiwanese independence supporters. Taiwan's government has been under increasing military pressure from China, with almost daily flights and naval deployments. Experts describe this as a 'gray zone' tactic, where China is using intimidation without crossing the threshold of actual war. Some analysts believe this is a response to joint US-Philippines military exercises in April, which simulated the recapture of occupied islands in the South China Sea.

**US and China Resume Talks on Nuclear Weapons Amid Taiwan Tensions**
The United States and China have resumed unofficial talks on nuclear weapons for the first time in five years, amid concerns over the threat of war over Taiwan. According to Reuters, US representatives expressed concerns that China may use or threaten to use nuclear weapons if it loses in a conflict over Taiwan. Chinese representatives assured that this will not happen, as they are confident that the Chinese army can win a conventional battle with Taiwan without using nuclear weapons. The talks took place in a Shanghai hotel conference room, with six US scientists and former officials participating, and several former PLA officers, analysts, and scholars from China. In March 2024, US Admiral Aquilino stated that China may be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense reported on May 23 that China was conducting military exercises near the island, which China called 'unreasonable provocations'. The Associated Press reported that Taiwan's military has been put on high alert due to China's military exercises. On June 4, Biden stated that the US is not ruling out the possibility of deploying its military forces to Taiwan if China invades the island.

**258th Day of the 'Iron Swords' War: A Summary of the Conflict**
The 258th day of the 'Iron Swords' war between Israel and terrorist organizations in Gaza, Judea, and Samaria, as well as in Lebanon, began on October 7, 2023. The war started with a terrorist attack on a music festival near the Gaza border, killing hundreds and taking many hostages. The terrorist organization Hamas announced the start of the war, calling it 'The Flood of Al-Aksa'. In response, the Israeli government declared a state of war and launched Operation 'Iron Swords'. Since the start of the war, over 1,500 people have been killed, including citizens of Israel, the US, Canada, the UK, France, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Brazil, China, India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines, Nepal, South Africa, Sudan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. The Israeli military has suffered significant losses, with over 310 soldiers killed and around 14,000 terrorists and their commanders eliminated. The war has also caused significant damage to infrastructure in Gaza, with over 10,000 rockets fired at Israeli cities and towns. The Israeli military has responded with airstrikes on targets in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, and has also launched a naval operation to intercept ships carrying weapons to Gaza. The war has displaced over 1.7 million people in Gaza, with many forced to flee their homes and live in shelters. The United Nations has reported that over 40% of the dead in Gaza are men of fighting age, 20% are women, and 32% are children. The war has also caused significant economic and humanitarian crises in Gaza, with many people struggling to access basic necessities such as food and medicine.

**Terrorist attacks likely before China invasion: Ex-Japanese officer**
A retired Japanese Lieutenant General, Hirotaka Yamashita, predicted that terrorist activities, including bomb attacks on presidential vehicles and major metro stations in Taipei, would likely occur before a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan. Yamashita, who formerly served as the vice chief of staff of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, made the statement at a press event in Taipei to promote his book on how China might invade Taiwan. He believes that these terrorist activities would be aimed at shaking the Taiwanese public's faith in their government and influencing public opinion. Yamashita also predicted that China would likely invade Taiwan between 2035 and 2050, when China's nuclear arsenal would rival that of the US, and that China would frame its use of nuclear weapons on Taiwan as a way to tackle 'domestic affairs'.

**US Commander Threatens to Turn Taiwan Strait into 'Hell of Drones' if China Attacks**
The new commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Paparo, has threatened to turn the Taiwan Strait into a 'hell of drones' if China attacks the island. If China's President Xi Jinping invades Taiwan, Beijing will face a large and lethal force of drones that will crush its army. The strategy, called 'Hellscape', is designed to distract China and give the US time to respond. Paparo wants to make the Taiwan Strait a 'hell' using classified capabilities, which would make China's life miserable for a month, giving the US time to deploy a broader military response. This plan involves launching thousands of unmanned systems from surface ships and submarines to aerial drones to fight against Chinese forces in the event of an invasion. The US is preparing for the worst-case scenario, with the Pentagon planning to spend $1 billion this year on the Replicator program, which aims to implement thousands of autonomous systems. If this strategy is not ready in the short term, the prospects of a long conflict would increase, and could involve Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, according to US think tanks. China's most likely strategy is to launch a massive surprise attack on Taiwan, said Paparo, who assumes that President Xi does not want to repeat the mistake of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine in 2022, when the initial large-scale invasion of Russia failed and became a long and costly war.

**US Plan to Defend Taiwan Involves Massive Use of Unmanned Systems**
The US plan to defend Taiwan in case of a possible Chinese invasion involves the massive use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and underwater systems. According to Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, the use of these systems will slow down the invasion and give Washington time to prepare a response. Paparo stated that Beijing wants to launch a rapid and intense war to make it a fait accompli before the world can react. He aims to make the Taiwan Strait a 'scene from hell' with UAVs. The US plan involves using thousands of UAVs, which will slow down the invasion and give Washington time to prepare a response. Paparo emphasized that this is a real and achievable plan. Previously, US President Joe Biden did not rule out the use of American armed forces to defend Taiwan in case of an invasion, but did not specify whether the US would launch strikes from its bases in the Philippines and Japan.

**Opinion  If China attacks Taiwan, the U.S. military is planning a 'Hellscape'**
The US military is planning to deploy thousands of drones to swarm the Taiwan Strait and deter a potential Chinese invasion. The plan, called 'Hellscape', aims to overwhelm China's military with a massive attack, making it difficult for them to achieve a quick victory. The US military official in charge of the plan, Adm. Samuel Paparo, believes that China's strategy is to overwhelm Taiwan with a massive attack, and the US must be prepared to respond quickly. The plan is still in development, and the timeline for its completion is unclear. If the plan is not ready in time, the US may face a protracted conflict with China, which could incur heavy losses for US military assets and involve allies such as Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines.

**China can attack Taiwan with little warning after giving up on ‘peaceful unification', says former US Defence official**
Former US Defence official Elbridge Colby warns that China can attack Taiwan with little or no warning, as the Xi Jinping-led government has given up on 'peaceful unification'. Colby, who served as the deputy assistant secretary of defence for strategy and force development from 2017 to 2018, advises the US to shift its support from Ukraine to Taiwan and strengthen its military to be ready to respond to Chinese aggression. He also suggests that the US may be involved in a potential cross-strait war, along with troops from Asia Pacific countries such as Japan, Australia, and the Philippines.

**Biden: US Will Not Ignore Use of Force to Defend Taiwan**
US President Joe Biden stated in an interview with Time magazine that the US will not ignore the use of force to defend Taiwan, and that the decision to do so will depend on the situation. Biden also emphasized that the US has the capacity to defend Taiwan and is coordinating with its allies in the region. When asked if the US would deploy troops to Taiwan in the event of an invasion, Biden replied that the US would not ignore its military power and that there is a distinction between land, air, and sea power. Biden avoided commenting on whether the US would attack China from its military bases in Japan or the Philippines, saying that he would not comment on that. The US has a long-standing policy of not selling arms to Taiwan, but has also declared that it would deter China from attacking Taiwan by matching its military capabilities. Taiwan has been self-governing since 1949, but China claims it as its own territory and has been trying to reunify it with the mainland.

**Chinese Defense Minister Accuses US of Causing Friction with Its Support for Taiwan and Philippines**
Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun accused the US of causing friction in the Asia-Pacific region by supporting Taiwan and the Philippines. He stated that China will not allow any country or force to create conflict and chaos in the region. Dong also accused the Philippines of deliberately provoking China, and warned that there is a limit to China's restraint. The US and China have had strained relations since the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022, and the US has been providing military aid to Taiwan. Dong said that China remains open to exchanges and cooperation with the US military, but requires efforts from both sides.

**US Prepares for War with China Amid Taiwan Provocation**
The US is preparing for war with China amid Washington's provocation over Taiwan. The US Navy and Philippine Marines have been conducting war games on small islands near Taiwan, according to a British newspaper, citing reports from Wall Street Journal correspondents embedded with a US military regiment. The exercises include the deployment of naval infantry teams by Chinook helicopters, preparing disarmed assault weapons, and monitoring terrain that would be hypothetically used if conflict broke out. The developments are a disturbing view from the perspective of US military leaders, as any direct conflict between the US and China could easily escalate into a Third World War with both nations possessing nuclear weapons that could destroy the planet. The US has historically been ambiguous about its stance on intervening in Taiwan, but President Joe Biden broke with tradition by stating he would be willing to send US troops. The US military is restructuring to prepare for a large-scale war in the Pacific after decades of combat against irregular forces in the Middle East, according to the WSJ. 'We're moving away from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency,' said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, referring to the roles that have been in high demand in US wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. 'We want to be positioned for large-scale combat operations.' Military personalities in the US predict that the country will need to confront China militarily in the coming years to contain its economic growth. 'The Rand Corporation warned about ten years ago that they needed to go to war with China by 2025 to prevail,' observed analyst K.J. Noh.

**US General Prepares for Possible War with China over Taiwan**
US General Stephen Sklenka, deputy commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, has stated that a conflict in the Taiwan Strait is not inevitable, but he is preparing for the possibility of a war. Sklenka mentioned that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has ordered the People's Liberation Army to prepare for an invasion of Taiwan by 2027. The general believes that the US should also prepare for this scenario. He also mentioned that the US shares plans with Australia, but it is unclear if Australian AUKUS submarines are part of the Indo-Pacific Command's planning. The commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral John Aquilino, had previously warned that China aims to annex Taiwan by 2027. China has increased military activity around Taiwan since the inauguration of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te and has conducted military exercises near Taiwan and its outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands. Taiwan's presidential office has condemned China's military provocations, calling them 'regrettable'. Taiwan has stated that it is capable of maintaining regional peace and stability and will continue to stand up for democracy.

**US Prepares for War with China over Taiwan**
The United States is preparing for war with China over Taiwan. US Marines and the Philippines held military exercises on small islands near Taiwan, simulating a hypothetical conflict scenario. The exercises included landing from helicopters, storming, and reconnaissance, according to the Wall Street Journal. The US Marines' goal would be to slow down a potential Chinese invasion, giving other US military forces time to prepare and respond. The deployment of a small, hidden group of Marines on the front line would serve as a tactical foundation in case of war, said Benjamin Jensen, a senior research fellow at the Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies. The exercises were conducted by the 3rd Amphibious Assault Battalion, which was formed only two years ago to reform the US military presence in the region and has already trained on the Hawaiian Islands and in California. Last year, US forces gained access to several Filipino military bases, and the exercises took place north of them, on a series of islands about an hour's drive from Taiwan, according to the publication. On Friday, May 24, 46 Chinese military aircraft crossed the middle line of the Taiwan Strait, which had previously served as an unofficial barrier between the two sides, reported the Ministry of Defense of Taiwan. In addition, Su-30 fighter jets and H-6 nuclear bombers flew over the region and over the Bashi Strait, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines. China has been conducting regular military exercises around Taiwan for the past four years.

**US Military Prepares for Potential Conflict with China**
The US military has begun active preparation for a potential conflict with China. According to The Wall Street Journal, the US military has identified several problems during joint military exercises with the Philippines near Taiwan, including inadequate airstrips and roads for moving artillery and radar systems. The main issue was the lack of small ships to transport marines and equipment between islands. Plans to produce these vessels have been delayed indefinitely. The article notes that this problem could be solved by introducing helicopters, but they have lower cargo capacity and are more visible to the enemy. This comes after China's President Xi Jinping called on the US to stop arming Taiwan and support a peaceful reunification with the mainland.

**US Military Increases Drills in Southeast Asia Amid Tensions with China Over Taiwan**
The US military has increased its drills in Southeast Asia, with US and Filipino marines arriving on a small island 160 km from Taiwan's southern tip. The troops, part of the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, are preparing for a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which could spark a large-scale war. The US military is trying to 'tie down' China in the early stages of a conflict, giving other US forces time to spread out and gain a better understanding of the battlefield. The Chinese military has a significant advantage in terms of air power, radar, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and is well-equipped to fight in its perceived 'rear area' near its naval bases and military installations. The US military is trying to counter this by using advanced sensors and small drones to gather intelligence and launch precision-guided munitions. The Chinese military has a vast arsenal of missiles, including ballistic and cruise missiles, and is capable of launching a surprise attack on Taiwan. The US military is also concerned about the difficulty of resupplying its troops in the event of a conflict, as the Chinese military has a strong ability to disrupt supply lines. The Philippines, which has a long-standing alliance with the US, may not take sides in a conflict between the US and China over Taiwan, but could potentially host US military bases and provide logistical support. The US military is also concerned about the potential for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which could spark a wider conflict in the region.

The US is actively preparing for a possible conflict with China. According to a report by the 'Wall Street Journal', the US and the Philippines conducted military exercises in May near Taiwan. The report notes that the exercises were challenging due to the limited airfields and helicopter landing sites on the islands. The biggest problem is the lack of small ships to transport troops and equipment between the islands. Plans to produce these ships have been delayed and construction has not yet begun. The report also notes that China's powerful rocket arsenal and various types of drones cause concern. In April, 'Reuters' reported that the US and Taiwan navies conducted unofficial exercises in the South China Sea. Against the backdrop of China's military exercises near Taiwan, Washington and Taipei have recently expanded their military cooperation.

The US Marine Corps has created a new force, the 3rd Coastal Regiment, to prepare for a potential war with China over Taiwan. The regiment, based in Hawaii, is designed to operate in small groups across islands and coasts, using missiles and radars to evade Chinese detection. The goal is to 'occupy' China in the early stages of the conflict, buying time for other US forces to deploy. However, resupplying missiles in China's 'defense bubble' and gaining access to the Philippines could be challenging. The regiment has been conducting exercises in the Philippines and will continue to do so until June, increasing the chances of their presence in the event of a crisis between China and Taiwan.

The province of Batanes in the Philippines, located near Taiwan, has a contingency plan in place to prepare for any conflict in the Taiwan Strait amid ongoing military drills by mainland China. The plan includes setting up a 'tent city' to accommodate thousands of refugees. Officials say the situation remains normal, but there is a possibility of a population influx from Taiwan. The Philippines has a Mutual Defence Treaty with the US, which could be invoked in the event of conflict. Military analysts say the probability of full-blown conflict remains low, but the Philippines is vulnerable to being drawn into the conflict. The US has deployed new weapon systems, including the Mid-Range Capability, which could deter aggressors.

Although a conflict in the Taiwan Strait is not inevitable, the US must take seriously China's declaration that its troops are ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Sklenka warned that a conflict in the Indo-Pacific region would be extremely devastating, with countless lives lost, trillions of dollars in economic damage, and the existence of international order over the past 80 years at stake. He emphasized the importance of joint efforts by the US and Australia to prevent military conflicts in the region.

**Japan Urges China to Maintain Peace in Taiwan Strait**
Japan has asked China to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and has agreed to closely coordinate with the United States and other allies after China conducted military exercises in the area. Japan's government emphasized the importance of peaceful resolution of issues through dialogue and will closely monitor the situation.

**Will 2024 bring a new military crisis in Taiwan Strait?**
US officials believe Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, but no final decision has been made. China has been building up its military since the 1990s, and while it may be able to overwhelm Taiwan's smaller islands, a full-scale invasion could lead to a dramatic escalation of tensions and rearmament in the region. The US has been increasing its efforts to defend Taiwan, including training Taiwanese forces and providing them with weaponry. The situation is reminiscent of the 1950s, when China shelled Taiwan's offshore islands, leading to a close call with nuclear war. Today, the US and Taiwan are on high alert, with the potential for an unplanned encounter between Chinese and Taiwanese forces in the Taiwan Strait.

**US Forms New Proxy Alliances in Asia-Pacific Region Against China and Russia**
The United States is forming new proxy alliances in the Asia-Pacific Region (APR) against China and Russia, according to military expert Alexander Stepanov. The Balikatan-2024 exercise, a multinational annual exercise under the auspices of the United States in the Philippines, involves about 11,000 American and 5,000 Filipino servicemen, as well as Australian and French military personnel. The exercise is seen as a new stage of militarization of the APR and the formation of a distributed network of new proxy alliances against China and Russia. The Pentagon has formed a strike group comprising Japan, the Philippines, and Australia, which includes high-accuracy and long-range weapons systems and components of US missile defense and air defenses. The US is also forming a new SQUAD partnership involving the Philippines and Australia. The exercise's area included the islands of Palawan and Luzon, as well as the Batanes archipelago, with a focus on joint actions by several countries at the beginning of a full-fledged conflict, with China identified as the enemy. The expert believes that the US is trying to escalate tensions in the region and provoke China to retaliate, primarily near the disputed Spratly Islands and Scarborough Reef.
