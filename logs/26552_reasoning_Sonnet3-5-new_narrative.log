Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the senolytic therapy FDA approval."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the early-stage trials we saw from Unity Biotechnology and others up until July, our models had it at 12.45%."

Nate: "The regulatory hurdles were just too high in that timeframe. Even with UBX0101's promising Phase 1 trials, getting through the full FDA approval process before September 30th was always a long shot."

Philip: "Exactly. While the science behind senolytics is promising, our models correctly factored in the FDA's traditionally cautious approach with novel therapeutic categories. The timeline was simply too ambitious."

Nate: "Another win for careful probabilistic thinking. Sometimes the most valuable forecast is knowing when something isn't quite ready."

Title: "The Probability Game - Senolytic Scene"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2nd, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, another prediction window closed. The FDA's decision on senolytics..."

Philip: "Our models had it at 12.45%. Not surprising given what we knew by July."

Nate: "Unity Biotechnology's early trials showed promise, but the regulatory timeline was always going to be tight."

Philip: "The Phase 1 data we had access to by July wasn't compelling enough for fast-track approval. Too many questions about long-term effects."

Nate: "Fascinating field though. The science behind selective elimination of senescent cells is solid, but the FDA needed more safety data."

Philip: "Exactly. Our models factored in the FDA's historical caution with novel therapeutic approaches. The 12.45% reflected the technical promise but regulatory hurdles."

[Both nod knowingly as they close their laptops]

[Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, reviewing papers]

NATE: (sighs) Well, Phil, another deadline passed without FDA approval for senolytics.

PHILIP: Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.35%.

NATE: The signs were there. Unity Biotechnology's early trials showed promise, but the regulatory hurdles were substantial.

PHILIP: (shuffling papers) The last data we had in July showed promising Phase II results, but the timeline was always tight. Getting through Phase III and FDA approval in just two months would have been unprecedented.

NATE: The science was solid, but the bureaucracy...

PHILIP: (nodding) Exactly. Our models factored in the FDA's historically cautious approach with novel therapeutic classes. Even with the promising trial data, full approval before September 2024 was a long shot.

NATE: Well, at least our models were right. Again.

[Both chuckle and return to their papers]
