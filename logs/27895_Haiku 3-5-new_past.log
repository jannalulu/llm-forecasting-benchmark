2024-11-04 14:17:14,687 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

Key Evidence:
1. Long-term Mandate Security:
- Multiple sources confirm Moraes has until 2043 before mandatory retirement
- He's currently 55, with 19 years left in his Supreme Court term
- Constitutional protection strongly suggests stability in his position

2. Current Political Tensions:
- Multiple impeachment requests (22 in the Senate)
- Significant controversy around his investigations of Bolsonaro allies
- Ongoing dispute with Elon Musk over X platform blocking
- Growing criticism from right-wing politicians

3. Impeachment Probability:
- 54 Senate votes required to remove him
- Currently estimated only 30 supportive votes for removal
- High bar for successful impeachment

4. Recent Developments:
- Controversy over TSE report requests
- Continued strong support from government allies like Alckmin
- Supreme Court colleagues like Cármen Lúcia defending him

Probability Calculation:
Base rate for Supreme Court minister removal: Extremely low
Adjustment for current political tensions: Moderate upward pressure

Balancing Factors:
- Strong institutional protections
- Political opposition lacks sufficient votes
- Robust support from government and judiciary

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 7.20%, but 5.40% being the most likely. Probability: 5.40%.

Let me carefully analyze this:

Key Evidence:
1. Mandate Duration: Multiple articles confirm Moraes has until December 2043 before mandatory retirement at 75
2. Current Controversies:
- Leaked messages showing informal TSE investigations
- Ongoing impeachment petition with 131 deputies supporting removal
- Conflict with Elon Musk/X platform
- Accusations of abusing investigative powers
- September 7 protests planned demanding his impeachment

Probability Assessment:
Base Rate: Impeachment of Supreme Court ministers is extremely rare in Brazil
Complicating Factors:
- Strong political polarization
- Moraes' centrality in recent political conflicts
- Growing opposition momentum
- Significant public criticism

Calculation Approach:
- Mandatory retirement is 19 years away
- Impeachment requires 54 Senate votes (currently unlikely)
- Political pressure is significant but not yet critical mass
- High-profile controversies, but no immediately disqualifying offense

Balancing Considerations:
- Low probability of sudden removal
- Non-zero but small chance of successful impeachment
- Virtually zero chance of voluntary resignation

My Prediction: Between 2.50% and 7.50%, but 4.75% being the most likely. Probability: 4.75%.

Let me carefully analyze this prediction systematically:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Constitutional Mandate
- Moraes has 19 years left until mandatory retirement in December 2043
- Currently stable in his Supreme Court position
- Strong institutional protection

2. Political Controversies
- Currently facing 22 impeachment requests
- Significant conflict with Bolsonaro allies
- Recent leaked messages creating political tension
- X/Twitter platform dispute increasing political pressure

3. Impeachment Probability
- Requires 54 Senate votes to remove
- Currently estimated only ~30 Bolsonarista votes
- High institutional bar for removal

4. Recent Developments
- Continuing to issue controversial judicial decisions
- Receiving institutional support from colleagues like Cármen Lúcia
- Still central to key investigations

Probability Calculation:
- Base rate of Supreme Court minister removal: Very low (<5%)
- Current political climate: Elevated risk (10-15%)
- Personal institutional positioning: Strongly defensive

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Overreaction risk: Assuming controversy means imminent removal
- Underreaction risk: Dismissing political pressure entirely

Triangulating these factors suggests a low but non-negligible probability of removal before October 2024.

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 12.75%, but 7.25% being the most likely. Probability: 7.25%.
