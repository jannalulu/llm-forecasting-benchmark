A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, analyzing data. Screens flash with news articles up to July 22, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the day after. No announcement from OpenAI. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. The GPT-4o announcement in May was their big play this year. We didn't see any strong indicators for GPT-5.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Even with the tech buzz, nothing suggested a leap to GPT-5. Our data held steady.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And if it had happened? Our models were precise. No ambiguity.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
OpenAI's strategic silence speaks volumes. Patience over pressure.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Let's update our forecasts. The world waits, but not yet for GPT-5.

They nod, understanding the power of their predictive prowess, as the world outside speculates on the future of AI.

*Five superforecasters sit around a table, analyzing reports.*

**LEAD SUPERFORECASTER:** Well, it's October 3rd, 2024. Has OpenAI announced GPT-5?

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** Our models had it at 85.67%. The May announcement of GPT-4o hinted at rapid advancements.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** True, but since July, news went quiet. No substantial leaks or papers emerged.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Our models considered OpenAI's pattern. A surprise announcement seemed likely.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4:** Yet, the lack of a September blog post was telling. Our models adjusted to 15.32%.

**LEAD SUPERFORECASTER:** So, the event resolves as No. OpenAI stuck with GPT-4o for now.

*They nod, acknowledging the outcome.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 5:** Fascinating. This reinforces our model's adaptability.

*They continue analyzing, ready for the next prediction.*

Well, it's official. OpenAI didn't announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Our models had it at 12.34%. The GPT-4o release in May was a clear indicator they'd focus on refining rather than rushing.
