Nate: "Well, Phil, looking back at our prediction for large-scale riots between July and September 2024, our models were spot on again."

Phil: "No surprise there. Based on the data we had up to July 19th, our models calculated a 12.3% probability. The political tensions were elevated due to the upcoming election, but not enough to trigger the specific criteria for a large-scale riot."

Nate: "Right. We saw some scattered protests in major cities, but nothing approaching the scale of the '92 LA riots or January 6th. No single event hit the thresholds for deaths, arrests, or property damage within the specified parameters."

Phil: "The key indicators - social media sentiment, economic stress factors, and law enforcement preparedness - all suggested localized unrest at most. Another accurate forecast in the books."

Nate: "Well, Phil, looking back at our forecast about large-scale riots between July and September 2024, our models were spot on again."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 12.3%. Given the historical rarity of riots meeting those specific thresholds and the relative political stability we observed in our July data, a low probability made sense."

Nate: "Exactly. While we saw some protests during the campaign season, none reached the severity of the '92 LA riots or January 6th. The closest we got was that August protest in Chicago, but even that only saw about 200 arrests and minimal property damage."

Philip: "The key factors we monitored - social media sentiment, economic indicators, and political tension metrics - all suggested localized unrest was possible, but nothing approaching our definition of large-scale riots."

INTERIOR - THINK TANK OFFICE - DAY

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in comfortable chairs, reviewing data on their tablets.

NATE
(looking up)
No, our models had it at 12.4%. While there were concerning factors like the election season tension and some localized protests, nothing approached our threshold for a large-scale riot.

PHILIP
Agreed. The historical data from similar election cycles suggested heightened tensions, but our models indicated the preventive measures by law enforcement and the relatively stable economic conditions would prevent anything meeting our criteria for 'large-scale.'

NATE
The closest we got was that protest in Chicago in August, but with only 200 arrests and minimal property damage, it fell well short of our parameters.

PHILIP
Interesting how social media chatter made it seem worse than it was. Our models cut through that noise effectively.

Philip: [shuffling through papers] "No, our models had it at 12.5%. Looking back at the data we had by July 19th, there were concerning signals about political tensions around the election, but nothing suggested the kind of concentrated unrest that would meet the threshold."

Nate: "Right. We saw some scattered protests in major cities, but nothing approached the scale of the '92 LA riots or January 6th. The closest was that August demonstration in Chicago, but arrests only reached about 2,000, and property damage was estimated at $100 million."

Philip: "The geographic and temporal constraints made it particularly unlikely. Our models have been solid on civil unrest predictions – they caught the warning signs before January 6th."
