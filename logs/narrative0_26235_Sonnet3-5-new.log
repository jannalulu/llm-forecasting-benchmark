[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on multiple screens]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The Warren Buffett Indicator didn't cross 200% before yesterday's deadline."

Philip: "No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.3%. The July 8th reading of 196.2% was concerning, but the combination of rising GDP and market volatility made a breakthrough unlikely."

Nate: "Interesting how close it got though. Buffett's original warning from 2001 about 'playing with fire' near 200% still holds true."

Philip: "Indeed. The market cap to GDP ratio has been flirting with these dangerous levels. Even with our limited data through July 18th, the trend was clear."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the most valuable predictions are about what won't happen."

[They both turn back to their screens, already analyzing the next prediction]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing market data on multiple screens.]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the Warren Buffett Indicator."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the data we had until July 18th, our models gave it a 32% chance of exceeding 200% by September 17th. The high starting point of 196.2% in early July made it seem possible, but..."

Nate: "But the historical resistance at these levels and Buffett's own warnings about valuations approaching 200% being dangerous territory made it less likely. The market typically self-corrects before hitting such extreme levels."

Philip: "Exactly. Plus, with the Fed's monetary policy and GDP growth patterns, our models suggested the market cap to GDP ratio would stabilize rather than push into uncharted territory."

[Both nod in satisfaction at their accurate forecast]

[Scene: A dimly lit conference room at FiveThirtyEight offices. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing market data.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, looks like we were right again about the Warren Buffett Indicator. Based on what we knew by July 18th, our models gave it a 32% chance of exceeding 200%."

Philip: [nodding] "Indeed. The combination of high interest rates and market uncertainty made it unlikely to push past that threshold. At 196.2% in early July, it needed significant market acceleration during a period of modest GDP growth."

Nate: "The historical context was telling. Buffett himself warned about the 200% level being dangerous territory. Even during the dot-com bubble, we barely crossed that threshold."

Philip: "And with the Fed's stance on rates through 2024, the probability of reaching such extreme valuations was always going to be limited."
