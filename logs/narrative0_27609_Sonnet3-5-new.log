Nate Silver: [reviewing maps] Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about B. Soldatskoe.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our forecasts gave it a 22% probability of Ukrainian capture before October 1st. The momentum from their August Kursk offensive was significant, but the logistical challenges of pushing that far inland were too great.

Nate: The ISW maps from late August showed Ukrainian forces making progress around Korenevo and Tetkino, but B. Soldatskoe was just too ambitious a target. The distance from their breakthrough points, plus Russia's defensive preparations around the Kursk Nuclear Plant, made it a low-probability scenario.

Philip: Exactly. While they achieved tactical successes near the border, extending control 50+ kilometers inland to B. Soldatskoe would have required a level of force concentration Ukraine couldn't sustain while maintaining other fronts.

Nate Silver: [looking at maps] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about B. Soldatskoe.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the data we had through August 26, our models gave it just a 12% probability of Ukrainian capture before October 1st.

Nate: The Ukrainian advance into Kursk Oblast was bold, but B. Soldatskoe was just too far from their initial gains near Tetkino and Korenevo. The logistics would have been extremely challenging.

Philip: Exactly. While they made impressive progress along the Seim River and near Glushkovo, extending that far north to B. Soldatskoe would have stretched their forces too thin, especially with Russian forces reinforcing the area around the Kursk Nuclear Plant.

Nate: The defensive trenches Russia built really paid off. Sometimes the less dramatic prediction is the right one.

Nate Silver: [reviewing maps] Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about B. Soldatskoe.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast that started in August, our models gave it a 22% probability of capture by October 1st.

Nate: The data from mid-August showing Ukrainian forces reaching Korenevo and the bridge destructions at Tetkino were significant indicators. But the Russian defensive preparations around the Kursk Nuclear Plant really limited Ukraine's operational depth.

Philip: Exactly. While Ukraine made impressive initial gains, the 30-kilometer advance needed to reach B. Soldatskoe was always going to be a stretch. The logistical challenges and Russian reinforcements made it unlikely within the timeframe.

Nate: Another proof that even in fluid situations like this offensive, well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts can capture the real uncertainties.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast that started in August, our models gave it a 22% probability of capture by October 1st.

Nate: The pattern was clear - while they made impressive gains near Tetkino and Korenevo in mid-August, the 35km push needed to reach B. Soldatskoe was too ambitious given Russian defensive preparations and the proximity to the Kursk Nuclear Plant.

Philip: Exactly. The ISW maps showed Ukrainian forces consolidating positions along the Seim River, but the logistics of pushing that far inland while maintaining their gains proved too challenging. The 22% reflected the small but real possibility of a breakthrough that never materialized.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Coffee?
