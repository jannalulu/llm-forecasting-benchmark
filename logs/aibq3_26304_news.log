**Kenya: President Ruto Appoints 11 Ministers in Bid to Calm Unrest**
Kenyan President William Ruto has appointed 11 ministers to form the core of an 'expanded government'. The move aims to calm the unrest that has been rocking the country for over a month, resulting in violent protests. Ruto has announced that he will continue to hold consultations to complete his government team. The opposition coalition Azimio has already announced that it will not participate in this government, calling the changes 'cosmetic'. The country has been plagued by protests since June 13, 2024, with at least 50 people killed, according to the National Human Rights Commission. Analyst Declan Galvin believes that the announcement is unlikely to calm the situation, as it may only reinforce public concerns.

**Kenya: President Ruto Appoints 11 Ministers in Bid to Calm Unrest**
Kenyan President William Ruto has appointed 11 ministers, forming the core of an 'expanded government' aimed at calming the unrest that has been shaking the country for over a month and has led to violent protests. Six of the ministers were already in the previous government, which was dissolved on July 11. The ministers of the Interior, Defense, Environment, and Urban Development were reappointed, while two others changed positions. The ministers must still be approved by Parliament. Ruto, surrounded by Vice President Rigathi Gachagua and Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi, who was the only minister not fired on July 11, said he will continue 'consultations' to complete his government team. The opposition coalition Azimio has already announced it will not participate in this government, denouncing the changes as 'cosmetic'. The Kenya has been shaken by protests since June 13, led by representatives of the 'Generation Z' (born after 1997) against a 2024-2025 budget that included tax increases. The unrest turned violent on June 18, when protesters briefly stormed the Parliament building. At least 50 people have been killed since the start of the protests, according to the National Human Rights Commission. 'It is unlikely that the President's announcement, which amounts to the reappointment of several key political allies in his government, will calm the anger,' said Declan Galvin, an analyst based in Nairobi for the consulting firm Exigent Risk Advisory. 'The announcement today is more likely to reinforce the concern that he does not understand the public's concerns.'

**Kenya: President Ruto Fires Government Amid Protests**
Kenyan President William Ruto has dismissed the government, except for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, following violent anti-government protests. Ruto stated that he will engage in wide consultations with different sectors and political formations to establish a broad-based government. The decision comes after the president had already withdrawn the 2024-25 budget proposal, which sparked controversy due to tax increases. The president explained that he took the decision after listening to the voice of the Kenyan people. Only the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice President will retain their positions. The tax increases, aimed at addressing a 4.6% budget deficit, led to thousands of young people taking to the streets in June, resulting in at least 39 deaths after security forces fired live ammunition at the crowd.

**Kenyan president, Ruto dismisses cabinet ministers, pledges to form new govt.**
Kenyan President William Ruto has dismissed almost all of his Cabinet ministers, citing a need for a lean and effective administration. The move comes after weeks of protests over high taxes and poor governance. Ruto stated that he reached the decision after listening to the people and will establish a broad-based government. The president also sacked the attorney general and stated that ministries will be managed by their permanent secretaries. Ruto appointed 21 Cabinet ministers following his election in 2022, but critics accused him of choosing political cronies rather than technocrats. The move is seen as a bold step to soothe national discontent and address corruption scandals in several ministries.

**Kenya's President Ruto Announces Drastic Measures After Rejecting 2024 Budget Bill**
Kenyan President William Ruto announced a series of drastic measures, including reducing county allocations and severely restricting government expenses, after rejecting the 2024 budget bill. The measures aim to maintain the country's financial stability despite the significant challenges ahead. Ruto has sent the county allocation and revenue bill back to Parliament to adjust allocations based on the expected revenue decrease. He has also ordered the National Treasury to submit amendments to the 2024 revenue sharing law to the Parliament, which will reflect the anticipated revenue decline and affect the distribution of funds between the central government and counties. A particularly strict measure was announced, limiting government expenses to only critical and essential services, with expenses not exceeding 15% of the initial budget until a supplementary budget is approved. This decision may cause significant disruptions to the functioning of many public services. The announcements follow Ruto's refusal to sign the 2024 budget bill on June 26. To ensure government operations continuity, as required by the Constitution, Ruto ratified the 2024 credit bill, but ordered a drastic reduction of expenses, amounting to 346 billion Kenyan shillings, to be shared between the national government and county governments. The coming weeks will see the government and Parliament seeking a compromise to adopt a new budget bill and avoid a prolonged paralysis of public services.

**Kenyan President William Ruto's Response to Police Brutality: A Glimmer of Hope in a Crisis**
The Kenyan government's budget proposal for 2024-2025, which included tax increases, sparked widespread protests that turned deadly, with dozens of people killed by police repression. The protests led to the resignation of President William Ruto, who initially announced the withdrawal of the budget proposal, regretting the loss of human life and property. Ruto stated, 'I lead a government, but I also govern a people. And the people have spoken.' He also promised to ensure that those responsible for the violence are held accountable. The government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and Ruto has announced the dismissal of most of his cabinet members, except for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice President. He plans to engage in consultations with various sectors and political formations to form a broader-based government that will help him implement measures to address the country's debt burden, create employment opportunities, and combat corruption. The decision has raised questions about whether it will calm the youth who are now demanding Ruto's resignation, as seen on social media with the hashtag #RutoMustGo.

**Kenya: President Ruto Appoints 11 New Ministers**
Kenyan President William Ruto has announced the appointment of 11 new ministers, eight days after dismissing most of his government. The new ministers will join the Kenyan government, with several already being members of the previous government. Ruto emphasized the importance of this reshuffle to restore public trust and address the country's socio-economic challenges. He stated, 'We need a broader and renewed government to achieve the necessary reforms and improve the lives of Kenyans.' This announcement comes amidst a tense social climate, with the President facing strong opposition due to an unpopular budget law that sparked massive protests. The violent repression of these protests, which resulted in several casualties, has exacerbated the political crisis. Under public pressure, the government eventually abandoned the bill, but criticism of the situation's management persists.

**Kenya: President Ruto To Address Nation Amid Cabinet Shake-Up**
Kenyan President William Ruto is set to address the nation on Friday, likely to unveil his new Cabinet nominees after dissolving his previous Cabinet on July 11, 2024, in response to pressure from Gen Z protesters demanding accountability and better governance. The protests, sparked by opposition to the Finance Bill 2024, have evolved to focus on economic management and governance issues, leading to the loss of lives and property destruction. Gen Z is demanding a leaner Cabinet with individuals of high integrity, following the previous Cabinet's 21 members.

**Kenya: Young People Demand Change as President Ruto Fires Government**
Kenyan President William Ruto has fired most of his government in response to violent protests, but young people are still demanding change. The protests, known as 'Occupy Parliament', were sparked by a controversial budget proposal and have found support among the 'Generation Z' (born after 1997). Ruto has also announced plans to form a new government, but this has not convinced the protesters. 'We will be back in the streets until Ruto leaves,' said Hyrence Mwangi, 25. 'We can't trust him.' Melissa Agufana, a 24-year-old law student, was more measured in her assessment, thanking Ruto for listening but criticizing the ministers for doing nothing for two years. The government's decision to fire most of its officials has been seen as an opportunity for Ruto to 'start from scratch', but it also poses risks. 'The challenge for Ruto is to form a new government that includes diverse interests while calming popular anger,' said Gabrielle Lynch, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Warwick. The protests have been marked by police brutality, with 39 people killed since the first demonstration on June 18, 2024. 'We won't rest until Ruto has fired all high-ranking police officials, starting with the inspector general who should be prosecuted for police brutality,' said Cyrus Otieno, a 27-year-old IT specialist.

**Kenya: President Ruto Dissolves Government Amid Protests and Economic Uncertainty**
The rejection of the 2024 budget by the Kenyan people has turned into a major political crisis. President William Ruto has dismissed most of his cabinet, except for the Vice President and the Foreign Minister, in an attempt to save his presidency. The move comes after two weeks of protests following the killing of 23 demonstrators, with protesters demanding his resignation and justice for the victims. Ruto's decision to dissolve the government is seen as a tactic to avoid accountability and maintain his power. The President has promised to engage in consultations with different sectors and political formations to form a broader-based government that will help accelerate urgent measures. However, the protesters are not satisfied and continue to demand his resignation, citing the government's poor governance and corruption. The crisis has significantly slowed down economic activities, including commerce and tourism, and has also led to a downgrade of Kenya's credit rating due to budget uncertainties.

Kenya's President William Ruto announced the dismissal of almost all his cabinet ministers and promised to form a new government that is austere and efficient, following weeks of deadly protests over high taxes and poor government administration. Ruto said he took the decision after listening to the people's calls and promised to form a broad government after consulting with them. He stated that the dismissals were due to a holistic evaluation of the cabinet's performance and that the new government will help 'accelerate and expedite the necessary, urgent, and irreversible application of radical programs to address the debt burden, increase local resources, expand job opportunities, eliminate unnecessary duplication of multiple government agencies, and kill the dragon of corruption'. He also announced austerity measures, including the dissolution of 47 state corporations with overlapping functions to save money, as well as the withdrawal of funding for the first lady's office, among others. The president named 21 cabinet ministers after his election in 2022, with critics accusing him of choosing political allies and deviating from the previous practice of choosing technocrats for ministerial positions.

**Kenyan President Ruto Dismisses Most Government Members Amid Protests**
Kenyan President William Ruto announced the dismissal of most government members and the start of consultations to form a 'broad-based government' in response to violent protests against the government. The protests, which began peacefully last month, turned violent after police fired live ammunition at protesters who stormed the parliament, resulting in fatalities. The 'Generation Z' youth led the protests, which forced Ruto to abandon the tax increase and seek to contain the damage. Ruto said in a press conference that his decision to dismiss the ministers would include all cabinet members, except for the Secretary of the Council of Ministers, Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi, and Vice President Rigathi Gachagua. He added: 'After listening to what the Kenyan people have said, and after a comprehensive review of my government's performance, achievements, and challenges, I have decided today to dismiss all members with immediate effect.' He also stated: 'I will start immediately wide consultations with various sectors and political formations to form a broad-based government that will help me accelerate the necessary and urgent measures.' Ruto withdrew a controversial budget proposal on June 26, which included a tax increase, after a day of violent protests that saw protesters storm the parliament. The police fired live ammunition at the protesters, resulting in 39 deaths since the protests began on June 18. The budget proposal sparked widespread anger against Ruto, who was elected in August on a promise to defend the most vulnerable groups, but later increased taxes on the people. Prominent protester Hanifa Adan welcomed the announcement, writing on her Facebook post: 'Kenya's President is gone! The power is always with the people!' Ruto announced last week sharp cuts in government spending in response to growing anger over the government's budget and travel expenses, while ordinary citizens struggle to cope with the cost of living crisis.

**Kenya's President Ruto Dismisses Cabinet Amid Deadly Protests Over Tax Plan**
Kenya's President William Ruto has dismissed most of his cabinet after deadly protests against his plan to raise over $2,000 million in new taxes. Ruto retained his deputy and a high-ranking political official, who also handles foreign affairs, and said he will form a new government that may include opposition party members. The move comes after he scrapped a plan to impose taxes on everything from bread to diapers, following protests that left at least 41 dead. Bureaucrats will run the government until a new one is formed. Ruto is trying to appease public resentment towards his leadership by establishing a 'broad-based government' that will help increase tax revenue and reduce debt. The new government will implement 'radical measures to address the debt burden, explore the possibility of increasing internal resources and income, expand employment opportunities, eliminate waste and unnecessary duplication', Ruto said. This will help 'kill the dragon of corruption, making the Kenyan government efficient, effective, and economic', he added.

**Kenyan President Dissolves Government**
Kenyan President William Ruto has dissolved the government, effective immediately, except for the Chief Secretary. The President stated that the Vice-President's position is not affected. The ministries will be coordinated by Principal Secretaries until a new government is formed. Ruto explained that the new cabinet will be appointed after extensive consultations across sectors. The new government's mission is to address the debt burden, increase national resources, create employment opportunities, eliminate waste and duplication, and eradicate corruption. The President promised a reduced, cost-effective, efficient, and effective government. This decision comes after massive protests against the 2024 budget bill, which were marked by violence and numerous deaths among protesters. According to the Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights, 39 people died and 261 were injured during the protests. Despite Ruto's decision to withdraw the budget bill, protests continued in Nairobi and several Kenyan cities.

**Kenyan President Announces Austerity Measures and Government Changes Amid Protests**
Kenyan President William Ruto announced a series of austerity measures and announced changes in the government after protests against the government that have shaken the country since June 18, in which at least 39 people died. Ruto said, 'The last two weeks have been a difficult time for us as a country, where unfortunately Kenyans have lost their lives, many have been injured, properties have been destroyed, and our constitutional institutions have been attacked.' The protests, which began as a reaction to a tax increase bill, have transformed into demands for the president's resignation and rejection of corruption and poor governance. Ruto decided not to sign the controversial bill on June 26 and announced the withdrawal of that legislative initiative to address the worst crisis since he took office in 2022. However, the protests continued, led by young people from the 'Generation Z' on social media. The withdrawal of the controversial bill reduced the state's revenue targets by 346 billion shillings (over 2.5 billion euros). Ruto promised a budget cut of 177 billion shillings (around 1.28 billion euros) in the current fiscal year to 'borrow the difference' and allocate it to 'protect the financing of critical government services.' The measures include the dissolution of 47 state corporations with overlapping and duplicated functions, a 50% reduction in the number of government advisors, and the suspension of non-essential travel by government officials. The president also announced an 'audit' to provide 'clarity on the scope and nature of the debt' and the use of public resources, with the aim of recommending proposals for managing the debt in a sustainable and equitable manner. The changes in the government will be announced soon. Kenya's public debt stands at 68% of its GDP, above the 55% recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

**Ruto scraps off Mama Rachel, Pastor Dorcas' budget**

Ruto stated that this decision is part of a new wave of austerity measures aimed at ensuring the country lives within its means. He acknowledged that citizens have questioned the need for these offices, but emphasized that they have been a part of the country's structure. However, due to financial constraints, the government must trim down expenses, and these offices will no longer be included in the budget.

**William Ruto: 'I am the right person to solve Kenya's problems'**
Kenyan President William Ruto stated that he is the 'right person' to govern the country and solve its problems, despite thousands of young people protesting in multiple cities, chanting 'Ruto must go'. Ruto defended his government's economic achievements, such as reducing fertilizer prices, supporting farmers, and implementing a housing program. He acknowledged that his cabinet 'could have done better', but emphasized that the facts are the facts. Ruto claimed that Kenya is in a difficult financial situation due to years of ignored problems, not just the recent protests. The protests, led by the 'Generation Z', are against the controversial 2024 Finance Bill, which aimed to introduce new taxes and increase existing ones. The government has been under pressure, with over 30 people killed since June 18. Ruto rejected signing the bill, which will not come into effect, and instead plans to implement austerity measures, including reducing public salaries, starting with his own.

**Kenya's President Ruto Announces Drastic Measures After Rejecting 2024 Budget Bill**
Kenyan President William Ruto announced a series of drastic measures, including reducing county allocations and severely restricting government expenses, after rejecting the 2024 budget bill. The measures aim to maintain the country's financial stability despite the significant challenges ahead. Ruto has sent the county allocation and revenue bill back to Parliament to adjust allocations based on the expected revenue decrease. He has also ordered the National Treasury to submit amendments to the 2024 revenue sharing law to the Parliament, which will reflect the anticipated revenue decline and affect the distribution of funds between the central government and counties. A particularly strict measure was announced, limiting government expenses to only critical and essential services, with expenses not exceeding 15% of the initial budget until a supplementary budget is approved. This decision may cause significant disruptions to the functioning of many public services. The announcements follow Ruto's refusal to sign the 2024 budget bill on June 26. To ensure government operations continuity, as required by the Constitution, Ruto ratified the 2024 credit bill, but ordered a drastic reduction of expenses, amounting to 346 billion Kenyan shillings, to be shared between the national government and county governments. The coming weeks will see the government and Parliament seeking a compromise to adopt a new budget bill and avoid a prolonged paralysis of public services.

**Kenya's president won't sign bill after parliament stormed**
Kenya's President William Ruto has announced that he will not sign a finance bill that sparked widespread protests and violence, resulting in the deaths of at least 22 people. The bill aimed to raise taxes and fees on various goods and services, but protesters argued it would worsen economic conditions for millions of Kenyans. Ruto initially called the protests 'treasonous', but later conceded to the will of the people, citing 'widespread dissatisfaction'. The move is a significant setback for Ruto, who had been praised by the US as a stable partner in Africa. The protests saw Kenyans from different tribes and backgrounds unite against the bill, with many young people who had supported Ruto in the 2022 election now opposing his reforms.

**Kenyan President Withdraws Budget Bill Amid Violent Protests**
Kenyan President William Ruto withdrew the 2024-2025 budget bill after violent protests left 22 people dead, according to the Kenyan Human Rights Commission. Ruto said, 'After listening carefully to the Kenyan people who loudly and clearly said they do not want the 2024 budget, I will not sign it... it will be withdrawn.' The opposition considered the decision 'a public relations stunt'. The government had previously announced plans to increase taxes, citing the country's debt burden, which is around 70% of its GDP. However, the opposition and protesters rejected the plan, calling for Ruto's resignation. The protests turned violent, with buildings being looted and set on fire, and the police using live ammunition to disperse the crowds. The US, EU, UN, and African Union have expressed concern over the violence and called for calm. Ruto has called for national dialogue with the youth, saying, 'We must find a way to manage our debt together... I will propose dialogue with our children and grandchildren.' Kenya is heavily indebted and the government is struggling to find alternative sources of revenue.

How do we manage our debt together?' This initiative aims to calm tensions and find sustainable solutions to Kenya's economic problems. The withdrawal of the budget has sparked mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a victory for the people and others remaining skeptical. Hanifa Adan, a protest leader, called the announcement 'an operation of com'. On social media, opinions are divided, with some protesters continuing to express distrust of the government.

Kenyan President William Ruto announced that he will withdraw the 2024 Finance Law, which sparked widespread protests that resulted in 22 deaths, according to the National Human Rights Commission of Kenya. The law was approved by parliament on Tuesday, leading to anger among protesters gathered outside the parliament building in Nairobi, who invaded the building, looting and setting fire to several buildings. The police fired live ammunition at the crowd, according to several non-governmental organizations. The President appealed for a national consultation, saying that now that they have removed the 2024 Finance Law, they need to have a conversation with the nation to move forward. He proposed a compromise with the young people of the nation, their children and daughters. The government considered these fiscal measures necessary to restore the country's financial maneuverability, heavily indebted with a public debt representing about 70% of the Gross Domestic Product, and to finance its ambitious budget for 2024-25 with a record expenditure of 4,000 million shillings (29 million euros).

The protesters forced the police cordon and entered the Parliament buildings, where lawmakers had just approved the budget amendments before their final approval, scheduled for before June 30. At least five people died and 31 were injured, according to Amnesty International Kenya. The main opposition coalition, Azimio, accused the government of 'unleashing its brute force against the children of our country.'

**Kenyan President Vows to Take Tough Stance Against Violence and Chaos**
Kenyan President William Ruto vowed to take a tough stance against 'violence and chaos' after protests against a proposed tax increase turned deadly, killing at least five people and injuring 31 others. Ruto said, 'We will take a full and swift action against the traitors who have committed these acts.' He also warned the planners, financiers, and instigators of the violence. The protests, which began on June 13, were sparked by a proposed budget for 2024-2025 that includes a 16% value-added tax on bread and a 2.5% annual tax on private cars. The government claims the taxes are necessary to restore the country's financial stability.

**Kenyan President Ruto Discusses Israeli-Palestinian Conflict with Biden**
Kenyan President William Ruto discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with US President Joe Biden during his visit to Washington. Ruto stated that Kenya has its own position on the issue, but it cannot dictate the US position. He emphasized that Kenya will continue to promote its position, regardless of the US opinion. Ruto also reiterated that the friendship between Israel and Kenya will continue. The conflict escalated after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip infiltrated Israeli territory on October 7, 2023, resulting in the deaths of civilians and the capture of over 240 hostages. Israel launched a military operation in Gaza to eliminate Hamas' military and political structures and free the hostages. A temporary humanitarian ceasefire was established in late November 2023 with the mediation of Egypt and Qatar, during which 110 hostages were released. The ceasefire was breached on December 1, and fighting resumed.
