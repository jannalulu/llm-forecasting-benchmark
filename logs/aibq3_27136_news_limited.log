**Thursday's Campaign Round-Up, 7.25.24**
The article covers various campaign-related news items from across the country. Vice President Kamala Harris' new 2024 campaign released its first video, emphasizing 'freedom' against a Beyonce soundtrack. At a campaign rally, Trump mispronounced Harris' first name, made unusual comments about Hannibal Lecter, and admitted to abandoning his 'nice' rhetoric after the recent assassination attempt. The Harris campaign responded by calling Trump 'old and quite weird.' A CNN poll found Trump leading Harris nationally, 49% to 46%. Fox News is not currently scheduled to host a 2024 presidential debate, but has reached out to the Trump and Harris campaigns to invite them to debate in Pennsylvania on September 17.

**What Happens if a Presidential Candidate Dies Before the Election?**
The 2024 US presidential election campaign will last until January 20, 2025. What happens if a candidate dies unexpectedly before the election? If a candidate dies unexpectedly, the respective parties must be able to present a replacement candidate. This process is similar to when a candidate withdraws, and those who did not make it through the primaries can be elected by the superdelegates at the party convention. Since the party conventions take place months before the election day, American citizens have sufficient time to decide on a candidate. This means that potential candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Michelle Obama could be elected. If the election winner dies after taking office as president, the vice president would take over. Therefore, candidates must choose a strong vice president who is capable of governing the country. This scenario has already occurred, such as when John F. Kennedy's vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, took over after his assassination in 1963 in Dallas, Texas.

**RFK Jr. Candidacy: A Controversial Figure in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election, has a background in elite education and is an environmentalist and anti-vaccine activist. He has a law degree from Harvard University and a doctorate in law from the London School of Economics. Kennedy has been spreading misinformation about vaccines and immunizations since 2005. According to a political specialist, Kennedy is an 'outsider' with no chance of winning. He is considered a 'conspiracist' and has made false claims about vaccines, including comparing vaccination to a 'holocaust' and claiming that immunizations cause autism in children. Kennedy has also made bizarre claims, such as saying that a worm ate part of his brain and that he has no effects from the incident. He has also been suspended from Instagram for repeatedly sharing false information about COVID-19. His candidacy has been met with criticism from his own family, who disavowed him after he made comments comparing pandemic measures to Nazi Germany. Despite this, Kennedy has gained votes from dissatisfied voters who are looking for an alternative to the traditional party candidates.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Faces Deadline to Qualify for CNN Presidential Debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate, has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first presidential debate of the 2024 US election, and a lawsuit filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may be his only hope. The CNN will broadcast the debate on June 27, after President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, agreed to the confrontation last month. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is midnight on Wednesday. Kennedy filed a complaint with the FEC in May, alleging that the CNN debate is an illegal campaign contribution to Biden and Trump because the media company is requiring him to meet 'different criteria' to participate in the debate. The campaign requested that the FEC take action by Thursday and prevent the CNN, Biden, and Trump from holding the debate on June 27 until they 'comply with the Federal Election Campaign Act', according to the complaint. The FEC declined to comment for this report. This election cycle presents a unique situation - since 1960, when the era of televised presidential debates began, it will be the first time that news organizations - first CNN, next week, and ABC, which will host a debate in September - will control the terms and parameters of the debates between candidates. Previously, the Commission on Presidential Debates sponsored the debates. CNN said that candidates qualified to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election and receive at least 15% support in four separate national polls. After the debate announcement, Kennedy and his campaign complained. Kennedy said that Biden and Trump are 'trying to exclude me from the debate because they fear I will win'. On Saturday, CNN said it was 'not impossible' for Kennedy to qualify, but he has not yet met the criteria. He received at least 15% in three polls so far and qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral votes, according to CNN. Kennedy's campaign did not comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain access to electoral ballots across the US, with $15 million raised for the process.

**AV24 Launches 'Only Kennedy Can Beat Trump' Ad Campaign - posting it on.**
American Values 2024 (AV24), a super PAC supporting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president, has launched an ad campaign titled 'Only Kennedy Can Beat Trump.' The ads, which will be displayed in New York City and Washington, DC until August 4, emphasize Kennedy's viability as an independent candidate. According to Larry Sharpe, Organizing for AV24, 'It doesn't matter who the Dems anoint, they can't beat Trump.' Tony Lyons, co-founder of AV24, added that Kennedy has been censored by Meta and most of the media for his inconvenient perspectives on how to fix America. A recent poll conducted by Zogby Strategies showed that in a head-to-head matchup between Trump and RFK Jr., Kennedy would win by 14 points (57% to Trump's 43%). This makes Kennedy the first independent president since George Washington won in 1789. AV24 aims to educate and mobilize voters to elect candidates who will restore and protect the soul of democracy in the United States.

**RFK Jr. PAC launches 'Only Kennedy Can Beat Trump' ad campaign**
The American Values 2024 (AV24) super PAC, backing independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential bid, launched an ad campaign promoting the message 'Only Kennedy Can Beat Trump.'

The campaign aims to draw attention to Kennedy's campaign, which has been underrepresented in the election cycle. AV24 co-founder Tony Lyons stated that the corrupt two major parties, mainstream media, and big tech have prevented voters from hearing the views of all presidential candidates, crippling the democratic process. The ad campaign will run from July 29 to August 4, and will be displayed in high-traffic areas, including national monuments, tourist attractions, and Capitol Hill.

**America is ripe for third-party candidate, but not Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- Marshall Bates**
The 2024 presidential race is considered to be one of the worst in American history, with many Americans disapproving of both major candidates, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. This presents an opportunity for a third-party candidate to win, but unfortunately, the most prominent third-party candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is not a suitable choice. Kennedy has a history of health issues and has run an ad that features misleading footage. The author of the article mourns the loss of a competent third-party candidate, as Kennedy's campaign has not been well-received. Regardless of the outcome of the election, the author predicts that the next four years will be challenging for America.

**RFK Jr.'s campaign files petitions to get on presidential ballot in critical 2024 swing-state Pennsylvania**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, has filed paperwork to get on the ballot in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state, six weeks before the August 1 deadline. To qualify, he must gather 5,000 signatures of registered voters. The campaigns of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump fear Kennedy could play a spoiler role in the election, especially in Pennsylvania, which has swung between parties in the last two presidential elections. Kennedy's petitions could be challenged in court by the major parties, and both campaigns have sought to portray him as an adversary.

**RFK Jr. Faces Midnight Deadline to Qualify for CNN Debate**
Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle. Kennedy has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that CNN's debate criteria is unfair and amounts to a prohibited campaign contribution to the incumbent President Joe Biden and his Republican rival Donald Trump. The FEC has declined to comment. Kennedy's campaign is in the process of gaining ballot access across the US, with $15 million raised for the process. He has qualified for the ballot in six states and has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls. CNN has set criteria for candidates to participate in the debate, including appearing on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold and receiving at least 15% in four separate national polls. Kennedy's campaign has criticized the criteria, saying it is unfair and biased towards the presumptive nominees. Some experts have also questioned the criteria, saying it is 'nonsensical' and allows Biden and Trump to qualify for the debate as presumptive nominees. Having an independent candidate like Kennedy on stage may make for a more substantive debate, according to some experts.
