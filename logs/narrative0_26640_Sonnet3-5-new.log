[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models.]

Nate: Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. After Biden dropped out in July, the chances of a formal debate plummeted.

Tetlock: Yes, our models had it at 12.5%. The combination of Trump's insistence on Fox News and the Democratic party's scramble to nominate Harris made a formal debate nearly impossible in such a short timeframe.

Nate: The writing was on the wall when Biden withdrew. The logistics of organizing a formal debate with a new nominee, plus Trump's demands about the venue – it was a perfect storm.

Tetlock: Not to mention Harris's team focusing on rebuilding campaign momentum rather than debate prep. When they proposed those separate town halls instead, it confirmed our model's prediction.

Nate: Another accurate forecast in the books. Sometimes political chaos is surprisingly predictable.

[They both chuckle and return to their computers.]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. With Biden's sudden withdrawal in July and the subsequent chaos within the Democratic Party, our models gave it a 12.3% chance of a formal debate happening before October 1st.

Nate: The signs were there. Trump's insistence on Fox News, the Democratic scramble to select a new nominee, and the time constraints for organizing a formal debate – it all pointed to a low probability event.

Philip: [checking his notes] The combination of Trump's conditions and the unprecedented situation of a sitting president withdrawing so late made it nearly impossible to arrange a formal debate in that timeframe.

Nate: No, our models had it at 12.3%, and once again, they were right. The town halls they ended up doing separately weren't what we'd call a formal debate.

[Both nod knowingly as they review their prediction charts]

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. With Biden's sudden withdrawal in July and the subsequent chaos within the Democratic Party, our models gave it a 12.3% chance of a formal debate happening before October 1st.

Nate: The timing was crucial. When Harris became the nominee, Trump's insistence on Fox News and her team's refusal to engage on that platform created an insurmountable deadlock.

Philip: [checking his notes] The ABC News debate slot went unused. Looking back at our July data, the indicators were clear - Trump's social media posturing and Harris's focus on traditional campaign events rather than direct confrontation made a formal debate highly unlikely.

Nate: No surprise there. The models factored in historical precedent of substitute nominees rarely debating this close to election day.

Philip: Correct. No debate occurred, and our models had it at 12.3%.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given what we knew by late July, with Biden's sudden withdrawal and Trump's demand for Fox News hosting, our models calculated a 12.3% probability of a formal debate happening before October 1st.

Nate: The Democratic party's scramble to nominate a replacement candidate after Biden's withdrawal left too little time for debate preparations. And Trump's insistence on Fox News as the only acceptable venue...

Philip: [interrupting] Plus, the historical precedent of candidates skipping debates when they're leading in polls. Our models factored all of that in.

Nate: No debate materialized, just as we predicted. Though that 12.3% wasn't negligible - there was a real chance if the Democrats had moved faster with their nomination process.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting.
