**Anthropic Launches Improved Version of Generative AI Model Claude**
Anthropic, an American company, has announced the launch of an improved version of its generative AI model, Claude, just a few months after the release of its previous series. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the new intermediate-sized model, is said to be 'twice as fast' and more intelligent than its predecessor. The new version will be available in the US, Europe, and France. Anthropic presented Claude 3 in March, which includes three power models, Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. According to Michael Gerstenhaber, product lead at Anthropic, the new Sonnet model has the ability to perform tasks of very high complexity. Users will have free access to the model on the web and mobile app, while businesses can access it through the 'Claude Team' plan for a fee. The success of OpenAI's ChatGPT has sparked a revolution in generative AI, which enables machines to understand and produce text, images, sound, and code, among other things, on simple natural language requests. Founded by former OpenAI employees, Anthropic aims to differentiate itself from its competitors by implementing stricter safeguards for this technology, which excites and worries people. This approach had made Claude less impressive than ChatGPT, but the startup believes it has now overcome the obstacle without sacrificing its values.

**airBaltic plans to go public by the end of 2024**
airBaltic, a Latvian airline, plans to go public by the end of 2024. The company has been planning an initial public offering (IPO) for a long time, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine delayed the process. However, the company's CEO, Martin Gauss, believes that the current time is ideal for the IPO. The airline plans to double its fleet to 100 aircraft by 2030 and needs investments to achieve this goal. The company aims to raise funds not only from the Latvian state but also from private shareholders through the IPO. According to Gauss, the company is in better shape than ever before and is preparing for the IPO with the help of banks, advisors, and consultants. The goal is to go public by the end of 2024, but if the market conditions are not favorable, the IPO may be postponed to 2025 or 2026.
