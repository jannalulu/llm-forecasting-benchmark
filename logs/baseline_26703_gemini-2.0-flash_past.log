Okay, let's analyze the likelihood of a Venezuelan invasion of Guyana before September 30, 2024, considering the provided resolution criteria.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Resolution Criteria Specificity:** The resolution criteria are very specific. The invasion must involve more than 100 ground troops acting deliberately on orders of the Venezuelan government, without the permission of the Guyanese government or the UN. It requires confirmation by Venezuela *or* any two permanent members of the UNSC.
*   **Time Remaining:** We are forecasting for a period ending on September 30, 2024. That gives us roughly two months.
*   **Recent Developments:** Tensions between Venezuela and Guyana regarding the Essequibo region remain high, but overt military action hasn't occurred despite heated rhetoric. Recent negotiations seem to have de-escalated the situation somewhat.
*   **International Pressure:** Any overt Venezuelan military action against Guyana would likely trigger strong international condemnation and potentially sanctions, particularly from the United States. Brazil's position is also a key consideration, and Brazil has expressed concern about any instability in the region.
*   **Venezuelan Capacity and Intent:** Venezuela has significant military capabilities, but launching a full-scale invasion across difficult terrain would be a major undertaking. There's a difference between saber-rattling and actual invasion. While Maduro has used the Essequibo issue to rally domestic support, a failed military adventure would be disastrous for him.
*   **UNSC Dynamics:** Getting two permanent UNSC members to confirm an invasion is significant. It could likely happen if an invasion occurs, especially if it's blatant.

**Reasoning:**

An outright invasion, as defined by the resolution criteria, seems unlikely in the next two months. The risks for Venezuela are enormous, and while Maduro is unpredictable, he is likely aware of the potential consequences. The international pressure, logistical challenges, and the specific requirement of confirmed troop numbers make a full-scale invasion less probable. The ongoing, albeit fragile, diplomatic efforts also suggest a lower likelihood.

However, tensions remain high. A miscalculation, a local skirmish escalating out of control, or a sudden shift in Venezuelan domestic politics could still trigger an incursion. It's also possible that Venezuela might attempt a smaller-scale operation that *doesn't* meet the specific criteria of the resolution (e.g., fewer than 100 troops), but we are specifically forecasting the defined event.

Given the short time frame, the recent de-escalation, and the significant risks involved, the probability of a qualifying invasion before September 30, 2024, is relatively low, but not zero.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 4.50%, but 3.00% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.
