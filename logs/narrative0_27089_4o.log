NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the tech world is buzzing. Apple did announce the iPhone 16 Pro models with Wi-Fi 7 yesterday. Our models had it at 65.32%.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, Nate. The anticipation was high, especially with the leaks suggesting Wi-Fi 7. Our data pointed towards this likelihood, given Ming-Chi Kuo's insights.

NATE SILVER  
The leap to 40Gb/s speeds was a strong indicator. Apple couldn't resist the competitive edge.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Absolutely. The shift aligns with their strategy to stay ahead in connectivity. Our models were spot on.

NATE SILVER  
It's fascinating how technology predictions reflect reality. Until next time, Philip.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Always a pleasure, Nate.
