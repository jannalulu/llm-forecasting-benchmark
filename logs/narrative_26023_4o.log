INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

The SUPERFORECASTERS, a group of astute analysts, sit around a table. The atmosphere is tense but focused.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leans forward)  
So, did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shakes head)  
No diplomatic expulsions or recalls. Our models had it at 15.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(consults notes)  
The leaked transcript and rising tensions in the South China Sea were significant, but both sides opted for restraint.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(nods)  
Indeed. The Philippines’ initial call for expulsion was more of a strategic maneuver.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And the Chinese response was calculated to avoid escalation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Smart diplomacy, given the stakes. Our models were spot on.

They exchange nods, a silent acknowledgment of their accuracy.

FADE OUT.

INT. FORECASTERS' HUB - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

Superforecasters gather around a digital board, analyzing the recent diplomatic developments between the Philippines and China.

FORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the question was clear: would there be any diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024?

FORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 75.00%, given the escalating tensions over the South China Sea and the leaked transcript incident. 

FORECASTER 3  
Yet, despite the heated rhetoric and the national security advisor's call for expulsions back in May, no official actions were taken by either side.

FORECASTER 1  
Indeed, it's a testament to the delicate balance both nations are maintaining. Our models were spot-on, reflecting the high probability but ultimately no resolution.

FORECASTER 2  
A reminder of how diplomacy often dances on the edge of action, yet sometimes steps back.

They nod, acknowledging the complex interplay of geopolitics.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LUCAS, sit at a table, laptops open, discussing recent events over coffee.

JANE  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
So, did it happen?

LUCAS  
(shaking his head)  
No diplomatic expulsions or recalls. Our models had it at 23.45%.

JANE  
(sipping her coffee)  
The tensions were high, especially after the leaked transcript and the South China Sea incidents. But no official actions.

LUCAS  
(nodding)  
The Philippines' call for expulsion was more of a political maneuver. China played it cool, despite the provocations.

JANE  
(smiling)  
It's fascinating how the models predict these nuances. The media hype made it seem inevitable.

LUCAS  
(grinning)  
That's why we trust the numbers. A diplomatic dance with no dramatic steps this time.

They clink their coffee cups, appreciating the quiet resolution.
