Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Base Rate:
- According to the articles, an average of 5 countries make their Olympic medal debut in each recent Olympics
- However, the question is specifically about gold medals
- In Tokyo 2020, only 3 countries (San Marino, Burkina-Faso, and Turkmenistan) made their medal debut

2. Current Situation:
- 68 countries have never won an Olympic medal
- 35 additional countries have won medals but never gold
- So there are approximately 103 countries that could potentially win their first gold

3. Early Results Analysis:
- After 3-4 days of competition, around 36 countries have won medals
- Most medals are going to traditional powerhouses (Japan, France, China, USA, etc.)
- Turkey has won its first medal (bronze in archery)
- No reports of any first-time gold medalists yet

4. Key Considerations:
- With 329 medal events, there are many opportunities
- However, traditional powers tend to dominate most events
- The early pattern shows medals concentrating among established nations
- Historical data suggests first-time winners are rare
- Only about 1/3 of the Olympics has happened so far

5. Counterbalancing Factors:
+ Large number of remaining events
+ More countries participating than ever before
- Strong competition from established nations
- Early results showing concentration among powerhouses

Given the early results showing concentration among established powers, but considering the large number of remaining events and opportunities, I estimate this is unlikely but not impossible.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 18.50% being the most likely. Probability: 18.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Base Rate:
- In Tokyo 2020, 3 countries won their first Olympic medals (San Marino, Burkina Faso, Turkmenistan)
- According to articles, an average of 5 countries make their podium debut in each of the last four editions
- However, the question asks specifically about first GOLD medals, not just any medal

2. Current Situation:
- 68 countries have never won any Olympic medal
- An additional 35 countries have won medals but never gold
- So there are approximately 103 countries eligible to win their first gold
- After 3 days of competition, no new country has won their first gold medal yet
- Current standings show traditional powerhouses (Japan, France, China, USA) dominating

3. Key Factors:
- Many events are still to come (329 total events)
- The number of countries winning their first gold in recent Olympics has been relatively low
- Host nation effect might benefit some smaller nations through increased participation
- Medal table currently shows established nations performing as expected

4. Analysis:
Positive factors:
- Large number of eligible countries (103)
- Many events remaining
- Historical average of 5 new medalists per Olympics

Negative factors:
- No new gold medalists yet after 3 days
- Traditional powers dominating early medals
- Gold medals are much harder to achieve than silver/bronze
- Historical precedent shows first golds are rare

5. Current Progress:
- With no new gold medal countries after 3 days and traditional powers dominating, achieving 5 debut gold medals seems increasingly unlikely
- The trend of medal distribution so far suggests established nations maintaining their advantage

Given all these factors, particularly the early dominance of traditional powers and the higher difficulty of winning gold compared to any medal, I assess this as having a relatively low probability.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

- Most medals are going to traditional powerhouses (Japan, France, USA, China)
- No reports of debut medals yet
- We're only a few days into the Olympics, with many events remaining

4. Positive Factors:
- Large pool of potential first-time winners (103 countries)
- Still many events remaining
- Host country effect might benefit some smaller nations
- More medal events (329) than previous Olympics

5. Negative Factors:
- Traditional powers dominating early medals
- Historical precedent shows it's rare for multiple countries to win first golds
- Winning first gold is harder than winning first medal
- Early results show concentration of medals among established nations

6. Current Progress:
- No debut gold medals reported yet
- Pattern of medals going to established Olympic powers
- Many events still to come but trend favors experienced nations

Given this analysis, reaching 5 debut gold medals seems unlikely. If we consider that getting a first medal is more common than a first gold, and the average for first medals is 5, then the likelihood of 5 first golds must be significantly lower.

4. Evidence For Lower Probability:

- Strong competition from established powers
- Limited medal opportunities remaining
- Many events already completed
- Most remaining events feature favorites from experienced nations

5. Evidence For Higher Probability:
