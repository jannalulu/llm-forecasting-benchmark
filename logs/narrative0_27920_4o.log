**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the deadline's passed. Before October 1, 2024, did Ethiopia and Somalia announce a settlement?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. Given the stalled talks in Ankara and Somalia's firm stance on sovereignty, it wasn't likely.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, despite Turkey's mediation efforts, the complexities of recognizing Somaliland were too great.

*They exchange a knowing nod.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Ethiopia's strategic need for the port is clear, but the geopolitical implications were underestimated.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Our models were spot on, as usual. Let's see if future negotiations bring any surprises.

*The camera zooms out, capturing the analysts deep in thought, as the scene fades to black.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the deadline has passed. Before October 1, 2024, would Ethiopia and Somalia announce an agreement settling their dispute over the Somaliland port deal?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the third round of talks in Ankara, the complexities were too great.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Somalia's insistence on sovereignty and Ethiopia's strategic interests in Somaliland were always going to be a tough knot to untangle.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Turkey's mediation efforts showed promise, but the geopolitical stakes, especially with Somaliland's unrecognized status, kept tensions high.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. Perhaps future negotiations will find common ground, but for now, the status quo remains.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the clock struck midnight, and we're left with our models. Did Ethiopia and Somalia announce a settlement over the Somaliland port deal?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 35.67%. The third round of talks in Ankara showed promise but ultimately fell short.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, the stakes were high. Ethiopia's need for sea access and Somalia's insistence on sovereignty—complex dynamics.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Turkey's mediation brought some convergence, but not enough for a full agreement. The geopolitical chessboard remains tense.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. As accurate as ever, our models reflected the intricate reality of international negotiations.

*They exchange knowing nods, acknowledging the delicate balance of probabilities and diplomacy.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the clock has struck past October 1st, and no agreement has been announced between Ethiopia and Somalia regarding the Somaliland port deal.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75% for a resolution by now. Given the complexities and the stakes involved, it wasn't surprising.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Despite Turkey's involvement and the third round of talks scheduled in Ankara, the political tensions were simply too high to overcome in time.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Precisely. Somalia's insistence on sovereignty respect posed a significant hurdle. Our models accounted for these dynamics accurately.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, a "no" it is, but the door isn't closed. Future diplomacy will be crucial.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the clock has passed October 1st, and the question on everyone's mind is: Did Ethiopia and Somalia settle their dispute over the Somaliland port deal?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Based on our models, which had access to news until September 6th, we predicted a resolution was unlikely. The third round of talks in Ankara was pivotal, but our models showed a 35.78% probability of a 'Yes.'

**NATE SILVER:** So, it's a 'No' then. Despite Turkey's mediation efforts, the complexities around Somaliland's recognition and Somalia's sovereignty concerns were too significant to overcome in such a short timeframe.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Precisely. The geopolitical stakes were high, but without a breakthrough, the models reflected reality accurately once again.
