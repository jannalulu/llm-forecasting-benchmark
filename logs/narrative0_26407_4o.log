*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, coffee cups in hand, surrounded by newspapers and data printouts.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the deadline has passed. Russia's second mobilization waveâ€”did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 35.75%. The ISW confirmed no official mobilization occurred.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. Given the staggering losses and Ukraine's mobilization plans, I thought the probability might've been higher.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, but Putin's concern about widespread discontent likely held him back. The political cost seemed too high.

**NATE SILVER**  
And the recruitment of 400,000 troops last year probably cushioned the need for formal mobilization.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Sometimes the invisible hand of politics trumps the visible need for troops.

*They sip their coffee, the weight of accurate forecasting evident in their expressions.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers strewn about, a large screen behind them displaying "Russia Mobilization Update."*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it's October 1st, and as of yesterday, the Institute for the Study of War hasn't reported a second mobilization wave in Russia.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
That's right, Nate. Our models had it at 35.67%. Given the political climate and Putin's concerns about public discontent, a large-scale mobilization seemed improbable.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Despite Ukraine's increased military efforts and Russia's significant losses, the Kremlin's strategy appears to rely more on recruitment rather than formal mobilization.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The geopolitical chessboard remains complex, but for now, our forecast stands validated.

*A moment of contemplation as they both nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**NATE SILVER**  
We'll continue to monitor the situation closely. Stay tuned.

Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75%. The political risks and public discontent were just too high for Putin.
