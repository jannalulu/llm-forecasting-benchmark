Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Key Evidence Pointing Toward License Approval:
1. Revolut has been actively pursuing the license for 4 years
2. Strong 2023 financial performance ($2.2bn revenue, $545m profit)
3. Clean audit opinion for first time in 2023
4. CEO Nikolay Storonsky repeatedly expresses confidence
5. Expanded global presence (45 million customers)
6. Relocated headquarters to Canary Wharf, signaling commitment to UK market

Key Evidence Against License Approval:
1. Regulatory hurdles remain significant
2. ECB pushing for enhanced financial crime controls
3. Complex ownership structure
4. Previous money laundering allegations
5. Already 3+ years into application process
6. No definitive timeline from regulators

Comparative Analysis:
- Similar fintech peers like Monzo/Starling obtained licenses
- Regulatory environment increasingly scrutinizes fintech

Probability Calculation Factors:
- Time remaining: ~2 months
- Momentum seems positive but regulatory discretion is critical
- High stakes for both Revolut and regulators

Balancing Considerations:
- Regulators unlikely to rush decision
- Revolut has demonstrated increasing financial/operational maturity

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 52.75%, but 44.25% being the most likely. Probability: 44.25%.

Let's carefully analyze the Revolut UK banking license situation:

Key Evidence:
1. Revolut has been seeking a UK banking license since 2021 (3+ years)
2. Recent financial performance is strong:
- Reported £438m profit in 2023
- Revenue nearly doubled to £1.8bn
- 45 million global customers
- Clean audit report for first time

3. Regulatory challenges:
- ECB pushing for improved financial crime controls
- Previous issues with financial reporting
- Complex ownership structure raised regulatory concerns
- Allegations of money laundering previously hindered progress

4. Leadership Signals:
- CEO Nikolay Storonsky repeatedly expresses confidence about license
- UK CEO Francesca Carlesi says application is "progressing well"
- Relocated headquarters to Canary Wharf, signaling commitment to UK market

Comparative Context:
- Peers like Monzo and Starling already obtained licenses
- Significant regulatory scrutiny for fintech banking licenses

Timeline Consideration:
- Current date: 2024-07-24
- Deadline: 2024-09-30
- Remaining time: ~2 months

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Strong financial performance increases credibility
- Ongoing regulatory engagement suggests progress
- Short remaining timeframe limits complexity of remaining steps

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Overly optimistic: Regulatory hurdles more complex than anticipated
- Overly pessimistic: Company clearly motivated and preparing

Synthesizing these factors, I assess the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 62.75%, but 54.30% being the most likely. Probability: 54.30%.
