**India's Navy Accidentally Reveals Removal of Nuclear Weapons in Yoga Post on Instagram**
The Indian Navy accidentally revealed the removal of nuclear weapons from a ship in a yoga post on Instagram. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) used social media to track the movement of India's nuclear arsenal. According to Matt Korda, Associate Director of the Nuclear Information Project at FAS, 'This is probably the most unexpected source I've found for information related to nuclear weapons.' Korda discovered that India had removed its nuclear weapons from two patrol boats, the INS Suvarna and the INS Subhadra, by reviewing satellite images and searching for keywords on social media. The removal of the nuclear weapons was confirmed by two yoga posts on Instagram, one from October 2022 and another from February 2024, which showed the absence of the stabilizers required for launching nuclear missiles. 'It's a bit unusual to learn about military systems, especially nuclear systems, in non-military environments,' Korda said. 'This case is unique because it shows that even in a non-military context, information about nuclear systems can be revealed.'

**US Receives Over 200 New Nuclear Weapons, Largest Number Since Cold War**
The US Department of Defense received over 200 new nuclear weapons in 2023, the largest number since the Cold War, according to National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Administrator Jill Hruby. She stated, 'As a result of the investments made under the administrations of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, the NNSA was able to deliver more than 200 new nuclear weapons to the Department of Defense last year. This is the largest annual delivery since the end of the Cold War,' according to the Russian TASS news agency. Hruby noted that in October 2023, the US announced a new modification to the B61 nuclear bomb, saying, 'We expect the first B61-13 unit to be produced in 2026.' The NNSA administrator added that the budget required for strategic stability programs will be around $25 billion, including $21 billion for nuclear weapons. According to Hruby, nuclear power is 'on the verge of a renaissance' amid climate change, and that 'in this case, high-enriched uranium will be used in nuclear reactors.' Hruby believes that this will pose a challenge to the current nuclear non-proliferation regime, which the US relies on. In November, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree withdrawing Russia from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, citing the war in Ukraine and the crisis with the West. The treaty, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996, aims to ban all nuclear tests, but it has not been implemented due to the lack of accession by several major nuclear powers, including the US and China. In October, Russia conducted a series of missile launches to prepare its forces for a 'massive nuclear strike' in response to a similar attack.

**Pentagon Receives Over 200 New Nuclear Weapons in 2023**
The Pentagon received over 200 new nuclear weapons in 2023, according to Dr. Lisa Hrooby, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration. She stated, 'As a result of the investments made under the administrations of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, the nuclear security administration was able to deliver more than 200 new nuclear weapons to the Department of Defense last year. This is the largest annual delivery since the end of the Cold War.' Hrooby also mentioned that the US announced a new modification to the B61 nuclear bomb, the B61-13, in October 2023, and expects the first unit to be produced in 2026. The budget required for strategic stability programs, including nuclear arms, is estimated to be around $25 billion, with $21 billion allocated for nuclear weapons. According to Hrooby, nuclear power is 'on the verge of a renaissance' as the US fights climate change, and the high-enriched uranium will be used in nuclear reactors. However, she believes that this will pose a challenge to the current non-proliferation regime that the US relies on.

**US Reveals Number of Strategic Nuclear Warheads**
The United States has revealed the number of its strategic nuclear warheads, which stood at 3,748 as of September 2023. This is the first time the data has been made public since October 2021. The Federation of American Scientists stated that the nuclear arsenal will consist of 3,708 warheads in 2024. Additionally, the number of non-strategic (tactical) nuclear weapons in the US has decreased by more than 90% since September 1991. According to the National Nuclear Security Administration, the US had 3,748 nuclear warheads intended for strategic forces as of September 2023.

**China Expresses Concern Over New US Nuclear Strategy**
China has expressed concern over a new American nuclear strategy targeting it. According to a report by the New York Times, US President Joe Biden approved a secret nuclear strategy in March, which for the first time directs American deterrence towards China, focusing on China's rapidly growing nuclear arsenal. The strategy also aims to prepare the US for potential coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said, 'The US is promoting the narrative of a Chinese nuclear threat and finding excuses for gaining a strategic advantage.' She added, 'The facts have proven that the US has been constantly stirring up the so-called Chinese nuclear threat theory in recent years.' The US has been updating its nuclear strategy every four years, and it is highly classified, with only a few printed copies distributed to national security officials and defense leaders. In June, the US National Security Council's director for arms control and non-proliferation, Berne Fadi, mentioned the document, which for the first time examines whether the US is ready to respond to simultaneous or sequential nuclear crises using a mix of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. Fadi said the new strategy confirms 'the need to deter Russia, China, and North Korea at the same time.' The White House stated that the secret nuclear strategy approved by Biden this year is not a response to a specific country or threat, but rather a constant US concern about China's nuclear expansion. According to a Pentagon report released in October 2023, China's nuclear arsenal currently includes over 500 active nuclear warheads, which is expected to increase to 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, numbers also reported by the US and Russia.

**US Revises Secret Nuclear Strategy, Focusing on China and North Korea**
US President Joe Biden has approved a revised, highly classified nuclear strategy for the United States, according to a report by the New York Times. The strategy, called the 'Nuclear Employment Guidance', focuses on preparing the US for potential coordinated nuclear threats from China, Russia, and North Korea. The Pentagon believes that China's nuclear arsenal will rival that of the US and Russia in size and diversity within the next decade. The document, updated every four years, is so highly classified that it has no electronic copies and only a few printed copies are distributed among a select group of national security officials. The NYT notes that the forming partnership between Russia and China, as well as the conventional arms supplied by North Korea and Iran to Russia for the war in Ukraine, have fundamentally changed Washington's thinking. The new document serves as a stark reminder that the next president will face a significantly more unstable and changed nuclear landscape than the one that existed just three years ago. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, including during the crisis in October 2022, when Biden and his advisors feared that the likelihood of nuclear use could rise to 50% or higher. Former US President Donald Trump confidently predicted that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would give up his nuclear weapons, but instead, Kim has doubled down and now has over 60 units of nuclear weapons and fuel for even more rockets. The expanded North Korean arsenal is rapidly approaching the size of those of Pakistan and Israel and is large enough to theoretically coordinate threats with Moscow and Beijing, the NYT notes. A non-classified notification of the revised strategy is expected to be sent to Congress before the end of Biden's presidential term, according to Reuters.

**US Reorients Nuclear Deterrence Strategy to Focus on China's Rapid Nuclear Expansion**
According to a highly classified and recently updated plan, approved by President Joe Biden in March, the US is reorienting its nuclear deterrence strategy to focus on China's rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal. The plan, which is updated every four years, also prepares the US for potential nuclear challenges coordinated by China, Russia, and North Korea. The New York Times reported that the document is so classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of printed copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders. The plan examines in detail whether the country is prepared to face nuclear crises or a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear threats. The newspaper noted that the possibility of US adversaries coordinating nuclear threats seemed remote in the past, but explained that the 'emerging association' between Russia and China, and the conventional arms provided by North Korea and Iran to Russia for the war in Ukraine, have changed Washington's thinking. The change is also attributed to China's nuclear ambitions. China's nuclear expansion is advancing at a faster pace than US intelligence officials anticipated two years ago, driven by President Xi Jinping's determination to reach or surpass the size of the US and Russian nuclear arsenals. The Pentagon reported in October last year that China had 500 nuclear warheads in May 2023, a figure that was on track to surpass previous predictions, and could reach 1,000 by 2030. The US Department of Defense's annual report on China's military power calculated that China's nuclear arsenal will continue to increase until 2035, in line with the goal of ensuring that the modernization of its army is 'basically complete' by then. The New York Times also noted that Washington is concerned about the paralysis of talks with China on nuclear security improvements. There was an exchange on the matter between the two countries last fall, but from Beijing, it has been suggested, according to the newspaper's information, that there is no interest in continuing the talks.

**Biden's Secret Nuclear Strategy Shifts Focus to China**

**Biden approves secret plan to deter expansion of China's nuclear arsenal**
US President Joe Biden has approved a top-secret nuclear strategic plan that redirects Washington's strategy to deter the expansion of China's nuclear arsenal. The plan, titled 'Guidelines for the Use of Nuclear Weapons,' is the first to address the possibility of responding to nuclear crises that erupt simultaneously or sequentially with a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. According to Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the new strategy takes into account the 'significant increase in size and diversity' of China's nuclear arsenal. The document emphasizes the need to simultaneously deter Russia, China, and North Korea. Intelligence agencies are trying to determine whether Russia is helping the North Korean and Iranian missile programs in return for conventional weapons. The new document is a stark reminder that the next president will face a changed and far more volatile nuclear landscape than the one that existed just three years ago. 'It was an important moment,' said Richard Haas, a former senior State Department and National Security Council official, referring to a crisis in October 2022 when Biden and his aides feared that the possibility of using nuclear weapons could rise to 50% or more.

**US Prepares for Nuclear Conflict with China, Russia, and North Korea**
According to The New York Times, citing sources within the US government, President Joe Biden approved a new nuclear strategy in March, which involves preparing the country for a potential conflict with China, Russia, and North Korea. The document, updated approximately every four years, is so secret that there is no digital copy, and only high-ranking officials in national security and military commanders in the Pentagon receive physical copies. The new version states that China's nuclear potential will be on par with that of the US and Russia in the next decade. Biden's order requires US forces to prepare for a coordinated nuclear threat. The secret papers also reveal some details about the Russian-Ukrainian war, including that in 2022, the Biden administration estimated a 50% chance of Russia using nuclear weapons against Ukraine during the 'October crisis'. This led to China and India issuing statements condemning nuclear blackmail, which helped to ease tensions.

**AUKUS Countries Take Step to Facilitate Defense Industry Exports**
Australia, the US, and the UK, parties to the AUKUS agreement, have taken a new step to facilitate defense industry exports. According to ABC News, the three countries have reached the final stage of a plan to 'facilitate defense industry trade' and have removed bureaucratic barriers for AUKUS partner countries. The US has announced that it will remove regulations on arms exports to Australia by next month, and the three AUKUS countries aim to share military technology. The current US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) have been a barrier to the close cooperation between the three countries, and the new application, which is expected to come into effect on September 1, is expected to increase defense exports. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said, 'These important regulations will revolutionize defense trade and cooperation.' Meanwhile, Australia has signed an agreement with the US and the UK on August 12 to transfer nuclear submarine materials to the country and share classified information in this field. Australia signed the AUKUS agreement with the US and the UK in October 2021 to cooperate in nuclear submarine technology. The AUKUS agreement has raised concerns that it may increase tensions in the region in the future, as it will make Australia the first country to have nuclear-powered submarines without being a nuclear power. The transfer of nuclear technology from a nuclear-armed state to a non-nuclear state is considered a 'gap' in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and Australia is seen as a precedent in this field. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese defended the agreement against criticism, saying that China has significantly increased its military presence in the region and that the agreement is necessary. Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, on the other hand, said, 'The real purpose of AUKUS is to establish military control over Australia. In the end, Australia will become the 51st state of the US.'

**North Korea May Conduct New Nuclear Test in October, According to Experts**
Bruce Klingner, a researcher at the Heritage Foundation, believes that even if Donald Trump returns to the White House, holding a new summit with Kim Jong-un will not be one of his priorities. According to Klingner, Trump's predecessor would have thought that he did not gain any benefits from dialogue with the North Korean leader and would have focused on national issues, prioritizing China, Taiwan, Ukraine, and the Middle East in his foreign policy. Klingner also notes that North Korea may be less interested in new negotiations with Trump, as it has secured a solid support from Russia. Some experts predict that if Kim Jong-un thinks he can benefit from Trump's return, he may order a new nuclear test or the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in October, a month before the US presidential election, in order to question Biden's North Korea policy and help Trump win the election.

The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) has accidentally revealed India's withdrawal of nuclear arms. A yoga post on Instagram has been the source of the leak. The FAS, a non-profit organization based in the US that tracks the world's nuclear arsenal, published an article titled 'Hot-Launch Yoga: Cobra Pose Reveals Nuke Repose', which made a play on words between yoga and nuclear arms. The article revealed that India had moved its nuclear arms from two patrol boats, the INS Suvarana and the INS Subhadra, to a submarine. The FAS discovered this by analyzing satellite images and searching for keywords on social media, including a yoga post on Instagram from October 2022 that showed people practicing yoga on the deck of the INS Suvarana, and another post from February 2024 that showed the deck of the INS Subhadra without the stabilizers needed to launch nuclear arms. 'It's much more unusual to learn about military systems, especially nuclear systems, in non-military environments. That's what makes this case unique', said the FAS.

**India's Navy Accidentally Reveals Removal of Nuclear Weapons in Yoga Post on Instagram**
The Indian Navy accidentally revealed the removal of nuclear weapons from a ship in a yoga post on Instagram. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) used social media to track the movement of India's nuclear arsenal. According to Matt Korda, Associate Director of the Nuclear Information Project at FAS, 'This is probably the most unexpected source I've found for information related to nuclear weapons.' Korda discovered that India had removed its nuclear weapons from two patrol boats, the INS Suvarna and the INS Subhadra, by reviewing satellite images and searching for keywords on social media. The removal of the nuclear weapons was confirmed by two yoga posts on Instagram, one from October 2022 and another from February 2024, which showed the absence of the stabilizers required for launching nuclear missiles. 'It's a bit unusual to learn about military systems, especially nuclear systems, in non-military environments,' Korda said. 'This case is unique because it shows that even in a non-military context, information about nuclear systems can be revealed.'

**No First Use of Nuclear Weapons: Rejecting Nuclear Annihilation**
The collapse of nuclear weapons talks between China and the US in July 2024 has led to a regression of nuclear tensions to levels not seen since the Cold War. China has suspended nuclear negotiations with the US, blaming high levels of arms sales to Taiwan. The US has accused China of a 'lack of transparency' and a failure to agree on 'risk reduction strategies'. China has expanded its nuclear arsenal to 500 warheads, predicted to reach 1000 by 2030. The US contends this buildup is inconsistent with China's No First Use offer. The US currently deploys 1770 warheads and keeps over 5000 in reserve. No First Use of nuclear weapons provides the only assurance that the first use of nuclear weapons will not degenerate into general nuclear war. Princeton's Science and Security Lab predicts such a scenario, where a small tactical nuclear weapon used by Russia would lead to a nuclear exchange, resulting in millions of deaths and casualties. A No First Use treaty would achieve the same security balance through mutually agreed verifiable treaties without building diabolical weapons systems. The great majority of the world's states and their people agree with NFU policies. Nuclear powers have already committed not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear armed countries. The Non-Proliferation Treaty governing nuclear weapons came into force in 1970 with over 190 countries now signatories. Refusal by nuclear weapon states to fulfill their responsibilities has caused the quinquennial NPT Review Conferences to fail over the last fifteen years. 'No First Use of nuclear weapons was first promoted by a large contingent of scientists working on the Manhattan Project even before the A-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945.'

**Nuclear-weapon States Urged to Promote Non-proliferation and Disarmament**
The Second Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Eleventh Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference at the UN in Geneva concluded on August 2, 2024, without an agreed outcome. The five nuclear-weapon states—China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US—are engaging in a new nuclear arms race, spending $86 billion last year on modernizing and expanding their arsenals. The nine nuclear-weapon states possess roughly 12,100 nuclear warheads, with over 9,500 in active military stockpiles. ICAN stated, 'nuclear weapons are the most destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever created.' The nuclear-weapon states have been involved in nuclear sharing, contrary to Article VI of the NPT, which requires States to pursue effective measures related to nuclear disarmament. States and civil society organizations have raised concerns about the risks of nuclear sharing, with Kazakhstan stating that 'the sharing of nuclear weapons is a dangerous and outdated practice that brings us closer to war.' The response from nuclear-weapon states and their allies was to bristle, deflect responsibility, and point at each other. A joint Inter-faith and Values Appeal to the 2024 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Prep Com was presented to the governments meeting at the UN in Geneva, calling for halting the modernization and production of nuclear weapons and affirming that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.

**US and AUKUS Partners Develop Nuclear Defense and Capabilities**
The United States has announced the development of nuclear defense and capabilities with its AUKUS partners, Australia and the United Kingdom. The agreement, signed on August 5, 2024, will allow the sharing of information related to nuclear-powered submarine propulsion between the partners, and enable the UK and US to transfer materials and equipment to Australia necessary for the safe and secure operation, maintenance, and management of traditional nuclear-powered submarines. Since the announcement of this initiative, the partners have been committed to implementing it in a way that meets the highest standards of non-proliferation, protecting sensitive information, materials, and equipment. The agreement reaffirms the international non-proliferation commitments of the countries involved, and is consistent with them. As a non-nuclear-armed state party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Australia has reaffirmed that it does not possess and will not seek to acquire nuclear weapons. The US administration described the agreement as a significant milestone and a demonstration of its partners' commitment to providing this vital capability.

**Pentagon Receives Over 200 Nuclear Weapons in 2023, Highest Number Since Cold War**
The Pentagon received over 200 nuclear weapons in 2023, the highest number since the Cold War, according to US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Administrator Jill Hruby. She stated, 'As a result of investments made under the administrations of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, the NNSA was able to deliver more than 200 modern nuclear weapons to the Department of Defense last year. This is the largest annual delivery since the end of the Cold War.' Hruby noted that in October 2023, the US announced a new modification to the B61 nuclear bomb, saying, 'We expect the first B61-13 unit to be produced in 2026.' The NNSA Administrator added that the budget required for strategic stability programs will be around $25 billion, including $21 billion for nuclear weapons. According to Hruby, nuclear power is 'on the verge of a renaissance' as the world fights climate change, and she stated that 'in this case, high-assay low-enriched uranium will be used in nuclear reactors.' Hruby believes that this will pose a challenge to the current nuclear non-proliferation regime, which the US relies on.

**US Acquires Record Number of Modernized Nuclear Weapons**
The US Defense Ministry has acquired over 200 modernized nuclear weapons in 2023, according to the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Jill Hruby. This is a record annual delivery, said Hruby, citing the investments made during the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and current President Joe Biden. The NNSA delivered 200 modernized nuclear weapons to the Defense Ministry last year, Hruby said. 'This is the largest annual delivery since the end of the Cold War. In October 2023, the US announced the B61 nuclear bomb's new modification, the B61-13. We expect the first B61-13 weapon to be produced in the 2026 fiscal year. The budget request for strategic stability programs will be approximately $25 billion, with $21 billion allocated for nuclear weapons,' Hruby said.

Hruby believes that this will pose a challenge to the current nuclear non-proliferation regime, which the US relies on. In November, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree withdrawing Russia from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, citing the war in Ukraine and the crisis with the West. The treaty, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996, aims to ban all nuclear tests, but it has not been implemented due to the lack of accession by several major nuclear powers, including the US and China. In October, Russia conducted a series of missile launches to prepare its forces for a 'massive nuclear strike' in response to a similar attack.

**March Against Nuclear Arms on Menez-Hom: A Call for Abolition and Referendum**
The Finistère Collective for the Abolition of Nuclear Arms (CIAN 29) is organizing a march against nuclear arms on the Menez-Hom on August 6, 2024, to commemorate the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The march will start at 11:30 am at the Sainte-Marie du Menez-Hom parking lot and will take place in the vicinity of the nuclear base of Île Longue on the Crozon peninsula. According to the militants, 'the region is more than concerned by the nuclear danger with this base.' They are calling for a referendum on the abolition of nuclear arms, citing a 2022 IFOP survey that showed 70% of respondents in favor of such a referendum. The march aims to inform locals and tourists about the issue and to remember the Hiroshima bombing, which 'is a catastrophe that has already occurred and could happen again in the future.' The CIAN 29 also proposes the scenario of a hydroelectric power plant as a possible reconversion of the Île Longue base, which has 'already made victims' among the workers exposed to nuclear radiation. The collective wants France to respect the 1992 Non-Proliferation Treaty and sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. 'It's antidemocratic that France finances, maintains, and modernizes a nuclear military policy while public opinion is against it,' said a militant. 'We want to show that the question of nuclear arms deserves to be asked.'

**South Africa Still Holds Reserves of Highly Enriched Uranium**
South Africa still has reserves of highly enriched uranium, according to Netwerk24, citing Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe, as reported by Bloomberg. 'The nation declared its nuclear material reserves, which can be used for creating weapons, to the International Atomic Energy Agency as part of a comprehensive safeguards agreement,' Mantashe said. However, the level of uranium enrichment is classified information, Mantashe added. Noel Stott, an expert in nuclear issues, notes that the country's uranium reserves are largely excess from the nuclear weapons program of the apartheid era. South Africa is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Meanwhile, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik stated that North Korea may consider a nuclear test closer to the US presidential elections on November 5 to boost its authority. The US recently declassified information on its nuclear arsenal, last updated in October 2021. As of September 2023, the US nuclear stockpile consisted of 3,748 nuclear warheads, a decrease of 88% since the end of the 1967 fiscal year, when the stockpile stood at 31,255 warheads.

**Russia Begins Third Stage of Non-Strategic Nuclear Exercises**
Russia has started the third stage of non-strategic nuclear exercises, which began in May. The exercises involve the Southern and Central military districts, as well as the personnel of the Aerospace Forces, according to the Ministry of Defense. The military will work on preparing parts of the Russian Armed Forces for the practical application of non-strategic nuclear weapons. As a reminder, during the first two stages, the military received special ammunition from storage facilities and installed it on carriers. Now, the strike complexes will be taken to firing positions and conduct electronic launches at mock targets. Despite the desire of many to see a nuclear ' mushroom cloud', it is unlikely that we will see it, as there are no training grounds in the Central and Southern Military Districts where a tactical charge could be detonated. However, the signal that Russia is sending to its 'Western partners' is clear, even without special effects.

Russia has started the third stage of exercises for non-strategic nuclear forces. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the exercises will focus on preparing parts of the Russian Armed Forces 'for the combat application of non-strategic nuclear weapons.' The first stage of the exercises took place in May 2024, with Russia citing the need to maintain the readiness of personnel to respond and ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the state 'in response to provocative statements and threats from individual Western officials.' The United States criticized the exercises, with John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications in the US National Security Council, stating in May, 'It's reckless and irresponsible for a leader of a major nuclear power to be rattling their weapons in this way.' Similar exercises using tactical nuclear weapons were conducted in the Soviet Union, but not in modern Russia.

**US Conducts Test Launch of Hypersonic Weapon**
The United States has conducted a test launch of a hypersonic weapon. According to RIA Novosti, citing an American military official, the Army and US Navy recently conducted a test of a conventional hypersonic system on a space station based on the US Space Force base on Cape Canaveral in Florida. The official described this test as 'an important step in the development of operational hypersonic technology'. However, he did not specify whether the launch was successful. The official also noted that the US received important data for further progress in hypersonic weapons during the test. The US Department of Defense announced on July 10 that the United States will deploy long-range, hypersonic weapons in Germany in 2026. Previously, Bloomberg reported, citing a report by the US Government Accountability Office, that the US Army had failed to achieve its goal of deploying its first battery of hypersonic missiles, LRHW (Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon), by October 2025. The US Army has previously acknowledged problems with testing hypersonic weapons.

**USA reveals number of nuclear weapons**
The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has revealed the number of nuclear weapons the USA has in stock. According to NNSA, as of September last year, the USA had 3748 nuclear weapons, which is 88% less than the peak of 31,255 in 1967. NNSA states that the stockpile includes both active and inactive strategic and non-strategic warheads. The USA has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads from 1994 to 2023, with 2000 of them retired and waiting to be dismantled. The NNSA's decision to disclose the number of nuclear weapons is to be more transparent and follow the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970, which prohibits the receipt, production, and transfer of nuclear weapons, as well as assistance in producing them.

**Iran on the Brink of Obtaining Nuclear Weapons: A Result of Biden's Failed Foreign Policy**
The US State Department has announced that Iran is close to obtaining nuclear weapons. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that Iran is only a few weeks away from obtaining the necessary materials for nuclear weapons. The US government believes that if the nuclear agreement had remained in place, Iran would have had a year to obtain nuclear weapons, but now the timeline has been reduced to just a few weeks. The article suggests that the US administration's foreign policy under President Biden has contributed to Iran's progress in developing its nuclear program. The article highlights several key events, including the release of $6 billion in Iranian assets in September 2023, which was used to develop nuclear materials and finance proxy forces, and the US's decision to ease sanctions on Iranian oil sales in October 2023. The article concludes that the US's foreign policy under President Biden has been a failure, and that the country's actions have contributed to the growth of Iran's military and economic power.

**US Reveals Data on Strategic Nuclear Arsenal, Russia and US Remain World's Largest Nuclear Powers**
The United States has revealed data on its strategic nuclear arsenal, stating that it has 3748 nuclear warheads as of September 2023. This is the first time the US has provided such information since October 2021. The US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) reported that between 1994 and 2023, Washington has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads. Additionally, around 2000 warheads are currently being decommissioned. The US has reduced its non-strategic (tactical) nuclear arsenal by more than 90% since September 30, 1991. The NNSA emphasized the importance of transparency in nuclear arsenals for efforts to prevent the spread and disarmament of nuclear weapons, including obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Russia and the US remain the world's largest nuclear powers, accounting for around 90% of the world's nuclear arsenal. The US has deployed nuclear weapons in five NATO countries under the protection of the US Air Force, with a total of around 100 warheads, consisting entirely of gravity bombs B61. The US regularly speaks about the nuclear threat posed by other countries, including Russia's alleged plans to deploy similar weapons in space. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has denied these allegations, stating that they are baseless and have no connection to reality. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has stated that Iran is close to being able to obtain materials for making nuclear weapons, saying it's a matter of weeks.

**US Releases Data on Its Nuclear Arsenal for the First Time in Three Years**
The United States has published recently declassified information about its nuclear arsenal to update the information last announced in October 2021. The document was published on the website of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and became known on July 20. According to the document, as of September 2023, the US had 3748 nuclear warheads in storage. This number is after a reduction of 88% compared to the maximum value of 31,255 at the end of the 1967 fiscal year and an additional reduction of 83% compared to the level after the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989. The US has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads from 1994 to 2023. From September 30, 2020, the US dismantled 405 nuclear warheads. Approximately 2,000 nuclear warheads are currently being removed from service and awaiting dismantling, according to the document. The US has reduced its non-strategic nuclear weapons by more than 90% since September 30, 1991. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission notes that the nuclear stockpile includes both active and inactive warheads. Active warheads include strategic and non-strategic weapons that are maintained in a working, ready-to-use form and logistical reserves. Inactive warheads are stored on the shelf in a non-working state and their tritium balloons are removed.

**US Releases Data on Strategic Nuclear Arsenal for 2023**
The United States has released data on its strategic nuclear arsenal for 2023. As of September 2023, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) reported that the US has 3748 nuclear warheads intended for strategic forces. This is the first time such information has been published since October 2021. The number reflects an 88% reduction in stockpiles compared to the maximum of 31,255 warheads in the 1967 fiscal year and an 83% reduction compared to the level of 22,217 warheads at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The Federation of American Scientists also reports that by 2024, the US will have only 3708 nuclear warheads. As a result, the US has lost its former unchallenged leadership in nuclear arms. They were unable to take advantage of this, as the destruction of their economic and human potential was guaranteed.

**US Reveals 3748 Nuclear Warheads as of September 2023**
The United States has revealed that it had 3748 nuclear warheads as of September 2023. This information was published by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The number of warheads has decreased significantly since the end of the Cold War, with a reduction of 88% compared to the maximum value of 31,255 in 1967. The NNSA also reported that the US has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads since 1994, with 405 additional warheads dismantled as of September 2020. The US has also removed over 2000 warheads from service and is awaiting their dismantling. The country has reduced its tactical nuclear weapons by over 90% since 1991, with almost all non-strategic nuclear weapons created during the Cold War being withdrawn from service and dismantled. The NNSA noted that non-strategic nuclear weapons are not accountable under the SNO-III treaty, which was signed between the US and Russia in 2010. Russia has reportedly deployed 1710 nuclear warheads, while China has around 500. NATO's number of operational nuclear weapons is classified, but according to The Telegraph, the UK has 40 out of 225, the US has around 1700 out of 3700, and France has 300 nuclear warheads. NATO Secretary-General announced on June 17, 2024, that the alliance is negotiating the deployment of more nuclear weapons in response to the growing threat from Russia and China. US Secretary of State stated on July 19, 2024, that Iran may develop fissile material for nuclear weapons within one or two weeks.

**US Publishes Declassified Information on Nuclear Weapon Stockpiles**
The United States has recently published declassified information on its nuclear weapon stockpiles. This updated information will replace the data published in October 2021. The increased transparency of nuclear weapon stockpiles is important for efforts in non-proliferation and disarmament, including obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and efforts to combat all types of nuclear weapons, including deployed, non-deployed, strategic, and non-strategic ones. As of September 2023, the US nuclear warhead stockpile consisted of 3,748 warheads. This number represents an 88% reduction compared to the maximum value (31,255) at the end of the 1967 fiscal year and an 83% decrease compared to the level (22,217) at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989. The US has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads from 1994 to 2023. From September 30, 2020, the US dismantled 405 nuclear warheads. Approximately 2,000 additional nuclear warheads have been taken out of service and are awaiting dismantling. The number of non-strategic nuclear weapons in the US has decreased by more than 90% since September 30, 1991.

**US Reveals Data on Strategic Nuclear Arsenal: A Reduction of 88% Since 1967**
The United States has unexpectedly declassified data on its strategic nuclear arsenal, revealing that as of September last year, it had 3,748 warheads. This is the first time Washington has published such information since October 2021, when it had 3,750 warheads, just two more. A group of Democratic congressmen have repeatedly urged the Biden administration to reduce nuclear spending. In August 2022, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that Washington was committed to reducing the role of nuclear weapons and preventing an arms race. According to a new report from the US National Nuclear Security Administration, the White House has reduced its stockpile of nuclear warheads by 88% compared to the maximum of 31,255 warheads in 1967. However, the number of non-strategic nuclear weapons has decreased by more than 90% since 1991. The Pentagon has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads since 1994, and around 2,000 more are awaiting demolition. Meanwhile, the International Campaign to Ban Nuclear Weapons notes that the US spent the most on supporting and modernizing its arsenal in 2023, with a staggering $51.5 billion. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, as of 2024, the US has 1,770 warheads deployed and 1,938 in storage. Russia has 1,710 warheads, and the UK has 120. Despite public statements about the importance of disarmament and preventing nuclear conflict, the US continues to underestimate the real and long-term consequences of nuclear war.

The US plans to deploy long-range and hypersonic weapons in Germany in 2026, according to the Pentagon. The planned deployments will include SM-6 surface-to-air missiles, Tomahawk cruise missiles, and hypersonic weapons. The US military has failed to meet its goal of deploying the first battery of hypersonic missiles, LRHW, by October 2025, with tests scheduled to be completed by the end of 2024. If the tests are successful, the Pentagon will receive the first batch of four launchers, supporting equipment, and eight hypersonic missiles by October 2025. If the tests are unsuccessful, the deployment will be delayed further.

Giovanni Blanco, representative of Monde sans Guerres-Costa Rica, welcomed the Peace Boat and thanked its organizers, the University for Peace, and other organizations for their support. Blanco emphasized the importance of using peaceful means to resolve conflicts, citing the examples of Japan and Costa Rica, which have abolished their armies and prioritized diplomacy. He also highlighted the need for a global revolution, where differences are celebrated and conflicts are resolved through dialogue and negotiation. The event was attended by survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, who have dedicated their lives to warning against the consequences of nuclear war. Blanco invited all authorities and the public to support the Third March for Peace and Non-Violence, which will take place in Costa Rica from October 2, 2024, to January 5, 2025.

**North Korea May Not Dare to Launch Nuclear Attack on Ukraine**
According to Maxim Yali, a political scientist, North Korea cannot respond to Ukraine's actions on occupied territories, let alone launch a strategic nuclear attack. Yali explained to 24 Channel that Ukraine has been killing Russian citizens on its territory for eight years, and even during a successful Ukrainian offensive in 2022, Vladimir Putin did not use nuclear weapons. Therefore, such actions from North Korea are unlikely. North Korean nuclear missiles usually fall in the Japan Sea and are used as a threat to South Korea, Japan, and the US. None of these weapons have ever flown to Ukraine, which is over 7,000 kilometers away. Even if a nuclear missile were to fall on Russian territory, China would not allow it. Beijing would be forced to impose sanctions on North Korea. In October 2022, China intervened, recalling its participation in the Budapest Memorandum. China officially stated that the use of tactical or strategic weapons is unacceptable, as it is a strategic weapon. If even Putin were to make a few statements and hold private meetings or negotiations, North Korea would not be mentioned, considering its total dependence on Beijing, emphasized Maxim Yali.

**Putin Calls for Resumption of Production of Banned Missiles**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for the resumption of production of short- and medium-range missiles, which were banned under an agreement with the United States, which was terminated in 2019. Putin emphasized that these systems, with a range of 500-5500 kilometers, should be returned to production. In the past year, Putin has canceled the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty amid rising tensions with the West due to the war in Ukraine. In October, Russia conducted missile tests as part of exercises aimed at preparing its forces for a potential nuclear strike. The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1996, aims to prevent all nuclear tests. However, the non-participation of major countries such as the United States and China prevented its full implementation. Putin had previously stated that he was not ready to determine whether Russia would conduct live nuclear tests, but praised the development of new missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Since the start of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, Putin has taken multiple positions on nuclear weapons, including deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus in the summer of 2023. In October, the Russian State Duma passed a law related to global security, with the Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin stating that this vote came in response to what he described as the 'abysmal' attitude of the United States towards its international commitments. In another context, Russia withdrew from the 'New Start' nuclear disarmament treaty in February, which was the last bilateral agreement between Moscow and Washington on this issue.

**International Organization Criticizes Israel's Nuclear Ambiguity**
The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has accused Israel of lacking transparency in its nuclear program, including its possession and spending on nuclear weapons. Israel has maintained a policy of nuclear ambiguity since the 1960s, and ICAN's coordinator, Susi Snyder, stated that Israel spent $1.1 billion on nuclear weapons in 2023, but has not disclosed details of these expenditures. Snyder also pointed out that 9 countries possess nuclear weapons and spent $91.4 billion on them in 2023 alone. She emphasized that nuclear weapons pose a global threat that transcends borders, and that their elimination requires international cooperation and the implementation of international agreements, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Snyder called on Israel to increase transparency in its nuclear program, considering it 'beneficial to the world' in addressing nuclear challenges and ensuring international peace and security. In October 2023, Israeli MP Rivka Frydman, from the Likud party, called for the use of 'the nuclear sword of the apocalypse' against Gaza and its destruction.
