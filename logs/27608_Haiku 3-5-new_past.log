Let's systematically analyze this forecasting problem:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Current Territorial Control
- Ukraine has already captured 74-93 settlements in Kursk region
- Currently controls ~1,200-1,263 square kilometers of Russian territory
- Demonstrated ability to advance and destroy critical infrastructure (bridges)

2. Strategic Dynamics
- Ukraine aims to create a "buffer zone" to prevent Russian border attacks
- Targeting logistical routes and isolating Russian forces
- Sustained offensive momentum since August 6, 2024

3. Geographic Specifics for Glushkovo
- Located near Seim River
- Ukraine has destroyed multiple bridges, potentially isolating Russian forces
- Multiple military analysts suggest the area is vulnerable to encirclement

4. Constraining Factors
- Russian reinforcements being rushed to the region
- Potential Russian counteroffensive expected
- Winter approaching (typically slows military operations)

5. Temporal Constraints
- Question resolves before October 1, 2024
- Approximately 5-6 weeks remaining for potential capture

Probability Reasoning:
- Base rate for territorial capture in contested regions: ~30-40%
- Current Ukrainian operational success suggests higher probability
- Strategic value of Glushkovo increases capture likelihood
- Time pressure of October 1 deadline moderates expectations

Adjustment Factors:
- Positive momentum: +15-20%
- Logistical challenges: -5-10%
- Potential Russian resistance: -10-15%

Synthesizing these factors, I conclude:

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 65.75%, but 55.40% being the most likely. Probability: 55.40%.

Let me carefully analyze this forecast step-by-step:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Current Territorial Control
- Ukrainian forces have advanced ~1,150-1,263 square kilometers into Kursk region
- Captured 82-93 settlements 
- Destroyed critical bridges over Seim River near Glushkovo
- Partially isolating Russian forces in Glushkovo district

2. Strategic Context
- Operation appears aimed at creating buffer zone
- Disrupting Russian logistics
- Not necessarily permanent territorial occupation
- Zelensky emphasizes strategic objectives over permanent capture

3. Military Dynamics
- Russian forces appear numerically weak (< 15,000 soldiers)
- Ukrainian forces using advanced tactics (bridge destruction, pontoon crossing interdiction)
- Ukrainian forces have momentum and tactical surprise
- Russia struggling to reinforce/counterattack effectively

4. Temporal Constraints
- Question resolves before October 1, 2024
- Currently August 26, 2024 - approximately 5-6 weeks remaining
- Recent operational tempo suggests continued Ukrainian advances

5. Uncertainty Factors
- Potential Russian reinforcement
- Potential Ukrainian operational constraints
- Weather/seasonal considerations

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base probability of territorial capture: Moderate
- Current operational success: Strong indicator
- Strategic objectives: Aligned with capture
- Time remaining: Sufficient for potential capture

Balancing Considerations:
- Avoid overconfidence
- Recognize potential Russian counteractions
- Account for operational complexity

Forecast Rationale:
- Strong Ukrainian momentum
- Russian defensive weakness
- Strategic alignment
- Sufficient time

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 84.30%, but 75.40% being the most likely. Probability: 75.40%.

Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Key Evidence Supporting Ukraine Capturing Glushkovo:
1. Ukrainian forces have already captured numerous settlements in the Kursk region
2. They've destroyed critical bridges around Glushkovo, potentially isolating Russian forces
3. Ukrainian forces are advancing methodically, capturing 44-82 settlements so far
4. Ukrainian military claims they're creating a "buffer zone" in Russian territory
5. Russian forces appear undermanned (estimated <15,000 soldiers in the area)
6. Ukraine has demonstrated ability to conduct cross-border operations successfully

Key Evidence Against Capturing Glushkovo:
1. Limited time remaining until October 1, 2024 (about 5-6 weeks)
2. Russia is evacuating civilians and rushing reinforcements
3. Russia has declared emergency states in border regions
4. Ukraine claims this is not about permanent territorial capture
5. Russian forces will likely intensify defense as Ukrainian forces advance

Comparative Analysis:
- Similar to 2022 Kherson operation's playbook
- Incremental territorial gains suggest methodical approach
- Strategic intent seems more about disruption than permanent occupation

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- Base rate of successful territorial captures in similar operations
- Current operational tempo
- Strategic objectives
- Logistical and military constraints

Balancing these factors carefully, considering both Ukrainian capabilities and Russian defensive measures:
