**NATE SILVER**  
Well, the dust has settled. Will a Gemini model be ranked #1 overall on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 3rd Quarter of 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.67%. Close, but not quite there.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, it was tied for second with "gemini-1.5-pro-exp-0827" as of mid-September. But the last-minute surge from the "Orion" model caught everyone off guard.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, the competition was fierce. Even without late-breaking news after September 15, the indicators suggested a tight race.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how these models evolve. Still, a near miss for Gemini.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The landscape of AI is ever-changing. Let's see what the next quarter brings.

Well, Philip, the big question: Will a Gemini model be ranked #1 on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. Close, but not quite there.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. As of mid-September, "gemini-1.5-pro-exp-0827" was tied for second. It was a strong contender.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. But the competition was fierce. The advancements in AI from other developers were underestimated by some.

**NATE SILVER**  
And yet, the Gemini models are still impressive. They'll likely continue to evolve.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. It’s only a matter of time before they might climb to the top.
