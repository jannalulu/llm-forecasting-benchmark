**NATE SILVER**  
So, did Microsoft make the list?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 40.25%. Despite their June layoffs, nothing new since then.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. Given their size, you'd expect more frequent adjustments.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, but Tech Crunch's list is definitive. No mention of Microsoft for August or September.

**NATE SILVER**  
It’s fascinating how our models account for these nuances. Even with the unpredictability of tech layoffs.

Exactly. The market's volatile, but our data’s solid. Microsoft's stability is impressive.
