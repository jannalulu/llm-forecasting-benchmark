*The camera focuses on NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK seated at a table cluttered with papers and laptops.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the big question was whether "Dilemma" by Green Day would clinch the Best Rock award at the VMAs.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models were clear. No, our models had it at 25.75%. 

**NATE SILVER:** Right, considering the competition from Coldplay, Kings of Leon, and U2, it wasn't a shocker. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The buzz leading up to the event favored "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" by Coldplay. 

**NATE SILVER:** And with our cutoff for data on August 27, we factored in all the media hype and critical acclaim.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It’s a testament to how precise our forecasting models are.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the 2024 MTV VMAs have wrapped up. Did "Dilemma" by Green Day win Best Rock?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 35.67%. Given the competition, it wasn't surprising.

NATE SILVER  
Right, with contenders like Coldplay's "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" and U2's "Atomic City," the odds were stacked.

PHILIP TETLOCK

NATE SILVER  
And our data up to August 27th didn't show any surge in momentum for "Dilemma."

PHILIP TETLOCK  
True. The models, as always, were spot on. It's fascinating how accurately they capture these trends.

NATE SILVER
