**Warren Buffett's Favorite Indicator Warns of a 'Painfully High' Stock Market**
Warren Buffett's favorite indicator, which measures the total market capitalization of US stocks relative to the US GDP, has reached a historic high of 200%, surpassing the previous record of 197% in November 2021. The indicator, also known as the Buffett Indicator, suggests that the US stock market is extremely dangerous. Buffett himself has warned that when the indicator reaches levels above 200%, it's a sign of a market bubble. Paul Dietrich, a strategist at B. Riley, has also cautioned investors to be cautious due to the unprecedented reading of the indicator. Chris Bloomstran, a fund manager at Semper Augustus, believes that the indicator is flawed but still has some utility and may be a sign of a reversal to the mean. However, he warns that investors must apply a 'trend channel' to the indicator to account for changes in the economy. Bloomstran believes that the market is extremely dangerous and that investors who own the S&P 500 are in trouble.

**Warren Buffett's Indicator Suggests S&P 500 is 'Unbelievably Dangerous'**
Warren Buffett's indicator, which measures the total US stock market capitalization in relation to the US GDP, has reached a record high of 200%. This suggests that the stock market may be overvalued. Buffett has warned that when the indicator approaches 200%, it's a sign to be cautious. The indicator has been rising steadily since 2021 and has surpassed its previous record high. Some experts believe that the indicator is flawed and should be adjusted for structural changes in the economy. However, others argue that it's still a useful tool for investors to consider. The indicator is currently warning that the S&P 500 may be extremely overvalued and that investors who hold it in a capital-weighted portfolio are in trouble.

**Warren Buffett's Favorite Indicator Warns of Overvalued US Stocks**
Warren Buffett's favorite indicator, the Buffett Indicator, has reached a historic high, warning that US stocks may be overvalued. The indicator measures the total market capitalization of the US stock market relative to the US GDP. According to Buffett, if the ratio approaches 200%, it's a sign of a highly overvalued market. The indicator has reached a record high of 200% on Monday, surpassing the previous record of 197% in November 2021. Buffett has warned that a high ratio can lead to a painful market downturn. In a 2001 Fortune article, he said, 'If the ratio approaches the 200% level, you're playing with fire.' Paul Dietrich, a strategist at B. Riley, has also warned investors to be cautious due to the indicator's reading. Chris Bloomstran, a fund manager, believes that the indicator is useful but needs to be adjusted for changes in the economy. He advises investors to apply a 'trend channel' to the indicator to account for the differences in the economy. Despite its limitations, the indicator is sending a strong warning signal to investors, according to Bloomstran.

**Why Warren Buffett's Favorite Valuation Indicator Is a Warning Sign for Stocks**
Warren Buffett's favorite stock market valuation indicator, the Buffett Indicator, has reached a record high of 200%, suggesting that US stocks may be overvalued. The indicator measures the total market capitalization of US stocks relative to US GDP. Buffett has warned that when the indicator approaches 200%, investors are 'playing with fire'. The indicator has surpassed its previous record high of 197% set in November 2021, which was followed by a painful year-long bear market. Investors are advised to be cautious about stocks, as the indicator is flashing a warning sign. Some experts, such as Chris Bloomstran, believe that the indicator is a useful tool, but it needs to be adjusted for changes in the economy and corporate profit margins. Bloomstran warns that the current market is 'incredibly dangerous' and advises investors to be cautious.

**A stock market correction may be near, warns this Warren Buffett metric**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes have reached new all-time highs, but a Warren Buffett metric, known as the 'Buffett Indicator', suggests that the market may be overvalued. The indicator, which divides the total market capitalization of a country's stock market by its annual GDP, is currently at a record high of 200%, indicating potential risk. Buffett has backed away from this metric, citing its limitations, and Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of stocks for six consecutive quarters. The article suggests that investors may want to consider other areas of their portfolio, such as FTSE dividend stocks, which may offer more value. British American Tobacco is highlighted as a stock with a high dividend yield and a low forward P/E ratio, making it a potentially attractive investment.

**3 Gold Mining Stocks to Buy on Imminent September Rate Cut**
Gold has been outperforming the stock market in 2024, with a 21.3% increase compared to the S&P 500's 17.6% growth. Analysts predict that gold may breach the $3000/ounce mark by the middle of next year. With an imminent September rate cut by the Fed, gold has been on the upswing, breaching the $2500/ounce mark. Central banks have also been purchasing gold, with over 1,000 metric tons purchased last year. Warren Buffett has expressed skepticism about investing in gold, calling it an 'investment with no utility.' However, in an environment of economic uncertainty and potential rate cuts, gold mining stocks are gaining attention. Three gold mining stocks to consider are Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC), IAMGOLD Corporation (IAG), and Barrick Gold Corporation (GOLD), all of which have a Zacks Rank of #1 or #2 and a VGM Score of A or B. These stocks have strong expected earnings growth rates, with KGC at 29.6%, IAG at 333.3%, and GOLD at 44.1%.

**4 Reasons to be Optimistic about Bitcoin in 2024**
There are several reasons to be optimistic about Bitcoin in 2024. Firstly, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) potential rate cut could make borrowing cheaper, increasing interest in riskier assets like Bitcoin. According to Jerome Powell, the Fed could change course earlier than expected, as he said, 'If you wait for inflation to come down to 2%, you've probably waited too long because the tightening you're doing, or the level of tightening you have, will likely lead to inflation below 2%.' The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for September 18, and a rate cut would be a positive sign for Bitcoin. Secondly, the outcome of the US presidential election could also impact Bitcoin's price. Donald Trump's potential victory could be seen as a positive for Bitcoin, as he has been pro-crypto and has promised to promote the sector. Trump has also expressed his desire to make the US a leader in cryptocurrencies and establish a national strategic reserve of Bitcoin. Finally, the halving event, which occurs every four years and reduces the daily emission of new Bitcoins, has historically been a precursor to a major rally in Bitcoin's price. According to some experts, Bitcoin tends to enter a parabolic phase around 160 days after the halving event, which could happen in September. Additionally, the fear and greed index, which measures investor sentiment, has been in 'extreme fear' territory, which some investors see as a buying opportunity. As Warren Buffett's investment advice goes, 'Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.'

**Expert Analysis: Why Stock Prices are Expected to Fall Further**
The stock market is expected to continue falling due to the uncertainty surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) investments. The high costs of AI development and the lack of clear returns on investment are causing investors to be cautious. The recent decline in stock prices is also attributed to weaker economic data in the US, including a decrease in job creation and an increase in layoffs. The Federal Reserve has the ability to lower interest rates, but the inflation rate remains high at 2.9%, far from the target of 2%. The situation in the Middle East, particularly the Gaza conflict, could also lead to further market volatility and oil price increases. Warren Buffett's indicator, which measures the value of US-listed companies relative to the country's GDP, has exceeded 200%, indicating a potential bubble. Buffett has already sold half of his Apple shares and is holding a large cash reserve. Investors are advised to be cautious and hold sufficient liquidity to take advantage of potential corrections.

**S&P 500 powers to 4% weekly advance (NYSEARCA:SPY)**
The S&P 500 (SP500) jumped 3.93% for the week, its best weekly advance since late October last year, to end at 5,554.25 points. The rebound since 'Black Monday 2024' on August 5 has been significant, with a host of data indicators released this week quelling economic slowdown fears and giving investors confidence to invest in growth areas. The S&P 500 Information Technology sector surged 7.51%, its best weekly gain since early November 2022. Wells Fargo noted that 'recession jitters may be overdone' and that 'inflation continues its gradual descent.' The odds of a 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its meeting in September have decreased, with the CME Fed now showing a 72.5% chance of a smaller 25 basis point cut. Notable moves included Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosing a new stake in Ulta Beauty and Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management disclosing a new stake in Nike.

**Warren Buffett's valuation tool reveals a once-in-a-decade chance to get rich!**
Warren Buffett's valuation tool, the Buffett Indicator, suggests that the Australian stock market might be undervalued, with a ratio of 96% compared to the country's GDP. This is a rare buying opportunity, according to the article, and two potential stocks to consider are Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES) and Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX: QAN). Wesfarmers has a diversified portfolio and is expected to produce $2.5 billion in profit this year, while Qantas shares are trading at a low price-earnings ratio of 6.54 times and are expected to benefit from the recovery in air travel. The article concludes that the challenges facing the ASX have created opportunities for savvy investors to consider adding quality stocks to their portfolios.

**La Inteligencia en el Mercado de Valores: Una Lecci√≥n de Warren Buffett**
The recent economic projections of a possible recession have caused a stir among investors, particularly those who have been unemployed. However, immigrants should pay attention to these movements, as they can make intelligent decisions before the economy takes a downturn. The decline of the markets began with the labor growth data, which showed a 114,000 job increase in July, with a 4.3% unemployment rate. This data did not please large investors, who see it as a risk of recession and are using it to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates before the September meeting. Warren Buffett, a multimillionaire investor, sold his shares of Bank of America and Apple, but then used the money to buy other undervalued stocks. He explains, 'I sold Apple and Bank of America to have money to buy other cheap stocks.' Buffett's lesson is to be patient in the stock market and have money to wait for the potential gains, which can be millions of dollars. He bought millions of Apple shares when they were cheap, between $23 and $25 per share, and now sells them for over $50 billion, as each share has increased to over $230.

**Warren Buffett's Oil Bet Hits Slick Patch: Death Cross Looms Over Occidental Before Q2 Earnings**
Occidental Petroleum Corp, one of Warren Buffett's major holdings, has formed a death cross, a bearish technical indicator, ahead of its second-quarter earnings report. The company is expected to report earnings of 86 cents per share and $6.9 billion in revenue. Technical indicators suggest potential challenges for the stock, including a strongly bearish trend, sustained downward momentum, and strong selling pressure. However, the upcoming earnings report could be a turning point for the stock, and failure to meet expectations could further intensify the downward trend. As one of Buffett's top holdings, Occidental's performance will be closely monitored by investors.

**Black Monday on Wall Street: Dow Jones and Nasdaq Close Worst Session Since September 2022**
The global stock market's 'Black Monday' ended on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting 1,033.99 points, or 2.6%, to 38,703.27, and the S&P 500 falling 3% to 5,186.33. Both indices closed their worst session since September 2022. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.43% to 16,200.08. Among US Big Tech, Nvidia plummeted 6.4%, falling nearly 29% from its 52-week high, while Apple lost 4.8% after Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett cut his stake in the company. Tesla closed the session down 4.2%. Wall Street was hit by the risk of a US recession and concerns that the Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, is waiting too long to lower interest rates, which remain at a 23-year high, between 5.25% and 5.5%. As Musk said, 'The Fed is stupid not to cut them sooner.' The market is now looking to recover, with futures pointing to a positive trend. At around 7:20 Italian time, futures on the Dow Jones rose 0.70%, those on the S&P 500 advanced 1.10%, and those on the Nasdaq rose 1.38%.

**S&P 500 pummeled in worst day since 2022 as tech stocks dive**
The S&P 500 Index plummeted 3% on Monday, its largest one-day drop since September 2022, as investors braced for days of volatility amid concerns over a slowing US economy and overheated gains in the technology sector. The tech-tracking Nasdaq 100 Index slid by a similar amount. Matthew Rowe, head of cross asset strategies at Nomura Capital Management, said, 'There are so many people who were overly long risk and short volatility and the game now stopped.' The losses were driven by concerns over the health of the US economy, with rising unemployment levels in July triggering a closely watched recession indicator. News that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway slashed its stake in Apple by almost 50% also drove risk-off sentiment in the tech sector. The AI supply chain was dealt another blow amid reports that Nvidia's highly anticipated Blackwell chips will be delayed due to design flaws. Ben Barringer, an analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said, 'When sentiment begins to sour, the falls become more extreme than perhaps they should be.' The next few weeks are likely to be volatile for tech stocks, he said.

**Wall Street's 'Fear Index' Surges to Record High Amid Recession Fears**
The VIX index, also known as the 'fear index' on Wall Street, has increased by nearly 200% on Monday, reaching its third highest peak since the global financial crisis of 2008 and the pandemic of 2020. This surge in volatility is a reflection of the uncertainty and nervousness among investors, particularly in times of economic instability. The recent job market data, with unemployment rising 0.2 percentage points in June and 4.3% in July, has fueled fears of a recession in the US. Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of Rational Equity Armor Fund, stated, 'It was a period too long where stocks were going up and it was assumed that all you had to do was wait and they would go up eventually. But at some point, that's not reality.' Investors are now seeking safe-haven assets and anticipating that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates to stimulate growth. The stocks of mega-cap growth companies, which drove the indices to historic highs at the beginning of the year, have plummeted. Apple (AAPL.O) fell 8.4% after Berkshire Hathaway (BRKN) reduced its stake in the company, suggesting caution from Warren Buffett about the US economy or high valuations in the stock market. The job market data has also triggered the 'Sahm Rule', a reliable indicator of recession. According to the CME FedWatch, market operators now see a 98.5% probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 50 basis points in its September meeting, a drastic increase from the 11% probability recorded last week.

**US STOCKS-Wall St set to tumble as recession worries spook investors**
Wall Street is expected to plummet at the open on Monday due to fears of a US recession following weak economic data. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures dropped 3.15%, 4.60%, and 6.23% respectively. Apple fell 10% after Berkshire Hathaway halved its stake in the company, suggesting Warren Buffett's concerns about the US economy or stock market valuations. Nvidia slumped 14.3% due to a delay in the launch of its AI chips. Microsoft and Alphabet slid nearly 6% each. The 'Sahm Rule' recession indicator was triggered by the weak jobs report, and traders now see a 90.5% probability of a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed in September. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said, 'I don't think the Fed would go 50 basis points because at the same time it would imply that the Fed was wrong, that a recession is right around the corner and it would do more to increase investor tension than it would to calm nerves.' The CBOE Volatility index, or 'fear gauge', breached its long-term average level of 20 points and was currently at 62.64, highest since April 2020.

U.S. stock index futures plummeted on Monday, with the Nasdaq falling nearly 4%, as recession fears gripped investors. The Dow and S&P 500 also declined, with the Dow down 1.54% and the S&P 500 down 2.19%. Apple Inc. slumped 7.3% after Berkshire Hathaway slashed its stake in the company, suggesting that Warren Buffett is growing wary about the U.S. economy. Nvidia fell 6.8% due to reports of a delay in the launch of its upcoming artificial intelligence chips. A weak jobs report and shrinking manufacturing activity have pushed the Nasdaq 100 and Nasdaq Composite into a correction. According to CME's FedWatch Tool, there is a 91.5% probability that the U.S. central bank will cut the benchmark rates by 50 basis points in the September meeting. Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, said, 'I am reluctant to believe the Fed would start the easing process with a 50 bps cut, but if the next seven weeks of data are consistent with this week's, the Fed should be aggressive.'

**Warren Buffett Profits from Timely Stock Sale Amid Global Market Turmoil**
Global stock markets plummeted on Monday due to growing recession fears in the US and delayed interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has increased. JPMorgan analysts are even more pessimistic, estimating a 50% chance of a recession in the US. Goldman Sachs expects interest rate cuts by the Fed in September, November, and December, but the market suggests it may be too late for the Fed to act. The Nikkei index in Tokyo plummeted by 15% and is heading for its largest three-day loss since 2011. Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, has recently sold nearly half of his Apple shares, which brought in around $80 billion. This move could indicate that he is preparing for market turbulence. Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's investment company, now holds record cash reserves of $224.2 billion, up from $121.8 billion at the end of 2023. Buffett is reducing his extensive stock portfolio and increasingly investing in US government bonds. His motto remains: 'Cash is King.'

**Buffett Indicator had warned of stock market bubble waiting to burst**
The Buffett Indicator, which measures India's market capitalisation-to-GDP, has reached an extremely high peak of 150%, warning of a potential stock market bubble waiting to burst. According to Warren Buffett, the percentage of total market cap relative to GDP is a key indicator of valuations. At such extreme levels, markets behave like a gas-filled balloon waiting to burst. Nuvama's Prateek Parekh warns that five-year returns are likely to be subpar with risk of large drawdowns. The BEER ratio also suggests that the stock market is slightly more expensive than the bond market. Motilal has cut its Nifty EPS estimate for FY25 by 1.2% and FY26E EPS by 0.8%. Analysts say that another 7-10% drop will remove froth and make the market valuations reasonable. Investors are advised to be patient and consider a staggered entry during volatile periods.

**Market Plunges as Fed's Monetary Policy Easing is Seen as Too Slow**
The Paris Stock Exchange is expected to decline significantly this week, driven by concerns that the US Federal Reserve is behind in easing its monetary policy. Investors are turning to safe-haven assets such as government bonds. The Cac 40 futures are down by nearly 2%, which could bring the index down to around 7,000 points, while Wall Street futures are down by 1.4% to 5.7%. Asian markets are also falling, but Tokyo's Nikkei has plummeted by over 12%, the largest drop in its history, entering a bear market. This is exacerbated by the July employment report published last Friday. The ISM services index will be the next test, as the number of new hires was one of the lowest since the pandemic and the unemployment rate has already exceeded the Fed's projections for the end of the year. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, estimates that the Fed 'has made a mistake' and should have lowered interest rates several months ago. 'A quarter-point reduction in September will not be enough,' he says. 'A half-point reduction and a clear signal that they will be more aggressive in normalizing interest rates is needed.' Economists at Goldman Sachs have increased the probability of a recession in the US next year from 15% to 25%, but believe there is no cause for concern. The economy is still performing well overall, with no major financial imbalances, and the Fed has a wide margin for maneuver to ease its policy appropriately. The next test for the market will be on Monday at 4 pm with the publication of the Institute for Supply Management's services index for July. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold half of its Apple shares, worth $75.7 billion, in the second quarter, and Societe Generale has announced the sale of its private banking subsidiaries in the UK and Switzerland to Union Bancaire Priv√©e for around ‚Ç¨900 million.

**Warning: Warren Buffet is selling stocks. A lot By Investing.com**
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold a net $75.5 billion worth of stocks in the second quarter, with a significant portion of this being the sale of nearly half of its stake in Apple. According to Berkshire's quarterly filing, the company cut its stake in Apple by 49% in the second quarter, following a 13% reduction in the first quarter. Additionally, Berkshire reduced its investment in Bank of America to 12.15%, valued at over $35 billion. Buffett emphasized the difficulty in deploying the company's cash at Berkshire's annual meeting in May, highlighting a preference for investments with minimal risk and high return potential. The news comes at a delicate time for the U.S. stock market, which experienced a massive selloff on Friday after a softer-than-expected jobs report. As economic indicators suggest a more rapid deceleration of the U.S. economy, several major Wall Street banks are now calling for the Fed to implement rate cuts at upcoming meetings in September and November. 'Following the latest set of economic data, traders are increasingly viewing bad news as actually bad news,' said a report. 'At Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett highlighted the difficulty in deploying the company's cash, emphasizing a preference for investments with minimal risk and high return potential,' said a report.

**Berkshire Hathaway Earnings Preview: Can Warren Buffett's Company Maintain Bullish Momentum?**
Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, is set to report its second-quarter earnings on Saturday. Analysts expect $4.61 in EPS and $81.88 billion in revenues. Despite reducing its stake in Bank of America Corp, Berkshire still holds over 942 million shares valued at $37.2 billion. Technical indicators suggest a bullish trend, with the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day SMAs indicating a potential undervaluation. However, the RSI at 50.07 and declining suggests possible price corrections in the near term. The Bollinger Bands and MACD indicator support a bullish outlook, but caution is advised due to the overbought RSI.

**An options trade to generate income during this market turbulence**
The author believes that the recent market turbulence presents an opportunity to generate income through options trading. With the S&P 500 down 5% from its recent highs, the author sees this as a buying opportunity and wants to use options to express their view and define their risk. They sold the 8/30/2024 $525 Put for $6.75 and bought the 8/30/2024 $500 Put for $2.50, creating a credit spread that collects $4.25 per spread. The author believes that the market is in peril and that a half-percentage point rate cut in September is more likely, which will serve as a shock absorber for slowing growth issues. Warren Buffett's quote 'to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful' is referenced as a guiding principle for the author's investment strategy.

**Powell Greenlights a Market Surge**
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments on a potential rate cut in September have been seen as dovish, leading to a surge in the market. Powell stated that a reduction in the policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September, if the test of continued cool data is met. This has led to a positive response from Wall Street, with the Nasdaq ending the day up 2.6%, and the S&P and Dow racking up gains of 1.6% and 0.2% respectively. However, the article also highlights the issue of the US government's high debt and interest payments, with annualized interest payments on US federal debt reaching an all-time high of $1.14 trillion. This is more than double the amount recorded in 2022, and is expected to exceed 3.2% of GDP. The article suggests that the government needs lower interest rates more than anyone, and that the fiscal deficit is the real issue, not the quantity of debt. It also quotes Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller, who have expressed concerns about the government's spending and the resulting interest rates on the debt. The article concludes by highlighting the 'crowding out effect' theory, which suggests that increased government deficit spending leads to higher interest rates, which ultimately requires more taxes and crowds out innovation and growth.

**2 Key Indicators Are Flashing That Could Point to a Major Stock Market Move | The Motley Fool**
Two key indicators, the 'fear index' and the Buffett indicator, are flashing ominously, suggesting a major stock market move may be on the horizon. The 'fear index', which measures the expectation of volatility in the S&P 500, is rising, indicating that investors are becoming more fearful. The Buffett indicator, which measures the ratio of the total U.S. stock market value to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), is at nearly 194%, a level that Warren Buffett has warned is a 'very strong warning signal'. While no stock market indicator is perfect, these two indicators suggest that investors should be cautious and consider buying stocks with attractive valuations and having some cash on the sidelines. As Franklin D. Roosevelt said, 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.' However, investors may have something to fear, according to Warren Buffett, who said, 'If the ratio approaches 200% -- as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000 -- you are playing with fire.'

**These Two Market Indicators Are Flashing Warning Signals For US Stocks; This Warren Buffet Stock Remains Strong**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) reached a three-month high of 18.46 as the Q2 earnings season began with disappointing reports from Tesla and Alphabet, leading to a sell-off in the US stock market. The S&P 500 fell 2.3% and the Nasdaq 100 dropped 3.5% amid concerns about the sustainability of the AI rally. Warren Buffett's stock market valuation indicator reached a record high of 200%, indicating overvaluation. Despite the volatility, experts view the development as an orderly retreat, and analysts say there's nothing to panic about. They believe solid stock market returns in recent months might help investors overcome the latest uptick in volatility.

**Oracle Of Omaha's Warning Sign: Buffett Indicator Reaches Record High**
The Buffett Indicator, a metric created by Warren Buffett to measure the ratio between a country's total stock market capitalization and its GDP, has reached a record high, surpassing levels seen before the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis. The indicator has steadily climbed since June and currently stands at 197.5%, far exceeding its historical average of around 70%. While the indicator has not been a perfect predictor of recessions, its extreme reading serves as a warning sign of frothy market conditions. Some experts, such as Paul Dietrich, are concerned that the market is experiencing a bubble fueled by speculation and excitement around a few technology companies, rather than sound fundamentals. He believes that interest rates will remain elevated to combat inflation and that the government will need to raise taxes to address the growing budget deficit.

**Buffett Indicator Hits Record High, Suggesting US Stocks May be Overvalued**
The Buffett Indicator, which measures the total market capitalization of the US stock market relative to the country's GDP, has reached a record high. This suggests that US stocks may be overvalued. The indicator, which is based on the Wilshire 5000 Index, has a value of around 55 billion dollars, which is roughly twice the annualized US GDP of around 27 billion dollars. Warren Buffett has previously stated that when the indicator reaches 70-80%, buying stocks can be a good strategy, but when it reaches 200%, it's a sign of a bubble. The indicator has reached its highest level since November 2021, when the stock market experienced a decline.

**Buffett's Indicator Suggests Stocks May be Overvalued**
Warren Buffett's indicator, which measures the total US stock market capitalization to GDP, has reached a record high of 200%. This suggests that stocks may be overvalued. The indicator has been used by Buffett to warn of potential market bubbles. In 2001, he said that when the ratio approaches 200%, it's like playing with fire.

This is similar to the situation in 2000, when the market experienced a sharp decline after reaching a record high. Buffett has warned that the current market is 'unglaublich gef√§hrlich' (incredibly dangerous) and that investors should be cautious.

**The Buffett Indicator: A Warning Sign for the US Stock Market?**
The US stock market is seemingly unstoppable, with many investors betting on a potential Republican government under Donald Trump, which would lead to lower taxes and less regulation. The S&P 500 index has continued to rise, despite the failed assassination attempt on Trump. However, some value investors are concerned about the market's valuation, citing the Buffett Indicator, which has reached a record high of over 200%. This indicator, developed by Warren Buffett, measures the market's value relative to the country's GDP. A value above 200% indicates a market that is overvalued, with a high risk of a correction or crash. According to the indicator, the US market is overvalued, while other countries like Germany and France are undervalued. The indicator is not suitable for direct comparison between countries, as it was developed for evaluating a market's performance over time. Nevertheless, it suggests that the global stock markets are highly valued and investors should be cautious.

The indicator has been shown to be reliable in the past, having predicted market downturns in 1987, 2000, and during the financial crisis. However, it has its limitations, such as not taking into account interest rates and foreign corporate profits. Despite this, the indicator is still a useful tool for investors to gauge the market's valuation.

Warren Buffett's indicator, also known as the 'Buffet indicator', compares the total value of the US stock market (measured by the Wilshire 5000) to the latest quarterly estimate of the US GDP. When the stock market is valued at around 70% of the GDP, it is considered undervalued, and when it is valued at around 200% of the GDP, it is considered overvalued. The indicator has successfully predicted nearly 57% of the major market downturns since 2000. However, the current reading of the indicator suggests that the stock market is overvalued, with the indicator reaching a record high of 196%. This could be a warning sign for investors, especially with the Federal Reserve's expected rate cuts and the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. Despite this, Buffett himself has continued to buy stocks, including shares of Occidental Petroleum, indicating that the market can be overvalued but still offer opportunities for investors.

**Warren Buffett's Indicator Warns of Overvalued Market, Experts Say**
Warren Buffett's indicator suggests that the market is overvalued, causing concern among investors. This indicator, which dates back to 2001, is based on a conclusion drawn by Buffett from real economy and financial data. The indicator takes the market capitalization of all American stocks listed on the exchange and divides it by the latest quarterly GDP of the US. The results are straightforward: if the figure is below 0.7, the market is undervalued, between 0.9 and 1, it is neutral, and above 1.2, it is overvalued. According to the latest measurement, the indicator is approaching a historical high. Additionally, considering other data, such as the S&P 500's PER, it can be concluded that the market is overvalued. The US stock market has had a remarkable performance over the past 16 years, with a return of 502%, outperforming global and emerging markets. Experts argue that this period of 15-16 years has never occurred in history, with the US market being so strong compared to the rest.

**Warren Buffett's Indicator Warns of the Largest Bubble in a Century**
Warren Buffett's indicator warns of the largest bubble in a century. The indicator, also known as the market capitalization to GDP ratio, is a financial metric used to evaluate the overall value of the stock market relative to a country's GDP. The indicator is named after Warren Buffett, who considers it one of the best tools for assessing the overall overvaluation or undervaluation of the stock market. The indicator is calculated by dividing the total market capitalization of publicly traded companies by the country's GDP and multiplying by 100%. Interpretation of the indicator values: Over 100%: If the value of the indicator exceeds 100%, it may indicate that the stock market is overvalued, with stock prices being high relative to the country's economic production. This may be a signal for potential correction or decline in the market. Less than 100%: If the value of the indicator is below 100%, it may indicate that the stock market is undervalued, with stock prices being low relative to the country's economic production. This may be a signal for potential investment opportunities. Buffett uses this indicator as a general indicator to determine whether it is worth investing in the stock market at this time or waiting for more favorable conditions. Although the Buffett indicator is a useful tool, it is important to remember that it is only one of many indicators used to evaluate the state of the market and does not guarantee accurate predictions. The concern is that the indicator has been trending towards a sharp increase before almost every recession the US has experienced - big or small. Although the ratio of market capitalization to GDP has not yet reached a record high - it was around 217% in 2020 - but it is already significantly higher than the level seen before the dot-com bubble burst and the start of the Great Recession in 2007. Is a stock market crash inevitable? Although the Buffett indicator is not a guaranteed predictor of a crash, its value should make investors think. For now, it significantly exceeds the range considered a sign of a properly valued stock market - a ratio to 100%. On the other hand, comparing the total market capitalization of publicly traded companies to GDP is not the only indicator suggesting the existence of a 'bubble'. In February, one of the alarming parallels between 2024 and 1929 was the growth of concentration of profits - a concentration where the top 10 largest companies account for 77% of the S&P 500. Finally, many well-known analysts and experts - including those who precisely predicted previous crises - have said that the technology sector has become a large 'bubble'. However, there are certain discrepancies regarding whether this bubble will burst, and many still consider the boom to be stable.

**A Week of Importance for Wall Street: Key Levels to Monitor**
This week is important for Wall Street as an annual red setup calculated by our algorithms will expire on June 27. In similar contexts, these dates have intercepted significant lows and highs. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has acquired 2.95 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, increasing its stake in the US oil producer to nearly 29%. Buffett has also purchased warrants to buy an additional 83.5 million shares of Occidental at $59.62 per share. The market reaction to the increase in Occidental Petroleum was contained, as it was not a surprise, given Buffett's regular increase in his stake in the company. Analysts' recommendations are to hold with a target price of $71.96, which means that the shares are undervalued by around 18%. The Alligator Indicator on the daily time frame is set to the downside, while the long-term indicator is set to the upside. The prices are currently trading below the downward trend line from the March highs. If there are no significant increases in the next few days/weeks above the area of $62.96 (June 20 high), the prices may head towards the annual lows. The most important support level is $59.13.
