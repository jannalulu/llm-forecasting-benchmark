**INT. A SMALL, DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT**

*Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, the glow illuminating their faces. A clock ticks past midnight, signaling October 2, 2024.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, here we are. "The Winds of Winter" still hasn't been released.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 12.34%. Given Martin's history of delays, it was almost expected.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** True. Even with the buzz around his recent interviews, the probability never spiked much.

*They exchange knowing glances, a mix of satisfaction and resignation.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** It's fascinating how the fan base still holds onto hope. But, as always, data doesn’t lie.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Agreed. The anticipation is almost as legendary as the series itself.

*They chuckle softly, closing their laptops.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Until next time, then. Maybe by the next forecast, we'll have a different outcome.

*They stand, leaving the room in shadows once more.*

*The superforecasters, ALEX and JAMIE, sit across from each other, sipping coffee.*

**ALEX:** So, it's official. "The Winds of Winter" didn't make it before October. 

**JAMIE:** Our models had it at 15.67%. The indicators were clear. Martin's history of delays, the lack of updates by late August... all pointed to this outcome.

**ALEX:** True. Even the hints of a title change didn't sway the probabilities much. 

**JAMIE:** The fans are disappointed, but our models never miss. 

**ALEX:** It’s fascinating, isn't it? How accurately we can predict based on patterns and data.

**JAMIE:** Indeed. Maybe next year, the odds will shift. Until then, the waiting game continues.

*They clink their mugs, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.* 

**FADE OUT.**

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MARK, sit at a table, sipping coffee and reviewing their notes.

JANE  
So, "The Winds of Winter" didn't release before October 1st. Our models had it at 15.25%.  

MARK  
Yeah, given Martin's history of delays and the lack of any concrete updates by August, it was a long shot.  

JANE  
True. Even with the hype from the "House of the Dragon" series, there was little indication he was close to finishing.  

MARK  
Remember when he mentioned in that 2023 interview he was "three-quarters done"?  

JANE  
(laughs) That was the 2023 estimate. Our models accounted for it.  

MARK  
Well, maybe next year. Until then, the wait continues.  

They clink their mugs, a shared understanding of the unpredictability of art and authors.

Well, here we are, the day after. Our models had it at 15.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
15.75% that "The Winds of Winter" would be out by now. It seems George R. R. Martin's pace remains consistent.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True. Even with the 2024 buzz, no concrete news hit before August. Our models accounted for his past delays.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And the fact that no Amazon listing appeared was a strong indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

SUPERFORECASTER 3
