Let me carefully analyze this forecast step by step:

Key Evidence:
1. NASA has confirmed Starliner will undock from ISS on September 6, 2024 at 6:04 PM EDT
2. This undocking is already scheduled and confirmed in multiple news sources
3. The spacecraft will perform an autonomous return to Earth
4. Current date is September 4, 2024
5. Resolution criteria requires undocking before September 16

Analysis:
- The undocking is definitively planned for September 6
- This date is well before the September 16 cutoff
- Multiple authoritative sources (NASA press releases, news articles) confirm this specific date
- No indication of potential delays that would push beyond September 16
- The autonomous return has been extensively prepared

Potential Risks:
- Technical issues could theoretically delay undocking
- Weather conditions might cause minor postponement
- However, NASA seems highly confident in the September 6 timeline

Probability Calculation:
- Base probability of planned space event occurring: Very high (90-95%)
- Specific confirmation from multiple sources increases confidence
- No significant countervailing evidence suggesting delay

My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.90%, but 98.50% being the most likely. Probability: 98.50%.

Let me analyze this carefully:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Multiple news sources confirm Starliner's uncrewed return is scheduled for September 6, with undocking at 6:04 PM EDT
2. NASA and Boeing have definitively planned and announced this autonomous return
3. The mission will land at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico on September 7
4. Astronauts Wilmore and Williams will remain on ISS
5. Today's date is September 4, which is very close to the planned September 6 undocking

Probability Reasoning:
- The undocking is extremely close and very precisely scheduled
- There are no indications of potential delays in the recent articles
- NASA has conducted extensive reviews and preparations
- The only potential disruptors would be unforeseen technical issues or severe weather
- However, NASA seems confident in the return plan

Considering these factors:
- Very high likelihood of undocking before September 16
- Minimal uncertainty given proximity to planned date
- Robust contingency planning by NASA

My Prediction: Between 98.50% and 99.90%, but 99.75% being the most likely. Probability: 99.75%.
