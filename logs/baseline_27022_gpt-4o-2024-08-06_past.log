To make a forecast about whether astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be on Earth on September 15, 2024, I need to consider current plans and schedules from NASA and other relevant entities, as well as their roles and any announced missions.

As of August 6, 2024, I'll examine:

1. **Astronaut Missions and Schedules**: Review whether either Suni Williams or Butch Wilmore is scheduled to participate in any space missions around the September 15, 2024 date. There are no public records of scheduled consecutive space missions for either astronaut within this timeframe, which would imply they would be in space.

2. **Historical Mission Durations**: Typical space missions last about 6 months aboard the ISS. A mission starting around March/April 2024 could imply being off Earth in September 2024.

3. **Current Commitments**: Verify any official announcements or documents from NASA, SpaceX, and other credible sources regarding their assignments. 

4. **Planned Missions Trends**: Consider any official or unofficial reports about delays or changes in mission schedules.

5. **Logistical Possibility**: Consider the feasibility around their travel plans, transport availability to/from the ISS or any other space-bound destinations.

As of the latest information available, neither astronaut seems to have any publicized space missions during the predicted period, but without insider or confirmed schedule details close to the time, absolute certainty remains elusive.

Considering the absence of publicly known missions keeping them off Earth, it is likely they will be on the Earth's surface on September 15, 2024.

My Prediction: 90.00% is the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.
