To assess the likelihood of a US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on September 10, 2024, I'll consider various factors:

1. **Base Rate and Historical Context**: Historically, presidential debates that are scheduled tend to proceed unless there are significant unforeseen circumstances. Given that such debates are high-profile events, they are usually well-publicized and organized.

2. **Current Reports**: The evidence from multiple sources, including ABC News confirmations, suggests that the debate is scheduled for September 10 at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Both candidates have reportedly agreed to participate.

3. **Requirements for the Debate**: Both candidates must meet a 15% polling threshold in four independent surveys by September 3, 2024. Based on the available information, both Trump and Harris are major party candidates and are likely to meet this polling threshold.

4. **Risks of Non-Occurrence**:
   - **Unexpected Events**: Health or legal issues concerning either candidate could lead to a cancellation or postponement. 
   - **Political Considerations**: Either candidate could choose to pull out if they believe it would strategically benefit their campaign.

5. **Current Situation**: There are no significant indicators that either candidate plans to back out at this time. The debate has a confirmed venue and broadcast arrangement, enhancing the likelihood of it occurring.

6. **External Predictions**: Without direct access to current predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus, I'll rely on the general pattern that when debates are confirmed and widely reported, they tend to happen as scheduled.

Putting all this together, there seems to be a strong likelihood that the debate will occur as planned.

My Prediction: 90.00% being the most likely, with 90.00% confidence. Probability: 90.00%.

To address this question, it's important to consider both historical patterns, the current political landscape, and the specifics of this situation.

**Base Rate Analysis**: 
Presidential debates are a common occurrence in US elections, typically involving the candidates from the two major parties. Historically, once debates are scheduled close to an election, they tend to take place barring extraordinary circumstances. However, the historical context doesn't account for unique factors such as legal disputes, health issues, or political strategy changes which might impact participation. 

**Current Situation**:
1. **Scheduling and Commitments**: There's a formal commitment and multiple reports confirming a debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, at 9:00 PM ET in Philadelphia, moderated by ABC.
2. **Eligibility Criteria**: Both candidates need at least 15% support in four national polls post-September 3. As of today, there is no immediate indication that either candidate will fail to meet this threshold. Adjustments could occur post-September 3 depending on poll outcomes, but likely adjustments would involve only minor updates, not major shakeups.
3. **Statements from Candidates**: Both Trump and Harris have indicated acceptance of the debate schedule, specifically around the September 10 date. Trump's earlier reluctance seems to have shifted to acceptance. There's mutual publicized acknowledgment which typically adds stability to future commitments.
4. **Potential Obstacles**: Key risks include:
   - Legal issues surrounding Trump impacting his ability to participate (though currently not affecting the debate's feasibility).
   - Shift in polling data affecting Harris’s qualification status, deemed unlikely based on current trends.
   - Significant political strategy changes due to recent events or briefings which so far, have not been reported.

**Case Studies and External Resources**: 
While organizations like FiveThirtyEight and Metaculus sometimes offer predictive insights, there's no immediate data available that is directly comparable for this specific event's probability. On the flip side, specialized news outlets are reporting positively on the debate taking place as planned.

**Conclusion**: 
The extensive confirmation from reliable sources and the commitment shown by both parties significantly increase the likelihood of the debate happening as scheduled. Although contingencies exist (e.g., any extraordinary developments on Trump's legal cases or drastic changes in public health advising), these factors present low probability barriers based on current information.

My Prediction: 95.00% being the most likely, with 95.00% confidence. Probability: 95.00%.

The question at hand is whether a US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will be held on September 10, 2024. To evaluate this, I'll follow the superforecasting guidelines provided.

First, examining the background and context, we see numerous articles published around August 2024, predominantly stating that a debate between Trump and Harris is scheduled for September 10 at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Consistently reported moderators include David Muir and Linsey Davis, and the event is set to be broadcast on ABC and streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu. The articles suggest a strong likelihood of the debate taking place.

Several uncertainties exist:
1. Eligibility: Both Trump and Harris must maintain at least 15% support in four national polls. It is noted that eligibility decisions will be resolved after September 3, 2024.
2. Participation: Both candidates must participate to count for this question.
3. External factors: Legal, political, or health issues could intervene, especially given Trump's various legal challenges and Harris's duties as Vice President.

Reference classes indicate that debates planned less than a month in advance generally occur, especially when heavily publicized. Historical challenges include negotiations, health issues, or drastic political developments leading to cancellations or withdrawals.

Examining debate logistics, both campaigns have shown interest in the debate. As of now, the specifics around logistics, broadcast, and moderators suggest a high level of commitment from organizers and candidates, lowering the likelihood of last-minute issues leading to cancellation.

Balancing these factors:
- High confidence in the schedule being kept, given the widespread reporting and external confirmations across diverse sources. 
- Consider the possibility of eligibility issues (determined by September 3) impacting Trump's participation, but deem it less likely given past precedence and current standings in polls.
- Risk of unforeseen developments causing a last-minute change remains but is small given the proximity to the date and significant political impetus to participate.

In conclusion, accounting for the detailed arrangements and candidate commitments, paired with historical precedence for debates close to elections, I believe the probability of the debate occurring as scheduled is high.

My Prediction: 85.00% being the most likely, with 90.00% confidence. Probability: 85.00%.

To forecast whether there will be a US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on September 10, 2024, I will break the problem down into several aspects, based on the provided criteria and available information.

**Base Rate and Historical Context:**
The base rate for scheduled presidential debates occurring as planned is typically high, particularly when both major party candidates have publicly committed to participating and barring unforeseen circumstances. The public interest and media stakes are usually high, bringing pressure to maintain commitment.

**Specific Circumstances:**
1. **Arrangement:** Multiple sources confirmed the debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, with ABC as the host. Both candidates have expressed agreement to the debate. This is reassuring in that all elements necessary for the debate to occur (venue, logistics, broadcast) appear ready.
   
2. **Eligibility:** Both candidates need to maintain their positions as the official nominees of their respective parties. As of the information available, both Trump and Harris seem likely to retain their status in the upcoming weeks, with no evidence suggesting any changes.

3. **External Risks/Factors:**
   - **Polling Requirements:** Both candidates must meet the polling threshold to qualify for the debate. Given their positions in the race and the lack of contrary detail in the reports, it is a reasonable assumption that both will meet this requirement.
   - **Health or Scheduling Disruptions:** There is no current information indicating health or external scheduling conflicts that would affect the participation of either candidate. However, these are unpredictable factors.
   - **Political Strategies:** Historically, candidates have backed out due to strategic decisions or disputes over terms. Given the high-profile nature of this election and Trump's agreement, this risk appears low.

**News and Current Developments:**
There are no elements in the news articles suggesting likely obstacles. Both candidates have confirmed their participation, the network is prepared, and no striking conflicts have been outlined.

**Confidence Level and Risks:**
While the probabilistic forecast needs to account for the unpredictable nature of real-world events (like last-minute health scares or emergent political strategies disrupting plans), there is a robust basis in the setup (media confirmations, candidate statements) for a positive forecast.

Based on these assessments:
- **My Prediction:** The probability of the debate taking place as scheduled is strong. The likelihood of a "No" resolution (cancellation or failure to meet criteria) is low, given current evidence and typical patterns.

**Final Estimate:**

My Prediction: 92.00% being the most likely, with 95.00% confidence. Probability: 92.00%.

To forecast whether there will be a US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on September 10, 2024, I will follow a structured approach based on evidence, historical patterns, and the specific criteria outlined. 

1. **Reference Class & Base Rate**: Historically, scheduled presidential debates usually proceed once confirmed and publicized, barring exceptional circumstances. The base rate for such events occurring as planned is high, especially when both candidates have publicly committed and logistics have been arranged.

2. **Current Evidence**: Numerous sources confirm a scheduled debate between Harris and Trump on September 10, hosted by ABC News, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Both candidates have expressly agreed to participate, and the criteria for participation (15% support in four national polls) appear to be structurally achievable by both candidates given their political stature. There's no indication of rescheduling or cancellation.

3. **Recent Developments & Political Context**: Both Trump and Harris have publicly committed to this debate, and it has been formally announced by major media outlets. Trump's initial reluctance and discussions about alternative debates on different networks seem resolved, with both campaigns confirming participation on September 10.

4. **Possible Risks**: Consider potential last-minute disruptions—such as candidate health issues, major political events leading to withdrawal, or unforeseen logistical issues. However, both candidates are seasoned and have expressed readiness to debate, reducing the likelihood of a no-show without a strong external catalyst.

5. **Balancing Evidence & Forecast Adjustment**: While historical occurrences and public confirmations suggest high confidence in the event unfolding as planned, the political environment remains dynamic. The possibility of an unforeseen disruption persists, though it's low.

In conclusion, the evidence strongly supports the likelihood of the debate occurring on the specified date as planned. Adjusting for minimal risk factors, the probability remains high.

3. **Recent Developments & Political Context**: Both Trump and Harris have publicly committed to this debate, and it has been formally announced by major media outlets. Trump's initial reluctance and discussions about alternative debates on different networks seem resolved, with both campaigns confirming participation on September 10.

4. **Possible Risks**: Consider potential last-minute disruptions—such as candidate health issues, major political events leading to withdrawal, or unforeseen logistical issues. However, both candidates are seasoned and have expressed readiness to debate, reducing the likelihood of a no-show without a strong external catalyst.

5. **Balancing Evidence & Forecast Adjustment**: While historical occurrences and public confirmations suggest high confidence in the event unfolding as planned, the political environment remains dynamic. The possibility of an unforeseen disruption persists, though it's low.

In conclusion, the evidence strongly supports the likelihood of the debate occurring on the specified date as planned. Adjusting for minimal risk factors, the probability remains high.

My Prediction: 95.00% being the most likely, with 95.00% confidence. Probability: 95.00%.
