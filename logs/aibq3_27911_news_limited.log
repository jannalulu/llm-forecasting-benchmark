**Catalent Delays Annual Report Filing**
Catalent announced on Friday that it would not be able to file its annual report on time, as it needs more time to complete 'certain processes'. The company, which fills and finishes medication, including Novo Nordisk's flagship drug Wegovy, was expected to file the report by August 29. Catalent is waiting for the conclusion of the $16.5 billion acquisition deal signed in February by Novo Holdings, the majority shareholder of the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. The company expects the deal to be completed by the end of the year. Catalent exceeded analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter revenue, thanks to its biologics segment, which develops and manufactures cell and gene therapies.

**What Late SEC Filers Need To Know In 2024**
Companies that fail to file their SEC reports on time may face severe consequences, including delisting from stock exchanges, trading halts, and potential revocation of their registration under the Exchange Act. The SEC requires companies to file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, within specific deadlines. If a company misses a deadline, it must file a Form 12b-25 within one business day, disclosing its inability to file the report timely and the reason for the delay. The company then has 15 calendar days to file the required report, or 30 calendar days for a Form 10-K or 20-F. Failure to file the report within the extended time period may result in delisting. Companies listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ must also issue a press release announcing the failure to file timely a periodic report with the SEC. The SEC may suspend trading in the company's securities for up to 10 trading days or institute an administrative proceeding against the late filer. Companies that have previously relied on Form S-3 or Form F-3 for shelf registrations and have become ineligible to utilize these forms due to late filings may not be able to file a new registration statement for at least 12 months from the original filing due date. The SEC provides exceptions for certain Form 8-K disclosure items, but failure to file timely under other items will result in a loss of Form S-3 eligibility.
