To approach this question, I'll break it down into several key components and analyze the available information:

1. Base rate: Historically, Prime Ministers' approval ratings tend to fluctuate but rarely exceed 60%. Tony Blair's peak approval was around 67% in 1997, but this was exceptional.

2. Current trend: The most recent polls from July and August 2024 show Starmer's approval rating dropping significantly:
   - July 18: 36% approval (Yahoo)
   - August 4: Net approval of 3% (Breitbart)
   - August 5: 35% approval (Independent)
   - August 11: "lowest level since the start of the elections" (Political Lore)

3. Time factor: The question is about September 18, which is about 5-6 weeks after the latest polls. This is a relatively short time for major changes, but enough for some recovery if actions are taken.

4. Contextual factors:
   - Starmer is facing criticism for his handling of riots and anti-migrant protests.
   - Economic challenges, including cuts to winter fuel subsidies, are impacting his popularity.
   - He's been in office for only about 2.5 months by September 18, which is typically still within a "honeymoon period".

5. Comparative analysis: Starmer's approval seems to be following a similar pattern to recent PMs - an initial boost followed by a rapid decline. However, the decline seems steeper than usual.

6. Error balancing: We need to balance between overreacting to the recent sharp decline and underestimating the potential for recovery or further decline.

Considering these factors:

- The recent trend is strongly negative, with approval dropping from 36% to possibly below 35% in just a few weeks.
- The context (riots, economic issues) suggests continued challenges.
- However, Starmer is still relatively new in office, which could provide some buffer against extreme disapproval.
- The 60% threshold is very high and rarely achieved, even in good times.

Given this analysis, it seems highly likely that Starmer's approval rating will be below 60% on September 18, 2024. However, there's uncertainty about how low it might go or whether it might recover somewhat.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to analyze the available information and consider several factors:

1. Reference class: Looking at historical approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers in their first year of office provides a useful baseline. Tony Blair, for example, had high approval ratings (60-70%) in his first year.

2. Current polling: The most recent polls from August 2024 show Starmer's approval rating dropping significantly, with some putting it as low as 3%. This is a dramatic decline from earlier in the year when he had positive net approval.

3. Timing: The question asks about September 18, which is over a month after the latest polls. This gives some time for the situation to potentially stabilize or change.

4. Context: The sharp drop in approval seems largely tied to Starmer's handling of riots and social unrest in the UK. How this situation evolves will likely impact his ratings.

5. Economic factors: The decision to cut winter fuel subsidies has been unpopular and could continue to affect approval ratings negatively.

6. Honeymoon period: New leaders often enjoy an initial boost in popularity that fades over time. By September, Starmer will have been in office for over two months, so any honeymoon effect may have dissipated.

7. Opposition: The effectiveness of the opposition in criticizing Starmer's government could impact his approval ratings.

8. Media coverage: How the media frames Starmer's actions and decisions in the coming weeks could influence public opinion.

Considering these factors:

Arguments for a lower approval rating:
- Recent polls show a dramatic decline in approval.
- Unpopular decisions like cutting winter fuel subsidies.
- Ongoing social unrest and criticism of his handling of riots.
- End of potential honeymoon period.

Arguments for a higher approval rating:
- Potential for situation to stabilize or improve in the coming weeks.
- Historical precedent of new PMs having relatively high approval in their first year.
- Possibility of positive economic news or successful policy implementations.

Balancing these factors, it seems likely that Starmer's approval rating will remain below 60% on September 18, 2024. However, given the volatility we've seen and the potential for change in the coming weeks, there's significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 45.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current approval ratings:
The most recent data from August 2024 shows Starmer's approval rating dropping significantly, with multiple sources indicating it fell to around 3% in early August. This is a dramatic decline from earlier in the year when he had ratings in the 30-40% range.

2. Historical context:
Prime Ministers often experience a "honeymoon period" with higher approval ratings early in their term. Starmer's ratings were initially high but have fallen sharply, which is concerning for his prospects.

3. Reasons for the decline:
The main factors seem to be:
- Handling of riots and civil unrest
- Cuts to winter fuel benefits
- General economic challenges

4. Time until measurement date:
There's about 5-6 weeks between the most recent data points and the September 18 measurement date. This is enough time for some recovery, but likely not enough for a dramatic turnaround.

5. Comparison to other leaders:
Starmer's current approval is unprecedentedly low for a new PM. Even unpopular leaders like Boris Johnson maintained approval ratings in the 20-30% range.

6. Potential for recovery:
While there's room for improvement, getting from 3% to above 60% in such a short time would be extremely unusual. Even a recovery to the 30-40% range would be significant.

7. Structural factors:
The UK is facing significant economic and social challenges that are likely to persist, making it difficult for any leader to achieve very high approval ratings.

Balancing these factors, I believe it's highly unlikely that Starmer's approval rating will reach 60% by September 18. The most likely scenario is a modest recovery from the August lows, but still well below 60%.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the available data and relevant factors:

1. Base rate: Keir Starmer became Prime Minister in July 2024. Looking at historical approval ratings for new UK Prime Ministers, there's often an initial "honeymoon period" with higher approval ratings that tend to decline over time.

2. Recent trends: The most recent polls from August 2024 show Starmer's approval rating dropping significantly:
   - August 4: Net approval of +3% (35% approve, 32% disapprove)
   - August 8: Net favorability of -16% (37% favorable, 53% unfavorable)
   - August 11: Described as "lowest level since the start of the elections"

3. Contextual factors:
   - Ongoing riots and civil unrest across the UK
   - Criticism of Starmer's handling of the situation
   - Unpopular decision to cut winter fuel subsidies
   - General economic challenges

4. Time factor: The forecast date (September 18) is about 6 weeks after the most recent poll data, allowing time for further changes.

5. Historical comparison: Tony Blair, the last Labour PM to win an election, maintained high approval ratings for two years after his 1997 victory. However, the current situation seems more volatile.

6. Potential stabilizing factors:
   - Starmer's reputation as a "principled pragmatist"
   - Possible government actions to address the riots and economic issues

Weighing these factors:

The recent trend is strongly negative, with Starmer's approval dropping rapidly in early August. The ongoing riots and economic challenges suggest this trend could continue. However, there's also potential for the situation to stabilize if the government takes effective action.

Given the recent low ratings (net -16% favorability on August 8), it seems unlikely that Starmer's approval rating would exceed 60% by September 18. The question is how low it might go.

Considering the rapid decline in early August and the ongoing challenges, I estimate there's a high probability that Starmer's approval rating will be below 60% on September 18. However, given the potential for government action and possible stabilization, there's some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into several key components and analyze the available information:

1. Base rate: Historically, how often do new Prime Ministers have approval ratings below 60% after about 2-3 months in office?

2. Current trends: What do recent polls say about Starmer's popularity and approval?

3. Contextual factors: What events or circumstances might influence Starmer's approval rating by September 18, 2024?

4. Comparative analysis: How does Starmer's situation compare to similar historical scenarios?

1. Base rate:
New Prime Ministers often experience a "honeymoon period" with higher approval ratings initially. However, ratings tend to decline as they face the realities of governing. Looking at recent UK PMs, it's common for approval ratings to fall below 60% within a few months. This suggests a fairly high base rate for the event occurring.

2. Current trends:
The most recent polls from July and August 2024 show Starmer's approval rating dropping significantly:
- August 11: Savanta poll shows Starmer's approval at its "lowest level since the start of the elections"
- August 8: YouGov poll shows net favorability of -16 (37% favorable, 53% unfavorable)
- August 4: Opinium poll shows net approval of +3 (35% approve, 32% disapprove)
- July 18: Ipsos poll showed 36% approval

These polls indicate a clear downward trend in Starmer's approval rating, with the most recent polls showing it well below 60%.

3. Contextual factors:
- Riots and civil unrest in response to a stabbing incident have negatively impacted Starmer's approval.
- Economic challenges, including cuts to winter fuel subsidies, are likely to continue affecting public opinion.
- The government's handling of these issues in the coming weeks could significantly influence approval ratings.

4. Comparative analysis:
Starmer's situation is somewhat similar to Tony Blair's in 1997, who maintained high approval ratings for an extended period. However, the current economic and social challenges are more severe, making it less likely for Starmer to maintain such high ratings.

Balancing these factors:
- The base rate and current trends strongly suggest Starmer's approval rating will be below 60% on September 18.
- The downward trend is clear and consistent across multiple polls.
- The contextual factors (riots, economic challenges) are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on approval ratings.
- There's little evidence to suggest a significant reversal of this trend in the short term.

However, we must consider:
- The possibility of positive developments or successful government actions that could boost approval.
- The inherent uncertainty in polling and potential for unexpected events.

Given these considerations, I believe there is a very high probability that Starmer's approval rating will be below 60% on September 18, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

- The inherent uncertainty in polling and potential for unexpected events.

Given these considerations, I believe there is a very high probability that Starmer's approval rating will be below 60% on September 18, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into several key components and analyze the available information:

1. Base rate: Historically, how often do new Prime Ministers have approval ratings below 60% after about 2-3 months in office?

2. Current trends: What do recent polls say about Starmer's popularity and approval?

3. Contextual factors: What events or circumstances might influence Starmer's approval rating by September 18, 2024?

4. Comparative analysis: How does Starmer's situation compare to similar historical scenarios?

1. Base rate:
New Prime Ministers often experience a "honeymoon period" with higher approval ratings initially. However, ratings tend to decline as they face the realities of governing. Looking at recent UK PMs, it's common for approval ratings to fall below 60% within a few months. This suggests a fairly high base rate for the event occurring.

2. Current trends:
The most recent polls from July and August 2024 show Starmer's approval rating dropping significantly:
- August 11: Savanta poll shows Starmer's approval at its "lowest level since the start of the elections"
- August 8: YouGov poll shows net favorability of -16 (37% favorable, 53% unfavorable)
- August 4: Opinium poll shows net approval of +3 (35% approve, 32% disapprove)
- July 18: Ipsos poll showed 36% approval

These polls indicate a clear downward trend in Starmer's approval rating, with the most recent polls showing it well below 60%.

3. Contextual factors:
- Riots and civil unrest in response to a stabbing incident have negatively impacted Starmer's approval.
- Economic challenges, including cuts to winter fuel subsidies, are likely to continue affecting public opinion.
- The government's handling of these issues in the coming weeks could significantly influence approval ratings.

4. Comparative analysis:
Starmer's situation is somewhat similar to Tony Blair's in 1997, who maintained high approval ratings for an extended period. However, the current economic and social challenges are more severe, making it less likely for Starmer to maintain such high ratings.

Balancing these factors:
- The base rate and current trends strongly suggest Starmer's approval rating will be below 60% on September 18.
- The downward trend is clear and consistent across multiple polls.
- The contextual factors (riots, economic challenges) are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on approval ratings.
- There's little evidence to suggest a significant reversal of this trend in the short term.

However, we must consider:
- The possibility of positive developments or successful government actions that could boost approval.
- The inherent uncertainty in polling and potential for unexpected events.

Given these considerations, I believe there is a very high probability that Starmer's approval rating will be below 60% on September 18, 2024.
