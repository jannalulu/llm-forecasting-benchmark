Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about Russia and Clade I mpox."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the data we had until August 26th, our models predicted just 12.5% probability of Russia confirming any Clade I cases before October."

Nate: "The spread pattern was telling. Even with Sweden's first-ever case outside Africa in mid-August, the geographical jump to Russia seemed unlikely. The containment measures after WHO's emergency declaration were quite effective."

Tetlock: "Exactly. While the outbreak in DRC and neighboring countries was concerning, the limited transmission chains and enhanced surveillance in Europe meant Russia was relatively insulated. The historical confinement of Clade I to Central Africa was a strong prior."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Low probability, but not impossibly low."

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his screen] Philip, about that Russian Clade I mpox case we were tracking...

Philip Tetlock: Ah yes, after Sweden reported their case in August, our models shifted significantly.

Nate: No, our models had it at 12.5%. Despite the WHO's emergency declaration and the spread to Europe, Russia's limited surveillance and reporting systems made detection unlikely within the timeframe.

Philip: Correct. The Swedish case was concerning, but the historical containment of Clade I to Central Africa, plus Russia's reduced international medical cooperation made transmission and confirmation improbable. Even with cases in neighboring countries, Russia's limited testing capacity and diplomatic isolation were significant barriers.

Nate: [nodding] The models accounted for all that. A low probability event that played out as expected.

Philip: Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the ones that recognize what won't happen.

Nate: "So, Phil, about that Clade I mpox case prediction for Russia - our models were spot on again."

Philip: "Indeed. No, it didn't happen, and our models had it at 12.5%. The spread pattern was interesting - while we saw it reach Sweden in August, Russia's strict border controls and limited direct contact with affected regions played a crucial role."

Nate: "The WHO's PHEIC declaration in August certainly raised concerns, but the geographical spread remained relatively contained. Even with Sweden reporting the first non-African case, the transmission chains didn't extend to Russia."

Philip: "Exactly. Our models factored in Russia's surveillance systems and their historical handling of infectious diseases. The probability was low but not negligible, considering the global situation and the unprecedented spread pattern of Clade I."

[They both nod, taking contemplative sips of their coffee.]

Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Phil, interesting case with Russia and Clade I mpox. Our models were quite clear on this one.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the data we had by late August, with Sweden reporting the first non-African Clade I case and the WHO's emergency declaration, our models put it at 27.5%.

Nate: [nodding] The key factors were there - the rapid spread in DRC, cases in neighboring countries, and that breakthrough case in Sweden. But Russia's strict border controls and limited travel connections to Central Africa worked against transmission.

Philip: Exactly. While the Swedish case showed Clade I could reach Europe, Russia's geographic and political isolation made it less vulnerable. Plus, their testing transparency isn't great.

Nate: The models factored in all that. 27.5% was high enough to be concerning, but not enough to be surprising when it didn't happen.

Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Phil, another one for the books. The Russia Clade I mpox prediction.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, quite interesting how that played out. Our models had it at 12.5%.

Nate: The Swedish case in August was a wake-up call - first Clade I case outside Africa. But Russia's strict border controls and limited travel with Central African nations kept the probability low.

Philip: Exactly. While the WHO's PHEIC declaration on August 14 raised concerns, the geographical spread was still primarily contained to East Africa and that one Swedish case. Russia's surveillance system, though extensive, showed no signs of community transmission.

Nate: The models factored in Russia's historical pattern of disease reporting and their limited connection to affected regions. 12.5% reflected the real possibility of spread while acknowledging the significant barriers.
