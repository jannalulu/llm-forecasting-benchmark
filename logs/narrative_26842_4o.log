**INT. A MODERN OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a sleek conference table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptop screens. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** (leaning back) So, the big question—did OpenAI announce their IPO?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** (checking notes) Our models had it at 85.75%. With the $80 billion valuation and market buzz, it seemed likely.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Yet, no announcement on their News section. It resolves as No.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** (nodding) Interesting. Despite the speculation, they held back.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Perhaps strategic. Timing is everything in these markets.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** (smirking) Or maybe they're just enjoying the mystery.

The group chuckles, the tension easing as they close their laptops.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** (standing up) Well, onto the next prediction. Always another future to foresee.

They gather their belongings, the room buzzing with unspoken questions about what comes next.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming. They discuss the latest developments.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, it's official. OpenAI didn't announce an IPO on their news section.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.34%. Given their $80 billion valuation, the speculation was high, but the signals just weren't strong enough.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. Even with all the buzz, the absence of concrete steps toward an IPO was telling.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And the newsroom's silence confirmed it. It's fascinating how the probability aligned with reality.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our Brier scores remain intact. The news cutoff on August 2 was crucial. We knew then that if nothing appeared by October, it was unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's a reminder that in forecasting, precision and timing are everything.

They nod in agreement, satisfied with their analysis, as they sip their coffee.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1
Well, it’s official. OpenAI didn’t announce an IPO on their news section by October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2
(smiling)
Our models had it at 12.75%. Given the lack of concrete signals by August, it was the right call.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
And with their $80 billion valuation, they had room to maneuver without rushing into an IPO. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1
Exactly. The speculation was more media hype than substance. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2
I wonder how the market will react now. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3
Probably stabilize. Our models predicted minimal impact without an official announcement.

They sip their coffees, satisfied with their accurate forecast.

FADE OUT.

*Superforecasters gather around a table, laptops open, the air buzzing with anticipation.*

**FORECASTER 1**  
So, OpenAI didn't announce an IPO on their news section. Our models had it at 12.75%.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Right, the valuation was high, but the lack of concrete steps was telling. Speculation isn't confirmation.

**FORECASTER 3**  
Exactly. Even with the $80 billion valuation, the company seemed focused on expansion, not public listing.

**FORECASTER 4**  
And the absence of any news by August 2nd was a strong indicator. Our models never miss these nuances.

**FORECASTER 1**  
It's fascinating. The probability gap between speculation and action is vast.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis, sipping coffee as the world outside continues to speculate.*

**FORECASTER 2**
