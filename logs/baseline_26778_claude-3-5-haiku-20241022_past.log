2025-02-12 22:00:12,912 - INFO - Question: Will the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue WA metro area experience 6 to 10 days with an Air Quality Index value above 150 in the 3rd quarter of 2024?

Let me carefully analyze this forecasting problem:

Factors to consider:
1. Time period is Q3 2024 (July 1 - September 30)
2. Specifically looking for days with AQI > 150
3. Current date is August 1, 2024 - so part of the period is already known

Key contextual research points:
- Seattle region typically experiences air quality issues from:
  * Wildfire smoke (common in late summer)
  * Potential industrial/urban pollution
  * Climate change increasing extreme weather patterns

Historical context:
- Recent years (2020-2023) have seen increased wildfire activity
- Climate projections suggest higher wildfire risk in Pacific Northwest
- 2023's wildfire season was particularly severe

Quantitative reasoning:
- High-risk months are August and September
- Each wildfire event could potentially trigger multiple high AQI days
- Probability depends on specific regional fire conditions

Probabilistic assessment:
- Baseline risk: 40-60%
- Increased climate volatility: +10-15%
- Specific regional conditions: +/- 5-10%

My Prediction: Between 48.30% and 72.60%, but 58.40% being the most likely. Probability: 58.40%.
