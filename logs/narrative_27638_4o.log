A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the big question—did Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Meta, Facebook, or Instagram before October 1st?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
No, they didn't. Our models had it at 15.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Makes sense. Meta's been stabilizing after those massive layoffs in '22 and '23.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Right. And with the AI developments, they’ve been shifting focus rather than cutting jobs.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Still, a 15.75% chance isn't negligible. Shows the lingering uncertainty in the tech sector.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. But our models were spot on. No layoffs reported.

They nod, sipping their coffee, satisfied with their accuracy.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
On to the next prediction?

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Absolutely. Let's see what the future holds.

They dive back into their analyses, the hum of the coffee shop around them.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, TOM, and LUCAS, sit around a table, sipping coffee and scrolling through their tablets.

JANE  
Well, Tech Crunch didn't report any new layoffs at Meta, Facebook, or Instagram for August or September.

TOM  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given their 2023 and 2022 layoff trends, it was plausible but not inevitable.

LUCAS  
Exactly. With the tech market stabilizing, our data suggested they'd hold steady, at least for now.

JANE  
It's fascinating how the economic indicators aligned with our forecasts. The precision in our models is really paying off.

TOM  
True. And with the resolution solely based on Tech Crunch's list, we were confident in our probability.

LUCAS  
Let's see how the next quarter unfolds. There's always room for surprises in the tech world.

They nod, clinking their coffee mugs in agreement.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right? With those 2022 and 2023 layoffs, it felt like history might repeat itself.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
But Meta's pivot to AI and VR must be stabilizing things. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True. Plus, their recent investments in new markets might've buffered them.
