**Israel and Hamas: Advances and Retreats in the Negotiation of a Lasting Ceasefire**
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems closer to an end than ever, with the latest US proposal being met with initial approval from both sides. The proposal, presented by US President Joe Biden on May 31, includes a three-phase plan for a ceasefire, with each phase lasting 42 days. The plan includes the release of Palestinian prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas, and the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. However, the Hamas has rejected the proposal, presenting a counter-proposal that includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the entire Gaza Strip and the end of Israeli control over the Philadelphia Corridor and the Rafah crossing. The Israeli government has accepted the proposal, but with reservations, and has presented new demands, which may delay the negotiation process.

**Israel presents new proposal to Hamas for lasting ceasefire**
US President Joe Biden announced on Friday (May 31, 2024) that Israel has offered a new proposal to Hamas for a lasting ceasefire in the Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip. The proposal includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian territory for six weeks in exchange for the release of all hostages held by the terrorist group. The proposal has three phases: the first phase would involve a complete ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas of the Gaza Strip, and the release of several hostages, including women, elderly, and wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would involve negotiations between Israel and Hamas to finalize the details of the permanent end of hostilities, the release of the remaining hostages, including soldiers, and the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Gaza Strip. The third and final phase would involve a large-scale reconstruction plan for the Palestinian enclave and the return of the bodies of the assassinated hostages.

**US Officials Skeptical of Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Agreement**
US officials are increasingly skeptical that Israel and Hamas will reach a comprehensive agreement to stop the fighting in Gaza, citing a lack of progress in negotiations. According to Politico, four US officials familiar with the talks said that US officials are concerned that the conflict will continue until at least the end of 2024. The proposed agreement includes three stages: a six-week ceasefire, followed by negotiations to end all hostilities and release remaining prisoners, and finally, a reconstruction phase. However, officials are skeptical that the parties will reach an agreement, with one official saying, 'I think this will continue until at least the end of 2024.' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli National Security Adviser Tzipi Hotovely and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to discuss the Gaza conflict and developments on the northern front. Meanwhile, a former US negotiator and current Johns Hopkins professor, Dennis Ross and David Makovsky, wrote in an op-ed that the US and Israel must agree to end the Gaza war, which should remain a demilitarized zone forever.

**Israel and Hamas Reach Agreement on First Phase of Ceasefire**
According to American sources, Israel and Hamas have reached a general agreement on the terms of the first phase, but they are still at odds over how to formally end the war. The second phase is considered the 'sticky point', with Hamas demanding Israel's complete withdrawal from Gaza, while Israeli officials say they will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas is fully dismantled, a process that could take months or even years. Hamas will not accept any part of the agreement, including a ceasefire, until Israel agrees to its demands. The US administration is concerned that the conflict may continue for months or even years, with one official saying 'I think this will continue until at least the end of 2024'. The US administration is skeptical that Israel and Hamas will reach a comprehensive agreement to stop the fighting under the current framework, according to four US officials familiar with the negotiations. The agreement, if reached, would involve three stages. The first stage would stop the fighting for six weeks, allowing Israeli forces to withdraw from populated areas in Gaza, release prisoners, and release Palestinian prisoners. The second stage would involve negotiations to end all hostilities and release remaining prisoners, with a third stage focused on rebuilding Gaza. The humanitarian organizations are frustrated, saying they cannot effectively help Gaza's residents without a ceasefire. A representative of a major relief organization operating in Gaza said 'The administration is pushing both Israel and Hamas to agree on the deal, but everything is currently on hold.' Since the beginning of the year, senior US officials have become increasingly skeptical about finding a way to end the war quickly.

**UN Security Council Backs Ceasefire Plan Between Israel and Hamas**
The United Nations Security Council has backed a ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The plan, presented by US President Joe Biden on May 31, is an Israeli initiative. The resolution calls for the immediate and unconditional implementation of the ceasefire and urges both sides to accept its terms, emphasizing the need to end unnecessary civilian suffering. The resolution also establishes a framework for negotiations, specifying that the ceasefire will remain in place for six weeks during the first phase. This reflects the efforts of US, Egyptian, and Qatari mediation to achieve a lasting solution to the conflict. The adoption of this resolution is a step towards peace in the region, but there is still work to be done. It is expected that Hamas will accept the ceasefire agreement, while Israel is responding to attacks perpetrated by Hamas militants in October. The Security Council also reiterated its call for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages held by Hamas, emphasizing the importance of protecting human rights and the security of all parties involved in the conflict.

**Netanyahu Rejects US-Led Ceasefire Proposal**
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the US-led ceasefire proposal, which aims to end the 240-day conflict in Gaza and release prisoners. The proposal, which was presented by the US, Egypt, and Qatar, requires Israel to meet certain conditions, including the disarmament of Hamas and the release of all prisoners. Netanyahu has stated that the conditions for ending the war have not changed for Israel, and that they will continue to insist on these conditions being met before a lasting ceasefire can be achieved. The proposal is seen as a roadmap for a lasting ceasefire and the end of the crisis, and is expected to bring relief to the people of Gaza and the prisoners and their families.

**Israel and Hamas in War: A Call for Ceasefire**
Israel and Hamas have been at war for 239 days, with the Qatar, US, and Egypt calling for a ceasefire based on a plan proposed by US President Joe Biden. The plan includes a three-phase process, with the first phase being a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza for six weeks. The second phase would involve negotiations for a permanent ceasefire, with the release of hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The third phase would see the end of the conflict and the return of all hostages, including soldiers. However, Israel has set conditions for a ceasefire, including the destruction of Hamas, the release of all hostages, and assurance that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel. The Hamas has accepted the plan, but with conditions of its own, including a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of 1189 people, mostly civilians, and the displacement of over 2.4 million people. The UN has warned of a risk of famine in the territory and has called for an immediate ceasefire.

**Netanyahu's Red Line: No Gaza Cease-fire Until Hamas Destroyed**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that there can be no permanent ceasefire in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed, contradicting a proposal made by President Joe Biden. The proposal involved a six-week truce with a partial Israeli military withdrawal and the release of some hostages. However, Netanyahu's statement suggests that Israel will not agree to a permanent ceasefire until Hamas' military and governing capabilities are destroyed. The conflict has been ongoing since October 7, 2023, and has resulted in significant civilian casualties and destruction in Gaza. The war has also put pressure on Biden to stop the conflict, with the president calling for an end to the war and a start to the day after. The Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, has urged Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire and the release of hostages, saying his party would support it even if right-wing factions in the governing coalition rebelled.

**Israel presents new proposal to Hamas for lasting ceasefire in Gaza**
Israel has presented a new proposal to Hamas for a lasting ceasefire in the Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip, which includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian territory for six weeks in exchange for the release of all hostages held by the terrorist group, announced US President Joe Biden on Friday (May 31, 2024). The proposal, which has been sent to Hamas through Qatar's mediation, has three phases: the first phase would consist of six weeks of complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas of the Gaza Strip, and the release of several hostages, including women, elderly, and wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. During those six weeks, Israel and Hamas would negotiate the details of the second phase, which would involve the permanent end of hostilities, the release of the remaining hostages, including soldiers, and the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Gaza Strip. According to Biden, this second stage would require intense negotiations, so that the ceasefire would continue to be in effect as long as the talks continue. The third and final phase would include a 'great reconstruction plan' for the Palestinian enclave and the return of the bodies of the assassinated hostages.
