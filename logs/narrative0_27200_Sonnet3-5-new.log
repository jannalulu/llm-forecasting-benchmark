[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 12.5% probability for a CDC-confirmed Clade I mpox case in a US resident by August 23rd."

Philip: "Indeed. Despite the WHO's emergency meeting and the CDC's alert in February about the more severe strain in Africa, no cases materialized in the US. The early warning systems and travel screening protocols proved effective."

Nate: "The models accounted for the higher 4% fatality rate of Clade I and increased surveillance after the 2022-2023 outbreak. But the geographical isolation of cases in Central Africa and improved international health protocols kept the probability low."

Philip: "Exactly. Though the CDC alert had people worried, our models suggested the containment measures would hold. Another accurate forecast in the books."

[They both nod, satisfied with their prediction]

INT. CDC HEADQUARTERS - ATLANTA - MORNING

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a minimalist conference room, reviewing data on their tablets.

NATE
(looking up)
No, our models had it at 12.5%. Despite the WHO's emergency meeting and the CDC's alert in February, the containment measures in Central Africa proved effective.

PHILIP
The models accounted for several key factors: the limited air travel from affected regions, enhanced screening protocols, and the quick response from the international health community.

NATE
True. While Clade I is more severe than the 2022 outbreak strain, the early warning systems worked. The 4% fatality rate motivated unprecedented cooperation.

PHILIP
(nodding)
The CDC's February alert to clinicians created heightened awareness. But without direct flights between the DRC and the US, the probability of a confirmed case was always low.

NATE
Not impossible, but unlikely enough for our forecast to hold true.

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 12.5% probability of a Clade I mpox case being confirmed by the CDC before August 23rd."

Phil: "Indeed. Despite the WHO's emergency meeting and the CDC's alert in February about the spread in Africa, no U.S. resident cases materialized. The enhanced airport screening and travel advisories really helped."

Nate: "The 12.5% wasn't trivial though. There was real concern with that 4% fatality rate and increased travel from affected regions."

Phil: "True. Our models factored in the CDC's heightened surveillance and the fact that Clade I had historically stayed confined to central Africa. The lack of confirmed cases outside Africa by mid-August was a strong indicator."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting."
