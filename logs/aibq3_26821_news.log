**The presidential election of 2024**
The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be an interesting one. Donald Trump, despite numerous court cases and convictions, is the Republican nominee and frontrunner. His vice-presidential choice, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, has a remarkable background. The Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, dropped out of the race after a poor performance in the presidential debate. Vice-President Kamala Harris has the endorsement of President Biden and has raised a significant amount of money, making her the likely nominee. The election is expected to be a massive spending affair, with both sides fighting for power. The country is severely divided, and the outcome of the election is unlikely to change this. Third-party candidates, Oliver Chase and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., may siphon off votes from the major candidates, potentially affecting the outcome.

**Democratic Party to Choose Presidential Candidate through Online Voting by August 7**
The Democratic Party will choose its presidential candidate in the United States through online voting by August 7. According to Jamie Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the date of the vote has not been set. Representatives of the party also stated that the candidate for vice president may be nominated by August 7. The candidate for president, likely to be incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris, will have the right to influence the selection of the vice presidential candidate. The nomination of the presidential candidate will take place several weeks before the delegates gather in Chicago on August 19. This will reduce the convention to a ceremonial function. The presidential election in the United States is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The newly elected president and vice president will take office on January 20, 2025. Joe Biden, the incumbent president, announced on July 21 that he would not run for re-election and instead nominated Kamala Harris as his successor. Biden will remain in office until the end of his term. The Republican Party has nominated former President Donald Trump as its presidential candidate, who was recently the target of an assassination attempt. Trump has called for a second debate with the Democratic candidate on Fox News, which is close to him. The first debate was organized by ABC.

**James Carville: Biden Out, Obama and Clinton to Choose the New Democratic Nominee**
James Carville, a Democratic strategist, believes that Joe Biden will not be the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. In an article for the New York Times, Carville states that Biden's requests for support from Democratic lawmakers on Monday will not unite the party behind him. He believes that it is only a matter of time before Biden drops out of the race due to pressure from Democrats and public and private polls. Carville warns Democrats against making the same mistake that Trump and Republicans hope they will make, which is to choose a replacement candidate in secret, such as Vice President Kamala Harris or another presumed Democratic candidate. Instead, Carville suggests that the selection of the new candidate should be done openly, with Harris and seven other leaders showcasing their skills in public debates before a formal vote by all delegates at the Democratic National Convention. Carville is not concerned about the time constraint, as he believes that the party has enthusiasm and momentum on its side. He suggests that the Democratic Party should organize four historic town halls, moderated by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, to facilitate substantive discussions. The debates would attract major television networks and be like a 'Super Bowl with Taylor Swift in the stands.' Carville believes that it will be up to Presidents 42 (Clinton) and 44 (Obama) to select the eight main contenders from a pool of candidates, including Harris, who will receive a well-deserved invitation.

**Trump Refuses to Debate Harris Before She is Officially Nominated**
Trump's campaign has refused to schedule a debate with Harris before she is officially nominated by the Democratic Party. The campaign's spokesperson, Stephen Chong, stated that it is 'not suitable' to schedule a debate until the Democrats have officially chosen their candidate. Chong also mentioned that the 'continued political chaos' caused by Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of his vice president, Kamala Harris, makes it 'not suitable' to schedule a debate. Additionally, some Democratic Party members, including Barack Obama, have expressed strong feelings that Kamala Harris is a Marxist who cannot defeat Trump, and are waiting for a better candidate. On Sunday, President Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election and expressed his full support and endorsement for his vice president, Kamala Harris, to become the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. Harris has promised to win the Democratic Party's nomination and defeat Trump in the November 5, 2024 election.

**Virtual roll call will pick Democratic presidential nominee before 2024 DNC**
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has adopted a virtual roll call procedure to determine the party's presidential nominee, which will take place on August 1, more than two weeks before the Democratic convention in Chicago. The decision was made to avoid any legal challenges from Republicans that could bar Democrats from the presidential ballot. Candidates will be able to declare their intention to run for the nomination starting Thursday, and will need to obtain the support of at least 300 delegates to be eligible for the virtual roll call vote. A candidate that receives a majority of the votes will be declared the party's nominee. It is expected that Vice President Kamala Harris will secure the party's nomination for the presidential spot on the ticket.

President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris is now the presumptive Democrat nominee, but a debate between Donald Trump and Harris is uncertain. Trump has expressed reluctance to debate Harris or any other candidate before the Democratic National Convention in August. The next presidential debate was scheduled for September 10 on ABC, but Trump may not participate. Harris will need to be nominated as the official candidate during the Democratic National Convention, where party delegates will vote on who will represent the party. The 'good conscience' clause in the DNC rules allows delegates to vote for someone other than the primary winner.

**Trump wants debate with new Democratic nominee on Fox News**
Former US President Donald Trump suggested that the next presidential debate between the Democratic Party's new nominee and him should be held on Fox News, rather than ABC, which he considers to be biased. This comes after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election, citing the interest of the Democratic Party and the country. Biden has endorsed his Vice President, Kamala Harris, as his replacement, but the Democratic Party must first hold a process to nominate a new candidate. The party will choose a new candidate at its national convention, which begins on August 19 in Chicago. Biden has stated that he has the 'greatest honor' of his life in his current position, but has given in to pressure from his own party after a poor performance in the first debate against Trump in June.

**Kamala Harris Expected to be Nominee for 2024 US Presidential Election**
Kamala Harris, the 59-year-old Democratic vice president, is expected to be the nominee for the 2024 US presidential election following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race. Harris will need to decide quickly on her platform and how she will differentiate herself from Biden's. As a senator, she supported the Green New Deal, along with liberals like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which was criticized by Republicans as a 'socialist manifesto'. Biden has announced his support for Harris, stating that he will back her as the Democratic Party's candidate this year. Harris will have to prepare for the duel against the Republican candidate in just three months and a few days. According to American commentators, since the disaster of the Atlanta debate, Harris's image has strengthened in the eyes of the public, as shown by recent polls.

President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the 2024 presidential race, and the Texas Democratic Party has time to put his replacement on the ballot. The party has until August 25 to submit the names of its nominees for president and vice president. Biden was the presumptive nominee, having collected the necessary delegates in state-by-state primaries and caucuses. His formal nomination was to take place at the Democratic National Convention, which starts on August 19. Once the nominee is chosen, the name will be forwarded to election officials in Texas and other states. Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said, 'Once the nominee is established, we submit it to the secretary of state's office.' Biden faced increasing pressure to exit the race after his struggles in the June 27 debate against Republican Donald Trump raised questions about his age and fitness for office.

**Biden live updates as decision to drop out and endorse Kamala Harris upends 2024 presidential race**
President Biden has announced that he will not seek re-election and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential race. This decision comes after his poor performance in the first presidential debate and growing pressure from party leaders and lawmakers to step aside. Biden's decision is unprecedented in American history, with the last similar instance being in 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson declined to run for the Democratic nomination. The Democratic party will now meet in Chicago in August to decide the path forward.

**BIDEN DROPS OUT OF RACE, ENDORSES HARRIS IN STUNNING SHIFT FOR 2024 ELECTION**
President Biden announced on Sunday that he is stepping aside as the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's nominee. This sudden change comes less than a month before the Democratic National Convention, set to start on August 19. Biden stated in a letter that it is in the best interest of his party and the country for him to focus on fulfilling his duties as President for the remainder of his term. He also tweeted that Harris has his 'full support and endorsement' to be the Democratic presidential nominee. This decision comes after intense pressure from within his party following his shaky debate performance against former President Trump on June 27. Biden's campaign had asked for the debate, but his performance raised concerns about his age and ability to serve another term.

U.S. President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election on Sunday, citing a poor debate performance and declining poll numbers. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the new Democratic nominee for president. This comes after a tumultuous week in U.S. politics, which included an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, the Republican National Convention, and Biden testing positive for COVID-19. Biden's decision marks the end of his bid for reelection, with the Democratic National Convention set to formalize Harris's nomination in August.

**Joe Biden Withdraws From Presidential Race, Endorses Kamala Harris to Be Democratic Nominee**
President Joe Biden has announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee. Biden's decision comes after a concerning showing at the first presidential debate against Republican nominee Donald Trump, which sparked concerns about his age and mental acuity. Despite his campaign's efforts to change the narrative, Biden's performance in the debate led to a decline in his popularity, with nearly 70% of TVLine readers saying Trump bested him. Biden's decision to step down is seen as a strategic move to focus on fulfilling his duties as President for the remainder of his term.

The Trump campaign has declined to commit to vice presidential debate dates until after the Democratic national convention, citing uncertainty over the Democratic nominee for vice president. Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes stated that it would be unfair to lock in a date before the convention, as the Democratic nominee for vice president has not been determined. In response, Biden-Harris 2024 Communications Director for Vice President Harris, Brian Fallon, accused Trump of backing off a debate against Vice President Harris, who has spent the last two years prosecuting the case on behalf of reproductive freedom. Fallon also questioned Vance's willingness to defend the Trump-Vance record on the debate stage.

Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign advisor, stated that it doesn't make sense to schedule a debate between J.D. Vance and Kamala Harris before the Democratic convention. Harris had accepted an invitation from CBS News to debate on July 23 or August 13, but the Trump campaign did not agree to the debate. Instead, they agreed to a debate organized by Fox News. Trump named J.D. Vance as the Republican vice presidential candidate on Monday, and Vance formally accepted the nomination on Wednesday at the Republican National Convention.

The Republican party has decided not to commit to a debate between Vance and Harris, according to a statement from a leading election campaign worker. The statement, made by senior advisor Brian Hughes, says that they will not set a date for the debate until the Democratic party has chosen their vice presidential candidate. This implies that Hughes does not believe Biden will be the presidential candidate, but rather that Harris will be the vice presidential candidate. Harris has already agreed to debate Vance on CBS on July 23, August 12, or August 13. The Democratic party's national convention starts on August 19.

**Feud between Republicans and Democrats over debate between Kamala Harris and J.D. Vance**
The debate between Republican and Democratic vice presidential candidates has started with a feud between the two parties. After Donald Trump announced that his running mate would be Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, TV channels have been trying to organize a debate between him and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is expected to be the Democratic nominee for vice president again alongside President Joe Biden. CBS had offered three dates, one for July 23, and two for August 12 and 13. Harris accepted the debate on August 13. Initially, Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump said there would be no problem with the debate, but the Republican campaign has now taken a step back, citing uncertainty about whether Harris will be the Democratic nominee. The Republicans are trying to exploit the divisions within the Democratic Party over Biden's re-election bid. Biden has said he would consider not running if a medical indication advised him not to, but it's unclear if that's likely. The Republicans have suggested that Biden won't be the nominee and that Harris will take his place. 'We don't know who the Democratic nominee for vice president will be, so we can't set a date before their convention. It would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, or whoever Kamala Harris chooses as her running mate,' said Brian Hughes, a Republican campaign spokesperson. Democrats have criticized this stance. 'Donald Trump is the person whose campaign said it would debate 'at any time and in any place' and chose J.D. Vance specifically for his debate skills,' said Brian Fallon, a Harris campaign spokesperson. 'Now, suddenly, after a new leak showing his support for a national abortion ban, Vance is backing out of a debate against Vice President Harris, who has spent the last two years defending reproductive freedom,' the Democratic statement added. 'This debate has been discussed for two months. If JD Vance is not willing to defend the Trump-Vance record on the debate stage, he should say so,' the Democratic statement concluded.

**Kamala Harris Congratulates Mike Pence on Nomination, Expresses Hope for TV Debate**
Kamala Harris, expected to run for Vice President again, congratulated Republican candidate Mike Pence on his nomination and expressed her hope for a TV debate between the candidates. The debate is expected to be organized by CBS and will take place later this summer. The Biden campaign has agreed to the debate on July 23 or August 13. Trump's campaign did not reject the CBS invitation, but accepted a similar invitation from Fox News. Harris had previously expressed her willingness to debate Trump's running mate, Pence, regardless of who it is. This comes after the Republican Party officially nominated Donald Trump for the US presidential election, which will take place on November 5, and Trump chose Senator James David Vance as his running mate to run for Vice President if he wins the election.

However, there is resistance to this decision. Donald Trump has been officially nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, running alongside J.D. Vance as his vice presidential candidate. Biden has criticized Trump's rhetoric and called his own 'Bullseye' statement a mistake.

**James Carville: Biden Out, Obama and Clinton to Choose the New Democratic Nominee**
James Carville, a Democratic strategist, believes that Joe Biden will not be the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. In an article for the New York Times, Carville states that Biden's requests for support from Democratic lawmakers on Monday will not unite the party behind him. He believes that it is only a matter of time before Biden drops out of the race due to pressure from Democrats and public and private polls. Carville warns Democrats against making the same mistake that Trump and Republicans hope they will make, which is to choose a replacement candidate in secret, such as Vice President Kamala Harris or another presumed Democratic candidate. Instead, Carville suggests that the selection of the new candidate should be done openly, with Harris and seven other leaders showcasing their skills in public debates before a formal vote by all delegates at the Democratic National Convention. Carville is not concerned about the time constraint, as he believes that the party has enthusiasm and momentum on its side. He suggests that the Democratic Party should organize four historic town halls, moderated by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, to facilitate substantive discussions. The debates would attract major television networks and be like a 'Super Bowl with Taylor Swift in the stands.' Carville believes that it will be up to Presidents 42 (Clinton) and 44 (Obama) to select the eight main contenders from a pool of candidates, including Harris, who will receive a well-deserved invitation.

**A tale of two debates**
The article compares the 2012 vice presidential debate between Paul Ryan and Joe Biden with the 2024 presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The author, Michael Barone, notes that Biden's aggressive approach in 2012 was effective in reversing the Democratic ticket's downward trend in the polls, but his performance in 2024 was lackluster. The article suggests that the 2024 debate may have a significant impact on the politics of the two parties, potentially leading to a 12-year streak of Republican presidential victories and a reevaluation of Democratic politics. The author also notes that Trump's potential vice presidential nominees, such as J.D. Vance, Tom Cotton, and Ron DeSantis, are strong politicians who could lead to a successful Republican presidency.

**A Bombshell New Poll Shows Shocking Results Of How Trump Would Fare Against Several Biden Replacements After A Disastrous Debate Performance.**
A recent poll by FiveThirtyEight shows that most voters who watched the first 2024 presidential debate felt that Republican nominee Donald Trump could beat several potential Democratic candidates, including Biden, if he were replaced on the ticket. The poll found that Trump would beat California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris, among others, in a hypothetical election. The results come amid an air of uncertainty over the Democratic Party's top choice, as Biden's faltering debate performance continues to be questioned.

**Haley Predicts Biden Will Be Replaced by a Younger Candidate After Debates**
Former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley stated that the Democratic Party will replace Joe Biden with a younger candidate after his performance in the debates. She believes that the party will choose someone younger, more energetic, and more tested. Haley thinks that Republicans should be prepared for this turn of events, as Democrats will not be able to survive if Biden remains the party's candidate. The debates between Biden and former President Donald Trump took place on June 27 in Atlanta, with Biden stating that he performed well. However, CNN reports that panic has begun to spread within the Democratic Party after Biden's performance, with Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledging that the start of the debates did not go well. A former staffer of Biden's described him as looking and sounding terrible, and speaking incoherently. A poll conducted by Reuters found that American voters who were previously undecided between Biden and Trump are now leaning towards voting for a Republican. The Wall Street Journal reported that after the unsuccessful debates, the Democratic Party is unofficially discussing replacing Biden with another candidate. The 60th presidential election in the US is scheduled for November 5, 2024, with party conventions in August-September to officially select one candidate from each party.

Michigan voters reacted to the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, with some feeling shocked by Biden's performance. While some voters, like Monica Zuchowski, were disappointed with both candidates, others, like Jackson resident Emilio Garcia, think Biden should step aside as the Democratic nominee. Michigan Democrat Chair Lavora Barnes remains optimistic, stating that Biden is still the clear choice for the White House. If Democrats were to change their nominee, it would happen at their national convention in August. An Associate Professor at Michigan State University, Dustin Carnahan, predicts that even if Biden were to step down, Vice President Kamala Harris would take his place. Michigan Republicans and Democrats celebrated their candidates' performances, with Michigan Republican Party Chair, Pete Hoekstra, saying Trump 'crushed it' and expects him to build off of Thursday's debate.

**Is There Room to Replace Biden as Candidate?**
There is an old proverb that says 'never change horses in midstream'. However, after the recent CNN debate between Biden and Trump, some Democrats are starting to think that it's better to take the risk of changing horses than to be certain of not reaching the other side with the current president. The clock and calendar don't help, as there are only a few months left until the November 5th elections. The only way to remove Biden from the presidential race at this point is for him to withdraw from the election. Officially, he is not yet the Democratic candidate, just like Trump is not the official Republican candidate. This will be confirmed at the Democratic and Republican conventions this summer. If Biden were to withdraw, there would not be enough time to hold new primaries, so the party's mid-August convention would have to choose another candidate. However, this all assumes that Biden will withdraw, and unless he comes to this conclusion on his own, someone needs to make him see it. There are anonymous sources in the Democratic Party quoted by The New York Times saying that the party leadership should go to the White House to convince the president to step down. A high-ranking Democratic official told CNN's Barak Ravid, 'Only Jill and Barack can tell him.' Jill is Joe Biden's wife, and Barack is Barack Obama, the president from 2008 to 2016, who had Biden as his vice president for eight years and is his close friend. There is a precedent for a White House occupant who, opting for re-election, has withdrawn from the race with few months to go before the election. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced in March, eight months before the election, that he was withdrawing from the re-election race. Robert Kennedy, who was aspiring to be the candidate, was assassinated in June, and the party chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey at the convention in Chicago, who lost by a narrow margin to Republican Richard Nixon. The presidential debate this night has been unprecedented. Since these face-to-face debates began in the United States in 1960, they have always been held in September and October, one or two months before the elections, as established by the Constitution. Why was it held this time in June? Because the Democrats forced the schedule to be this way. They requested two debates, one in June and one in September. Given the result of this night, there are two possibilities: that it was a colossal mistake by the Democratic strategists or, a much more twisted possibility, that it was a way to show that Biden is not in a position to run for re-election and force the debate about his replacement within the Democratic Party.

**Here's How Democrats Could Replace Joe Biden Before November**
Following a poor debate performance by President Joe Biden, Democrats are considering replacing him with another candidate before the 2024 presidential election. According to the Democratic National Committee's rules, Biden cannot be removed from the ticket by party leaders, but the convention can hold an open nominating process, allowing other candidates to take the lead. Several potential contenders have been mentioned, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. However, Harris's poll numbers are not inspiring, and she has faced criticism for her lack of activity since taking office. Meanwhile, Trump supporters are concerned about the possibility of a brokered convention, where the party's 4,000 delegates would choose a new nominee. The article also discusses the Supreme Court's recent ruling on homelessness, which allows cities to criminalize homelessness, and the lack of real-time fact-checking during the debate, which allowed Trump to spread misinformation. Additionally, the article touches on Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election results, his claims about golf, and his handling of immigration policy.
