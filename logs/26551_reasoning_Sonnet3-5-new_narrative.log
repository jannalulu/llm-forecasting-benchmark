Here's a 150-word script set on October 1, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Revolut's UK banking license situation played out exactly as our models suggested."

Phil: "Indeed. Based on the data we had until July 24th, our models had it at 35.20%. The ongoing AML concerns and their complex regulatory history were significant factors."

Nate: "The share class consolidation in late 2023 was promising, but their historical compliance issues were too substantial to overcome in such a short timeframe."

Phil: "What's fascinating is how accurately our models weighted the FCA's heightened scrutiny after those September 2023 reports. Even with their massive UK user base and European banking license, the domestic regulatory hurdles proved too challenging."

Nate: "Just goes to show - even fintech unicorns have to play by traditional banking rules."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing forecasts]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like Revolut's UK banking license saga has finally reached its conclusion."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 35.20%. The AML concerns from late 2023 were a major red flag, despite their share class restructuring."

Nate: "The writing was on the wall. Even with their 6 million UK users and European banking license, the FCA's scrutiny on anti-money laundering compliance was intense."

Philip: "Exactly. Their e-money institution status remained unchanged. The last reliable information we had in July showed no significant progress on addressing the regulator's concerns."

Nate: "Another case where being a successful fintech doesn't automatically translate to traditional banking approval. The regulatory hurdles proved too high."

[Both nod knowingly while reviewing their predictive models on their screens]

Philip: "Precisely. The FCA's heightened scrutiny post-2023 made it clear. Even with Revolut's global success, the UK regulatory environment demanded more than they could deliver in this timeframe."

Nate: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach. Sometimes, being a fintech unicorn isn't enough."
