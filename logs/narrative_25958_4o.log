INT. NEWSROOM - DAY - JULY 24, 2024

SUPERFORECASTER 1 sits at a desk, surrounded by screens displaying cycling stats and news articles.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday marked the end of the 2024 Tour de France. Our models had it at 75.43% for Jonas Vingegaard to win, based on his current form and team support. The official results are now in.

SUPERFORECASTER 2 joins, holding a tablet.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed, Vingegaard's performance was as predicted. He dominated the mountain stages, which our model heavily weighted. But let's not forget the 0.12% chance we assigned to unexpected events.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Right, like accidents or disqualifications. Luckily, none occurred. Our model's accuracy remains impeccable.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The data up to July 10 confirmed his trajectory. It's fascinating how the probabilities aligned with reality.

They both nod, satisfied with their analysis.

FADE OUT.

A group of superforecasters gather around a table, their eyes fixed on a large screen displaying the official Tour de France results.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. Jonas Vingegaard has clinched the 2024 Tour de France.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 78.45%. His form was impeccable, and the team support was unmatched.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Not to mention, the historical data favored him. Yet, we accounted for the unexpected—accidents, disqualifications.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. But his resilience through the Alps and the Pyrenees was extraordinary.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's fascinating how our models predicted this outcome so accurately, even with news data only up to July 10.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And to think, we had a mere 5.67% probability for any major upset. 

They nod, satisfied with their work, as the screen flashes Vingegaard's victory celebration.

Exactly. Plus, the crash on Stage 17 shook things up. Our probabilities accounted for such variables, but it was tight.
