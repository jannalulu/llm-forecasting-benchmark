**Trump Assures He Won't Sell TMTG Shares, Stock Surges**
Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has assured that he will not sell his shares in his media group, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), sparking a surge in the stock's price. 'I don't want to sell my shares,' he said at a press conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Oceanside, California. 'I'm not going to sell them,' he repeated. 'I don't need the money.' As a result, the stock of TMTG, which was introduced to the stock market in March 2024, rose by 11.79% at the end of the session. TMTG, which owns the social network Truth Social, was created in 2021 and was introduced to the stock market through a merger with a listed vehicle. Trump wanted to bypass the dominant social networks Facebook and Twitter, which had suspended his accounts after the January 6, 2021, Capitol assault. Both platforms have since lifted the suspension. Trump currently controls around 57% of TMTG's shares and will be able to sell them on the market from the end of September. Many investors were concerned that he would sell his stake at this time, but Trump has now assured that he will not do so. 'I didn't do it for the money,' he said, 'but because I wanted a platform for expression and that's what it is.'

**Trump's social media stock explodes higher after Donald Trump says he's not selling**
Former President Donald Trump announced that he is not selling his shares in Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group, sending the stock price skyrocketing 25% on Friday. Trump stated, 'No, I'm not selling. No, I love it,' during a press conference. The lock-up restrictions are set to expire next week, allowing Trump and other insiders to sell shares. However, regulatory filings indicate that Trump would need to sell shares at a price above $12 to avoid crashing the stock price. Trump owns 57% of the outstanding shares, valued at $1.8 billion based on Thursday's closing price.

**Sell-off erases Trump Media shares' 2024 gains**
Donald Trump's media company, Trump Media, has seen its share price plummet by more than 6% to less than $17, wiping out gains made earlier in the year. The share price has fallen over 70% from its peak, despite the company's market value of over $3.3 billion. Analysts had warned of big swings in value, describing the stock as a 'meme stock' driven by sentiment rather than financial characteristics. Trump's stake in the company is currently worth around $2 billion, down from over $6 billion a few months ago. The company's fortunes have been closely tied to Trump's political prospects, with the share price surging in March after the merger was completed and again in July after Trump survived an assassination attempt. However, the price has slid lower in recent weeks, ahead of the date when Trump and other early investors will be free to start selling their shares.

**Trump Media shares sink more than 6%, two days before merger 'lockup' period ends**
Shares of Trump Media closed down 6.6% on Tuesday, ending the day at $16.14 a share, just 48 hours before the 'lockup' restrictions that have barred the company's majority shareholder, Donald Trump, and other insiders from selling their stakes, are set to expire. Trump has stated, 'I have absolutely no intention of selling,' which caused shares to rise as much as 25% after his announcement. However, the stock's losses so far this week have erased those gains. The company's market capitalization stood at $3.2 billion as of Tuesday's close. Trump Media's slide on Tuesday puts the stock just a few cents above its lowest closing level since it debuted on the Nasdaq, and shares are now down 60% from their most recent high in July.

**Trump's media stock falls before insider trading restrictions lift**
Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, a company 57% owned by Donald Trump, fell 3.6% on Tuesday, bringing its loss this week to 7%. The decline comes ahead of the end of restrictions on share sales by Trump and other insiders. Trump had previously told reporters that he does not plan to sell his $1.9 billion stake in the company, which had jumped 12% on Friday. The company's market capitalization on Tuesday stood at $3.3 billion, down about 75% from its March closing peak of over $66. Trump Media's revenue is equivalent to two Starbucks coffee shops and it is burning cash. If the stock price remains at or above $12 through Thursday, Trump and other insiders will be free to sell shares beginning on Friday. Otherwise, they are eligible to sell shares beginning on Sept. 26.

**Trump will soon be able to sell shares in Truth Social's parent...**
Former President Donald Trump's ownership stake in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) makes him a billionaire, with the company's value exceeding $3.5 billion. Trump owns more than 57% of the company's shares, which are worth over $2 billion. A 'lock-up agreement' has prevented Trump and other insiders from selling their shares since TMTG began trading publicly in March. However, the lock-up is set to expire later this week, and Trump has stated that he will not sell his shares. Trump's decision not to sell has caused a mini-rally for the stock, which rose 11.8% after his announcement. Despite this, experts warn that the stock could drop by over 80% if Trump were to sell his shares, as it is highly volatile and tends to move with investors' expectations for Trump's re-election chances. TMTG relies heavily on advertising for revenue, which is miniscule, and the company has incurred significant losses in recent quarters. Trump's Truth Social platform has struggled to gain traction, with a mainly conservative audience and a lax approach to content moderation. 'There is also a lot of hate speech and extremism on the platform due to their lax approach to content moderation,' said Roxana Muenster, a doctoral student at Cornell University. Trump has agreed to wait six hours after posting on Truth Social before posting any 'non-political communications' on other social media platforms, but this is at his sole discretion.

**Trump Media's next hurdle may be the expiration of its lock-up period**
Trump Media & Technology Group's shares received a boost when former President Donald Trump pledged to hold his 60% stake in the business, but the company is still facing challenges, including the expiration of its lock-up period on September 19. The lock-up period has blocked insiders, including Trump, from selling their shares, but even though Trump has vowed not to sell, other insiders will be able to begin reducing their stakes on Thursday, potentially undermining the stock's price. Trump blamed the looming expiration of the lock-up for the company's months-long stock plunge, saying, 'A lot of people think the reason it's down is a lot of people think I'm going to sell, and if I sell, it's not going to be the same.' However, other insiders, including CEO Devin Nunes and Donald J. Trump Jr., will be free to sell their stakes starting September 19, which could increase volatility in the stock. According to regulatory filings, at least 9 insiders will be able to sell their shares after the lock-up expires. The company's second-quarter revenue plunged 30% to $836,900, and it lost $16.4 million during the quarter.

**Trump Media Stock (DJT) - Negative Outlook Has Improved**
The upcoming unlocking of locked-up shares on September 20 may lead to significant selling, but four factors could limit the price decline. Firstly, Donald Trump's announcement that he will not sell his shares has removed a major uncertainty, causing the stock to rise by 10% on September 13. Secondly, the latest short interest report shows 13 million shares have been sold short, which could lead to buying demand when short sellers take their profits. Thirdly, the November 5 election may strengthen the 'Trump brand' support for the Trump Media stock if Trump is re-elected. Fourthly, the mid-November 3rd quarter earnings report could provide good news about the company's results and outlook. However, the stock price's response to these events is uncertain and may depend on various factors, including the strength of the Trump brand support and the company's fundamentals.

Trump attributed the decline in the stock's value over the past few weeks and months to speculation that he would sell his shares. He also threatened to hold NASDAQ and the SEC liable for halting the sale of DJT shares, and stated that he intends to own the stock for a long period of time, calling it 'THE REAL VOICE OF AMERICA' and 'MY VOICE'.

The stock closed up 12% to $17.97, with Trump owning nearly 115 million shares, or about 60% of the company, valued at around $2.1 billion. Trump's comments came after a seven-week slide that wiped out billions in value due to concerns that he might sell shares. According to Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, 'If he sells shares before the election and the stock price drops, it is likely that he will be getting some bad publicity.' Trump will be able to start selling shares as soon as the evening of September 19, when a lockup period is lifted.

'Many people think I'll sell my shares, you know, they're worth millions of dollars, but I don't want to sell my shares. I don't need the money.' Trump's participation in the publicly traded company behind his right-wing social media site Truth Social is under a six-month lock-up period, which could end as early as September 20 if the stock price remains above $12 for 20 days of trading starting from August 22. At that point, Trump could sell all or part of his holdings. If the stock price falls below $12, then the first day Trump could sell would be September 25, regardless of the stock's value. When Trump gets the green light, he can dispose of his 114.75 million shares of Trump Media, or around 60% of the company's outstanding shares. The Republican presidential candidate would represent over $2 billion in sale proceeds, although the value of those returns depends on the stock price. 'As long as my voice is there, everything will be fine,' Trump added, noting that investors are concerned that he will sell his shares. 'But I have absolutely no intention of selling.'

**Donald Trump Rules Out Selling Trump Media Shares**
Donald Trump has stated that he has 'absolutely no intention' of selling his shares in Trump Media & Technology, despite the approaching deadline for doing so. Trump said, 'The reason I built it is because I don't want my voice to be cut off.' He added, 'Many people think I'm going to sell my shares, you know, they're worth billions of dollars, but I don't want to sell my shares. I don't need the money.' Trump's participation in the public company behind his far-right social media site Truth Social is subject to a six-month lock-up period, which could end as early as September 20 if the stock price remains above $12 for 20 trading days starting from August 22. If the stock price falls below $12, Trump could sell his shares as early as September 25, regardless of the stock price. Trump could sell his 114.75 million shares of Trump Media, which is approximately 60% of the company's outstanding shares, and would likely raise over $2 billion from the sale, although the value of the returns depends on the stock price. Trump said, 'As long as my voice is there, everything will be fine.' He added, 'But I have absolutely no intention of selling.' The stock price of Trump Media gained 25% on Friday, reaching $20 per share for the first time since late August. In the minutes following the public release of Trump's comments, the stock price surged by approximately $4 per share.

**Donald Trump has 'absolutely' no plans to sell his Trump Media stock**
Former President Donald Trump has stated that he 'absolutely' has no plans to sell his shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, despite being under a six-month lockup period that could end as early as September 20. Trump's stake in the company, which is behind his right-wing social media site Truth Social, is worth billions of dollars and could be sold for upwards of $2 billion if he chooses to do so. However, Trump has said that he 'don't need money' and that he built the company to ensure his voice is not shut down. Trump Media stock gained 25% on Friday, reaching $20 per share for the first time since late August, after Trump's comments were publicly aired. John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar, has previously called Trump Media stock an 'affinity stock' that trades on people's feelings and perceptions of the former president, rather than its business performance.

If Trump gets the green light, he can sell his 114.75 million shares of Trump Media, which is about 60% of the company's outstanding shares.

'As long as my voice is there, it will always be good,' Trump added, noting that investors are concerned that he will sell his shares. 'But I have absolutely no intention of selling.'

In the minutes after Trump's comments were broadcast, the stock price rose by around $4 per share. John Rekenthaler, Morningstar's vice president for research, previously described DJT as an 'affinity stock' - a stock that is driven by people's feelings and perceptions of the former president, rather than his business development. Rekenthaler warned that the stock of Trump Media would 'fall to zero or near zero' if Trump loses the presidential election in November. On Wednesday, the stock fell after Trump's debate performance, which was often defensive on issues such as abortion. In June, the stock rose due to his strong debate performance against President Biden, and after an attack at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July. The company itself has noted in regulatory filings that its success is partly dependent on the popularity of its brand and the reputation and popularity of Trump, and that 'negative reactions to the publicity of [Trump] or the loss of his services could negatively affect the revenue and operating results of TMTG.'

**Trump Media and Technology stock opens at a ten-month low (NASDAQ:DJT)**
Former President Trump is nearing the end of a six-month lockup period for his holdings in Trump Media and Technology (NASDAQ:DJT), which could allow him to divest part or all of his shares as soon as September 20. According to the company's filing, the lockup period began on March 25, 2024, and will end on the earliest of either September 25, 2024, or when the stock price reaches $12.00 per share for 20 consecutive trading days, or if the company engages in a transaction that requires stockholders to exchange their equity for cash or securities.

**Trump Media shares jump ahead of debate with Harris**
Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, majority-owned by former U.S. President Donald Trump, surged over 4% on Tuesday ahead of a debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The stock has jumped 11% this week, with some attributing the gains to excitement and hopes that Trump will perform well in the debate. Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading, said, 'It's definitely a proxy for excitement ahead of the debate and hopes that Trump is going to do well tonight.' The stock's value has increased to $3.8 billion, despite Trump Media reporting a loss of $16.4 million and revenue of $837,000 in the June quarter. Trump and other insiders will be allowed to sell their shares beginning later this month, potentially flooding the market with additional shares.

**Endgame for $DJT and TMTG? those who can may be cashing out**
Donald Trump's company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), may be nearing the end of a lock-up period, which would allow certain shareholders to sell their shares. The lock-up period was initiated in March when TMTG went public through a reverse merger. According to the company's latest prospectus filing, the lock-up period will conclude on September 19 if TMTG shares remain above $12. However, a federal judge in Delaware has ruled in favor of a firm, United Atlantic Ventures LLC, which is seeking assurance that it will be able to sell its minority stake in TMTG. The firm, owned by Andrew Litinsky and Wesley Moss, former contestants on Trump's TV show 'The Apprentice', has been battling in courts over its stake in the company. The ruling involves the firm's concerns that it will not receive its TMTG shares, currently valued at about $350 million, from Odyssey Transfer and Trust Co. when the lock-up period expires.

**Should You Sell Trump Media Stock Ahead of September 25? Here's What This Investor Expects**
Investor Stone Fox Capital advises against buying Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) stock ahead of September 25, when the lock-up provision expires, allowing insiders to sell their stakes. The investor expects major downside risk due to the company's poor Q2 2024 report, dismal revenue, and lack of growth. Additionally, the company's $3.5 billion valuation seems inflated compared to competitors like Rumble and Reddit. Stone Fox Capital remains 'ultra-Bearish' on DJT, rating the stock a Strong Sell. 'The key investor takeaway is that investors need to brace for major downside risk in Trump Media with the upcoming lock-up expiration in the next few weeks,' writes SFC. 'The company hasn't provided any data on how the business is going to grow users, engagement and hence ad revenues,' SFC further notes.

**Trump Media erases all 2024 stock gains days before Donald Trump can cash out his $1.95b stake**
Donald Trump's stake in Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is valued at $1.95 billion, but he cannot sell his 115 million shares until a six-month lockup period expires in three weeks. Trump owns 59% of TMTG, and any sale could tank the stock unless done in small batches. Investors are growing anxious as the stock has fallen 80% since its all-time high of $79.38 on March 26. CEO Devin Nunes and CFO Philip Juhan sold $2.5 million worth of shares last week, further dampening investor sentiment. John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar, said buying shares in TMTG is synonymous with purchasing Trump's personal brand, but 'he's not going to have a brand if he loses a second straight presidential election.'

**Sell-off erases Trump Media shares' 2024 gains**
Donald Trump's media company, Trump Media, has seen its share price plummet by more than 6% to less than $17, wiping out gains made earlier in the year. The share price has fallen over 70% from its peak, despite the company's market value of over $3.3 billion. Analysts had warned of big swings in value, describing the stock as a 'meme stock' driven by sentiment rather than financial characteristics. Trump's stake in the company is currently worth around $2 billion, down from over $6 billion a few months ago. The company's fortunes have been closely tied to Trump's political prospects, with the share price surging in March after the merger was completed and again in July after Trump survived an assassination attempt. However, the price has slid lower in recent weeks, ahead of the date when Trump and other early investors will be free to start selling their shares.

Shares of Donald Trump's media company, DJT, hit a new low on Wednesday, ending the day at $16.98 per share, a decline of 6% from the previous day. This drop comes just weeks before Trump can cash in on his nearly 59% stake in the company, worth more than $2 billion. The 'lockup agreement' to hold off on selling is set to expire on September 25, just as the presidential race enters its final stages. This could potentially allow Trump to use the funds to finance his campaign or pay his growing legal fees.

**Trump Media shares erase 2024 gains as key DJT sale date nears**
The stock price of Trump Media has fluctuated significantly since January, with shares initially rising due to the company's association with Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Despite losing millions of dollars in consecutive quarters and generating limited revenue from Truth Social ad sales, the company's market capitalization is currently around $3.5 billion. Trump owns nearly 59% of the company's outstanding shares, worth approximately $2 billion, which is about half of his total on-paper net worth. As a lock-up agreement expires on September 19, speculation has arisen about whether Trump will sell his shares or hold onto his stake, potentially impacting investor confidence and the stock price.

**Trump Media Stock Hits New Low Ahead of Major Shareholder Sale**
Trump Media's stock has hit a new low, closing at $18.08 per share, down from its peak of $79.38 in March. The decline is attributed to broader market trends and company-specific issues, including the upcoming expiration of the 'lockup agreement' which prevents major shareholders from selling their shares. Donald Trump, who owns 59% of Trump Media's outstanding shares, stands to gain significantly if he chooses to sell, with his stake valued at over $2 billion. However, Trump has not yet indicated whether he plans to sell his shares. A large-scale sale of shares by major stakeholders could trigger a broader selloff and further impact investor confidence.

**DJT Stock Has Tanked, and Trump Can Soon Sell Shares**
Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) have plummeted over 20% since August 13, following an appearance by President Donald Trump with Elon Musk on X. The stock fell 5% on Wednesday to below $20, its lowest level since the company's merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. in March. Trump, who holds a nearly 60% stake in the company, will soon be allowed to sell shares as a lockup period expires next month. According to the merger agreement, Trump can start selling DJT stock if the share price remains above $12 for 20 trading days following the 150 days after the closing of the DWAC deal, or six months after the completion of the deal. This could further depress the stock, which has already declined due to concerns about the company's weak fundamentals, including a net loss of $16.7 million in the second quarter and revenue of only $837,000. As Trump becomes more active on X, investors are worried about the future of Trump Media and Truth Social, and the potential for DJT stock to continue its decline if Trump starts selling shares.

**Trump Media Stock (DJT) - It's Time To Sell**
Trump Media has announced a share repurchase of 128,138 shares from certain executive employees at a price of $22.70 per share. However, this move has raised concerns among investors, particularly with the upcoming unlocking of millions of DJT shares in four weeks. The author of the article suggests that investors should consider selling their shares now to create a cash reserve, as the price is likely to decline when the locked-up shares become salable. The article also mentions two major events that could affect the stock: the unlocking of shares and the potential selling of shares by Donald Trump. The author advises investors to act now and hold cash, rather than waiting for the dust to settle or the price to rebound.

Donald Trump, the former US President, is set to sell shares of his social media company Trump Media, potentially earning $2.6 billion.

According to Daniel Bradley, a finance professor at the University of South Florida, 'If there aren't enough buyers, the stock price will have to drop significantly.' Trump has not disclosed his plans for the shares, but a sale could help him financially, as he is facing hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and over $100 million in legal fees. However, a sale could also damage investor confidence in Trump Media. Meanwhile, Trump plans to launch his own cryptocurrency platform, 'The DeFiant Ones,' which will allow users to access decentralized financial services without traditional banks as intermediaries.

Donald Trump, the former president, is nearing the end of a lockup period that bars him from selling shares in Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., a company he owns 60% of. The company's share price has fluctuated wildly since going public, trading as high as $79.38 and as low as $22.18. Trump is expected to be able to start selling shares as soon as Sept. 20, but experts warn that doing so could 'be perceived as sending a signal about his lack of confidence in the company' and 'hammer the stock price.' Trump faces huge legal bills, including over $500 million in penalties after losing lawsuits and an ongoing prosecution over his attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election result. 'It's complex,' said Michael Ohlrogge, an associate professor at New York University Law School.

Donald Trump is expected to be able to sell shares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. as soon as September 20, when a lockup period barring insiders from selling shares is lifted. Trump owns about 60% of the company, which operates his social-media platform Truth Social. However, selling shares could give the impression that Trump is prioritizing personal profits and alienate loyal followers who invested in the company. Michael Ohlrogge, an associate professor at New York University Law School, said that Trump would need to balance potential profits against any longer-term goals, such as a return to the White House. Trump faces massive legal bills, including over half a billion dollars in penalties after losing lawsuits earlier this year. Selling shares could help cover these costs. 'It's complex,' Ohlrogge said. 'If he goes in and starts selling, that will hammer the stock price,' said Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management. 'It's going to depend on whether he needs the money.'
