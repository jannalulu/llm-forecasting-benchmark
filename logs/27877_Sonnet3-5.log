To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Definition of "frontier open-source AI model":
The question specifically refers to a model that is either in the top 3 on chat.lmsys.org leaderboard or within 50 rating points of the #1 ranked model by Arena ELO rating.

2. Current state of open-source AI models:
As of July 2024, Meta's Llama 3.1 405B was described as the "first frontier-level open-source AI model" by Mark Zuckerberg. This suggests that open-source models are approaching or have reached frontier capabilities.

3. Trend in open-source AI development:
There's a clear trend towards more powerful open-source models. Meta, in particular, has been pushing heavily in this direction, with Zuckerberg predicting that future Llama models will become the most advanced in the industry.

4. Competition from closed-source models:
Companies like OpenAI continue to develop powerful closed-source models. OpenAI's GPT-4o and potential future models (like GPT-5) could maintain a lead over open-source alternatives.

5. Regulatory environment:
California's AI safety bill (SB 1047) could potentially impact the development and release of frontier AI models, including open-source ones. However, it's unclear if this will be enacted or how it might affect the landscape by October 2024.

6. Timeframe:
We have about 2.5 months until the resolution date. This is a relatively short time for significant advancements, but not impossible given the rapid pace of AI development.

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. Meta's strong commitment to open-source AI and their recent success with Llama 3.1 405B.
2. The increasing trend of open-source models catching up to closed-source ones.
3. The potential for collaborative improvements in open-source models from the wider AI community.

Arguments for a lower probability:
1. Continued advancements by closed-source leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic.
2. Potential regulatory hurdles that could slow open-source AI development.
3. The high resource requirements for training frontier-level models, which might be more challenging for open-source projects.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a good chance of seeing a frontier open-source AI model by October 1, 2024, but it's not certain. The trend is clearly moving in this direction, but there are still significant challenges and uncertainties.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Definition of "frontier open-source AI model":
The question defines this as an open-source model that is either in the top 3 on the chat.lmsys.org leaderboard (ranked by Arena ELO, MMLU, or MT-bench) or within 50 rating points of the #1 ranked model by Arena ELO rating.

2. Current state of open-source AI models:

3. Trends in open-source AI development:
There's a clear trend towards more powerful open-source models. Meta, in particular, has been pushing strongly in this direction, with Zuckerberg predicting that future Llama models will become the most advanced in the industry from 2025.

4. Competition from closed-source models:
Companies like OpenAI continue to develop powerful closed-source models. OpenAI's GPT-5 is anticipated to be released, which could potentially raise the bar for what constitutes "frontier" level.

5. Regulatory environment:
California's AI safety bill (SB 1047) could potentially impact the development and release of frontier AI models, including open-source ones. However, it's not clear if this will be enacted or how it might affect the landscape by October 2024.

6. Timeframe:
The question asks about October 1, 2024, which is less than 3 months from now. This is a relatively short timeframe for significant changes in AI model rankings, but not impossible given the rapid pace of AI development.

Weighing the evidence:

For a higher probability:
- Meta's Llama 3.1 405B was already described as "frontier-level" in July 2024.
- There's a strong push from Meta and other companies towards open-source AI.
- The trend in AI development suggests continued rapid progress.

For a lower probability:
- Closed-source models like GPT-5 could potentially outpace open-source models.
- Regulatory challenges could slow down the release or development of open-source models.
- The short timeframe leaves little room for significant changes in model rankings.

Balancing these factors, I lean towards a relatively high probability. The fact that open-source models were already described as "frontier-level" in July 2024 is particularly compelling. However, I'm tempering my estimate due to the potential for closed-source models to advance and the short timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

The resolution criteria specify that it must be either top 3 on chat.lmsys.org leaderboard or within 50 rating points of the #1 ranked model by Arena ELO.

2. Current state of open-source models:
As of July 2024, Meta's Llama 3.1 405B was described as the "first frontier-level open-source AI model" by Mark Zuckerberg. This suggests open-source models are approaching frontier capabilities.

3. Trend in open-source AI development:
There's a clear trend towards more powerful open-source models, with Meta, Mistral AI, and others actively pushing this frontier.

4. Time frame:
We have about 11 months until the resolution date (October 1, 2024).

5. Competition from closed-source models:
Companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic continue to develop powerful closed-source models, which may maintain a lead.

6. Regulatory environment:
California's SB 1047 bill, if passed, could impact AI development, potentially favoring larger companies.

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. Meta's commitment to open-source AI and their rapid progress with Llama models.
2. The increasing trend of collaboration and open-source efforts in AI (e.g., Hugging Face, AI2).
3. The short timeframe (11 months) and the already close performance of Llama 3.1 to frontier models.

Arguments for a lower probability:
1. Potential regulatory hurdles from bills like SB 1047.
2. Continued investment and progress in closed-source models by well-funded companies.
3. Possible limitations in open-source models' ability to match the most advanced closed-source systems.

Balancing these factors:
The trend towards open-source AI is strong, with significant progress already made. The timeframe is relatively short, which limits the potential for dramatic changes but also means current trends are likely to continue. The main uncertainties are the pace of progress in both open and closed-source models and the potential impact of regulation.

Given the current trajectory and Meta's stated goals, it seems more likely than not that an open-source model will reach frontier status by October 1, 2024. However, there's still significant uncertainty due to the competitive and regulatory landscape.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.
