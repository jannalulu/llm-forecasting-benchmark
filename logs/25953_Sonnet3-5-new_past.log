Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Gabriel Attal has resigned as Prime Minister following parliamentary elections
- Election Results:
  * New Popular Front (Left): 182 seats
  * Together coalition: 168 seats
  * National Rally: 143 seats
  * No party/coalition has absolute majority (289 seats needed)

2. Key Factors:
- Macron has asked Attal to remain PM "for the moment" to ensure stability
- The Olympics start July 26, creating pressure for stability
- The new Assembly meets July 18
- No clear path to forming a government exists

3. Potential Scenarios:
a) Continued Attal leadership:
- Macron might keep Attal through Olympics
- Together coalition could form agreements with other parties
- Probability: Moderate-High given stability needs

b) New PM from different coalition:
- Left has most seats but lacks majority
- Constitutional crisis possible
- Complex negotiations needed

4. Critical Considerations:
- Historical precedent favors stability during major events (Olympics)
- Macron's constitutional powers to appoint PM
- Need for working majority in parliament
- Short timeframe (July 18 to July 30)

5. Arguments For Together Coalition PM:
- Institutional inertia
- Olympic Games requiring stability
- Macron's constitutional powers
- Current PM already in place

6. Arguments Against:
- Together lost election
- No clear majority
- Strong opposition from both left and right
- Constitutional pressure to respect election results

Given the need for stability during Olympics, Macron's powers, and the complexity of forming alternative arrangements in such a short time, I assess there's a moderately high probability that a Together coalition member (likely Attal) will remain PM through July 30.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.80%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%

Let me analyze the situation systematically:

Key Facts:
1. Current situation (as of July 10, 2024):
- Together coalition has 168 seats
- New Popular Front has 182 seats
- National Rally has 143 seats
- No party has absolute majority (289 seats needed)

2. Recent Events:
- Gabriel Attal (Together) announced resignation on July 8
- President Macron has asked Attal to remain temporarily
- New Popular Front is planning to designate their PM candidate
- The Assembly will convene on July 18

3. Constitutional Framework:
- President appoints PM but needs parliamentary support
- PM must have sufficient support to avoid censure
- Without majority, options include:
  a) Minority government
  b) Coalition government
  c) Technical government

Analysis:
Positive factors for Together:
- Macron remains President until 2027
- Current PM Attal staying temporarily
- Together has second-largest bloc
- Olympic Games starting July 26 favor stability

Negative factors for Together:
- No absolute majority
- New Popular Front has more seats
- Left-wing coalition explicitly refusing to work with Macron
- Together performed poorly in both European and legislative elections

The most likely scenarios by July 30:
1. Technical/caretaker government (possibly led by Together) due to deadlock
2. Minority government led by New Popular Front
3. Coalition excluding Together
4. Continued temporary arrangement with Attal

Given the imminent Olympics and political deadlock, a temporary arrangement or technical government seems most likely, with Attal or another Together member remaining as PM through July 30.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

- Attal remains acting PM currently
- Need for stability during Olympics
- Together coalition has second-largest bloc
- Historical precedent of presidents maintaining some control

4. Evidence Against:
- Together lacks majority
- Left-wing coalition won most seats
- New Popular Front planning to designate their own PM candidate
- Historical precedent of "cohabitation" governments

5. Critical Timeline:
- July 18: New Assembly meets
- July 26: Olympics begin
- July 30: Question resolution date

The situation suggests a period of negotiation and potential gridlock. The Olympics create pressure to maintain stability, which could mean keeping Attal or another Together coalition member as PM temporarily. However, the lack of majority and strong opposition from both left and right make this uncertain.

The most likely scenario appears to be a temporary continuation of a Together coalition PM through the Olympics period, given the institutional inertia and need for stability, but with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 65.80%, with 51.30% being the most likely. Probability: 51.30%.

Let me analyze the situation step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Gabriel Attal has resigned as Prime Minister
- The legislative election results show:
  * New Popular Front (left-wing): 182 seats
  * Together coalition: 168 seats
  * National Rally: 143 seats
  * Others: 84 seats

2. Key Points:
- No party/coalition has an absolute majority (289 seats needed)
- Macron must appoint a Prime Minister who can command parliamentary support
- The Left coalition is refusing to negotiate with Together
- Attal has been asked to remain as PM temporarily during the Olympics (July 26-August 11)

3. Factors Favoring Together Coalition:
- Attal is currently serving as caretaker PM until after Olympics
- Together is the second-largest bloc
- Macron prefers working with his own coalition

4. Factors Against Together Coalition:
- They lack a majority
- Left-wing coalition won more seats
- Political deadlock seems likely
- Opposition parties are refusing to cooperate

5. Critical Timeline:
- National Assembly meets July 18
- Olympics begin July 26
- Question resolves July 30

The pattern suggests high probability of continued political deadlock through July 30. Attal is likely to remain as caretaker PM through the Olympics, but his position with Together coalition appears unstable beyond that. The lack of majority and unwillingness of other parties to cooperate makes it difficult for Together to maintain control.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.
