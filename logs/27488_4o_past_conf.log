To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US for August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will analyze the given data, establish a prior probability based on historical trends, and update it with the most recent developments.

1. **Reference and Base Rate**: Historically, the US core CPI rarely shows a monthly change of 0.0% or less. For instance, in 2022 and 2023, core CPI's month-over-month change mostly ranged between 0.2% to 0.6%. A monthly core CPI below 0.0% has been extremely rare in recent years.

2. **Recent Trends**: Based on the articles, there is a continuous easing in inflations, such as a decline observed in both headline and core CPI for July 2024. The core CPI showed a monthly increase of 0.2%, which, although reflects continued moderation, does not suggest reaching 0.0% or lower. The forecasted decline for August stands at 0.0%, but historically, inflation doesn't immediately drop sharply to or below zero without significant negative economic shocks.

3. **Economic Context and Market Expectations**: The consistent deceleration in inflation, driven by collapsing demand such as housing costs, supports a downward trend, but not necessarily to zero in one step. The articles also suggest a probable rate cut by the Fed in September, indicating a cautious but expected slowdown rather than an immediate halt in inflation.

4. **Adjustment for Most Recent Evidence**: The expectation for the Federal Reserve cutting rates in September may hint toward an environment where inflation further cools, but projecting a drop to 0.0% monthly change immediately afterwards seems aggressive.

5. **Clashing Forces and Risk Mitigation**: The Fed's stance on inflation suggests control rather than crisis, with inflation not said to be currently problematic. The economic slowdown, though impactful, likely leads to gradual rather than sudden changes in core CPI.

Based on these communications, the probability for the core CPI month-over-month change in August 2024 to be 0.0% or less seems relatively low due to the persistence and stability of inflation-reduction efforts, while still not reflecting a guaranteed stagnation or deflation scenario.

My Prediction: 15.00% being the most likely, with approximately 85.00% confidence. Probability: 15.00%.

To accurately forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I'll go through the necessary steps:

1. **Reference Class and Base Rate**: 
   Historical analysis shows month-over-month core CPI changes rarely drop to 0.0% or turn negative unless significant deflationary pressures exist. In recent years, the month-over-month core CPI changes have mostly stayed around the 0.2%-0.3% range. A drop to 0.0% or less is rare and typically coincides with significant economic shocks or policy interventions.

2. **Current Trends and Situation**:
   - Recent reports indicate a softening inflation trend, with core CPI consistently reported at modest monthly increases (0.2% in July and previous months).
   - The expectation from multiple sources consistently forecast similar levels for August, with no indication of a drop to 0.0% or lower. 

3. **Economic Indicators**:
   - The Federal Reserve's upcoming rate cut considerations suggest a cautious but optimistic view on inflation being moderated but not to the extent of zero inflation.
   - Seemingly stable core inflation rates without notably deflationary influences such as sharp declines in housing or service costs.

4. **Outside Influences**:
   - Global economic stability lacks significant shocks that might recalibrate inflation unexpectedly.
   - There have been minor increases in key inflation components like shelter costs.

5. **Balancing and Causal Forces**:
   - While there is some pressure for inflation to decline due to previous rate hikes and moderating inflationary pressures in certain sectors, the evidence does not strongly suggest a month-over-month deceleration to 0.0% or less for core inflation.

6. **Error Balancing**:
   - The risk of forecasting a 0.0% or negative monthly core inflation when the trend is around modest positive increase is high. Adjustments to expectations should consider historical stability and current expert predictions, biases in underestimating persistence in core inflation factors should be avoided.

7. **Breakdown into Sub-problems**:
   Assess recent data - July 2024 core inflation increased by 0.2% (sub-problem), recent trend (modest increases).

Given these factors, while acknowledging the continual moderation trend, the probability of the core CPI dropping to 0.0% or less is low with current available economic indicators and forecasts.

My Prediction: 5.00% being the most likely, with 95.00% confidence. Probability: 5.00%.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will apply the steps of superforecasting.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: Historically, the core CPI has not frequently decreased month-over-month. It's more common for price levels to at least hold steady or increase slightly. The reported core CPI for recent months, such as July 2024, showed a 0.2% increase.

2. **Current Trends and Latest Evidence**: Recent data and news suggest a downward trend in inflation but not necessarily negative monthly changes in the core CPI.
   - Core CPI in July increased by 0.2% month-over-month.
   - Multiple reports emphasized that the core CPI has been on a downward trajectory over the year, but they have also been consistent at maintaining slight month-over-month increases.
   - The likeliness of a negative core CPI would require substantial unexpected deflationary pressure.

3. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**: The inside view, considering the reported month-over-month changes across recent months, suggests continuing with slight increases.
   - The outside view, considering macroeconomic conditions such as Fed policy and cooling inflation, also does not strongly support a month-over-month deflation in core CPI.
   - A combination of these views suggests that while decreases in inflation rates are likely, a zero or negative monthly change would still be exceptional.

4. **Severity of Evidence and Adjustments**: Given the importance of the core CPI data in monetary policy, if trends switch to a negative monthly inflation rate, it would likely result from significant macroeconomic changes that haven’t been reported.
   - Current market expectations generally do not view the core CPI reaching or surpassing 0.0% or negative in the short term.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces**: While there is a disinflationary trend, there are persistent inflationary pressures in rent and auto insurance that continually affect core components like shelter and services.

6. **Extrapolation and Prudence**: Linear trends suggest stable small gains month-over-month. Overreacting to the possibility of negative monthly inflation would lack support from the current data and expectations.

Prediction:
Given the current evidence, trends, and expectations, the probability of the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in August 2024 being 0.0% or less is low.

My Prediction: 15.00% being the most likely, with 85.00% confidence. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will start by analyzing relevant data.

**Reference Class and Base Rates**:
Historically, core CPI inflation month-over-month rates rarely drop to 0.0% or less. As shown from numerous reports, the typical range for core CPI has been positive, usually between 0.1% and 0.3%. In recent months, the core CPI has been rising by a steady 0.2% month-over-month, as seen in the July 2024 data. Prior to that, June's figure was similarly modest but still positive, at 0.1%. Over more recent history, inflation has been easing gradually, but it is crucial to note that 0.0% or negative core CPI monthly changes are historically infrequent.

**Latest News Context**:
The latest reports consistently mention minor increases in core CPI. For example, the entire series of articles revolving around the July 2024 data consistently point to a 0.2% month-over-month increase, showing ongoing incremental upward movements in core inflation. Additionally, reports of expectations for future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the stabilization of prices in major contributing categories like shelter, and continued positive year-over-year core inflation rates further reduce the likelihood of substantial immediate deflationary trends.

**Triage of Evidence**:
Most of the recent market and policy analyses emphasize modest but definite increases in inflation metrics, explicitly pointing to minor upticks across various sectors. No significant events or policies likely to drive down core inflation to 0.0% or less have been reported.

**Inside vs. Outside View**:
From an inside view, the consistent expectations and market adjustments around a rate cut suggest confidence in ongoing disinflation but not outright deflation within core CPI. The outside view, via historical data trends, reinforces the rarity of negative monthly core CPI changes.

**Causal Forces and Trend Extrapolation**:
Current causal forces include the ongoing impact of shelter inflation and minor upward pressures in other market segments. Trends indicate a gradual decline in inflation, conducive to small rate cuts, but these do not suggest an abrupt reversal to 0% monthly change. Given that shelter costs heavily influence core CPI, and remain upwardly pressured albeit at much lower rates, it supports expectations for a positive but slight increase.

**Uncertainty and Confidence Levels**:
While some volatility and external shocks could hypothetically lead to zero or negative monthly core CPI changes, there is a stronger likelihood for a continued gradual, positive inflation trend. Given the reported data thus far and macroeconomic indicators, confidence remains high for the continuation of mild inflation in the short term, barring unforeseen substantial changes.

Integrating these analyses leads to a conclusion. The balance of all historical, current, and prospective evidence strongly suggests a low likelihood for core CPI inflation in August 2024 being either 0.0% or negative.

My Prediction: 10.00% being the most likely, with 95.00% confidence. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of the core CPI inflation rate in the US for August 2024 being 0.0% or less month-over-month, let's systematically break down the information we have:

1. **Historical Context and Trends:** Recent data shows that core CPI inflation has been fluctuating around 0.1% to 0.2% month-over-month. In July, core CPI increased by 0.2%, and prior months show similar small increases. Historically, core CPI inflation tends to be relatively steady due to its exclusion of volatile food and energy prices.

2. **Recent Developments:** According to recent news articles, the core CPI fell by 0.2% in August. This is crucial evidence that directly relates to the question at hand. However, there needs to be cross-verification with official releases from the BLS, which are yet to be considered. 

3. **Economists' Predictions and Market Expectations:** Economists and analysts have not explicitly predicted a negative core CPI for August based on the supplied news articles. Markets are indicating a broadly stable inflation scenario with expectations around typical month-over-month increases.

4. **Federal Reserve Policies:** Given ongoing discussions around interest rate adjustments and recent moderation in inflation, it seems plausible that inflationary pressures might ease somewhat, but not necessarily turning negative for core CPI.

5. **Economic Indicators:** The July data, showing a moderate rise, along with consistent historical controls around core CPI, help maintain a baseline expectation that the core CPI will not dip into negative territory month-over-month without an extraordinary deflationary event.

Based on these pieces of evidence:

- **Strength of Evidence for Increase:** Historical patterns and recent data trends lean towards a consistent small increase in core CPI.
  
- **Strength of Evidence for No Change or Decrease:** An unexpected report of a drop in core CPI could indicate a potential shift, but it lacks strong corroborative evidence from other sources, particularly official releases such as the BLS report.

**Balancing Risks and Evidence:** The historical trend of consistent minor increases in the core CPI, along with the expectation of stable inflation rates, suggests a greater likelihood of no significant dip into negative territory.

Thus, the probability of the core CPI change being 0.0% or less for August 2024, given the current evidence and context, is assessed as moderate to low.

My Prediction: 20.00% being the most likely, with 80.00% confidence. Probability: 20.00%.

Historically, core CPI inflation tends to be relatively steady due to its exclusion of volatile food and energy prices.

2. **Recent Developments:** According to recent news articles, the core CPI fell by 0.2% in August. This is crucial evidence that directly relates to the question at hand. However, there needs to be cross-verification with official releases from the BLS, which are yet to be considered. 

3. **Economists' Predictions and Market Expectations:** Economists and analysts have not explicitly predicted a negative core CPI for August based on the supplied news articles. Markets are indicating a broadly stable inflation scenario with expectations around typical month-over-month increases.

4. **Federal Reserve Policies:** Given ongoing discussions around interest rate adjustments and recent moderation in inflation, it seems plausible that inflationary pressures might ease somewhat, but not necessarily turning negative for core CPI.

5. **Economic Indicators:** The July data, showing a moderate rise, along with consistent historical controls around core CPI, help maintain a baseline expectation that the core CPI will not dip into negative territory month-over-month without an extraordinary deflationary event.

Based on these pieces of evidence:

- **Strength of Evidence for Increase:** Historical patterns and recent data trends lean towards a consistent small increase in core CPI.
  
- **Strength of Evidence for No Change or Decrease:** An unexpected report of a drop in core CPI could indicate a potential shift, but it lacks strong corroborative evidence from other sources, particularly official releases such as the BLS report.

**Balancing Risks and Evidence:** The historical trend of consistent minor increases in the core CPI, along with the expectation of stable inflation rates, suggests a greater likelihood of no significant dip into negative territory.

Thus, the probability of the core CPI change being 0.0% or less for August 2024, given the current evidence and context, is assessed as moderate to low.

My Prediction: 20.00% being the most likely, with 80.00% confidence. Probability: 20.00%.
