To forecast the probability that diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, we need to consider both historical context and current geopolitical tensions. Here are the factors that I have considered:

1. **Historical Context and Base Rate**: Diplomatic expulsions or recalls are relatively rare and serious events, typically used in reaction to espionage, severe diplomatic infringements, or to make a strong political statement. There have been incidents in the past between countries with maritime or territorial disputes, but these acts often follow a series of escalations beyond diplomatic protests.

2. **Current Situation**: The articles indicate ongoing tensions between China and the Philippines, particularly over incidents in the South China Sea. Despite the provocative actions reported, the Philippines and China seem to prefer addressing these issues through diplomatic protests rather than taking the more severe measure of expelling diplomats or recalling their own as shown by historical precedence and their current strategy of filing diplomatic protests and engaging in talks to manage tensions.

3. **Recent Developments and Indications**: Despite increased tensions and recent incidents involving military airplanes, both countries have engaged in dialogues and established communication channels to improve relations and de-escalate the situation. The recent agreement to establish a hotline between their leaders suggests a preference to manage conflicts and avoid severe diplomatic fallout.

4. **External Influences**: Relations with external countries, such as ongoing collaborations with the US and reactions from ASEAN countries, provide a pressure mechanism that might deter both nations from escalating to the level of expulsions or recalls. The impact of international diplomacy, such as ASEAN's involvement, tends to favor negotiation over confrontation.

5. **Forecasting Stability**: Given the current trajectory where diplomatic protests and negotiations are the main tools being used, and barring any significant new escalation, it is reasonable to predict that both countries will likely avoid any measures like expulsions or recalls, which would represent a significant diplomatic setback.

Considering these aspects, I estimate a fairly low probability for expulsions or recalls happening. The probability adjusted for the ongoing tension yet strong diplomatic ties and communication is slightly heightened compared to a neutral base rate but remains low given the current preference for diplomatic resolution of conflicts.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To predict whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, we need to consider historical tensions, current geopolitical dynamics, and the resolution criteria.

1. **Historical Context & Base Rates**: Look at past incidents of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between China and other countries in similar situations. Historically, South China Sea disputes have led to heightened tensions but not often resulted in diplomatic expulsions or recalls.

2. **Recent Activity**: The current situation is tense. There have been several diplomatic protests by the Philippines against China over aggressive maneuvers by Chinese military aircraft. However, there have been no recent expulsions or recalls despite repeated provocations.

3. **International Context**: Other countries are closely monitoring this dispute, with some, like the U.S., showing support for the Philippines. This international scrutiny may deter both countries from taking the drastic step of expelling or recalling diplomats.

4. **Internal Politics**: Both the Philippines and China manage these disputes with a balance of assertiveness and diplomacy. They have recently implemented measures like direct hotlines to manage tensions, which might reduce the likelihood of expulsions or recalls.

5. **Potential Triggers**: Severe escalation might change this dynamic. However, as of the current date, while tensions are high, there is more effort on de-escalation than outright diplomatic breaks.

In this complex interplay, diplomatic expulsions or recalls would likely occur if the situation escalates dramatically beyond current levels. Given the lack of historical precedent for such actions in similar circumstances, especially with the new hotlines and recent agreements aimed at easing tensions, a significant escalation could provoke such actions but is not extremely probable.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 40.00%, but 32.50% being the most likely. Probability: 32.50%.

To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will occur between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, start by identifying relevant historical context, as well as recent developments in the relationship between these two countries.

Historical Context and Base Rates:
- Diplomatic expulsions or recalls, while not a daily occurrence, have happened on a global scale in response to heightened tensions, military actions, or significant diplomatic disputes. The frequency varies based on the specific nature of diplomatic relationships and the ongoing disputes. 
- The Philippines and China have experienced significant diplomatic strains, largely due to territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and there have been numerous incidents involving military maneuvers, use of force, and aggressive posturing by state actors. 

Recent Developments:
- The Philippines has filed multiple diplomatic protests against China over military aggression and airspace violations, indicating heightened tensions between the two countries.
- Although neither country has expelled or recalled diplomats in response to the current tensions, events like dangerous aerial maneuvers could escalate to more severe diplomatic actions.
- Efforts have been ongoing to manage these disputes diplomatically, with both sides engaging in dialogues and agreements to de-escalate situations, such as the establishment of hotlines.
- Multilateral institutions like ASEAN are involved in mitigating tensions, which could mediate against full-blown diplomatic escalations, like expulsions or recalls.

Evidence Evaluating Probabilities:
1. *Inside View*: The repeated filing of diplomatic protests reflects considerable strain in bilateral relations. Historically, such protests can lead to more severe actions like expulsions if tensions escalate.
2. *Outside View*: Historically, Asian diplomatic contexts such as these do not always escalate to expulsions unless there's direct affront, espionage incidents, or severe diplomatic fallout resulting in public outcry or international interventions.
3. *Current Trend Extrapolation*: The likelihood of expulsions or recalls increases if tensions further escalate or if there are direct state actions against personnel. However, given current trends and emphasis on diplomatic dialogue, full-blown diplomatic expulsions seem a less immediate consequence.
4. *Clashing Forces*: Diplomatic backlash post-military incidents and statements on aggressive stances by both countries suggest potential for heightened actions, yet diplomatic channels remain open, which is a moderating factor.

Weighing Risks and Making Adjustments:
- There is a balance between recent escalations and ongoing diplomatic settling; therefore, changes in the geopolitical landscape, such as involvement from major allies or third-party nations, could influence potential outcomes.
- The potential risk of misjudging lies in either over-relying on current trends without considering new provocations or engagements or underestimating the dampening effect of diplomatic interventions.

By assessing the situation through these lenses, I forecast the probability of the event occurring by the specified date as follows:

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 50.00%, but 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.

To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, it's important to evaluate the current situation and historical patterns of similar diplomatic conflicts.

1. **Evaluation of the Current Situation:**
   - There have been numerous incidents and rising tensions between the Philippines and China, particularly in the South China Sea, as highlighted in various news articles.
   - The Philippines has issued multiple diplomatic protests against China due to alleged aggressive and dangerous maneuvers by Chinese military planes and vessels.
   - President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and other Philippine officials have condemned China's actions, indicating a heightened level of diplomatic tension.
   - Historical resolution patterns in the South China Sea disputes indicate that these incidents often result in prolonged diplomatic engagements rather than immediate expulsions or recalls.

2. **Reference Classes & Historical Trends:**
   - Diplomatic expulsions or recalls are rare, typically occurring in cases of severe diplomatic breakdowns or significant provocations.
   - Historically, tensions between the Philippines and China have not escalated to the extent of resulting in diplomat expulsions, largely due to the complex bilateral relations involving economic dependency and strategic interests.
   - The establishment of direct communication hotlines between China and the Philippines also suggests ongoing diplomatic efforts to prevent escalation.

3. **Analysis of Causal Forces:**
   - On one hand, ongoing maritime disputes and aggressive incidents could escalate tensions.
   - On the other hand, recent dialogues to de-escalate tensions and economic interdependencies could reduce the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls.

4. **Balancing Evidence & Risk of Errors:**
   - There's a need to balance the likelihood of further escalation with the historical tendency of both nations to resolve tensions through diplomatic channels.
   - Recognizing the risks of over-adjustment, given the establishment of communication hotlines, a cautious approach suggests moderate forecasting probabilities.

5. **Current Trends & Developments:**
   - Continuing strong rhetoric against China's actions by the Philippines might suggest hardening stances but is counterbalanced by active steps taken towards dialogue and diplomatic solutions, evidenced in various meetings and agreements.

6. **Final Probability Assessment:**
   - Taking into account all these factors, there is a moderate probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls before September 30, 2024, considering the historical precedent, current diplomatic engagements, and multiple ongoing disputes.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 45.00%, but 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.

To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will occur between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I'll follow a structured analytical approach.

Initially, I look at the reference class of prior diplomatic incidents of this nature between China and other countries or the Philippines with other countries. Diplomatic recalls and expulsions are relatively uncommon, typically occurring when diplomatic protests and other non-escalatory measures fail, or during heightened tense situations that necessitate immediate political signaling without military confrontation.

The core incidents here involve disputes over the South China Sea, a frequent flashpoint between China and its neighbors, including the Philippines. Historical patterns show that while diplomatic protests are common in these scenarios, the step to expulsion or recall is rarer, often reserved for severe diplomatic rows or when relations hit a significant new low.

The current situation involves both severe maritime incidents and ongoing diplomatic engagements. The sources describe significant provocations, such as dangerous aerial maneuvers by China's air force, prompting diplomatic protests from the Philippines. This incident itself is being managed through diplomatic protests and rhetoric at present. Therefore, a cautious approach suggests these existing patterns could continue unless an unexpected significant deterioration in relations occurs.

Next, there's the need to balance current tensions and past patterns. Despite the tensions, both countries have mechanisms in place, like the established hotline between China and the Philippines, aimed at preventing conflicts from escalating into full-blown diplomatic crises. However, the presence of multiple significant unresolved issues suggests a non-zero probability of severe diplomatic actions like expulsion or recall.

Considering these factors:

1. Base rates of diplomatic expulsions among countries with tensions similar to those between China and the Philippines suggest a low overall probability (historically uncommon without further escalation or direct violations).
2. Current trends indicate high diplomatic tensions with increased potential for incidents given recent escalations.
3. No directly comparable predictions from sources like Metaculus or Polymarket were found relevant.

Weighing the relevant factors should avoid extreme confidence but acknowledge a measured chance of escalation. Therefore, my prediction is:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.

Weighing the relevant factors should avoid extreme confidence but acknowledge a measured chance of escalation. Therefore, my prediction is:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.

To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will occur between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I'll follow a structured analytical approach.

Initially, I look at the reference class of prior diplomatic incidents of this nature between China and other countries or the Philippines with other countries. Diplomatic recalls and expulsions are relatively uncommon, typically occurring when diplomatic protests and other non-escalatory measures fail, or during heightened tense situations that necessitate immediate political signaling without military confrontation.

The core incidents here involve disputes over the South China Sea, a frequent flashpoint between China and its neighbors, including the Philippines. Historical patterns show that while diplomatic protests are common in these scenarios, the step to expulsion or recall is rarer, often reserved for severe diplomatic rows or when relations hit a significant new low.

The current situation involves both severe maritime incidents and ongoing diplomatic engagements. The sources describe significant provocations, such as dangerous aerial maneuvers by China's air force, prompting diplomatic protests from the Philippines. This incident itself is being managed through diplomatic protests and rhetoric at present. Therefore, a cautious approach suggests these existing patterns could continue unless an unexpected significant deterioration in relations occurs.

Next, there's the need to balance current tensions and past patterns. Despite the tensions, both countries have mechanisms in place, like the established hotline between China and the Philippines, aimed at preventing conflicts from escalating into full-blown diplomatic crises. However, the presence of multiple significant unresolved issues suggests a non-zero probability of severe diplomatic actions like expulsion or recall.

Considering these factors:

1. Base rates of diplomatic expulsions among countries with tensions similar to those between China and the Philippines suggest a low overall probability (historically uncommon without further escalation or direct violations).
2. Current trends indicate high diplomatic tensions with increased potential for incidents given recent escalations.
3. No directly comparable predictions from sources like Metaculus or Polymarket were found relevant.

Weighing the relevant factors should avoid extreme confidence but acknowledge a measured chance of escalation. Therefore, my prediction is:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.
