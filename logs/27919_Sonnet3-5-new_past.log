Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. An arrest warrant has been issued against González on September 2, 2024, for multiple serious charges including usurpation of functions, forgery, and conspiracy
2. The regime has already arrested over 1,700 opposition members following the disputed election
3. González's campaign chief and other team members have already been detained
4. He has failed to appear for three court summons, which typically triggers automatic arrest orders
5. The government appears to be escalating pressure against opposition figures

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. González appears to be in hiding ("resguardado") to protect himself
2. Only 27 days remain until October 1st deadline
3. International pressure and attention on the case may deter arrest
4. The regime may calculate that arresting him would create more problems than benefits
5. Historical patterns suggest the regime often issues threats without following through

Key Considerations:
- The timeline is very short (less than 4 weeks)
- González appears to have support networks helping him avoid capture
- The regime has demonstrated both capability and willingness to arrest opposition figures
- The arrest warrant is recent and active
- International attention may influence regime behavior

Balancing these factors:
- The existence of a fresh arrest warrant significantly increases probability
- The short timeline and González's apparent preparation for hiding decrease probability
- The regime's recent pattern of arrests suggests increased aggression
- But international scrutiny may cause hesitation

My Prediction: Between 45.20% and 65.80%, with 55.50% being the most likely. Probability: 55.50%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. An arrest warrant has been issued against González on September 2, 2024, for multiple serious charges including forgery, conspiracy, and electoral sabotage
2. The government has already arrested over 1,700 opposition members following the disputed election
3. González has failed to appear for three court summons, which legally justifies arrest
4. His campaign chief and other team members have already been arrested
5. The regime has shown willingness to arrest opposition figures historically
6. There's less than a month until the resolution date, giving authorities time to act

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. González appears to be in hiding, making arrest more difficult
2. International attention and condemnation may deter the government
3. Nine Latin American countries have rejected the arrest warrant
4. The military's stance isn't entirely clear
5. The regime might prefer to avoid escalation given current tensions
6. González has managed to avoid arrest so far despite previous threats

Analyzing the Pattern:
- The government has consistently arrested opposition figures but usually over a longer timeframe
- High-profile opposition leaders sometimes manage to evade arrest through hiding or international protection
- The short timeframe (less than 30 days) reduces probability somewhat
- The explicit arrest warrant increases probability significantly
- Recent mass arrests suggest increased willingness to detain opposition figures

Given the fresh arrest warrant, pattern of arrests, and short timeframe, balanced against González's current hiding status and international protection, I assess a significant but not overwhelming probability.

My Prediction: Between 45.20% and 65.80%, with 55.50% being the most likely. Probability: 55.50%

2. The government has already arrested over 1,700 opposition members following the disputed election
3. González's campaign chief and other team members have already been detained
4. González has refused to appear before court summons, which gives the regime legal justification
5. The Venezuelan government has a history of arresting opposition leaders
6. There is less than a month until the resolution date, giving authorities time to act

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. González appears to be in hiding ("whereabouts unknown")
2. International pressure and attention on the case may deter arrest
3. Nine Latin American countries have rejected the arrest warrant
4. The regime may calculate that arresting González would increase domestic unrest
5. González seems to have significant popular support which could make arrest politically costly

Key Considerations:
- The arrest warrant is very recent (September 2)
- The regime has shown willingness to arrest opposition figures despite international criticism
- González's refusal to appear in court gives legal pretext
- There's still reasonable time before October 1 deadline
- Being in hiding provides some protection but doesn't make arrest impossible

Looking at the pattern of recent arrests and the fresh arrest warrant, combined with the regime's past behavior and González's high-profile status, there appears to be a strong motivation to arrest him. However, his current hiding status and international attention provide some protection.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.80%, with 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

Key evidence for a higher probability:
1. An arrest warrant has been issued for González on September 2, 2024, according to multiple sources, including El Impulso.
2. He faces serious charges including usurpation of functions, forgery, conspiracy, and sabotage.
3. The regime has already arrested over 1,700 opposition figures following the disputed election.
4. His campaign chief and other team members have already been detained.
5. There's a pattern of the Maduro regime arresting opposition leaders.

Key evidence for a lower probability:
1. González has gone into hiding, making arrest more difficult.
2. The question resolution date is less than a month away (October 1).
3. International pressure and attention on the case may deter immediate action.
4. Seven Latin American countries have rejected the arrest warrant.
5. The military's stance isn't clearly supporting Maduro in this case.

Balancing factors:
1. The regime has shown willingness to act despite international criticism.
2. The arrest warrant is very recent (September 2), giving almost a month for enforcement.
3. The regime has significant security apparatus and resources to find González.
4. Previous opposition leaders have been successfully arrested despite being in hiding.

Historical reference class:
- The regime has successfully arrested numerous opposition leaders in similar situations.
- The timeframe (less than a month) somewhat reduces the probability.
- The success rate of enforcing arrest warrants against high-profile opposition leaders in Venezuela has been relatively high.

Considering these factors, while arrest is likely eventually, the short timeframe until October 1 and González's current hiding status somewhat reduce the probability. However, the regime's demonstrated capability and recent pattern of arrests suggest a still-significant chance of detention.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.80%, with 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%
