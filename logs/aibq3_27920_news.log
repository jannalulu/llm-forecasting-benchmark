**Djibouti Offers Ethiopia Access to Port of Tadjoura**
The Foreign Minister of Djibouti, 'We will provide Ethiopia with the opportunity to use the port of Tadjoura, located 100 kilometers from the Ethiopian border.' The minister added that the offer aims to provide Ethiopia with a new trade route to facilitate trade and enhance cooperation between the two countries. This step is part of a broader effort by Djibouti to ease tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia, which has threatened peace and stability in the Horn of Africa region. The proposal is expected to be discussed in more detail during the upcoming summit between Chinese and African leaders, which will be attended by the President of Djibouti Ismail Omar Guelleh, the President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and the Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed. In October 2023, Abiy Ahmed, the Prime Minister of landlocked Ethiopia, called on neighboring countries to negotiate equal access to ports in exchange for sharing control of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. However, at that time, Somalia, Djibouti, and Eritrea did not respond positively to his proposal. In January 2024, Abiy Ahmed and the President of Somaliland, Muse Bihi Abdi, signed a memorandum of understanding to provide Ethiopia with access to ports. As reported by the Adis Standard newspaper, Somaliland granted Ethiopia the opportunity to establish a naval base on its territory in exchange for recognizing it as a sovereign state. It is worth noting that Somaliland is not recognized by the international community, which considers it part of Somalia.

**Djibouti Offers Ethiopia Access to Port of Tadjura**
The Republic of Djibouti has announced its willingness to provide Ethiopia with access to the port of Tadjura. According to Djibouti's Foreign Minister, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, 'Access will be provided to the port of Tadjura, 100 km from the border with Ethiopia.' This move comes after Ethiopia's Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, called on neighboring countries in October 2023 to negotiate equal access to ports in exchange for participation in controlling the 'Renaissance Dam.' However, neither Somalia nor Djibouti nor Eritrea responded positively to the proposal. On January 1, 2024, Ahmed and the head of Somaliland, Muse Bihi Abdi, signed a memorandum of understanding to provide Ethiopia with access to maritime ports. In exchange, Somaliland would receive recognition as a sovereign state. Somaliland is recognized by the international community as part of Somalia, but its authorities declared state sovereignty unilaterally in the spring of 1991. The Somali government has stated its intention to challenge the memorandum between Ethiopia and Somaliland, which it believes violates the country's sovereignty. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has vowed to take action against Ethiopia without hesitation. In response, Ethiopia's senior advisor to the Chief of Staff, Alemeshet Degefe, stated that Addis Ababa is mobilizing troops to prevent attempts to destabilize the country. The African Union's Peace and Security Council has called on Ethiopia and Somalia to exercise restraint, de-escalate, and establish a productive dialogue.

**Turkey-Mediated Somalia-Ethiopia Port Deal Fails to Reach Agreement**
Talks between Somalia and Ethiopia over a contentious Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ethiopia and Somaliland ended without an agreement in Turkey. Despite the failure, the talks are being viewed as a diplomatic success, as they helped prevent direct confrontation or war between the two nations. The talks, mediated by Turkey, aimed to ease tensions that have persisted since the MoU was signed on January 1, 2024. Somalia denounced the agreement as infringing on its sovereignty and subsequently severed diplomatic ties with Ethiopia. Turkish mediation helped to prevent further escalation, as Somalia's Foreign Minister, Elin, said, 'It was a great day.' However, the exact details of the agreement remain unclear, and the dispute is far from being resolved.

Turkey's foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, announced that Ethiopia and Somalia have made 'notable progress' in talks to settle a dispute sparked by Ethiopia's deal with Somaliland.

Somalia has denounced the deal as infringing upon its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has said it's prepared to go to war over it. Fidan proposed an arrangement that would ensure Ethiopia's sea access via Somalia, in return for Ethiopia acknowledging Somalia's territorial integrity and political sovereignty. The foreign ministers of Ethiopia and Somalia expressed hope that the momentum from the talks will result in a solution, with Somalia reaffirming its commitment to protecting its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and unity.

**Egypt's Military Cooperation with Somalia Sparks Concerns of Proxy War with Ethiopia**
Egypt has taken a significant step in the region by signing a military cooperation agreement with Somalia, which has sparked concerns about a potential proxy war between Egypt and Ethiopia in the region. The agreement, which was signed in August 2024, aims to enhance military cooperation and security between the two countries. Egypt has also offered to participate in an African peacekeeping force in Somalia, which is set to start its operations next year. This move has been seen as a response to Ethiopia's agreement with the Somali region of Somaliland, which has been met with opposition from the Somali government. The agreement has been described as a 'declaration of war' by some observers, and has raised concerns about the potential for a conflict in the region. The situation has been further complicated by the fact that Egypt has been involved in a long-standing dispute with Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which has been a major point of contention between the two countries. The Egyptian government has stated that its agreement with Somalia is not related to the dispute with Ethiopia, but some analysts believe that it is an attempt to counterbalance Ethiopia's influence in the region. The situation remains tense, with both countries engaging in diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue. The Egyptian government has stated that it will not tolerate any external interference in Somalia's internal affairs, and has called for the African Union to play a more active role in resolving the conflict. The situation is complex and sensitive, and it remains to be seen how it will unfold.

**Djibouti pens proposal on resolving Somalia-Ethiopia tensions**
Djibouti's Foreign Affairs minister, Mohamoud Ali Youssouf, has announced that his country has penned a proposal to resolve tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia. The proposal includes giving Ethiopia access to the sea and 'a hundred percent port management' through the port of Tadjoura, 100 km from the border with Ethiopia. This move comes after mediation efforts by Turkey failed to yield a substantive agreement. Youssouf stated that the access to the sea for Ethiopia will not be a problem, and the proposal will be discussed with the leaders of the two countries during the upcoming Summit for China and African leaders. This development comes as Somalia has accused Ethiopia of infringement of territorial integrity and sovereignty, leading to the cutting of diplomatic ties.

**Djibouti Planning to Offer Ethiopia Port Access to Ease Tensions**
Djibouti's government plans to offer Ethiopia exclusive access to a new port in an effort to ease tensions between the two nations. The move comes after Ethiopia sparked a diplomatic row in January by proposing to recognize Somaliland as a sovereign nation in exchange for access to a harbour on the Gulf of Aden. Somalia, which considers Somaliland part of its territory, opposed the plan, leading to deteriorating relations between the two countries. According to Bloomberg, Djibouti's gesture aims to 'defuse tensions' and provide Ethiopia with a direct route to the sea. 'The plan is to offer Ethiopia exclusive access to the port,' a government official said, though no further details were provided. The move is seen as a potential solution to the ongoing dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia.

**Ethiopia's Commitment to Peaceful Resolution of Dispute with Somalia**
Ethiopia's Foreign Minister, Taye Atske Selassie, announced on Friday that his country is committed to 'settling the dispute with Somalia peacefully'. He emphasized that cooperation with anti-peace forces is a short-sighted and unproductive strategy, according to the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA). The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry released a statement on Wednesday regarding the developments in Somalia, a few weeks after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signed a military cooperation protocol with his Somali counterpart. Ethiopia had previously signed an agreement with the 'Land of Somalia' government, guaranteeing it a maritime outlet in Somali territory. In a press briefing on Friday, the Ethiopian Foreign Minister discussed the current regional developments, including the disputes between Ethiopia and Somalia. Selassie claimed that 'Ethiopia chose not to retaliate when it was recently attacked by some Somali government officials and anti-government forces seeking to exploit opportunities to destabilize the region'. He added that the 'aggressive rhetoric and threats' will not deter Ethiopia from its commitment to peace in the region, explaining that 'we must redouble our efforts to stop those who are trying to backtrack on the gains achieved against terrorism in this region'. The Foreign Minister also mentioned that Ethiopia is willing to facilitate negotiations with Somalia, first in Nairobi and then in Ankara, where these efforts have made progress and promise results, according to ENA. He stated that these efforts should not be undermined by 'provocative statements', adding that 'collaborating with anti-peace forces in this region is also short-sighted and unproductive'. The Foreign Minister emphasized that 'as the largest country in this region, we do not take lightly our responsibility to protect the safety and ensure the future of our country and region'. The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry stated in a tweet: 'Ethiopia has worked tirelessly for peace and security in Somalia and the region, and for mutual growth, and has strengthened the close ties between the peoples of the region. Ethiopia has participated in numerous discussions to resolve disputes with the Somali government and has made tangible progress in the talks, instead of building on these efforts to achieve peace, the Somali government has collaborated with external parties seeking to destabilize the region'.

**Next Africa: Growing war talk**
The Horn of Africa is witnessing a surge in war talk, fueled by regional proxies and a recent agreement between Ethiopia and Somaliland. Ethiopia's deal to secure direct passage to the Indian Ocean has sparked tensions, with Egypt and Eritrea supporting Somalia. Egypt has sent military hardware to Somalia, while Ethiopia has warned against 'inflaming tension' for short-term objectives. The situation is further complicated by Ethiopia's demand for access to the coast, a dispute over a massive dam on the Nile tributary, and the upcoming end of an African Union military force battling al-Shabaab in Somalia. Western officials fear the situation may escalate in the coming months, particularly with the distraction of an American election. Somalia has threatened to block Ethiopian planes from flying into its territory over the Somaliland spat.

**Ethiopia Appoints New Ambassador to Somaliland Amid Tensions with Somalia**
Ethiopia has appointed a new ambassador to the breakaway region of Somaliland, a move that comes amid heightened tensions between Addis Ababa and Mogadishu. The new ambassador, Teshome Hamito, presented his credentials to the president of Somaliland, Muse Bihi, in Hargeisa, the capital of the region. The two sides discussed security issues in the Horn of Africa and ways to strengthen bilateral relations. This move comes amid a dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia over a deal announced in January, which would have granted Ethiopia access to a port on the Red Sea in exchange for recognizing Somaliland as an independent state. Ethiopia has long sought to regain control over the Red Sea coast, which it lost after Eritrea gained independence in 1993. The Ethiopians claim that their country was subjected to a 'land grab' when Eritrea gained independence, despite the fact that Eritrea was granted independence through the implementation of the Ethiopian Constitution. Somalia has strongly rejected the deal, and protests broke out in the country after the announcement. 'The Red Sea is the natural boundary of Ethiopia,' said Abiy Ahmed, the Ethiopian Prime Minister, in October 2023, adding that Ethiopians cannot live within this 'geographical prison.' Somaliland, which declared independence in 1991, has not been recognized by any international or regional organizations, despite having its own government, currency, and military.

**Somalia issues warning to block flights of Africa's greatest carrier**
Somalia's Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) has issued a warning to Ethiopian Airlines, threatening to block its flights to Somalia by August 23 if current disputes are not resolved. The SCAA criticized the airline for undermining Somalia's sovereignty, including removing references to Somali destinations in favor of airport codes. The dispute is part of a larger conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia, which has escalated in recent months over a controversial port access deal. Somalia views the agreement as illegal and a land grab, and has taken several steps to protest, including expelling Ethiopia's ambassador and closing Ethiopian consulates. The SCAA stated, 'If these issues are not addressed promptly, Somalia would have no choice but to suspend all flights operated by Ethiopian Airlines.'

**Ethiopia's Quest for Influence in the Horn of Africa**
Ethiopia's efforts to increase its influence in the Horn of Africa may ultimately fail, despite its recent successes. Since 2011, Ethiopia has been working to build a dam on the Nile River, which has been completed and is now 74% full. However, Ethiopia has refused to negotiate with Egypt to reach a binding agreement on the dam's operation, which could have a negative impact on Egypt's future, as it relies on the Nile for 95% of its water needs. Ethiopia also lacks a port on the Red Sea, and has had to rely on its neighbor Djibouti for 95% of its trade, which costs it over $1 billion per year. The country's relationship with Eritrea has also been strained since their war in 1998-2000, but has improved since Eritrea helped Ethiopia defeat the Tigray People's Liberation Front in 2022. However, the recent agreement between Ethiopia and the self-declared state of Somaliland to establish a port on the Red Sea has been met with opposition from Eritrea, Djibouti, and Egypt, which sees it as a threat to its national security. The situation in the region is likely to become more tense, as the African Union peacekeeping force is set to end its mission in Somalia at the end of the year, and Ethiopia's military is expected to be withdrawn. The agreement between Ethiopia and Somaliland has also been seen as a move by Ethiopia to gain control over the Red Sea, and has been met with opposition from the Somali government, which has called for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops. 'The agreement is a threat to the stability of the region and the security of the Red Sea,' said a Somali government official. 'We will not accept any agreement that undermines our sovereignty and territorial integrity.'

**Turkey-Mediated Somalia-Ethiopia Port Deal Fails to Reach Agreement**
Talks between Somalia and Ethiopia over a contentious Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ethiopia and Somaliland ended without an agreement in Turkey. Despite the failure, the talks are being viewed as a diplomatic success, as they helped prevent direct confrontation or war between the two nations. The talks, mediated by Turkey, aimed to ease tensions that have persisted since the MoU was signed on January 1, 2024. Somalia denounced the agreement as infringing on its sovereignty and subsequently severed diplomatic ties with Ethiopia. Turkish mediation helped to prevent further escalation, as Somalia's Foreign Minister, Elin, said, 'It was a great day.' However, the exact details of the agreement remain unclear, and the dispute is far from being resolved.

This comes after the second round of Ankara talks, mediated by Türkiye, did not produce an agreement between the two nations. Mohamud added, 'Until this is resolved, there will be no discussions on the seaport or any other issues, as this challenges international law.' Ethiopia expressed confidence that Turkey now understands its 'legitimate interest' in securing dependable sea access, but Somaliland has questioned Turkey's impartiality as a mediator and has established a task force to advance its international recognition efforts.

**Ethiopia-Somaliland Dispute Raises Concerns About Regional Instability**
A dispute between Ethiopia and the self-declared state of Somaliland has raised concerns about a potential regional escalation that could threaten maritime security in the Red Sea region. The dispute centers around Ethiopia's desire to establish a naval base on Somaliland territory. The conflict has a long history, dating back to the British colonization of the region. In 1960, Somaliland gained independence from British colonial rule and merged with the Italian colony of Somalia to form the Somali Republic. However, in 1991, Somaliland declared independence from Somalia, and despite not being recognized by the international community, it has its own government, institutions, and currency. The current dispute began in 2024 when Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a memorandum of understanding that would allow Ethiopia to use one of Somaliland's ports for 50 years in exchange for recognizing Somaliland's independence. The agreement has been met with opposition from Somaliland, which has declared the agreement null and void. The United States and the African Union have called for calm and respect for Somaliland's sovereignty, while Turkey has expressed its commitment to Somaliland's unity and territorial integrity. Egypt has also pledged to support Somaliland and has signed a military cooperation agreement with the country. The agreement has been seen as a move by Egypt to counter Ethiopia's influence in the region and to secure its own interests in the Red Sea. The dispute has raised concerns about the potential for regional instability and the impact on maritime security in the Red Sea.

Ethiopia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Taye Atske Selassie, thanked Turkey for its mediation and reiterated Ethiopia's desire for a reliable access to the sea and from the sea. 'We are waiting with impatience for a continued commitment that will help us resolve the current disputes and restore normal relations', he said.

**Somalia and Ethiopia Talks End Without Agreement, But Progress Made**
The second round of Turkish-mediated talks between Somalia and Ethiopia ended without an agreement on a port agreement signed by Ethiopia with the breakaway region of Somaliland. Despite the lack of an agreement, there is optimism about the progress made. The talks in Ankara aimed to improve relations between the two East African neighbors, which deteriorated in January when Ethiopia agreed to lease a 20-kilometer coastal strip from Somaliland in exchange for recognition of its independence. The Somali government described the agreement as 'unlawful' and responded by expelling the Ethiopian ambassador and threatening to expel thousands of Ethiopian troops stationed in the country to fight against the Al-Shabaab militants. The talks were conducted indirectly between the two foreign ministers, with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan acting as a mediator. Fidan said that the number of issues discussed in the second round of talks had increased significantly compared to the first round, and that there is now a 'convergence on some key principles'. He added that this is a 'significant progress', and that a third round of talks will begin on September 17 with the aim of reaching a 'sustainable and viable' agreement between the two countries. Somali Foreign Minister 'Ahmad Mumin Farah' confirmed progress, saying that the government in Mogadishu is seeking to reach a result that conforms to international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. He added: 'While we are preparing for the third round of talks, we hope that the momentum we have built will lead to a final solution'. Ethiopian Foreign Minister Taye Atskeselasi confirmed that his country is looking to 'continue the participation that will ultimately help us resolve the current disputes and restore natural relations'. A spokesperson for the self-declared Republic of Somaliland refused to comment. Turkey has close relations with both Ethiopia and Somalia, where it trains Somali security forces and provides development aid in exchange for a foothold on the main global shipping route.

**Turkey hosts Somalia, Ethiopia talks on Somaliland port deal**
Turkey is hosting a second round of talks between Ethiopia and Somalia to resolve a dispute over Ethiopia's port deal with Somaliland. This comes as Sierra Leone's president reiterates Africa's demand for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, with an analyst questioning whether such a seat would have veto power. Additionally, a Paralympian is pushing for the voices of the disabled to be heard at a UN summit, while Guinea's capital remains quiet following a sit-down strike for democracy. Vice President Kamala Harris is also facing challenges in her bid for the White House, including misogyny and racism. 'For these and more, tune in to Daybreak Africa!'

**Talks end without agreement about Ethiopia's coastline access via Somaliland**
Diplomats from Somalia and Ethiopia failed to reach an agreement after two days of indirect talks in Turkey, mainly over coastline access for Ethiopia. The talks focused on a dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia over a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed with Somaliland's president, Muse Bihi Abdi. The Somali government strongly rejected the deal, accusing Ethiopia of violating Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said 'there are important convergences on some major principles and specific modalities; this constitutes notable progress,' but the two sides could not bridge their differences. The key sticking points remain unresolved, with Somalia wanting Ethiopia to officially commit to canceling the MOU and Ethiopia wanting Somalia to agree to sea access. The two sides will reconvene in Ankara on September 17 for a third round of talks.

**Ethiopia and Somalia make 'notable progress' as Turkey-mediated dispute talks end without agreement**
Turkey-mediated talks between Ethiopia and Somalia have made 'notable progress' in resolving their maritime dispute. The discussions, centered on Ethiopia's agreement with Somaliland, have expanded in scope and raised hopes for a peaceful resolution. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan announced the progress after a second round of negotiations in Ankara. Ethiopia needs reliable access to the sea, given its population of over 120 million, while Somalia is committed to safeguarding its territorial integrity. Turkey has proposed an arrangement allowing Ethiopia sea access via Somalia, contingent on Ethiopia recognizing Somalia's territorial sovereignty. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for September 17 in Ankara. Former Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke has called on Somalia to reject any deal allowing Ethiopia to establish a military presence in Somali waters. 'We are making notable progress in the talks,' Fidan said, 'and we are hopeful that we can reach a final resolution.'

**Turkey Announces Significant Progress in Somalia-Ethiopia Conflict Talks**
Turkey's Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, announced 'significant progress' in the negotiations between Somalia and Etiopía to resolve the territorial dispute over Etiopía's attempts to access the sea through the Somaliland region. Fidan stated, 'We have achieved a significant convergence between the parties on some basic principles and specific elements. In this sense, significant progress has been made.' The Turkish diplomat acted as a mediator in a meeting between the African countries and made these comments after a joint appearance with his counterparts from Somalia, Ahmed Moallim Fiqi, and Etiopía, Taye Atske Selassie, following the second round of talks in Ankara. Fidan also announced that a third round of contacts will take place in the Turkish capital on August 17. He noted that today, some concrete solutions were discussed that 'aim to eliminate the existing differences and reach an agreement on an acceptable framework for both parties.' The Turkish government has already hosted a negotiating round on the conflict triggered by Etiopía's attempt to acquire a port in the Indian Ocean on the coast of Somaliland in exchange for recognizing the independence of this secessionist Somali region. Fidan stated, 'Our goal is to eliminate the current concerns and resolve the problems in a way that benefits not only Somalia and Etiopía, but the entire region.'

**Turkey to Host Third Round of Somalia-Ethiopia Talks in September**
A new round of negotiations between Somalia and Ethiopia will take place in Ankara on September 17. According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the third round of talks aims to 'bring this process to a successful conclusion'. 'We have completed the second round of negotiations, which began in Ankara on July 1. During the talks, we discussed several specific formulas for resolving the existing differences and agreeing on the frameworks acceptable to both sides. The parties have made significant progress on some basic principles and specific elements. We will meet again in Ankara on September 17 to conduct the third round in the hope of bringing this process to a successful conclusion,' the ministry said in a statement. The talks were initially scheduled for September 2, but were postponed to August 12 after a meeting between Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and the leaders of the two countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently held phone talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, assuring them that Ankara will continue to make efforts to reduce tensions between the two countries and expressing hope for the success of the upcoming talks. The first round of talks between the foreign ministers of Somalia and Ethiopia, Ahmed Moalim Fiki and Taye Atsk-Selassie, took place in Ankara on July 1. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since the Ethiopian government signed an agreement to lease ports with the unrecognized Somaliland. Mogadisho called the deal 'unlawful' and recalled its ambassador from Addis Ababa. On January 1, 2024, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the president of Somaliland, Bih Ali Abdullahi, signed a memorandum of understanding to ensure Ethiopia's access to the ports. According to the Addis Standard newspaper, Somaliland granted Ethiopia the opportunity to establish a naval base on its territory in exchange for recognition as a sovereign state. The Somali authorities stated that they intend to challenge the memorandum, which they believe violates the country's sovereignty. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud stated that Mogadisho will take decisive action against Addis Ababa in connection with the signed agreement.'

**Ethiopia Considers Reconsidering Agreement with Somaliland Amid Somalia's Port Offer**
Ethiopia may reconsider its agreement with Somaliland, a secessionist region, after Somalia, backed by Turkey, made an 'attractive' offer to provide access to a port for its trade. Ethiopia, a landlocked country, seeks to access regional ports to strengthen its trade with the rest of the world. The potential agreement between Somalia and Ethiopia would involve Somalia providing Ethiopia with access to a port, and Ethiopia abandoning its protocol with Somaliland, signed on January 1, 2024. This arrangement aims to resolve long-standing tensions between the two countries and improve their diplomatic relations. According to diplomatic reports, the foreign ministers of Ethiopia and Somalia have provisionally accepted a reconciliation proposal presented by Turkey. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud stated, 'The role of Turkey in promoting dialogue and peaceful resolution of regional problems is essential.' He reiterated Somalia's willingness to engage in economic cooperation and development with Ethiopia, but emphasized that such partnerships must respect Somalia's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, and adhere to international law and norms. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan previously tweeted that he had spoken with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, saying, 'If Ethiopia takes measures to end any threat to Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, it will facilitate the discussion process.' This statement implies that Ethiopia must officially renounce its agreement with Somaliland to move forward with the proposed arrangement. It is not yet clear if Addis-Abeba has renounced the agreement with Somaliland.

**Türkiye Mediates Ethiopian-Somali Talks to Resolve Dispute**
Ethiopian and Somali delegations continued their indirect discussions in Ankara, Turkey, under the mediation of Türkiye, to resolve a dispute between the two countries regarding an agreement between Ethiopia and the Somaliland region. The delegations, led by Turkish diplomats, met separately with each party to seek reconciliation in a common format, as part of a 'long process'. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met with his Ethiopian and Somali counterparts, Taye Atske Selassie and Ahmed Moallim Fiqi, respectively. The dispute stems from Ethiopia's agreement with Somaliland to use its port of Berbera on the Red Sea, which has strained relations between the two countries. Türkiye is working to ease tensions between the two African nations. Ethiopia lost its access to the Red Sea and its main ports after the Eritrean War of Independence, which lasted from 1961 to 1991, resulting in the creation of two separate nations. Since then, Ethiopia has been landlocked, affecting its ability to conduct effective maritime trade.

**Ethiopian and Somali Delegations to Continue Talks in Ankara**
The Ethiopian and Somali delegations are set to continue their talks in Ankara, Turkey, on Tuesday, facilitated by Turkish diplomats. According to Turkish diplomatic sources, the talks will continue on Tuesday morning. The sources stated that the delegations have not met face-to-face yet, and the Turkish delegation is engaging in ' shuttle diplomacy' between the two sides, coordinated by Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. The sources mentioned that separate discussions have been held with each side, and efforts are being made to achieve reconciliation between them within a framework of mutual understanding. Relations between the two neighboring countries have deteriorated since Ethiopia signed a deal with the 'Somali Land' region on January 1, 2023, allowing Addis Ababa to use the region's coastal areas on the Red Sea for commercial and military purposes. Somalia rejected the deal, describing it as 'unlawful and a threat to good neighborliness and sovereignty.' Somalia recalled its ambassador from Ethiopia after the agreement was announced. Ethiopia defended the deal, saying it 'will not affect any party or country.' Ethiopia lost its Red Sea ports in the early 1990s after the Eritrean independence war, which lasted from 1961 to 1991. The 'Somali Land' region, which has not been recognized internationally since it declared independence from Somalia in 1991, is considered a separate administrative, political, and security entity, with the central government unable to exert control over it or its leaders to gain independence.

Somalia and Ethiopia are set to resume talks in Ankara, mediated by Turkey, to address disagreements over a port deal. According to Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, tensions could be resolved if Ethiopia's access to the seas is secured without disrespecting Somalia's territorial integrity and political sovereignty. The contentious agreement, signed in January, grants Ethiopia a 50-year lease on a naval base with access to Somaliland's Berbera port, which Somalia views as 'outrageous' and 'unauthorized.'

**Ethiopia-Somalia Tensions Escalate as Ankara Takes a Stand**
Ethiopia, the country with the largest population without access to the sea, has been trying to regain access to the Red Sea due to economic reasons. It signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Somaliland on January 1 to achieve this goal. However, the agreement sparked a serious reaction from Somalia and the international community due to its promise to recognize Somaliland's independence. Somaliland President Musa Bihi Abdi stated that the agreement would lead to Ethiopia recognizing them as 'independent'. The Somali government recalled its ambassador from Ethiopia in response to the agreement. The Arab League and the African Union also announced that they rejected and condemned the agreement, which aimed to facilitate military base construction and port development in the Red Sea. Ethiopian and Somali Foreign Ministers met in Nairobi on March 9-10 to resolve the crisis between the two countries, but indirect negotiations between the two countries failed to produce a result.

**Turkey Announces New Negotiations Between Somalia and Ethiopia**
Turkey has announced new negotiations between Somalia and Ethiopia, with Ankara holding Ethiopia responsible for the success of the talks. The negotiations, which began on Monday, aim to find a solution to the dispute between the two countries over the agreement with Somaliland. Turkey has been mediating between the two countries, with the goal of promoting itself as a neutral party. However, critics argue that Turkey's involvement may be biased towards Somalia, which could hinder the success of the talks. The dispute between Ethiopia and Somaliland dates back to the 1990s, and has resulted in two wars between the two countries. The current agreement between Ethiopia and Somaliland has been met with opposition from Somalia, which claims that Somaliland has the right to make its own agreements with foreign countries. Turkey's involvement in the negotiations has been welcomed by some, but others have expressed skepticism about its ability to mediate a successful outcome. The talks are expected to be challenging, given the deep-seated differences between the two countries. Turkey's goal is to promote itself as a neutral party and to find a solution to the dispute, but it remains to be seen whether it will be successful.

**Turkey Hosts Second Round of Talks Between Somalia and Ethiopia**
Turkey is hosting a second round of talks between Somalia and Ethiopia, as part of its mediation efforts to resolve a dispute over a port agreement signed by Ethiopia with the breakaway region of Somaliland in January 2023, which allows Somaliland to use the region's coastline on the Red Sea for commercial and military purposes for 50 years. According to a statement by the Turkish presidency, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed by phone, discussing the relations between Turkey and Ethiopia, regional and global developments, and the dispute with Somalia. Erdogan emphasized that Turkey will continue its efforts to end the tension between Somalia and Ethiopia, and that Ethiopia's steps to address Somalia's concerns about its unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity 'will make the process easier.' The Turkish Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, said that the foreign ministers of Somalia and Ethiopia will meet in Ankara this week to discuss the dispute over the port agreement. The relations between the two neighbors, Ethiopia and Somalia, have deteriorated since Ethiopia signed the agreement with Somaliland in January 2023, which allows Somaliland to use the region's coastline on the Red Sea for commercial and military purposes for 50 years, in exchange for Ethiopia's recognition of Somaliland's independence. In April 2023, Somalia announced the expulsion of the Ethiopian ambassador, and closed the Ethiopian consulates in Hargeisa, the largest city and capital of Somaliland, and Galkayo, the capital of the semi-autonomous region of Puntland. Somalia declared that the agreement between Ethiopia and Somaliland is 'unlawful' and constitutes a threat to its sovereignty. Ethiopia defended the agreement, saying it 'will not affect any party or country.' Ethiopia lost its ports on the Red Sea in the early 1990s, after the Eritrean independence war, which lasted from 1961 to 1991. Somaliland, which has not been recognized as a state since its declaration of independence from Somalia in 1991, operates as a separate administrative, political, and security entity, with the central government unable to exert control over the region. Turkey has launched a mediation initiative between Somalia and Ethiopia, and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has held a meeting with his Ethiopian and Somali counterparts in Ankara in July. Fidan said that 'the tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia will end when Ethiopia reaches the seas through Somalia, as long as Ethiopia's recognition of Somalia's territorial integrity and sovereignty is guaranteed.' Turkey has strong relations with both countries and has become a close ally of Somalia, providing schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, and offering scholarships to Somalis to study in Turkish universities. In 2017, Turkey opened its largest military base outside the country in Mogadishu, and in February this year, it signed a defense and economic cooperation agreement with Somalia, which includes the deployment of Turkish naval forces to protect Somalia's coastline, after the two countries agreed on Turkey's operations to explore oil and gas in three areas off Somalia's coast.

**Turkey Mediates Between Ethiopia and Somalia to Resolve Dispute**
The agreement signed on January 1st, which promised to recognize Somaliland, sparked a reaction from Somalia and the international community. In an effort to resolve the crisis between Ethiopia and Somalia, the two countries' foreign ministers were brought together in Nairobi on March 9-10. However, indirect negotiations between the two countries did not yield a result. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali wrote a letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, requesting Turkey's support in resolving the dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia. Following the receipt of the letter, Turkey initiated mediation efforts, led by Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Fidan met with the foreign ministers of Ethiopia and Somalia and hosted them in Ankara on July 1, 2024. The two countries' foreign ministers were photographed together, and they issued a joint statement expressing their intention to resolve their differences peacefully. Fidan then visited Addis Ababa on August 3, as part of the 'Ankara Process', and was received by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. As a result of the diplomatic efforts, it was decided to hold the second round of talks on August 12 instead of September 2 in Ankara. It was stated that the two countries' delegations would be hosted in Ankara on August 12, and that efforts would be made to reach an agreement by taking into account the needs, concerns, and approaches of the two friendly countries.

**Turkey Facilitates Diplomatic Efforts to Resolve Etiyopya-Somali Dispute**
Following a letter from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, expressing Turkey's support for the country in its dispute with Somalia, diplomatic efforts have been underway to resolve the issue. The second round of talks between the two countries has been rescheduled for August 12 in Ankara, instead of September 2. Sources indicate that the talks will focus on finding a mutually acceptable solution, taking into account the needs, concerns, and approaches of both Somalia and Ethiopia. Turkey, which has the trust of both countries, has been facilitating the diplomatic process. In this context, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has met with officials from both countries and hosted a meeting between the two foreign ministers in Ankara on July 1. The meeting resulted in a joint statement by the parties, expressing their intention to resolve the issue peacefully. Turkey's efforts to establish a sustainable dialogue channel between the two countries have been welcomed by the international community, and the country has also maintained contacts with other regional countries, securing their support for the process. Ethiopia, which has the largest population without access to the sea, has been seeking to regain access to the Red Sea due to economic reasons. The country signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Somaliland on January 1, which included a promise of recognition of Somaliland's independence. However, this move was met with criticism from Somalia and the international community. Somali President Musa Bihi Abdi stated that the agreement would lead to Ethiopia recognizing Somaliland as an independent state. In response, the Somali government recalled its ambassador from Ethiopia. The Arab League and the African Union have also condemned the agreement, stating that it would pave the way for military bases and port development in the Red Sea.

**Turkey's Mediation Efforts Continue in Ethiopia-Somalia Dispute**
Following a letter from Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, requesting Turkey's support in resolving the dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia, Turkey's diplomatic efforts have continued. Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's visit to Ethiopia and subsequent meetings with Somali officials have resulted in the second round of talks being rescheduled from September 2 to August 12 in Ankara. Sources indicate that the diplomatic process will continue, with both countries being hosted in Ankara, and their needs, concerns, and approaches being taken into consideration to achieve a consensus. Turkey, which has the trust of both countries, has initiated mediation efforts under the instructions of President Erdoğan. In this context, Foreign Minister Fidan has held meetings with Ethiopian and Somali officials, and on July 1, he hosted the foreign ministers of both countries in Ankara. After the meeting, the parties announced their intention to resolve the issue 'peacefully' through a joint statement and committed to meeting again in Ankara on September 2. However, the meeting has been rescheduled to August 12. Turkey's efforts to establish a sustainable dialogue channel between the parties, in the face of increasing tensions in the region, have been met with international acclaim.

Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a mutual understanding on January 1, which included Somaliland's recognition. However, this move was met with strong criticism from Somalia and the international community. Somali President Musa Bihi Abdi stated that Ethiopia would recognize Somaliland as an independent state upon the completion of the agreement. In response, the Somali government recalled its ambassador from Ethiopia. The Arab League and African Union have also condemned the agreement, stating that it would pave the way for military bases and port development in the Red Sea. The foreign ministers of Ethiopia and Somalia met in Nairobi on March 9-10 to resolve the crisis, but indirect negotiations between the two countries failed to yield a result.

**Erdogan Discusses Regional Developments with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed**
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Saturday, discussing bilateral relations and regional and global developments. Erdogan emphasized that Turkey continues to work towards resolving the tension between Somalia and Ethiopia. He stated that Ethiopia's steps to address Somalia's concerns about its unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity would ease the path forward. Erdogan also criticized Israel for committing 'genocide' in Gaza and highlighted Ethiopia's support for the Palestinian cause as a crucial step towards achieving lasting peace. The relations between Ethiopia and Somalia have deteriorated since Ethiopia signed a deal with the 'Somaliland' region in January 2023, granting permission for Ethiopia to use the region's coast on the Red Sea for commercial and military purposes. Somalia rejected the deal, calling it 'unlawful and a threat to its sovereignty.' The Ethiopian government defended the deal, stating that it would not affect any party or country. Ethiopia lost its ports on the Red Sea in the early 1990s following the Eritrean independence war, which lasted from 1961 to 1991. The 'Somaliland' region, which has not been recognized as a sovereign state since its declaration of independence from Somalia in 1991, considers itself a separate administrative, political, and security entity. The Turkish government has been mediating efforts in this regard, with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan meeting with his Ethiopian counterpart Taye Atske-Silasie and Somali counterpart Ahmed Awad in Ankara on July 1. The two ministers expressed their intention to reach a solution and agreed to hold a second round of talks in Ankara on September 2.

**Turkey to Host Talks Between Somalia and Ethiopia to Ease Tensions**
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan announced that the Foreign Ministers of Somalia and Ethiopia will meet in Ankara next week to discuss the dispute over the Berbera port agreement on the Red Sea, which Ethiopia signed with the separatist 'Land of Somalia' region earlier this year. Turkey is mediating the talks between the two countries, whose relations have been strained since Ethiopia agreed to lease 20 kilometers of 'Land of Somalia's' coastline in exchange for recognition of its independence. Somalia described the agreement as 'unlawful' and subsequently expelled the Ethiopian ambassador, and threatened to expel thousands of Ethiopian troops stationed in the country to fight against rebels. The two foreign ministers met in Ankara in July, with Fidan in attendance, to discuss the dispute, and agreed to hold another round of talks. Fidan said during a press conference in Istanbul that a second round of talks between Somalia and Ethiopia will take place in Ankara next week, adding that 'tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia will end as soon as Ethiopia reaches the sea through Somalia, as long as it recognizes the unity of Somalia's territory and its political sovereignty.' This announcement comes a week after Fidan's visit to Addis Ababa and his meeting with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Turkish-Ethiopian relations are thriving, with trade between the two countries increasing significantly, from around $27 million in 2000 to around $345 million in 2023, with a target of reaching $1 billion in the coming years.

**Turkish Foreign Minister to Visit Ethiopia for Talks on Bilateral Relations and Regional Issues**
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan will visit Ethiopia on Saturday to hold talks with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Foreign Minister Taye Assefa. According to diplomatic sources, Fidan will discuss bilateral relations, reconciliation between Ethiopia and Somalia, and regional issues. Turkey's diplomatic relations with Ethiopia are of great importance in Turkish politics and its partnership with Africa, dating back to before the establishment of the republic. Turkey opened its embassy in Addis Ababa in 1926, and the Ethiopian embassy in Ankara in 1933, but it was closed in 1984 due to a change in the government, before being reopened in 2006. Turkish-Ethiopian relations have deepened through regular contacts and reciprocal visits on a positive and friendly basis. The trade volume, which was around $27 million in 2000, reached $345 million in 2023, with a target of reaching $1 billion in the next five years. Turkey is one of the top four countries in Ethiopia in terms of direct foreign investment, and 70 Ethiopian and 250 Turkish companies participated in the Turkish-Ethiopian Business Forum held in Istanbul in May 2024. Relations between Ethiopia and Somalia have deteriorated since Ethiopia signed an agreement with the 'Somali Land' region on January 1, 2023, allowing Addis Ababa to use the region's coast on the Red Sea for commercial and military purposes. Somalia rejected the Ethiopian deal with 'Somali Land', describing it as 'unlawful and a threat to good neighborliness and sovereignty', and recalled its ambassador to Ethiopia after the announcement. The Ethiopian government defended the agreement, saying it 'will not affect any party or country.' Ethiopia lost its ports on the Red Sea in the early 1990s after the Eritrean independence war, which lasted from 1961 to 1991. The 'Somali Land' region, which has not been recognized since its declaration of independence from Somalia in 1991, acts as an independent administrative, political, and security entity, with the government unable to exert control over the region or its leader to gain independence. According to diplomatic sources, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan received the special representative of the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Mulatu Chomi Vertu, and the Foreign Minister, Siyasie, where the Ethiopian side requested Turkish support in its dispute with Somalia. Turkey has initiated mediation efforts at the instruction of Erdogan, where Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met with his Ethiopian and Somali counterparts in Ankara on July 1, in the framework of these efforts. The two ministers agreed to reach a solution and promised to hold a second round of talks on September 2 in Ankara, according to the sources.
