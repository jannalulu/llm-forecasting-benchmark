**SCC Quarterfinals: Nakamura Takes Off In Bullet, Sets Up Semifinal Match Vs. Firouzja In Paris**
GM Hikaru Nakamura has secured a spot in the Speed Chess Championship 2024 Finals by defeating GM Ian Nepomniachtchi in the Quarterfinals with a 14.5-9.5 score. Nakamura dominated the bullet games to win the match, despite Nepomniachtchi taking a three-point lead in the 5+1 segment. 'Ian Nepomniachtchi is just pouncing all over Hikaru Nakamura. He is not letting him escape,' said GM Robert Hess. However, Nakamura changed his game and strategy in the 3+1 segment, winning five out of the six games to even the score. He then took the lead in the bullet portion, winning six out of the seven games. Nakamura will face GM Alireza Firouzja in the Semifinals, which will be held in Paris in September. 'I think it'll be really exciting to play Alireza because, as I've probably said 10 times already, he is the one player who I think is at the same level as Magnus and myself in bullet,' said Nakamura.

**Chess: Alireza Firouzja wins Sinquefield Cup unbeaten and jumps to world No 5**
Alireza Firouzja, a 21-year-old Iranian-French chess player, has won the Sinquefield Cup unbeaten, jumping to world No 5. He totalled 6/9, half a point ahead of US champion and world No 3, Fabiano Caruana. Firouzja's victory was pivotal, particularly his marathon win against Caruana in round one, where he deliberately kept the position complex and tense until Caruana collapsed in time pressure. Firouzja has now beaten Ding Liren, the world champion, four times in their last five meetings. Ding Liren finished next to last on 3.5/9, with a minus score for the fifth classical tournament in a row, a negative record for any world champion. The World Rapid and Blitz championships will be staged on Wall Street, New York, on 26-31 December, with Magnus Carlsen defending his crowns against a challenge led by Hikaru Nakamura and Caruana. Britain's problem solvers, John Nunn, Jonathan Mestel, and David Hodge, won the World Solving Championship in Latvia, Britain's first success in this competition since 2007.

**CHESS CORNER: Backwards and forwards**
France's Alireza Firouzja defeated America's Wesley So in a chess match, employing a winning plan that involved capturing So's bishop with his rook, forcing So's b7 pawn to abandon the 'b' file, and allowing Firouzja's b6 pawn to promote. Firouzja's bishop then slid back to b4, blocking So's rook's line of fire. Firouzja has been on a roll, winning the St. Louis Rapid and Blitz tournament and taking home $40,000. He is also competing in the prestigious Sinqquefield Cup, where he could win an additional $100,000. Firouzja has been an elite player since 2019, achieving the second-highest chess ranking in the world in 2021. Magnus Carlsen has even called him a potential world chess champion. Firouzja has also made headlines for his decision to quit the Iranian Chess Federation in 2019 due to its policy against competing against Israeli players, and for becoming a French citizen in 2021. 'The farther backward you can look,' Winston Churchill once said, 'The farther forward you can see.' Firouzja's win is a testament to his ability to look back and learn from his opponents, and to look forward to new challenges and opportunities. 'As white's advanced pawn on b6 promotes, black is lost,' Firouzja's win is a reminder that sometimes, the simplest solutions are the best ones. 'But So seems to have locked the queen-side pawns by linking black's c6 bishop arm in arm with its pawn on b7, which impedes white's b6 pawn.' Firouzja's win is a reminder that even the most seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome with the right strategy and determination.

**2024 Sinquefield Cup Round 7: Firouzja Beats World Champion, Grows Lead to Full Point**
GM Alireza Firouzja defeated GM Ding Liren at the 2024 Sinquefield Cup, increasing his lead to a full point with two rounds to go. Firouzja's plan worked like clockwork, as Ding released the tension in the center due to time-pressure miscalculation. Firouzja reflected, 'I was very happy because he was getting low on time... It was not a surprise that he blundered. It's a very difficult position to have over-the-board.' Meanwhile, GM Nodirbek Abdusattorov scored his first classical victory of the GCT, defeating GM Wesley So with a combination of strategic and tactical ideas. Abdusattorov's preparation reaped rewards, and he shared his mindset during the game: 'At this point, I was very confident with my position, but, you know, we saw many, many kind of saves this tournament, unbelievable saves.'

**Alireza Firouzja's Comeback: From Disappointment to Victory**
The Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz tournament, held from August 12 to 16, 2024, was the fourth stop on the Grand Chess Tour. The tournament consisted of a nine-round rapid and an 18-round blitz section. In the rapid section, players received two points for a win and one point for a draw, while in the blitz section, wins were worth one point and draws half a point. The top three players after the first three days, each playing three rapid games with 25 minutes of thinking time and 10 seconds of increment per move, were Jan Nepomnjaschtschi, Alireza Firouzja, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, who scored 11 out of 18 possible points. They were followed by four American players, including Lewon Aronjan, Wesley So, Hikaru Nakamura, and Leinier Dominguez, who scored 9 points each. Fabiano Caruana, the 31-year-old defending champion, and Nodirbek Adusattorow scored 8 points each, while Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa trailed behind with 4 points. In the blitz section, Firouzja took the lead after the first nine rounds and maintained it until the end, scoring 23 points and securing $40,000 of the $175,000 prize fund. Nakamura climbed to third place in the overall standings with 19.5 points, while Aronjan and Vachier-Lagrave finished fourth and fifth with 19 points each. Nepomnjaschtschi fell back in the blitz section and shared sixth and seventh place with Caruana, who scored 18 points. The bottom three players were Adusattorow, Dominguez, and Praggnanandhaa, who scored 16, 15.5, and 12 points respectively. Firouzja's victory puts him in contention for his second Grand Chess Tour title after 2022. The 22-year-old Firouzja, who was born in Bābol, Iran, and lives in Chartres, France, surpassed the ELO rating of 2,800 in 2021 as the youngest player to do so. In recent years, he has also been involved in fashion design and has gained attention for his extravagant outfits. The chess goddess Caissa rarely forgives lack of dedication to the game, but it seems she has now blessed Firouzja with success.
