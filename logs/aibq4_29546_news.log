**Biggest backers of Oregon's Measure 118 are Californians with tech ties**
Measure 118, a ballot measure that would tax large companies and distribute the money among Oregon residents, is being widely opposed by Oregon businesses, organizations, and politicians. However, it is being supported by Californians in the tech industry who advocate for universal basic income. The measure proposes a 3% tax on sales exceeding $25 million, generating an estimated $7 billion annually, which would be distributed as $1,600 to every Oregon resident. Opponents argue that it would devastate the state's economy, while supporters, including Josh Jones, a cryptocurrency millionaire, and Gisele Huff, the mother of a former Tesla engineer, believe it would help Oregonians invest in their communities. Oregon campaign finance data shows that the biggest backers of Measure 118 are California residents who support basic universal income.

**Oregon citizens to vote on five measures in November**
Oregonian voters will see five new measures on the ballot in November. Measure 115 would allow elected officials to be impeached with a two-thirds vote by each House, rather than through recall votes. Measure 116 would establish an Independent Public Service Compensation Commission to determine the salaries of public officials, including the Governor and state legislators. Ranked choice voting, already established in Portland and Multnomah County, would be brought to the rest of the state with Measure 117. Measure 118 would introduce a new corporate tax, increasing the minimum tax by 3% for corporations making over $25 million in sales, with the goal of providing a basic universal income of $1,600 per year to all Oregon residents. Measure 119 would require cannabis retailers to remain neutral in labor disputes and sign a labor peace agreement to receive licenses or certifications, giving cannabis workers an easier way to unionize. 'This would provide a basic universal income for all Oregon residents,' said the goal of Measure 118. 'It is projected that it would provide all residents with about $1,600 each year.'

**Measure 118 promises Oregonians more money, but it could come at a cost**
Ballot Measure 118 in Oregon promises to redistribute money from large corporations to Oregonians, with a potential $1,600 yearly payment to each resident. However, opponents, including businesses, politicians, and labor groups, argue that the measure could increase prices, slow economic growth, and have a negative impact on the state budget. Supporters, including proponents of universal basic income, argue that the measure would create a more fair taxing structure for corporations and provide a significant redistribution of wealth to Oregonians. The measure's impact on the state budget and the potential costs of the payments are still unclear, and voters will have to weigh the benefits against the potential drawbacks when casting their ballots.

**Oregon Ballot Measure Targets Big ISPs, Others to Fund $1,600 Annual Payment to State Residents**
A November ballot initiative in Oregon, known as Measure 118, aims to provide a 'universal basic income' of $1,600 per year to every Oregon resident, funded by a 3% gross receipts tax on corporations with annual sales exceeding $25 million in Oregon. The tax would target large corporations like Comcast, Google, and Intel, which pay little to no state income tax. According to the State of Oregon's fiscal impact analysis, the measure would affect about 2,000 of Oregon's 64,000 corporations, most of which are multinational and based outside the state. Advocates for the measure say it would level the playing field between large and small Internet Service Providers, promote a more competitive broadband market, and help address the affordability crisis, including the rising cost of internet access. 'It's not fair that huge corporations like Comcast pay an effective tax rate of 0.11% while Oregonians and Oregon small businesses pay an Oregon tax somewhere between 4.75% and 9.9% in taxes! Oregon Rebate levels the playing field,' the campaign website notes.

**Oregon's cash giveaway**
Oregon's Measure 118 proposes a universal basic income, where residents would receive a lump sum of $3,000 per family. Proponents, such as Antonio Gisbert, claim it would reduce child poverty by 26%. However, critics argue that the funding for this initiative would come from a 3% tax on sales for businesses making over $25 million, which would increase prices for consumers. According to the Tax Foundation, this would result in a combined state and local tax bill of 56% for businesses, and 77% including federal taxes. This would lead to increased costs for consumers, and potentially even encourage illegal aliens to sign up for the giveaway. A more effective alternative would be to allow businesses to retain their earnings and invest in their operations, leading to economic growth and job creation.

**Several local and state measures in the hands of voters**
Oregon voters are deciding on several local and state measures in the 2024 general election. Measure 117, which would implement ranked choice voting, has the backing of the Oregon League of Women Voters and the Oregon American Federation of State and Municipal Employees. However, more than a dozen county clerks and the Oregon Republican Party oppose the measure, citing concerns about cost and reliance on the Secretary of State's Office. Measure 118 would impose a three-percent tax on in-state sales by corporations in Oregon, with supporters arguing it would bring hundreds of millions back into the economy and opponents warning of price hikes for everyday items. Measure 20-362, which seeks voter input on redistricting for Lane County, has created a divide among county commissioners, with some arguing it would prevent multiple commissioners from coming from Eugene and others opposing it due to concerns about cost and public input. Additionally, voters will decide on measures 20-359, 20-360, and 20-361, which would repeal sections of the Lane County Charter related to spending limits, park development, and a public safety income tax. 'This is when we have elections that are more than two people running. If their first choice is eliminated, then they still have a backup voice in the election. So it's a backup vote. There's a majority vote when that happens,' said Barbara Klein of the Oregon League of Women Voters. 'It's a political move to have maps changed ahead of the 2026 election,' said Commissioner Laurie Trieger, opposing Measure 20-362.

**Oregonians to Vote on Universal Basic Income, Ranked Choice Voting**
Oregonians will vote on five ballot measures, including Universal Basic Income (UBI) and ranked-choice voting (RCV). The UBI proposal, known as the Oregon People's Rebate, would provide a family of four with $6,400 annually, funded by a 3% tax on corporations with over $25 million in annual sales. However, opponents, including Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek, argue it would 'punch a huge hole' in the state's budget and put essential services at risk. According to the Legislative Revenue Office, the measure would create a $2 billion budget shortfall within five years. Proponents claim it would 'force giant corporations to pay their fair share in taxes.' RCV, which would be the first statewide measure to be referred by a state legislature, would allow voters to rank candidates from most to least preferred, increasing voter and candidate participation, moderating partisanship, and reducing wasted votes. Opponents worry it is costly, complicated, and hard for voters to understand, inhibiting voter participation and leading to ballot errors.

**This West Coast blue state could tax big companies and guarantee basic income for its residents  --  but is it a good idea?**
Oregon is considering a ballot measure, known as the Oregon Rebate, which would provide an annual rebate of $1,600 to every resident in the state. The rebate would be funded by increasing the minimum tax on corporations with in-state sales of more than $25 million by 3%. Supporters of the measure, including former neuroscientist-turned-organizer Antonio Gisbert, argue that it would cut child poverty in half and boost the state economy. However, Democratic Governor Tina Kotek has expressed opposition, stating that it 'would punch a huge hole in the state budget and put essential services for low-wage and working families at risk.' The measure is an example of universal basic income at work and, if passed, would represent one of the most ambitious programs of its kind in the U.S.

**Progressive groups withdraw endorsements of Oregon Measure 118**
At least four progressive organizations have withdrawn their support for Oregon Measure 118, a ballot measure that aims to hike taxes on businesses and distribute the proceeds among all Oregonians. The measure, which proponents say would give about $1,600 annually to all Oregonians, has been criticized by opponents for potentially raising prices and blowing a hole in the state's budget. The organizations that withdrew their support include the Oregon Working Families Party, the farmworkers union PCUN, Democratic Socialists of Eugene, and LIUNA (Laborers Local 483). According to Antonio Gisbert, chief petitioner for Measure 118, the organizations that withdrew their support were pressured by elected officials who are beholden to corporate donors. Annie Naranjo-Rivera, state director of the Working Families Party, stated that the party still supports a wealth tax but that Measure 118 has too many problems, and they now have a neutral stance on the measure. The campaign arm of PCUN has left Measure 118 off its endorsement list, while it's supporting other ballot measures.

**Opinion: Why Measure 118 is a 'well-intentioned, but naïve and misguided approach'**
The author opposes Ballot Measure 118, a proposal to impose a 3% tax on businesses with Oregon sales above $25 million, raising an estimated $6.5 billion a year. The funds would be redistributed as an annual $1,600 check to every Oregonian, regardless of age or income. The author argues that this approach is 'naïve and misguided' because it does not address the root causes of economic insecurity in Oregon, where over 1 million people (27% of the population) live with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. The author suggests that the measure would actually harm some Oregonians by pushing them above the threshold for public programs like healthcare, housing, and nutrition. Instead, the author calls for a long-term solution to address the complex issues contributing to economic insecurity, including the tax code, public agencies, and community responsibility.

**Opinion: 'Yes' on Measure 118 would improve the lives of everyday Oregonians, small businesses**
Measure 118 is a ballot measure that aims to address the issues of stagnant wages, high taxes for small businesses and individuals, and the lack of corporate tax contributions in Oregon. The measure will tax large corporations with revenue over $25 million in Oregon at 3 pennies per dollar, with the generated revenue distributed to every person in Oregon, including kids and seniors, as a rebate of about $1,600 per person. This will help individuals pay for monthly costs or save for the future. The tax will not affect small businesses, and the revenue generated will benefit the local and state economies. According to the Legislative Revenue Office, only 1.8% of corporations will pay the new tax, and the tax burden for small businesses will remain the same. The measure will not cause mass inflation, with a potential increase in costs of up to 1.3% over five years. With each person getting $1,600 per year, they will still be significantly better off after paying the potential increased costs. As stated by the author, 'Measure 118 is the right approach to provide a much needed tax break or rebate to everyday Oregonians and small business owners.'

**Oregon's Measure 118: A Proposed Stimulus Check of Up to $1,600 per Resident**
A proposed measure in Oregon, known as Measure 118, promises to provide an annual stimulus check of up to $1,600 per resident. The measure, which will be put to a vote in November, aims to provide significant financial support to eligible residents, including both taxpayers and dependents. According to its proponents, the measure represents an opportunity to boost the state's economy, although it has sparked debate. The measure proposes that each qualified resident receive an annual stimulus check of $1,600, which would mean that a family of four could receive up to $6,400 per year. The goal is to help improve the financial situation of families, either through a cash rebate or a refundable tax credit. The payments would be made over three consecutive years to alleviate the economic burden on low- and middle-income households. To be eligible, each resident must have spent at least 200 days per year in Oregon, ensuring that the benefit reaches those who truly live and contribute in the region. The measure proposes that the funds for these stimulus checks come from a 3% tax on the annual sales of large corporations with revenues over $25 million. This proposal has generated significant discussion, as it involves a change in Oregon's tax landscape. Proponents argue that this tax rate would allow the checks to be funded without imposing additional burdens on taxpayers.

**Measure 118 supporters ramp up messaging, while being wildly outspent**
Measure 118, a ballot measure in Oregon, has emerged as the hardest-fought this year, with opponents spending almost $12 million on ads attacking it. However, proponents argue that the measure would rebate $1,600 to every Oregonian every year and $6,400 for families, making it a tax cut for Oregonians. Antonio Gisbert, one of the authors of Measure 118, believes that the flood of messaging from opponents could backfire, saying 'What's the Shakespeare line? 'Doth protest too much?' Proponents argue that large corporations are paying too little in taxes in Oregon and that the measure would redistribute corporate wealth to residents who need it more. Opponents argue that businesses would simply pass the tax on to customers, raising prices in Oregon. State analysts estimate that the tax would increase prices by 1.3% by 2030 and slightly slow employment growth.

**2024 Oregon ballot measure breakdown**
Oregonians will be voting on several ballot measures in 2024, which could have a significant impact on the state's politics and economy. Measure 115 would establish an impeachment process for elected state officials, while Measure 116 would create a commission to set salaries for statewide officials and legislative representatives. Measure 117 would implement ranked-choice voting, which proponents argue reduces polarization and encourages voter participation. Measure 118, a 3% tax on corporations with sales over $25 million, has sparked sharp divisions, with opponents claiming it would jeopardize the state budget and cause price increases. However, supporters, such as Joey Barbey, a UO junior, believe it would provide a significant rebate to Oregon citizens, estimated at $1,600 on average.

**Oregon Measure 118 is Heading for Failure at the November 5 Polls**
Measure 118, a proposed 3% tax hike on companies with annual sales above $25 million, is heading for failure according to a poll by the Northwest Progressive Institute. While 29% of voters favor the measure, 54% are opposed, and 17% are undecided. Critics, including Deputy Director of the Oregon Center for Public Policy Daniel Hauser, argue that Measure 118 is poorly designed and will reduce funds for state schools, child and health care, and other essential services. Hauser notes that organizations that originally endorsed the measure have since changed their allegiance due to these concerns. In contrast, proponents claim that the measure will put $1,600 annually into Oregon taxpayers' pockets and bolster local economies. However, the campaign is heavily opposed by grocers and large corporations, with a $15.9 million campaign against it.

**Oregon's universal basic income measure headed for defeat, ranked choice elections measure faces even odds of passage or rejection, poll finds**
A proposed Oregon ballot measure to provide every resident with $1,600 per year through corporate tax increases is likely to be defeated. However, a measure to implement ranked-choice voting in federal and state offices in Oregon is evenly matched for passage or rejection. The poll also found that the race for Oregon's next attorney general is close, with Democrat Dan Rayfield leading Republican Will Lathrop by 5 percentage points, a margin within the poll's margin of error. According to the poll, 46% of voters support Rayfield, while 41% favor Lathrop.

The program would be funded by a 3% tax on annual sales of companies with revenues over $25 million. While progressive groups and unions support the measure, citing its potential to provide relief to workers and local economies, business owners and some politicians oppose it, arguing that the tax would lead to increased prices.

**Oregon's Measure 118: A Proposal for Annual Stimulus Checks**
A new legislative proposal in Oregon, known as Measure 118, is gaining attention as the November elections approach. This initiative aims to provide annual stimulus checks of up to $1,600 to state residents, seeking to provide significant financial support to those who qualify. According to projections from the Legislative Revenue Office (LRO), households with incomes below $40,000 would eliminate their state tax obligation after implementing this measure. To fund the program, a 3% tax on annual sales of companies with incomes over $25 million is proposed. However, Measure 118 has sparked intense debate. Progressive groups and unions support it, arguing that it will benefit the working class and strengthen local economies. Critics from the business sector and some politicians, including Democrats and Republicans, warn that the tax could increase prices for consumers. The measure's potential benefits and drawbacks are being discussed, with supporters highlighting the increase in residents' purchasing power. Opponents express concerns about the economic impact on the state.

**Rebate Debate**
Measure 118, the Oregon Rebate, would provide all Oregon residents with a $1,600 annual rebate through a three percent minimum sales tax increase on corporations with over $25 million in Oregon sales. Critics warn that the rebate could come at the cost of vital public services, while proponents argue that it would help those in need and stimulate the economy. Angela Wilhelms, chair of the No on Measure 118 campaign, says, 'Our broad coalition opposing Measure 118 includes hundreds of Oregon businesses, labor unions, social justice advocates, responsible-government organizations and elected officials from both major parties.' Antonio Gisbert, chief petitioner for Measure 118, says, 'All humans are deserving of the same amount of dignity and economic prosperity. Our goal is to get corporations to start paying their fair share in taxes.' Critics argue that the measure is poorly drafted and would result in unintended consequences, such as draining funds from vital budgets for services like schools or health care. Gisbert disagrees, saying that the rebate is revenue-neutral and will only come after paying for public services. The measure will give all Oregonians a rebate, regardless of their income, which opponents argue could take cash from those who need it most.

**Opinion: Vote 'no' on Measure 118's destructive tax**
Measure 118, a tax proposal on the November ballot, would raise prices for Oregonians, erode business competitiveness, and blow a billion-dollar hole in the state general fund. The tax, a 3% sales tax on businesses exceeding $25 million per year, would be passed along to consumers, hitting low-income households the hardest. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office, taxes on general consumption have a regressive impact on the distribution of the tax burden. Angela Wilhelms, president and CEO of Oregon Business & Industry, said, 'Measure 118 would inflict economic pain by imposing a 3% tax on Oregon sales exceeding $25 million per year.' The measure would decrease state general fund revenue by billions of dollars per biennium, according to the LRO, and create an incentive to move production outside of the state, taking jobs and incomes with it. An unprecedented coalition, including Oregon businesses, labor unions, and elected officials, have lined up in opposition to Measure 118.

**Opinion: Vote 'yes' on Measure 118 for economic justice**
Measure 118, the Oregon Rebate, is a proposal to provide a direct payment of $1,600 to every Oregonian every year, or $6,400 a year for a household of four. The rebate is paid for by increasing the corporate revenue tax rate to 3% on every dollar over $25 million. Opponents claim that this will harm businesses, but the author argues that it will only impact 1.9% of corporations operating in Oregon, mostly out-of-state corporations like Comcast and Kroger. The author argues that corporations are fueling their cash empires at the expense of everyone else and that it's time to ask: 'when is enough enough?' The author concludes that voting 'yes' on Measure 118 is a vote to restack the deck in favor of economic justice, fairness and accountability. 'We are the workers, consumers and small business creators that fuel the success of industry and the economy - not the other way around.'

**1600 Stimulus Payment: How would you become eligible to receive this check every year?**
Measure 118, a proposed initiative in Oregon, aims to provide a $1,600 rebate to every resident, including minors and dependents, who have lived in the state for more than 200 days. According to the State of Oregon's fiscal impact analysis, the median rebate over the first three years is projected to be $1,605. The rebate can be claimed as cash or as a fully refundable tax credit, providing significant benefits for Oregon families and the state's economy. The Legislative Revenue Office estimates that households earning less than $40,000 will eliminate their Oregon tax liability entirely once Measure 118 is enacted. The introduction of Measure 118 is expected to inject over $6 billion into Oregon's economy annually, fostering economic growth and sustainability. Small business owners and their employees will also receive rebates, helping to level the playing field between local enterprises and large corporations. 'This approach aims to support the growth of small businesses by reducing their tax burdens relative to larger corporations,' said the proposed initiative. Most residents are likely to opt for the rebate as a tax credit, though the option to receive it in cash remains available.

**Voter Backing for Oregon Measure 118 Is Losing Support**
Measure 118, a proposal to tax big corporations 3% on sales above $25 million, is losing support from progressive organizations. Four groups, including the Oregon Working Families Party, have withdrawn their backing due to concerns that the measure will lead to price hikes and harm the state's budget. Opponents, including Governor Tina Kotek, argue that the measure is 'flawed' and will jeopardize essential services for low-income earners and working families. However, the measure still has a large support base from other progressive organizations. The chief petitioner, Antonia Gisbert, says it's unsurprising that some organizations have changed their allegiance and is proud of the broad base of support for the measure. 'It is unsurprising that some organizations felt pressured to change allegiance once elected officials denounced Measure 118 in 'favor of corporate donors,' Gisbert said. 'Political change requires significant courage' and is encouraged by the broad base of support for the measure.

**Several progressive groups withdraw support of Oregon measure that would give every resident $1,600**
At least four progressive organizations have withdrawn their support for Oregon's Measure 118, which aims to give every resident $1,600 annually by increasing taxes on businesses. The measure, largely funded by wealthy Californians, still retains support from some progressive groups, including the Oregon Progressive Party and the Pacific Green Party. Antonio Gisbert, chief petitioner for Measure 118, dismissed the organizations that withdrew their endorsements as not being brave enough to buck politicians who are 'obliged to corporate donors.' Annie Naranjo-Rivera, state director of the Working Families Party, stated that the party still supports a wealth tax but has a neutral stance on Measure 118 due to its 'flaws' that could 'harm our families' economic well-being.'

**Oregonians Must Decide Yes or No on Measure 118 That Will Redistribute Corporate Tax on Sales Above $25 Million**
Oregonians will vote on Measure 118 on November 5, which proposes to increase the minimum corporate tax on sales exceeding $25 million by 3% and redistribute the cash in the form of tax rebates to residents who spend at least 200 days in the state annually. Big corporations like Nike and Intel are opposed to the measure, as are Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Jared Walczak, vice president of State Projects and the Tax Foundation. They argue that the measure could raise the cost of goods, drive jobs and economic activity out of state, and put state-based businesses at a disadvantage. In contrast, proponents of the measure, including the Oregon Progressive Party and Antonio Gisbert, the chief petitioner, argue that it will drastically reduce child poverty in the state by 26%. However, the consensus on social media is mostly negative, with many residents describing the measure as a 'job killer' and a 'horrible idea for all Oregonians'.

**The Skanner Endorsements: Oregon State and Local Ballot Measures**
The Skanner Endorses several Oregon ballot measures, but with reservations. Measure 115 would allow the legislature to impeach elected state executives, providing a framework for removing officials who have lost the trust of their constituents. Measure 116, which would establish an independent commission to determine public officials' salaries, is opposed due to its convoluted approach and lack of transparency. Measure 117, which would implement ranked-choice voting for federal and state offices, is also opposed due to its inconsistency in applying the new system to some offices but not others. Measure 118, which would require Oregon to issue rebates to residents from surplus corporate tax revenue, is opposed due to its flawed implementation of universal basic income (UBI) and potential negative impact on critical programs and services. Measure 119, which would require cannabis businesses to submit to labor peace agreements, is supported due to its worker protections and alignment with other states that have legalized recreational cannabis use.

**West Coast, Messed Coast™: Just a 'Throuple' of Things About Our Election Ejection Edition**
The West Coast, Messed Coast has been experiencing a hectic week with an atmospheric river bringing rain to the entire coastline. The good news is that the rain will help with snowpack in the mountains, but the bad news is that California hasn't built any new reservoirs to hold the rain, leading to potential drought concerns in the future. The author recommends voting for candidates who prioritize basic issues like water preservation and forest brush cleaning to prevent wildfires. The article also criticizes the policies of outgoing Gov. Jay Inslee, who promised to lower gas prices but instead increased them, and Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who ordered energy companies to hide the carbon tax line item from consumers' bills. The author recommends voting yes on Let's Go Washington's initiatives to repeal these policies. Additionally, the article criticizes Measure 118 in Oregon, which would implement a stealth VAT tax and Universal Basic Income, and recommends voting no on Proposition 3 in California, which would change the language of the state constitution to a generic statement that 'marriage is a fundamental right.' The author also shares a reader's suggestion for Project 4444, which would limit bills in Congress to 4,444 words, the length of the Constitution.

**Voter guide: Measure 118 – Rebates from corporate tax hike**
Measure 118, also known as the Oregon Rebate, is a citizen initiative that would tax most companies with sales over $25 million a year by 3%. The proceeds would be distributed equally to all Oregonians, regardless of age or situation, provided they lived in Oregon for at least 200 days in the applicable year. Supporters, including the Oregon Progressive Party and Teamsters Local 206, argue that the measure would put desperately needed money in the hands of Oregonians and help keep them housed. Opponents, including Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek and over 200 companies and business groups, claim that the measure would increase prices on everyday items and punch a huge hole in the state budget, putting essential services for low-wage and working families at risk. According to a state analysis, the program would reduce total personal income taxes by 33%, including reducing or eliminating personal income taxes for filers who earn less than $40,000 a year. The average rebate could range from $1,000 to $1,300 in 2026 and increase to $1,600 per person in 2027 and $1,686 in 2028.

**“Oregon Rebate” Measure 118 Could Turn Out To Be A Financial Burden**
Measure 118, the 'Oregon Rebate' proposal, aims to raise corporate taxes by 3% to provide every Oregon resident, including children, with a $1,600 annual rebate. Opponents argue it will be an expensive burden, with the Oregon Department of Revenue estimating an additional $7 billion in revenue per year. The revenue would be distributed equally among all Oregonians, but opponents claim the tax will be passed on to consumers, increasing prices and affecting state budgets. Large corporations, labor unions, and most legislative leaders, including Governor Tina Kotek, have come out against the measure. Jody Wiser of Tax Fairness Oregon said, 'It doesn't make any sense when there are all sorts of other needs.' In contrast, Stacey Rutland of the Yes on 118 campaign said, 'We're getting a family of four $6,400 to be able to make sure that they are able to do much better.'

**Measure 118: Financial relief or a costly burden?**
Measure 118, also known as the 'Oregon Rebate', proposes raising corporate taxes to give every Oregon resident $1,600 per year. Supporters, including Stacey Rutland from the Yes on 118 Campaign, say this would provide financial relief for people with bills, childcare, and emergency needs. However, opponents, such as Jody Wiser from Tax Fairness Oregon, argue that consumers will ultimately pay higher prices, and the tax will be passed along, potentially impacting state budgets for education and social services. According to the measure, individuals can opt out of the tax credit or check if it exceeds their tax liability. Despite this, most legislative leaders, labor unions, and Oregon Governor Tina Kotek are opposed to the measure.

**Oregon could become the first state to tax big companies and send the cash to all residents**
Oregon's Measure 118, the Oregon Rebate, aims to make the state the first to increase the minimum tax on large businesses and send the cash to all residents, guaranteeing them a minimum income. The measure would increase the minimum tax on corporations with in-state sales greater than $25 million by 3% to pay everyone the rebate, regardless of income. From the proceeds, most Oregon residents would receive an annual tax rebate, but some people with lower incomes could opt for a direct cash payment. The state estimates 84% of people would choose a rebate via a refundable tax credit on personal income tax returns, reducing their tax bill. Rebates were estimated at $750 when proponents first began seeking signatures to put the issue to voters; a new state analysis estimates the rebate is likely to be as much as $1,160 in 2026 and $1,605 by 2027. Despite the allure of cash, the ballot measure has met with widespread opposition, including from the Democratic governor, the legislative leadership of both parties, most of the state’s major labor unions and nearly all of its major business organizations. Gov. Tina Kotek told one news outlet, Willamette Week, that the proposal “would punch a huge hole in the state budget.”

**Oregon's 2024 ballot measures, explained**
Oregon voters will have several high-profile ballot measures to consider in the 2024 election, including questions about how elected officials are elected, paid, and penalized. One measure aims to introduce a form of universal basic income to Oregon residents, but at a cost. The article highlights the complexities of these measures and the potential impact on Oregon's political landscape. It also mentions the need for consistency and accountability in governance, citing the example of Borussia Dortmund's football team, which has improved its performance by focusing on consistency. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of informed decision-making and critical thinking in evaluating the ballot measures.

**Measure 118 promises Oregonians more money, but it could come at a cost**
Ballot Measure 118 in Oregon promises to redistribute money from large corporations to Oregonians, with a potential $1,600 yearly payment to each resident. However, opponents, including businesses, politicians, and labor groups, argue that the measure could increase prices, slow economic growth, and have a negative impact on the state budget. Supporters, including proponents of universal basic income, argue that the measure would create a more fair taxing structure for corporations and provide a significant redistribution of wealth to Oregonians. The measure's impact on the state budget and the potential costs of the payments are still unclear, and voters will have to weigh the benefits against the potential drawbacks when casting their ballots.

**Editorial endorsement November 2024: Vote ‘no' on Measure 118's false promise of free money**
Oregonians are urged to vote 'no' on Measure 118, a proposal that would fund rebates through a massive increase in Oregon's corporate minimum tax. Supporters claim that the rebate program would benefit low-income Oregonians, but state legislative analysts warn that the proposed 3% tax on sales over $25 million would dampen employment and income growth. The measure is expected to divert $1 billion a year to the rebate program, which would have otherwise gone to the General Fund for education, health care, public safety, and other vital services. The editorial board argues that the measure is a formula for chaos, sapping funding for essential services and sending that money as rebates to all residents, regardless of income or need. They also point out that the measure's complexity and unintended consequences are immense, and that the state would have to reserve funds to help affected families in as many as a dozen different federal programs. The editorial board notes that the measure's flaws are obvious, and that a long list of elected officials, nonprofit organizations, corporations, and unions are collectively standing in opposition to it. They urge Oregonians to join them in voting 'no' on Measure 118.

Oregonians are urged to vote 'no' on Measure 118, which would fund a rebate program through a massive increase in Oregon's corporate minimum tax. Supporters claim that the rebate program would benefit low-income Oregonians, but state legislative analysts and independent think tanks warn of unintended consequences, including a dampened employment and income growth, and a decrease in General Fund revenue. The measure is expected to divert $1 billion a year to the rebate program, which would have otherwise gone to education, healthcare, public safety, and other vital services. Oregonians should resist the misleading promises of free money and consider the complexity of consequences that result from fiddling with tax policy, particularly by ballot measure. 'We just do not see how this can lead to a decrease in General Fund revenue,' said chief petitioner Antonio Gisbert, but Legislative Revenue Officer Chris Allanach explained that the rebate program could affect state funding for public services. The opposition to Measure 118 is impressive, with a long list of elected officials, nonprofit organizations, corporations, and unions collectively standing in opposition to this measure.

**Viewpoint: Measure 118 is bad for all Oregonians**
Measure 118, also known as 'The Oregon Rebate,' offers an annual rebate to each Oregonian, but its negative impacts will be severe. The rebate will be funded by a 3% gross receipts tax on corporations with sales receipts over $25 million, which will lead to hidden compounded taxes on all goods and services, causing higher consumer prices and a weakened state economy. This tax will also cripple the state's ability to provide essential services and disproportionately hurt lower-income households. As Stephanie Do, a senior tax consultant with the Council on State Taxation, notes, 'Measure 118 is not a good deal for Oregonians.'

**Oregon businesses are spending millions to oppose a ballot measure that would give every resident a $1,600-a-year basic income**
Oregon residents will vote on a ballot measure that would give them a universal basic income of $1,600 per year. However, businesses have spent millions to oppose the measure, which would tax corporations and increase the state's minimum corporate tax rate by 3%. Lawmakers from both parties agree that the measure could harm the state budget and essential services. Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek said, 'The ballot measure may look good on paper, but its flawed approach would punch a huge hole in the state budget and put essential services for low-wage and working families at risk.' The Oregon Rebate PAC has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of the measure, while Oregon businesses have collectively raised $9.3 million to fight it. A report by the Oregon Legislative Revenue Office found that low-income rebate recipients could be disqualified from receiving aid from federal programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Medicaid. Antonio Gisbert, the petitioner behind the ballot measure, maintains that the rebate would be net neutral, saying, 'In short, General Fund dollars do not fund the rebate, all implementation and related costs are paid for by the new revenue.'

**Oregon Measure 118 would tax corporate sales and hand residents basic income**
Oregon voters will decide on Measure 118 in November, which would tax corporate sales and distribute the revenue as a rebate to residents. The measure aims to address the issue of big corporations not paying their fair share in taxes and provide relief to working-class families. However, opponents argue that it would be a bad idea, causing a huge hole in the state budget and putting essential services at risk. They claim that it would be a tax increase on consumer goods, with consumers paying more for products due to the tax being applied at every step of the supply chain. Proponents, including the petitioner Antonio Gisbert, believe that the measure would balance the playing field between large corporations and small businesses, and that the rebate would help the economy and local communities. The Oregon Legislative Revenue Office has analyzed the measure and found that it would have significant implications for the state's General Fund, including a negative cash flow and a reduction in the rainy-day fund. The measure has received criticism from various groups, including the Oregon Center for Public Policy and the Tax Fairness for Oregon, who describe it as poorly written and ignorant of the impacts on the state's General Fund.

**Oregon Ballot Measure Targets Big ISPs, Others to Fund $1,600 Annual Payment to State Residents**
A November ballot initiative in Oregon, known as Measure 118, aims to provide a 'universal basic income' of $1,600 per year to every Oregon resident, funded by a 3% gross receipts tax on corporations with annual sales exceeding $25 million in Oregon. The tax would target large corporations like Comcast, Google, and Intel, which pay little to no state income tax. According to the State of Oregon's fiscal impact analysis, the measure would affect about 2,000 of Oregon's 64,000 corporations, most of which are multinational and based outside the state. Advocates for the measure say it would level the playing field between large and small Internet Service Providers, promote a more competitive broadband market, and help address the affordability crisis, including the rising cost of internet access. 'It's not fair that huge corporations like Comcast pay an effective tax rate of 0.11% while Oregonians and Oregon small businesses pay an Oregon tax somewhere between 4.75% and 9.9% in taxes! Oregon Rebate levels the playing field,' the campaign website notes.

**‘Oregon Rebate' measure 118 could cost state at least $1 billion annually, legislators hear**
A proposed corporate tax hike in Oregon, known as Measure 118, could cost the state at least $1 billion annually, according to legislative revenue analysts. The measure would increase the corporate minimum tax on sales above $25 million and distribute the proceeds to all Oregonians. However, the rebate would be claimed by many Oregonians as personal income tax credits, which could decrease personal income tax revenue. Sen. Mark Meek called the measure a 'debacle' and said it was 'very poorly written.' The state would receive more money in the current budget cycle but have a negative cash flow in future budgets, with estimated losses of $547 million in the 2025-27 budget, $2.1 billion in the 2027-29 budget, and $2.5 billion in the 2029-31 budget. The measure's complexity has been criticized, with Legislative Revenue Officer Chris Allanach saying it would be difficult to determine the impact on social services and benefits. Opponents of the measure, including Oregon Business and Industry, have raised nearly $9.3 million to defeat it, while supporters have received significant funding from wealthy Californians.

**Another Think Tank Pans the Proposed Oregon Rebate**
The Common Sense Institute, a business-friendly think tank, has released a report criticizing Measure 118, a proposed Oregon ballot measure that would impose a 3% gross receipts tax on corporations with Oregon sales of more than $25 million a year. The report estimates that this change would result in a six-fold increase in corporate tax payments, with the tax burden shifting from profits to sales. Proponents of the measure, including chief petitioner Antonio Gisbert, argue that the tax would generate $7 billion a year and provide a $1,600 check to every Oregon resident, stimulating economic activity through new spending. However, the Common Sense Institute found that consumers may not act as expected, with people saving a large share of the payments rather than spending them. The report also notes that many companies would pass the tax on in the form of higher prices, and that the positive economic impact of rebate payments would be watered down due to federal taxes and high-income households saving the windfall. 'The positive economic impact of rebate payments would be watered down,' the report concludes. 'Rebate payments are subject to federal taxes, will create a hole in the state general fund, and will be collected by high-income households that will save much of the windfall rather than injecting it into the economy.'

**Oregon's cash giveaway**
Oregon's Measure 118 proposes a universal basic income, where residents would receive a lump sum of $3,000 per family. Proponents, such as Antonio Gisbert, claim it would reduce child poverty by 26%. However, critics argue that the funding for this initiative would come from a 3% tax on sales for businesses making over $25 million, which would increase prices for consumers. According to the Tax Foundation, this would result in a combined state and local tax bill of 56% for businesses, and 77% including federal taxes. This would lead to increased costs for consumers, and potentially even encourage illegal aliens to sign up for the giveaway. A more effective alternative would be to allow businesses to retain their earnings and invest in their operations, leading to economic growth and job creation.

Hundreds of companies have contributed $9.28 million to oppose a ballot measure in Oregon that proposes increasing corporate taxes to give every Oregonian an estimated $1,600 per year. The Defeat the Costly Tax on Sales committee, formed by the Oregon Business and Industry lobby, has reported spending and using just $1.4 million, leaving it with $7.9 million cash on hand. The committee's largest contributor is a group funded by grocery and retail stores, which donated $1 million in August. Erik Lukens, spokesperson for the committee, said, 'Contributions to the effort to defeat Measure 118 reflect widespread concern about the harm this costly tax on sales would do.' Antonio Gisbert, lead petitioner of Measure 118, countered, 'The opposition to Measure 118 is bankrolled by a real 'who's who' of dirty corporate actors.' The business coalition has indicated it will raise and spend as much as necessary to defeat Measure 118, which has received minimal backing from Oregon groups.
