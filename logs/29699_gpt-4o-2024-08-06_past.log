To forecast whether either major party candidate in California’s 13th Congressional District will concede the election before December 1, 2024, let's examine several factors.

1. **Timing and Political Norms**: The date is November 7, 2024, so the election has presumably just occurred, and we're within a window where concessions are typically made shortly after results become sufficiently clear. Historically, most concessions happen within days if the results are not contested or are clear-cut.

2. **Historical Concessions**: Traditionally, concession speeches occur if results are clear and there's no significant dispute or recount. While this is normative, each election cycle can vary depending on the closeness of the race and the political climate.

3. **Current Political Climate**: The level of partisanship and recent elections have seen some candidates delaying concessions, particularly if races are close or if they plan to challenge the results legally. This could lower the probability of a concession happening rapidly.

4. **California Politics**: California is predominantly Democratic, but local district races can be competitive. Checking recent polls or early results for California’s 13th might illuminate whether the race is close, influencing the likelihood of a delayed concession.

5. **Election Procedures**: California uses a top-two primary system, which can sometimes result in two candidates from the same party. It’s important to consider if this impacts the dynamic, though the question specifies Democratic or Republican candidates.

6. **Media and Reporting**: Credible reports of a concession must exist by the specific date for a "Yes" resolution. Lack of credible sources confirming a concession would lead to a "No" resolution even if a candidate does concede informally.

Given all these aspects, concessions are common if results are clear and uncontested. However, the current political climate and the potential closeness of the race, along with any procedural challenges, could delay such a concession.

Considering these elements, it's reasonable to assign a higher probability that a concession will occur, but leave room for uncertainty due to potential disputes or close-countering results.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 90.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.
