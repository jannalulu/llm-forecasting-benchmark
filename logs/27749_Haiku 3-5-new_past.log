Let's carefully analyze the evidence:

Relevant Evidence:
1. Firouzja recently won the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz tournament, demonstrating strong form
2. In the Speed Chess Championship 2024:
- He defeated Fabiano Caruana 14.5-8.5 in quarterfinals
- He defeated Alexander Grischuk 13.5-10.5 in round of 16
- He is qualified for the Paris Semifinals against Hikaru Nakamura

Competitive Context:
- Speed Chess Championship has a $175,000 prize fund
- Semifinals and finals will be in Paris in September
- Nakamura is considered equally strong in bullet chess
- Firouzja is considered at same level as Magnus Carlsen and Nakamura in bullet

Competitive Assessment:
- Firouzja has shown dominant speed chess performance
- He's had impressive victories in recent tournaments
- Nakamura will be a challenging semifinal opponent

Probability Considerations:
- Strong current form suggests high probability of success
- High-level competition reduces absolute certainty
- Nakamura is a formidable opponent in speed chess

Balancing these factors carefully, considering both his recent performance and the strength of competition:

My Prediction: Between 55.25% and 72.40%, but 64.75% being the most likely. Probability: 64.75%.

Let me carefully analyze this question step by step:

Key Evidence:
1. Firouzja just won the Speed Chess Championship quarterfinals against Fabiano Caruana decisively (14.5-8.5)
2. He's qualified for the Paris Semifinals in September
3. His semifinal match will be against Hikaru Nakamura, who described Firouzja as being "at the same level as Magnus and myself in bullet"
4. The finals will be held September 6-8 in Paris
5. Firouzja has demonstrated strong recent form, winning the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz tournament

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Firouzja shows excellent speed chess skills this year
- He's performed strongly in recent tournaments
- Nakamura is a formidable semifinal opponent, which increases uncertainty
- Speed chess requires different skills than classical chess
- Tournament knockout format introduces more variance

Reference Class Calibration:
- Speed Chess Championship requires winning multiple high-intensity matches
- Firouzja has shown he can compete at top speed chess levels
- But tournament knockout formats are inherently unpredictable

Balancing Considerations:
- Strong recent performance suggests high probability
- Tough semifinal match against Nakamura introduces significant uncertainty

Probability Adjustment:
- Base probability of winning: Around 40-50%
- Recent performance boosts this
- Semifinal difficulty reduces it somewhat

My Prediction: Between 42.50% and 57.50%, but 49.75% being the most likely. Probability: 49.75%.
