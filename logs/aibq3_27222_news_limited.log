**Deception and a Gamble: How Ukrainian Troops Invaded Russia**
Ukraine launched a surprise military offensive into Russia on August 6, 2024, with the aim of upending the dynamics of the war. The operation, planned and executed in secrecy, has pushed the limits of how Western military equipment would be permitted to be used inside Russian territory. Ukrainian forces have made significant gains, pushing 7 miles into Russia along a 25-mile front and taking dozens of Russian soldiers as prisoners. The operation has been successful so far, but analysts are skeptical that the Ukrainians can hold onto their gains. The incursion has created new vulnerabilities along the front where Ukrainian forces are already stretched thin. Videos show Ukrainian forces facing resistance at times, but there is no visual evidence of widespread losses. Ukrainian troops have been publicizing their moves, posting videos and selfies from Russian towns and villages, bragging about how they have finally taken the fight to Russia. The operation has also led to a haphazard evacuation of civilians, with many relying on each other for help. The city of Kursk has filled with people fleeing the fighting, with aid centers set up by charity groups to help those in need. 'We all have joy in our hearts,' said Oleksandr, a Ukrainian infantry soldier, 'but we realize that there are still difficult challenges ahead.'

**Full Offensive? Ukraine Is Now Taking the Fight to Russia (As In Inside Russia)**
The Ukrainian military has launched a significant offensive operation inside Russia, capturing 135 square miles of territory and advancing 15 miles into Kursk Oblast. This marks a shift from a cross-border raid to a full-blown offensive, threatening key Russian logistical lines and potentially even a nuclear facility. Russian casualties have been heavy, with over 1,140 men reportedly lost in 24 hours. Ukrainian losses are also substantial, but many wounded soldiers return to combat. The move is seen as an alternative strategy to the stalled counteroffensive along the contact line, aiming to force Russia to divert resources. As Stavros Atlamazoglou notes, 'It remains to be seen whether the Ukrainian military leadership launched the offensive just to distract the Russian forces, or if Ukraine means to establish a foothold on enemy territory and expand the contact line.'

**Russia maps show dramatic impact of Ukraine advances in 24 hours**
Ukrainian forces have made significant advances into Russia's Kursk region in just 24 hours, despite Russia's efforts to contain the offensive. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have 'rapidly advanced' into Kursk, with some reports suggesting they have reached as far as 22 miles into Russian territory. The Russian Ministry of Defense claims that Ukraine has lost nearly 1,000 servicemen and 27 armored vehicles, but ISW notes that Ukrainian forces 'most certainly do not control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims.' Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the raid was intended to 'squeeze something out' of Russia and ensure Moscow bargains earnestly in future negotiations. Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, believes Ukraine's motives are likely 'building back up for another go at a counteroffensive in 2025' to try and reverse the momentum of the war and put the Russians on the backfoot. Savill also noted that there is a symbolic motive at play, with Kyiv intending to 'send a signal that they've got the stamina for a long conflict, and indeed one in which the balance will turn in their favor.'

**Ukrainian Forces Advance 10 Kilometers into Russian Kursk Region**
According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces have advanced 10 kilometers into the Russian Kursk region. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) analyzed data and confirmed the advancement of Ukrainian forces into the region. The ISW stated, 'Confirmed that on August 7, Ukrainian forces advanced 10 kilometers into the Kursk region of Russia in the context of ongoing mechanized assault operations on Russian territory.' The ISW also noted that Ukrainian forces have breached at least two Russian defensive lines and an outpost. The Russian government's reaction to Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region has been inconsistent, with officials trying to balance representing the efforts as a significant escalation by Ukraine while avoiding exaggerating the potential consequences and risking internal discontent. Some Russian 'military' bloggers have criticized the Russian military command for not preparing for Ukrainian offensive operations in the Kursk region or preventing them. Ukrainian forces have also successfully adapted their capabilities in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), using a FPV-drone to shoot down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over the Kursk region. The head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, estimated that the Russian offensive potential will reach its climax within 1.5-2 months, which aligns with the ISW's assessment of Russia's current offensive potential. The head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Daniel Bell, stated that Russia has been torturing 95% of Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Russian prisons. The Central Election Commission of Moldova announced that it will not register the pro-Russian 'Victory' electoral bloc for the presidential election and referendum in October 2024. A Russian court sentenced Andriy Kurshin, the administrator of the Telegram channel of the Russian ultranationalist blogger 'Moscow Calls', to 6.5 years in prison for publishing 'fake' information about Russian military personnel. Ukrainian forces have recently regained positions south of Chasiv Yar, while Russian forces have advanced northeast of Siversk, southwest of Donetsk, and in the border areas of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 7, 2024**
Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanized offensive operations on Russian territory on August 7. The Kremlin's response to Ukrainian offensive activities in Kursk Oblast has been contradictory, with Russian officials attempting to balance presenting the effort as a notable Ukrainian escalation with avoiding overstating its potential implications and risking domestic discontent. Select Russian milbloggers have heavily criticized the Russian military command for not detecting preparations for or preventing Ukrainian offensive operations into Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces have reportedly used a first-person view (FPV) drone to down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over Kursk Oblast, indicating that Ukrainian forces continue to successfully adapt their drone capabilities. Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Head Kyrylo Budanov assessed on August 7 that Russian offensive potential will culminate within one and a half to two months, generally consistent with ISW's assessment on current Russia's offensive capabilities. Head of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), Danielle Bell, stated that Russia has tortured 95 percent of Ukrainian prisoners-of-war (POWs) in Russian detention. The Moldovan Central Electoral Commission (CEC) announced on August 7 that it would not register the pro-Kremlin Victory electoral bloc in the October 2024 Moldovan presidential election and referendum. A Russian court sentenced Andrey Kurshin, administrator of the 'Moscow Calling' Russian ultranationalist milblogger Telegram channel, to six and a half years in prison on August 7 for publishing 'fake' information about the Russian military.

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Operation into Russian Territory**
Ukraine's military launched a surprise operation on August 6, 2024, crossing the Russian border in the Kursk region and advancing up to 11 kilometers into Russian territory. According to the New York Times, the operation was a strategic turning point in the ongoing war, which began in February 2022. The Ukrainian forces caught the Russians off guard, and the operation has been described as a 'great gamble' by the Times. If Ukraine is able to maintain control of the territory, it could weaken Russia's military capabilities and create a bargaining chip for any future peace talks. However, if Russia is able to push the Ukrainian forces back and advance in the east, it could be seen as a victory for the Russian military and a blow to Ukraine's leadership. The Ukrainian military has been tight-lipped about the operation, with President Volodymyr Zelensky only acknowledging it publicly on Saturday. The operation has been described as a 'test of the Ukrainian military's ability to execute a complex operation in a highly contested environment.' The Ukrainian forces have been able to advance quickly, but they face significant challenges in maintaining control of the territory and defending against Russian counterattacks. As one Ukrainian officer said, 'We are facing a difficult situation, and we need to be careful not to overextend ourselves.' The operation has been seen as a significant development in the war, and it remains to be seen how it will play out in the coming days and weeks.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 8, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on the ongoing situation in Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing into Russian territory. According to geolocated footage and Russian claims, Ukrainian forces have continued to advance further into Kursk Oblast on August 8, with some reports indicating they are as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast. However, it is unclear if Ukrainian forces control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims. Russian milbloggers have provided conflicting reports on Ukrainian positions, with some claiming that Ukrainian forces have seized settlements while others claim that they have only advanced part of the way. The ISW notes that Ukrainian forces appear to be using novel and innovative tactics and technological capabilities during operations in Kursk Oblast, which may be a concern for the Russian military command. The Kremlin is likely to respond to the perceived threat to civilians in Kursk Oblast, and the Russian military command has several possible courses of action (COAs) it could pursue to respond to the Ukrainian operation. These COAs include using existing conscripts, Federal Security Service (FSB) border guards, Rosgvardia, and other irregular forces to push Ukrainian forces back; redeploying operational reserves to Kursk Oblast; or redeploying relatively better provisioned and more combat effective frontline units to Kursk Oblast. The ISW notes that the Russian military command's decision-making will be influenced by its perception of the size and capability of Ukrainian forces in the area, and it is unclear which COA is most likely.

**Russia's Military Campaign in Ukraine: A Failure Despite Territorial Gains**
Despite gaining significant territory, Russia's military campaign in Ukraine has been deemed a failure by experts. The Russian army has made steady gains, capturing around 600 square kilometers of land between May and August 2024, but at a high cost in human lives and material. According to military analysts, Russia is suffering from high casualties, with estimates suggesting 1000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded per day. The Kremlin is also facing recruitment problems and is trying to motivate soldiers with financial incentives, as reported by the British Telegraph. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) concludes that Russia's summer offensive, despite its territorial gains, is relatively small and 'scaled back'. Instead of a large-scale attack, Russia has launched many scattered attacks, mainly in eastern Ukraine. Military analyst Nico Lange states that the Russian offensive has failed, as the Russian leadership has missed its strategic goal, suffered heavy losses, wasted valuable time, and achieved minimal territorial gains. 'This has weakened the Russians for further attacks. At least, it has cost a lot of time. You can already say that was a disaster,' Lange said.

**Russian Summer Offensive in Ukraine: A Mixed Bag of Gains and Losses**
A recent graph by Finnish military analyst Pasi Paroinen shows that the Russian army has made significant territorial gains in the Ukraine, while the Ukrainian forces have made minimal progress. The Ukrainian army's summer offensive in 2023 resulted in a gain of approximately 320 square kilometers, but most of these areas are now under Russian control. In contrast, the Russian army has made steady progress since the start of their announced offensive in the spring of 2024, gaining around 600 square kilometers. However, the Russian army has suffered heavy losses, with estimates suggesting 1000 casualties per day. Military analyst Nico Lange stated, 'The Russian offensive was a disaster.' The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) concluded that the Russian summer offensive was relatively small and 'abbreviated' despite significant territorial gains.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, July 27, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has released its Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment for July 27, 2024. The report highlights several key developments in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian forces have reportedly conducted successful drone strikes against Russian military airfields and an oil refinery in Saratov, Ryazan, and Murmansk oblasts. Russia continues to deepen its relations with Iran and North Korea, with Iran set to launch its 'Hod Hod' and 'Kosar' satellites into low earth orbit from a Russian station in October 2024. The report also notes that Ukrainian forces have recently regained positions near Toretsk and Russian forces have advanced west and southwest of Donetsk City. The ISW assesses that Russian forces are continuing to push Ukrainian forces back from the international border with Belgorod Oblast and approach to within tube artillery range of Kharkiv City.

**Ukraine's War Effort: Challenges and Prospects**
According to military expert Pavel Narozhny, Ukraine's army will have to continue defending on the Donbass front for a long time, while in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be able to launch an offensive and liberate occupied territories from Russia. Narozhny listed the current problems in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including the slow pace of mobilization, the slow delivery of promised weapons, and the threat of Russian aviation. He noted that the flow of mobilized personnel will be felt in October 2024, and that Ukraine lacks the ability to shoot down Russian planes. The expert also stated that the transfer of F-16s is taking too long and will not happen before the end of 2024. He predicted that the situation on the front will be difficult, with the possibility of Ukrainian forces retreating and losing territory. However, he believes that by spring 2025, Ukraine may be able to regain the initiative, with the possibility of launching an offensive, striking at Russia, and liberating occupied territories.

**Ukraine's War Effort: Challenges and Prospects**
According to military expert Pavel Narozhny, the Ukrainian army will have to continue defending on the Donbas front for a long time, while in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, the Ukrainian military will soon be able to launch an offensive and liberate occupied Russian territories. Narozhny listed three main problems facing the Ukrainian army: the slow pace of mobilization, the slow arrival of promised partner weapons, and the threat of Russian aviation. He stated that the mobilization process will be felt in October 2024, and that Ukraine lacks the ability to shoot down Russian planes. The expert also noted that Ukraine has been negotiating the transfer of F-16s for too long and that the situation will not be resolved until the end of the fall. He believes that the Ukrainian army will be able to regain the initiative on the front in the spring of 2025, with the possibility of launching an offensive and liberating occupied territories.
