**Nvidia Surpasses Apple in Market Capitalization, Awaits Quarterly Results**
Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market capitalization and has become the largest listed company before presenting its quarterly results. The company's stock has risen by over 100% (180% specifically) compared to Intel's decline of over 50%. Nvidia is expected to report a net profit of $17,495 million on November 20, which would be the highest quarterly profit in its history and a 89% increase from the same period last year. According to JP Morgan, Nvidia's solid demand for PC games and its growth in the data center segment are expected to drive its revenue. The company's net profit is expected to reach $68,616 million in 2024, a 144% increase from the historical record of 2023. Analysts predict that Nvidia's net profit will exceed $100,000 million in just two years, making it one of the five companies in the world to achieve this milestone in 2026. 'We expect Nvidia to continue delivering good results across all segments, with the solid demand for PC games being a strong revenue driver, compensating for the decline in original equipment manufacturers,' said JP Morgan. 'We also expect the data center segment to grow strongly as hyperscale customers continue to adopt accelerated learning by GPU for processing large datasets.'

**Nvidia Surpasses Apple as World's Most Valuable Company**
Nvidia surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company on Monday, with a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, surpassing Apple's $3.35 trillion. Nvidia's stock rose 2% and Apple's fell 1% on Monday, continuing Nvidia's 2% gain on Friday and Apple's 1% loss. Nvidia's announcement on Friday that it would replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average helped boost Nvidia, while Apple's stock was affected by one of its largest shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, who revealed this weekend another significant sale of his Apple shares. Nvidia designs around 75% of the world's AI accelerators, the semiconductor technology that drives AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, as demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units increases. This 'insane' demand has led to a massive increase in earnings and a surge in stock prices. Nvidia's net income increased from $2.3 billion in the first half of 2022 to $31.5 billion in the first half of 2024, and its stock price has risen 850% in the last two years. However, Nvidia's stock has actually fallen 4.8% since its all-time high close on October 21, while Apple's stock has fallen 6.7% over the same period, leading to the change in their market values. In its earnings report on Thursday, Apple exceeded Wall Street's expectations for revenue and adjusted earnings, but its weaker outlook for the final quarter of 2024 disappointed investors. Despite Apple's stronger financial performance, with $397 billion in projected revenue and $98 billion in net income, surpassing Nvidia's $120 billion in sales and $64 billion in net income, analysts expect Nvidia's growth trajectory to continue, with $122 billion in projected earnings for 2026, just below Apple's $124 billion.

**Nvidia to Replace Intel in Dow Jones Index, Berkshire Hathaway Misses Earnings Expectations**

Nvidia will replace Intel in the Dow Jones index starting from November 8, while Dow Inc. will be replaced by Sherwin-Williams.

**NVIDIA Stock Soars to All-Time Highs Driven by AI Boom and Strong Q3 Earnings**
NVIDIA's stock price has reached an all-time high of $140.52, driven by the AI boom and strong Q3 2024 earnings.

**Microsoft Could Surpass Nvidia as Most Valuable Company Next Year**
A new analysis by 'Investor’s Business Daily' suggests that Microsoft could surpass Nvidia as the most valuable company in the world next year, with a projected market capitalization of $3.7 billion. Currently, Nvidia is valued at $3.68 billion, with Apple in third place.

Megan Horneman, Chief Investment Officer at Verdence Capital Advisors, notes that if Nvidia were excluded from the information technology sector, the growth rate would be lower, at 8%. Analysts are optimistic about Microsoft's prospects, with a 17% chance of growth in the next 12 months, compared to Nvidia's 4.4% chance.

**Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Before Nov. 20? | The Motley Fool**
Nvidia (NVDA) shareholders have seen a 180% increase in stock value this year, and the company is expected to announce its fiscal year 2025 third-quarter results on Nov. 20. New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran notes that Nvidia has consistently beaten Wall Street's earnings estimates over the last five years, with two potential reasons being the company's ability to recognize revenue and record expenses, and the growing demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). CFO Colette Kress said that the demand for Hopper GPUs will continue to grow into the second half of the year, and the consensus estimates among analysts are for Q3 revenue of $32.9 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.74 per share. However, Nvidia projects Q3 revenue of $32.5 billion, which is lower than analysts expect. The author suggests that investors should keep in mind that earnings beats don't necessarily translate to significant stock gains, and whether they buy Nvidia stock before or after the Q3 update probably won't make much of a difference in their returns over the long run.

**Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Before Nov. 20?**
Nvidia shareholders have had a great year, with the stock soaring over 180%. The company is expected to announce its fiscal year 2025 third-quarter results on Nov. 20. New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran notes that Nvidia has consistently beaten Wall Street's earnings estimates, with one possible reason being the growing demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs).

Analysts expect Q3 revenue of $32.9 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.74 per share, but Nvidia projects Q3 revenue of $32.5 billion, which is lower than expected. Damodaran thinks that the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has accelerated more quickly than Wall Street projected, and that the company may be able to top Wall Street's estimates again. 'The demand for Nvidia's GPUs unequivocally has accelerated more quickly than Wall Street projected in the past because analysts have said so themselves,' Damodaran said. 'I think Damodaran's second scenario is more compelling,' said the article, 'Nvidia might have enough wiggle room with accounting rules to sometimes manage an earnings beat. However, such manipulation wouldn't realistically enable the company to exceed expectations consistently for nearly every quarter over five years.'

The company's stock price has reached a new high of $144.13 per share, a 2% increase from the previous day.

**Nvidia's Stock Price Soars as Analysts Remain Optimistic**

The shares of the leading manufacturer of AI chips rose by 3% to over $142, surpassing the previous intraday record of $140.89 from the previous week. This price movement is a reaction to renewed buy recommendations from analysts. Bank of America increased its price target from $165 to $190, while CFRA raised its target from $139 to $160. Bloomberg consensus estimates suggest that the stock could reach $148.37 within 12 months. Vivek Arya, an analyst at Bank of America, highlights Nvidia's strength in the corporate AI sector, particularly through partnerships with major players like Microsoft and Accenture. Nvidia's role as the preferred partner for corporate hardware and software is emphasized.

Micron and TSMC also exceeded analyst expectations with their recent earnings reports, providing additional positive momentum in the AI sector. With an expected growth rate of 99% in 2024 and another increase of 74% in 2025, optimism remains high. However, a slight decline in Nvidia's growth could be enough to send the stock price into a downturn, as recent experiences with quarterly reports from major tech companies have shown. Analysts predict that Nvidia's third-quarter earnings per share will increase by 84% to $0.74 and revenue will rise by 83% to $33.1 billion. While 67 analysts rate the stock as Outperform, there are 7 neutral recommendations and only one Sell recommendation.

**Nvidia stock soars to fresh record as Wall Street stays bullish ahead of earnings**
Nvidia's stock price surged to a new high on Monday, closing at $143.71 per share, as Wall Street analysts maintained their bullish positions ahead of the company's earnings report. Analysts, including Vivek Arya from Bank of America and Dan Ives from Wedbush, cited strong demand for AI and Nvidia's strength in the enterprise AI space as factors contributing to their higher price targets. Ives forecasted the AI infrastructure market to grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies spending $1 trillion on AI capital expenditures. Despite concerns of an AI spending slowdown, Nvidia shares have risen nearly 3% over the past week and more than 20% in the last month. Analysts expect Nvidia to report third quarter earnings per share of $0.74, an 84% increase from last year, and revenue rising 83% to $33.1 billion.

**NVIDIA Reaches New High, but Apple Remains the Largest Company**
NVIDIA's stock price has reached a new high, surpassing $140.84 per share, driven by the positive results of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which reported a 54% increase in net profit. This has fueled optimism in the market, with NVIDIA's stock price rising over 3% and setting a new record. However, Apple remains the largest company in the world by market capitalization, with a value of $3.52 billion. The competition between NVIDIA and Apple will continue, with NVIDIA's stock price needing to reach $143 to surpass Apple's market capitalization. The third-quarter earnings season will be crucial in determining NVIDIA's potential for growth and whether it can overtake Apple. InvestingPro's ProPicks IA tool, which uses artificial intelligence to select stocks, has recommended NVIDIA as a top pick, with a 37.14% return since its launch in November 2023, surpassing the S&P 500 by 16.33%.

**Where will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?**
Nvidia's stock has seen significant growth, with a 528% increase in the past three years and a 167% increase in 2024. The company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) market has driven this growth. The global AI market is expected to grow rapidly, with estimates suggesting it will be worth hundreds of billions to almost $1.8 trillion by 2030. Nvidia's leadership in AI-optimized hardware and software positions it to benefit from this growth. The company's data center business is expected to grow at an impressive pace, driven by the increasing expansion of the worldwide data center infrastructure. Nvidia's strong competitive advantage in the AI market, driven by its network effect and widespread adoption of its CUDA parallel computing platform, is expected to continue. The company has reported record data center revenue of $26.3 billion, up 154% year over year, driven by the robust demand for its Hopper architecture chips and networking systems. Analysts expect Nvidia's fiscal 2025 revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be $125.5 billion and $2.84, respectively, implying a year-over-year revenue growth of nearly 106% and EPS growth of $119%. With such robust growth estimates, the consensus analyst target price is $152.44, implying an upside potential of 13.09%. Considering the robust demand for both the Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, the company's strong moat, and unfolding opportunities in the data center and enterprise AI segments, the company's highest estimated target price of $200 seems to be within reach in the next year.

**Can NVIDIA Stock (NVDA) Rally Past $200 Per Share?**
NVIDIA's stock price has been increasing due to several catalysts, including intense demand for their next-generation Blackwell systems, rising Wall Street estimates, and no meaningful market share losses. According to Wall Street estimates, NVIDIA's earnings per share (EPS) will be around $4 in 2025. However, if NVIDIA delivers significantly stronger growth next year, its EPS could reach $5 or more. At $200 per share, NVIDIA would trade for 50X next year's earnings, which is relatively expensive compared to its peers. However, if NVIDIA delivers on strong 2025 growth, its valuation could become more reasonable. The author believes that NVIDIA is reasonably valued at $140 per share and has more upside if it delivers on earnings growth. The author continues to hold NVIDIA as their largest holding in their $500,000 AI Portfolio.

**Analysts Go Even More Bullish As Nvidia, Meta Fly Past Buy Points**
Analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on Nvidia and Meta as their profit estimates continue to rise. Nvidia is approaching its trendline entry around $127.50, after strong growth in sales and earnings over the past five quarters. Analysts expect a 118% increase in profit to $2.83 per share in 2024 and a 44% increase to $4.07 per share in 2025. Meta is hovering near its buy point of $542.81 and analysts expect a 37% increase in profit to $21.30 per share in 2024 and a 14% increase to $24.24 per share in 2025. InterDigital is also in a buy zone, with analysts expecting a 10% decline in earnings in 2024 and a 52% decline in 2025, but the latest estimates were revised upward.

**Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar in the Remainder of 2024**
Nvidia's stock has been in a slump since mid-July, but the company's new Blackwell GPUs could drive significant revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. According to CEO Jensen Huang, data center operators could spend $1 trillion building GPU infrastructure over the next few years, and the new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system will perform AI inference at 30 times the pace of the equivalent H100 system. Many of Nvidia's top customers, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle, are begging for more GPUs to develop AI for their own purposes. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have even begged Huang to take more of their money for additional GPUs. Nvidia's stock looks cheap based on its future potential earnings, and Wall Street expects the company to deliver $4.02 in earnings per share during fiscal 2026. Therefore, I predict Nvidia stock will surpass its record closing high of $135.58 by the end of 2024.

**Prediction: Nvidia stock could hit $200 in 2025**
Nvidia's stock has been volatile lately, but analysts expect it to regain its momentum. The company's dominance in AI chips, robust product roadmap, and high switching costs make it a leader in the market. Constellation Research has given Nvidia a $200 price target, citing its 24-month technology lead over rivals. Nvidia's recent quarterly results show a 122% year-over-year revenue increase to $30 billion, with the data center business producing $26.3 billion. CEO Jensen Huang pointed out that demand for the company's graphics cards remains solid, with shipments expected to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. Analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to hit $4 per share in the next fiscal year, which could lead to a stock price of $220. The company's valuation is justified by its impressive growth and robust position in the AI chip market, making it a good candidate to exceed $200 in 2025.

**Prediction: Nvidia Stock Could Hit $200 in 2025**
Nvidia's stock has seen volatility since July, but its solid fiscal 2025 second-quarter results and bullish guidance suggest its growth is here to stay. Analysts expect the stock to regain its mojo, with a median 12-month price target of $150 and a Street-high price target of $200. Constellation Research points out that Nvidia's dominance in AI chips, high barriers to entry, and robust product roadmap make it a leader in the market, with a technology lead of 24 months over its rivals. Nvidia's recent quarterly results show it is the go-to supplier of graphics cards for companies and governments, with revenue up 122% year over year to $30 billion. CEO Jensen Huang noted that demand for the company's graphics cards remains solid, with shipments expected to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. With its outstanding moat in the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market and healthy pricing power, Nvidia is likely to maintain its dominant position in the AI chip market. As a result, the company's adjusted earnings jumped 152% year over year to $0.68 per share, prompting analysts to increase their earnings projections. The stock could exceed $200 in 2025, with earnings potentially hitting $4 per share and the stock price jumping to $220.

**Nvidia Stock Is Down 10% From Its Highs. Is It Time to Buy the Dip?**
Nvidia's stock has dipped 10% from its all-time high, but is it a good time to buy? The company's revenue has more than quadrupled in two years, from $6.7 billion in Q2 FY 2023 to $30 billion in Q2 FY 2025. Management has guided for revenue of $32.5 billion in Q3, indicating continued growth. Nvidia's earnings projections look attainable, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 42 times and a trailing P/E ratio of 56 times. The company needs to achieve 33% earnings growth over the next year to achieve that valuation, which seems achievable given its recent earnings per share growth of 168%. However, Nvidia's margins have expanded significantly, which means its profit growth will be more closely tied to revenue growth. Nevertheless, with 80% growth expected in Q3, Nvidia is on track for the medium term. Long-term demand for GPUs will remain elevated, as AI growth continues to require more computing power. Therefore, investors can confidently buy the dip in Nvidia's stock.

**Prediction: This Incredibly Cheap but Fast-Growing Semiconductor Stock Could Outperform Nvidia**
Nvidia (NVDA) has been a top-performing semiconductor stock in 2024, but its recent stock price action indicates wavering investor confidence. The company's valuation has become expensive, trading at 27 times sales and 50 times trailing earnings. In contrast, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) is a cheaper alternative with a 56% gain this year. TSM's growth has accelerated, with a 33% year-over-year increase in revenue in August and a 31% increase in revenue in the first eight months of 2024. Analysts expect TSM to deliver a 26% revenue growth to $87.5 billion in 2024, while Nvidia is expected to deliver a 125% increase in revenue. TSM's Foundry 2.0 plan targets a larger addressable market, including chip packaging, testing, and IDM, with a potential revenue of $150 billion in the future. TSM's earnings are expected to increase at an annual pace of 21.5% for the next five years, while Nvidia's estimated annual earnings growth is 52%. Assuming TSM indeed manages to clock such growth, its bottom line could jump to almost $17 per share after five years, translating into a stock price of $340, a 114% increase from current levels.

**NVIDIA Is Still Poised for Greatness**
NVIDIA is a compelling investment opportunity despite its large market capitalization of $2.9 trillion. The company's projected earnings of $4.50 per share in 2025 make it a good value at a price of $120 per share, with a valuation of 25 times next year's earnings. This is on the lower end of the 30-35x forward earnings multiple band observed among large tech companies, suggesting potential upside. The investment strategy involves initiating a core holding in NVIDIA and adjusting based on market trends and performance. While acknowledging potential risks, such as reduced capital expenditures from major customers, the company's position in the current market cycle and ongoing demand for its products justify its inclusion. The anticipated Blackwell cycle with strong growth rates is expected to allow NVIDIA to perform well over the next year, making it a valuable asset in a diversified investment portfolio.

**Nvidia Leads NY Stock Exchange to Close in the Green**
The New York stock exchange closed on Wednesday, September 11, with gains, thanks to the surge in Nvidia and related stocks, which helped to offset the losses recorded after the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Dow Jones index closed up 0.31%, at 40,861.71 points. The S&P 500 rose 1.07%, closing at 5,554.13 points, and the Nasdaq marked a gain of 2.17%, at 17,395.53 points. Initially, the opening of the New York stock exchange was negative, with declines of over 1%, following the August CPI, which indicated that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would not have space to initiate its monetary easing cycle more aggressively next week. However, investors returned to buying, mainly in search of technology stocks. Nvidia stood out, with gains of 8.80%, while Amazon rose 2.77% and Microsoft advanced 2.13%. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, said at a Goldman Sachs event that there is high demand for the company's new semiconductors, exceeding what the company has been able to deliver. Investors are also analyzing rumors that the US may allow the negotiation of chips with Saudi Arabia, according to sources revealed to Semafor. John Higgins, chief economist at Capital Economics, projects that the S&P 500 may surge around 500 points in the remaining months of 2024 and that a possible bubble in the technology sector has not burst. Higgins wrote, 'So far, there is not much evidence that AI adoption profits are waning,' highlighting Nvidia's latest earnings report. 'It's true that there has been a lot of talk about Nvidia having a perfect pricing. But the fact is that the company has continued to exceed analysts' expectations for revenue and earnings per share.'

**Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now? | The Motley Fool**
Nvidia's stock has dropped 22% from its June 2024 high, partly due to concerns that the AI bull market may be over. Despite this, analysts estimate Nvidia will earn $2.84 per share this year and $4 per share next year, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26. However, there are risks to consider, such as Nvidia's revenue being propped up by a few large customers, and the potential for pricing pressure as the AI market evolves. Analysts have noted that traffic to ChatGPT has dropped in recent months, and Amazon's management has stated that its AI customers want better value. Nvidia's gross margins are currently in the mid-70s, but this could revert to long-term averages, which would be disastrous for investors. As such, long-term investors should consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to accumulate shares slowly, and be aware of the potential risks and volatility of the stock.

**Could Nvidia Stock Double in the Next Year?**
Nvidia's stock has risen significantly in the past two years, with a 240% increase in 2023 and a 108% increase so far in 2024. The company's success is tied to the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) computing, and its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand. However, for Nvidia's stock to double, the company would need to be worth $5.2 trillion, which is a tall task in just a year. Analysts have already baked in 33% earnings growth into the stock, and the current valuation metrics are expensive, with a price tag of 50 times trailing earnings and 37 times forward earnings. While Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) rose 168% in Q2, it will face tough comparisons in the coming quarters. One analyst projects EPS of $5.45 for fiscal 2028, which is still short of the required $7.08 for the stock to double. Nvidia's growth trajectory suggests it will reach this mark around fiscal 2029, about four and a half years away. While a double in a year is unlikely, Nvidia's performance could still beat the broader market, which tends to double about every seven years.
