Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The question asks specifically about Spanish Wikipedia reaching 2M articles between Sept 15-Oct 1, 2024.

2. Current articles count is about 1.95M as of late July 2024, meaning ~50,000 articles needed to reach 2M.

3. Historical growth patterns:
- Spanish Wikipedia has shown steady but moderate growth
- Article creation rates have been relatively consistent
- Growth tends to be linear rather than exponential
- Based on recent trends, reaching 2M in late 2024 seems plausible

4. Timing considerations:
- We're looking at a very specific 2-week window
- This makes the probability lower as timing needs to be precise
- Even if 2M is reached in 2024, it could easily be before or after this window

5. Growth rate analysis:
- Current rate suggests 2M could be reached around September/October
- But exact timing is difficult to predict
- Natural variation in article creation rates adds uncertainty

6. The narrow time window (just over 2 weeks) makes this a relatively low probability event, even though the milestone itself is likely to be reached around this general timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 25.75%, with 20.25% being the most likely. Probability: 20.25%.
