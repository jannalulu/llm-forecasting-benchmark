**Philippines to File Diplomatic Protest Against China Over Airborne Provocation**
The Philippines will submit a diplomatic protest to China after Chinese military aircraft conducted threatening maneuvers against a Philippine Air Force plane during a patrol mission over Panatag Shoal. According to Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo, the incident, which occurred on Thursday, caught the Philippine authorities by surprise, as it happened just after a meeting between Manila and Beijing to better manage maritime disputes. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. emphasized the importance of condemning the provocative action of the Chinese aircraft, calling it 'perilous and illegal.' The incident raised concerns about the safety of Filipino crew members and the need to respond to such provocations. As reported by The Philippine Star, the Philippines and China recently held a meeting to discuss tensions in the South China Sea, aiming to restore trust and promote dialogue.

**Philippines to protest China's manoeuvres over disputed sea**
The Philippines plans to protest a recent incident in the South China Sea where a Chinese aircraft fired flares at a Philippine air force plane conducting a routine patrol over Scarborough Shoal. Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro stated, 'Naturally we cannot let this be. Even if it is just a diplomatic protest, we cannot not do it because otherwise will acquiesce this.' Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr 'strongly condemned' the incident, calling the Chinese aircraft's actions 'unjustified, illegal and reckless.' The Chinese military claimed the Philippine aircraft entered the airspace without authorization and were 'professionally and in accordance with the law' warned and expelled. The incident has raised concerns about instability in the region, with President Marcos stating, 'We have barely started to calm the waters, and it is already worrying that there could be instability in our airspace.'

**A complex, fluid dispute in South China Sea**
The Philippines and China are engaged in a complex and fluid dispute over the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea. The Philippines has been resupplying its troops on the shoal without prior notification to China, which has led to tensions between the two countries. China has insisted that the Philippines must receive prior approval from Beijing for troop rotation and reprovisioning, which Manila has rejected. The dispute has a long history, dating back to 1998 when the Philippines deliberately sunk a ship to prevent China's expansionist territorial ambitions. The Philippines has accused China of using water cannons and laser lights against their vessels, and a Chinese coastguard rammed a Filipino navy boat in June 2024, injuring a soldier. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Second Thomas Shoal is an underwater feature that cannot be occupied without a structure above it, and the sunken ship provides the necessary platform for Filipino soldiers to stay afloat. The dispute is not just about humanitarian considerations, but also about ownership of the feature and competing strategic designs in the South China Sea. The spat over reprovisioning goes beyond the Second Thomas Shoal and is ingrained in the foreign policy motivations of both countries, making it difficult to reconcile their political differences. The situation is unlikely to be resolved soon if both sides continue to bicker and disagree with each other. A multifaceted approach that emphasizes diplomacy, adherence to international law, and trust-building measures is needed to manage their disagreements and work towards a peaceful and stable resolution.

**Marcos, Duterte's bitter break-up portends major shake-up in Philippine politics**
The alliance between Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr and Vice-President Sara Duterte-Carpio has dissolved, according to observers. The break-up was evident when Duterte-Carpio did not attend President Marcos' State of the Nation Address (SONA) on July 22. The feud between the two powerful families has been escalating for months, with both sides accusing each other of being a drug user. The tensions have led to a series of events, including the release of a deepfake video purporting to show Marcos doing drugs, and the recall of 75 officers assigned to Duterte-Carpio's security detail. The vice-president has publicly pleaded for more security to protect her family, citing a photo surreptitiously taken of them at Manila's airport as an example of the threats they face. The government has also announced that it will not get in the way of the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the Duterte administration's bloody war on drugs. Observers say that the administration will have to double down on two of its most popular stances to win over public opinion: confronting Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea and banning Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (Pogos). However, the narrative the Marcos administration is building on these issues may not be enough to win over public opinion, as the Dutertes are known to be masters of courting public opinion. The break-up of the UniTeam alliance has significant implications for the country's future, as both families are now attempting to strengthen their own political coalitions ahead of the 2025 midterm elections. 'There is definitely no more UniTeam,' Maria Ela Atienza, a University of the Philippines political science professor, said. 'Both the president and vice-president can no longer diplomatically state that it is business as usual.'

**Weapons whiplash: US recalls potent midrange missiles from Philippines**
The US is recalling a midrange missile system from the Philippines, which was deployed for joint military exercises. The system, capable of firing SM-6 anti-aircraft missiles and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, was deployed in April and will be returned to the US in September. No reason was given for the recall. China has criticized the deployment, calling it a threat to regional security and stability. The US and Russia have been expanding their production and use of arms since a treaty banning certain types of missiles expired in 2019.

**â€˜Government acquiring more fighter jets amid West Philippine Sea air harassment'**
The Philippine government is acquiring more fighter jets for the Philippine Air Force (PAF) to strengthen its air defense capabilities, following China's recent act of harassment in the West Philippine Sea. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. has assured the military that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will definitely need more planes to address ongoing security concerns. Teodoro reaffirmed the Department of National Defense's (DND) commitment to strengthening the country's air defense systems, particularly through the acquisition of multi-role fighters. This comes after two Chinese fighter jets dropped flares on the flight path of a PAF aircraft conducting patrol operations in the airspace above Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal. The AFP denounced the illegal and dangerous actions of the two Chinese aircraft, which were done within the airspace of the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has already filed a diplomatic protest. Teodoro welcomed and honored the PAF contingent for their successful participation in Exercise Pitch Black 2024 in Australia, emphasizing the crucial collaboration across the Philippine government that enabled the deployment. He urged regular joint and combined exercises with like-minded partners, saying 'And now, the challenge for you is we need to sustain these kinds of operations. We have to make this the new normal. Year in, year out, more joint and combined exercises with like-minded partners,' he said.

**Philippines Submits Diplomatic Protest to China Over South China Sea Incident**
The Philippines has submitted a diplomatic protest to China following a recent aerial incident over a disputed area in the South China Sea. According to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, the incident occurred on August 8 when a Chinese military aircraft performed a 'dangerous maneuver' and dropped flares near a Philippine Air Force plane that was conducting a routine maritime patrol. The incident was condemned by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who described the Chinese actions as 'unjustified, unlawful, and reckless.' The Philippine military also condemned the incident, with General Romeo Brawner Jr. saying that the Chinese actions could have led to 'catastrophic consequences.' China has accused the Philippines of violating its airspace and disrupting military exercises, and has called on the Philippines to stop 'provoking' it. The incident is the latest in a series of disputes between China and several countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines, over China's claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea.

**Philippines lodges diplomatic protest with China over 'dangerous' air maneuvers**
The Philippines has filed a diplomatic protest with China over what it calls 'dangerous maneuvers' and flares against Filipino aircraft flying over the disputed South China Sea. According to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Teresita Daza, the protest was lodged in response to Chinese military planes allegedly conducting 'dangerous maneuvers' and dropping flares in the path of the Philippine Air Force aircraft, NC-212i, when the two were flying over Scarborough Shoal. China's People's Liberation Army Southern Theater Command stated that it deployed maritime and aerial forces to 'identify, verify, track, monitor, warn, and drive away the intruding aircraft in accordance with the law,' claiming the operation was carried out professionally and in adherence to legal standards.

**Philippines to File Diplomatic Protest With China Over Air Force Display**
The Philippines will file a diplomatic protest with China over a recent incident where two Chinese aircraft dropped flares in the path of a Philippine patrol plane. Philippine officials have denounced the move as 'unjustified, illegal' and 'very dangerous.' Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro called on China to abide by international laws, stating that this is part of a 'continuous pattern' of behavior demonstrated by Beijing in the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entirety of the South China Sea as its own, antagonizing neighboring countries and disregarding a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. Philippines President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. condemned the Chinese military's provocation, and Teodoro urged China to 'abide by international law' and 'deescalate,' acknowledging China's unwillingness to do so over the years. 'They will stick to their narrative that we know there is no international support whatsoever. All they have on their side is brute force and strength and might,' Teodoro said.

**Philippines to Submit Diplomatic Protest to China Over Scarborough Shoal Incident**
The Philippines will submit a diplomatic protest to China after the latest incident between the two countries' air forces near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. According to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, the incident occurred on August 8 when two Chinese military aircraft performed a 'dangerous maneuver' and launched flares at a Philippine Air Force turboprop aircraft over the shoal. Manila claimed that the Chinese actions put the lives of its crew at risk, but the aircraft returned safely to base. The Chinese actions were strongly condemned by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who described them as 'unjustified, illegal, and reckless, especially since the Philippine Air Force aircraft was conducting a routine security operation in the sovereign airspace of the Philippines.' Marcos expressed concern about the possible instability in the country's airspace. China defended its actions, stating that it had 'organized naval and air forces to lawfully remove the Philippine aircraft' after 'repeated warnings.' The Chinese military command emphasized that 'China has an undisputed sovereignty over the Huangyan Island (where the Scarborough Shoal is located) and the adjacent waters.' The incident follows a series of increasingly tense confrontations between Manila and Beijing, which claims most of the South China Sea and has occupied the Scarborough Shoal after a stalemate with the Philippines in 2012. In June, the Philippine military reported that one of its sailors lost a finger in a confrontation off the Second Thomas Shoal, another area of the South China Sea, when the Chinese coast guard also confiscated or destroyed Filipino equipment, including some arms. Beijing attributes the escalation to Manila and claims that its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportionate. After the second confrontation at the Second Thomas Shoal, the two countries agreed on a 'provisional agreement' to resupply Philippine troops on a warship stranded on a coral reef and to increase the number of communication lines to resolve disputes in the maritime zone. The Scarborough Shoal is at the center of a dispute between China, Taiwan, and the Philippines. It is located 240 kilometers west of Luzon Island, the largest in the Philippines, and nearly 900 kilometers from the Chinese province of Hainan. Last September, China installed a 300-meter floating barrier at its entrance to prevent Filipino fishing boats from accessing the area. The structure was later removed by Manila authorities, who denounced violations of the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The tribunal's verdict, which China has dismissed as 'a piece of trash,' contests its territorial claims in the South China Sea and asserts that Beijing has no 'historical rights' to the waters in question. In May, the Philippines accused Chinese fishermen of destroying the ecological environment of Scarborough through cyanide fishing, collecting giant clams, and devastating coral reefs. Two months later, China denied the accusations. Based on analyses conducted by government and research institutions, Beijing claimed that the waters around the shoal have low levels of heavy metals, pollutants, and hydrocarbons, which overall return 'an excellent environmental quality.'

**Philippines to File New Diplomatic Protest vs China after Airspace Incident**
The Philippines plans to file a new diplomatic protest against China after two Chinese aircraft dropped flares in the path of a Philippine Air Force aircraft patrolling Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) last week. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has 'strongly' condemned the incident, calling China's actions 'unjustified, illegal and reckless.' Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. stated that the Philippines cannot ignore the incident and must lodge a diplomatic protest, saying 'Naturally, we cannot just ignore this, even if the public says 'diplomatic protest, what not.' We cannot not do it; otherwise, we are acquiescing.' The Armed Forces of the Philippines described the incident as a threat to Philippine Air Force aircraft and its crew, and a contravention of international law and regulations governing safety of aviation.

**Philippines to Present Diplomatic Protest to China Over South China Sea Incident**
The Philippines will present a diplomatic protest to China after Chinese military aircraft launched flares near a Philippine military plane in the disputed South China Sea. 'We will definitely protest this latest incident that occurred at a time of calm (in the conflict between our countries),' said Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo. The Philippine Defense Secretary, Gilberto Teodoro, stated that the National Maritime Council is analyzing the incident, but provided no further details. The Philippine military reported that two Chinese aircraft executed a 'dangerous maneuver' and 'launched flares' near a Philippine military plane that was conducting a routine patrol. The Chinese military claimed that the Philippine plane had illegally invaded their territory despite repeated warnings. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. described the Chinese actions as 'unjustified, illegal, and reckless.' Tensions have been rising between China and the Philippines in recent months, particularly over the old Philippine ship Sierra Madre, which has been stranded on the Second Thomas reef in the South China Sea since 1999. The Philippine government claims that Second Thomas and Scarborough Shoal, occupied by China, are within their exclusive economic zone, which gives them the right to exploit the resources under international law. China claims historical reasons for nearly the entire South China Sea, through which 30% of global trade passes and which contains 12% of the world's fishing grounds, as well as oil and gas reserves.

**China Expels Philippine Plane from Disputed Scarborough Atoll Airspace**
The Chinese military expelled a Philippine military plane from the disputed Scarborough Atoll airspace without authorization, according to a statement from the South Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army. The plane, a Philippine NC-212 model, entered the airspace on Thursday, ignoring warnings. The Chinese military warned Manila to 'stop the provocations' and stated that Beijing has 'indisputable sovereignty' over the atoll and its adjacent waters. Hours earlier, the Philippines accused the Chinese air force of harassing one of its tactical transport planes on a routine patrol flight over the Scarborough Atoll. Two Chinese air force planes 'performed a dangerous maneuver and fired flares at' the Philippine plane, said General Romeo Brawner, chief of the Philippine military, in a statement describing the incident that occurred on Thursday. The incident was reported to the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has presented numerous diplomatic protests against China's actions. Brawner stated that the incident 'constituted a threat to Philippine Air Force aircraft and their crews, interfered with lawful flight operations in airspace within Philippine sovereignty and jurisdiction, and violated international law and regulations governing aviation safety.' The incident will not prevent the Philippines from conducting patrols in the region, Brawner said. The Scarborough Atoll is also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand, which have overlapping territorial claims in the busy maritime passage, a crucial route for global trade and security.

Wang made the statement during a meeting on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Vientiane, Laos. China has been protesting the growing US military presence in the Philippines, particularly the deployment of the medium-range missile system Typhon. The Typhon system, which was deployed in the northern part of the country in April and is scheduled to return to the US in September, is capable of reaching parts of the South China Sea, Taiwan, and eastern and southern Chinese cities. This is the first public meeting between Wang and Manalo since 2022. Wang also criticized countries that are fueling tensions between China and the Philippines, including the US, Japan, South Korea, and the EU. Despite this, China and the Philippines announced an agreement last weekend to prevent new clashes in the area of the Second Thomas Shoal, where a Philippine military ship has been stranded since 1999. The details of the agreement have not been disclosed by either side.

**Asean: Vientiane hosts foreign ministers, focus on Myanmar and South China Sea crises**
The foreign ministers of the Philippines and China have confirmed that they have reached an agreement to reduce tensions at the Second Thomas Shoal. The agreement follows a series of meetings between delegations from the two countries and intense exchanges of notes aimed at finding a mutually acceptable agreement without giving up their respective territorial claims. The Philippines has denied, contrary to what Beijing has claimed, that the agreement includes a commitment to inform Chinese authorities in advance of military resupply missions to the Second Thomas Shoal. During his third State of the Nation address, held on Sunday before the Congress, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that diplomacy is 'the only acceptable way to resolve' disputes. However, the head of state clarified that the Philippines 'will assert its rights and sovereignty as it has always done'.

**Philippines to still assert South China Sea rights after resupply deal with China**
The Philippines and China have reached a 'provisional arrangement' regarding China's resupply missions to the contested Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea. The Philippines will continue to assert its rights in the area, while China has demanded that the Philippines tow away its grounded warship, the Sierra Madre. The agreement does not prejudice the Philippines' national position, and the country will continue to send supply missions to the shoal. The US has welcomed the diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region.

**Newly upgraded communication line between Beijing and Manila helps de-escalate tension in SCS**
China and the Philippines have established a direct communication line between their leaders' offices to manage disputes in the South China Sea. This upgraded mechanism involves higher-level diplomatic departments and aims to prevent conflicts from escalating. Experts say that the effectiveness of this mechanism depends on the Philippines' sincerity in settling disputes and coordination among different departments within the country. The hotline is seen as a signal to extraterritorial countries that both China and the Philippines are willing to manage the situation in the South China Sea. However, some experts note that the Philippines' constant provocations and willingness to initiate international arbitration against China may hinder the effectiveness of the mechanism.

**South China Sea: Beijing urged to set deadline for Manila to withdraw from shoal**
A Chinese maritime expert, Wu Shicun, has urged Beijing to set a deadline for Manila to withdraw from Second Thomas Shoal, a move that would help end the long-standing tensions over the submerged reef. Wu said that China's delayed efforts to restore tranquility on the shoal may embolden the Philippines to take risky actions, and that Beijing should diplomatically present a time frame for the Philippines' withdrawal. He suggested that China take a firmer stance once the deadline expires, including imposing a temporary alert zone and blocking maritime and airdropped resupplies to the reef if Manila does not comply. Wu also recommended that Beijing register its dissatisfaction with Manila through their bilateral diplomatic consultation mechanism and inform the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other relevant parties through diplomatic channels beforehand.

Despite recent violent incidents between the Philippines and China, high-level diplomats from both sides met in Manila to de-escalate tensions. The ninth round of the bilateral consultation mechanism was a welcome respite, given a string of close calls in contested waters. The meeting aimed to improve maritime communication mechanisms and promote dialogue between their coastguards. The lack of timely diplomatic intervention has led to violent consequences, and talking does not resolve everything, but not talking can make it worse. The meeting came amid calls for greater diplomacy to stave off conflict and a legislative probe of previous arrangements to soothe tensions. China remains the Philippines' largest trade partner and a major investor, but tensions have affected economic ties.

**Yehey.com China-Philippines Relations in Spotlight Following South China Sea Dispute**
The South China Sea dispute between China and the Philippines has been ongoing for years, with tensions escalating in recent times. China has increased its military presence in the region, leading to diplomatic protests from the Philippines. Despite economic ties between the two nations, the Philippines' dependency on China makes it vulnerable to economic sanctions. The international community, including the US and Japan, has condemned China's actions and reaffirmed support for the Philippines. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is attempting to mediate the crisis through a Code of Conduct, but talks have been slow. The resolution of the dispute requires a combination of diplomacy, economic strategy, and possibly third-party mediation. Future steps to watch include ongoing diplomatic negotiations, changes in ASEAN Code of Conduct talks, economic strategies, and military movements.

**Philippines and China Work Together to Manage Tensions in South China Sea**
The Philippines is working with China to develop 'confidence-building measures' to manage tensions in the South China Sea after a recent incident that seriously injured a Filipino sailor, according to the Philippine Foreign Minister. 'We still believe in the primacy of dialogue, and diplomacy should prevail even in the face of these serious incidents, although I admit it is a challenge,' said Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo in a Senate hearing. The Philippines will not take any measures that compromise its sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in the South China Sea, Manalo added. 'We are not blind to the incidents that are happening,' he said. The Department of Foreign Affairs presented a diplomatic protest against China's 'illegal and aggressive' actions during a routine resupply mission on June 17, which, according to the Philippine military, seriously injured a sailor and damaged Manila's vessels. China disputed the Philippines' account, with its Foreign Ministry saying that the actions taken by its coast guard were necessary, legal, and irreproachable. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro praised the Philippine troops for containing the situation and preventing it from escalating further. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. China claims almost the entire South China Sea with its so-called 'nine-dash line', which overlaps with the exclusive economic zones of rival claimants Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. A 2016 arbitration tribunal decision, which Beijing does not recognize, invalidated China's claim to the strategic waters.

The US has criticized China's actions in the South China Sea, calling them irresponsible, aggressive, and destabilizing.

Kritenbrink said that the US will continue to support its Filipino allies and has publicly and privately told Beijing that the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty is 'ironclad'. He also emphasized that every country in the region, including China, must respect international law and behave responsibly in the maritime sphere. The US and Vietnam have officially elevated their relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level of diplomatic relations, during President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi in September 2023. Kritenbrink called the upgrade 'historic and momentous' and wants to maintain the momentum to ensure that all agreements are implemented. The US and Vietnam have a strong partnership, and Kritenbrink believes that it has never been stronger.

**Philippines Intensifies Strategy in South China Sea Dispute**
The Philippines has adopted a more assertive stance in the South China Sea dispute, challenging China's maritime claims by increasing transparency and strengthening its military alliance with the United States. This move was triggered by a February 2023 decision to release photos of a military-grade laser directed at a Filipino ship, as reported by National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya. The transparency campaign, led by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, aims to build international support by documenting encounters with Chinese forces and incorporating foreign journalists in coast guard missions. The Philippines' efforts have included releasing images showing aggressive actions by Chinese vessels, such as water cannon use against Filipino ships. The intensification of the disputes has been marked by incidents near Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippine Navy maintains a presence on the grounded BRP Sierra Madre. Recent confrontations have increased, with the Philippine Coast Guard reporting a surge in Chinese vessels from an average of one in 2021 to approximately 14 in 2023, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The conflict has drawn international attention, with statements of support from various countries and a renewed defense agreement with the US, providing access to additional military bases in the Philippines. This has raised concerns about possible US involvement under the mutual defense treaty in case the situation escalates. Although the Philippines has gained diplomatic support, they remain cautious about possible Chinese economic retaliation, their second-largest export market in 2023. The recent political approach also risks provoking China to adopt a 'tougher approach', according to political scientist Edcel John Ibarra. However, Philippine Ambassador to Washington JosÃ© Manuel Romualdez expressed hope to maintain economic relations alongside efforts to resolve the dispute peacefully. This assertive stance by the Philippines has surprised neighboring countries with similar maritime disputes, signaling a potential new approach to dealing with tensions with Beijing. The situation remains a delicate balancing act, with the Philippines seeking to assert its sovereignty while avoiding an escalation that could lead to hostility.

**China and Philippines Engage in Tensions Over South China Sea Disputes**
Tensions between China and the Philippines continue to simmer over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The Philippine military has accused China of illegal activities in the area, including the blocking of supply ships and the use of aggressive and dangerous maneuvers. The Chinese coast guard has responded by claiming that a Philippine supply ship intentionally and recklessly approached a Chinese ship, leading to a collision. The dispute has been ongoing for years, with the Philippines and China both claiming sovereignty over the area. The United States has expressed support for the Philippines and has warned that any attack on Philippine forces in the area would activate a mutual defense treaty. The situation remains tense, with both sides engaging in a series of confrontations and warnings. Experts believe that the situation could escalate into a larger conflict, but China's diplomatic and military skills may be able to prevent this.
