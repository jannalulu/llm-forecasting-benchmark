Nate Silver: [reviewing data on holographic display] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again regarding the Meta layoffs question.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given Meta's aggressive cost-cutting in 2022 and 2023, plus their strong AI investments and improved financial performance in early 2024, our models calculated just a 12.45% probability of new layoffs being reported by TechCrunch before October 1st.

Nate: The low probability made sense. Zuckerberg had already trimmed significantly during the "year of efficiency" in 2023. Another round would've signaled deeper problems.

Philip: [examining charts] Our models factored in Meta's Q2 2024 revenue growth and their focus on AI development rather than workforce reduction. The 12.45% probability reflected the small but real possibility of targeted restructuring, but ultimately, no layoffs materialized.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his tablet] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again regarding the Meta layoffs question.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given Meta's aggressive cost-cutting in 2022 and 2023, plus their strong AI investments and improved financial performance in early 2024, our models predicted a low probability of new layoffs being reported by TechCrunch.

Nate: No, our models had it at 12.45%. The efficiency measures Zuckerberg implemented in their "Year of Efficiency" seemed to have stabilized their workforce needs.

Philip: [examining charts] Correct. The market conditions didn't support another round of cuts. Their Q2 2024 earnings were solid, and their Metaverse pivot was finally showing returns. The probability of layoffs was low, but not negligible.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Coffee?

Philip: [smiling] Always.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on a holographic display] "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had Meta layoffs at 32.4% probability."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given Meta's aggressive cost-cutting in 2022 and 2023, and their pivot to the 'year of efficiency,' our models suggested they'd be more stable through Q3 2024. The AI investments were costly, but their revenue streams remained solid."

Nate: "The key signal was Zuckerberg's February announcement about flatter organizational structure. That suggested they'd already optimized their workforce."

Philip: "Precisely. While tech layoffs continued industry-wide in 2024, Meta's previous rounds meant they'd already right-sized. The 32.4% probability reflected some uncertainty due to market conditions, but indicated they'd likely maintain their workforce through September."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting."

Title: "The Oracle's Echo"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, our models were spot on again about Meta's layoff situation."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Based on our data cutoff from August 27th, we calculated a 12.3% probability of Tech Crunch reporting new Meta layoffs before October."

Nate: "The indicators were there - Meta's strong Q2 earnings, Zuckerberg's focus on the 'year of efficiency,' and their previous massive layoffs in 2023 suggested they'd already right-sized their workforce."

Tetlock: "Right. The AI investments were actually driving growth rather than creating redundancies. Plus, their stock performance was stable."

Nate: "No surprise Tech Crunch didn't report any layoffs. When our models show 12.3%, it's a strong signal for 'no.'"

Tetlock: "No, our models had it at 32.45%. Given Meta's aggressive cost-cutting in 2022 and 2023, they'd already streamlined significantly. By August 2024, our data showed their workforce optimization was largely complete."

Nate: "Agreed. The AI investments were actually driving selective hiring. Looking back at our August data, Meta's financial reports showed strong digital ad revenue. Zuckerberg's focus had shifted from 'year of efficiency' to AI infrastructure expansion."

Tetlock: "The model caught that shift. Tech layoffs were still happening industry-wide, but Meta had positioned itself differently after those earlier cuts. The 32.45% reflected real but diminishing odds of another round."
