To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by examining the base rates and key evidence, then consider arguments for higher and lower probabilities before synthesizing a final forecast.

Base rates:
Russia conducted one partial mobilization in September 2022. In the nearly 2 years since then, no further official mobilization has been announced. This suggests a relatively low base rate for mobilizations.

Key evidence:

1. Multiple recent statements from Russian officials (including Putin and Peskov) denying plans for or need of further mobilization.

2. Reports that Russia is actively recruiting contract soldiers, with claims of 160,000+ new recruits in 2024 so far.

3. ISW assessments that Russia's current recruitment and "crypto-mobilization" efforts are insufficient for large-scale offensives on multiple fronts.

4. Some reports/rumors of potential mobilization plans, but these are denied by official sources.

5. Upcoming fall 2024 implementation of electronic conscription records and travel restrictions, which could facilitate mobilization.

Arguments for lower probability:

1. Consistent official denials of mobilization plans suggest it's not imminent.
2. Success in contract soldier recruitment may reduce need for formal mobilization.
3. Political cost of another mobilization may deter Russian leadership.
4. Current "crypto-mobilization" efforts may be seen as sufficient.

Arguments for higher probability:

1. ISW assessments suggest current recruitment is insufficient for Russia's military goals.
2. Electronic conscription system implementation in fall 2024 could enable mobilization.
3. Historical precedent of Russian government denying mobilization plans before the September 2022 mobilization.
4. Ongoing war likely creates continuous pressure for more troops.

Synthesis:
The evidence suggests a relatively low probability of formal mobilization by September 30, 2024. Official denials and apparent success in contract recruitment argue against it. However, the implementation of new conscription systems, ongoing war needs, and past precedent of denials before mobilization leave some possibility open.

Given the specific requirement for ISW to report a second mobilization wave, and their careful analysis, I believe the probability is on the lower end but non-negligible.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To assess the likelihood of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Base rate: Russia conducted one partial mobilization in September 2022. No second wave has occurred in nearly 2 years since then, despite ongoing war.

2. Official denials: Russian officials, including Putin and Peskov, have repeatedly denied plans for new mobilization throughout 2023 and 2024. While their statements aren't always reliable, consistent denials across time reduce likelihood.

3. Alternatives to mobilization: Russia has been actively recruiting contract soldiers and volunteers, with reports of 30,000-40,000 new recruits monthly. This suggests they are finding alternatives to formal mobilization.

4. ISW assessments: Recent ISW reports (e.g. July 16-18, 2024) mention Russia's "crypto-mobilization" efforts but do not indicate an imminent official mobilization wave.

5. Timeframe: Only about 2 months remain until the September 30 deadline, leaving limited time for Russia to announce and implement a major mobilization.

6. Political considerations: A new mobilization could be unpopular domestically. Russia may want to avoid this, especially if they believe current troop levels are sufficient.

7. Military needs: Some reports suggest Russia needs more troops, but it's unclear if this necessitates formal mobilization versus continued volunteer recruitment.

8. Past predictions: Previous predictions of imminent Russian mobilization (e.g. in early 2023) did not materialize, suggesting caution in predicting such events.

Balancing these factors, I assess that a second Russian mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, as reported by ISW, is unlikely but not impossible. The consistent denials, ongoing alternatives to mobilization, and limited remaining timeframe are strong arguments against. However, Russia's military needs and past unpredictability leave some possibility.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To approach this question, I'll start by examining the base rates and historical context, then analyze the recent evidence and trends, and finally weigh the competing factors to arrive at a forecast.

Base rates and historical context:
- Russia conducted a partial mobilization from September 21 to October 31, 2022, calling up 300,000 reservists.
- Since then, Russia has relied on voluntary recruitment rather than formal mobilization.
- The Kremlin has repeatedly denied plans for further mobilization throughout 2023 and 2024.

Recent evidence and trends:
1. Continued denials: As recently as May 25, 2024, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the need for mobilization, citing ongoing voluntary recruitment.

2. Voluntary recruitment efforts: 
   - Russia reportedly recruited 30,000-40,000 soldiers monthly in 2024.
   - Putin claimed 160,000 new recruits signed contracts in the first half of 2024.

3. Potential preparation for mobilization:
   - Russia plans to restrict travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals starting fall 2024.
   - An electronic register of summonses is expected to be operational by fall 2024.

4. Military needs:
   - Some reports suggest Russia needs more manpower for large-scale offensives.
   - The ISW noted Russia's "crypto-mobilization" efforts are generating increasing financial costs.

5. Political considerations:
   - Putin seems reluctant to announce mobilization due to potential domestic backlash.
   - The Kremlin appears to prefer gradual, less visible methods of recruitment.

Weighing the evidence:

Arguments for lower probability:
1. Consistent official denials of mobilization plans.
2. Apparent success of voluntary recruitment efforts so far.
3. Political risks of formal mobilization for Putin's regime.

Arguments for higher probability:
1. Preparations for restricting travel of conscripts suggest possible mobilization plans.
2. Reports of Russia needing more manpower for offensives.
3. Historical precedent of the 2022 mobilization despite prior denials.

Balancing these factors, I lean towards a lower probability but with significant uncertainty. The Kremlin's consistent denials and preference for less visible methods of recruitment suggest they will try to avoid formal mobilization if possible. However, the preparations for travel restrictions and potential military needs create a non-negligible chance of mobilization.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To approach this question, I'll start by looking at relevant historical patterns and base rates, then adjust based on the specific situation and latest evidence.

Key considerations:

1. Historical precedent: Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022, calling up 300,000 reservists. This sets a precedent that mobilization is a tool Russia is willing to use.

2. Current troop levels: Putin stated in June 2024 that nearly 700,000 Russian soldiers are involved in the Ukraine conflict, up from 617,000 in December 2023. This suggests Russia has been able to increase troop numbers without formal mobilization.

3. Ongoing recruitment: Multiple sources indicate Russia is recruiting about 30,000 new soldiers per month through contract service, allowing them to maintain forces without mobilization.

4. Official denials: The Kremlin has repeatedly denied plans for new mobilization, most recently in May 2024. However, they also denied plans before the 2022 mobilization.

5. Military needs: Some analysts suggest Russia needs more troops to conduct large-scale offensives, but Putin has indicated a preference for a gradual approach.

6. Political considerations: Mobilization in 2022 was unpopular and led to many Russians fleeing the country. Putin may be hesitant to repeat this.

7. Timing: The question asks about mobilization by September 30, 2024, which is relatively soon. Major policy shifts often take time to implement.

8. ISW reporting: The ISW has not reported any concrete plans for mobilization, though they've noted Russia's "crypto-mobilization" efforts.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a relatively low chance of Russia conducting an official second mobilization wave by September 30, 2024. The current recruitment efforts seem to be meeting Russia's needs for now, and the political costs of mobilization are high. However, the situation remains fluid, and unexpected developments in the war could change the calculus.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Reference class: The last major mobilization in Russia was in September 2022. Since then, there have been no official mobilizations, despite ongoing conflict.

2. Timeline: We're forecasting until September 30, 2024, which is about 14 months from now.

3. Official statements: The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the need for new mobilization. As recently as May 25, 2024, Dmitry Peskov stated there's no need for mobilization.

4. Ongoing recruitment: Russia is reportedly recruiting about 30,000-40,000 soldiers per month through contract service.

5. Military needs: Some reports suggest Russia may need additional troops to maintain its offensive capabilities.

6. Past behavior: Russia has previously denied plans for mobilization right up until announcing one.

7. Economic factors: A new mobilization could have significant economic impacts, which Russia might want to avoid.

8. Political considerations: Putin may want to avoid the political backlash of another mobilization.

9. ISW's role: The question specifically asks about ISW's reporting, not the actual occurrence of mobilization.

10. Time pressure: As we get closer to September 30, 2024, the likelihood decreases as there's less time for it to happen and be reported by ISW.

- However, Russia's past behavior and potential military needs indicate it's not impossible.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Reference class: The last major mobilization in Russia was in September 2022. Since then, there have been no official mobilizations, despite ongoing conflict.

2. Timeline: We're forecasting until September 30, 2024, which is about 14 months from now.

3. Official statements: The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the need for new mobilization. As recently as May 25, 2024, Dmitry Peskov stated there's no need for mobilization.

4. Ongoing recruitment: Russia is reportedly recruiting about 30,000-40,000 soldiers per month through contract service.

5. Military needs: Some reports suggest Russia may need additional troops to maintain its offensive capabilities.

6. Past behavior: Russia has previously denied plans for mobilization right up until announcing one.

7. Economic factors: A new mobilization could have significant economic impacts, which Russia might want to avoid.

8. Political considerations: Putin may want to avoid the political backlash of another mobilization.

9. ISW's role: The question specifically asks about ISW's reporting, not the actual occurrence of mobilization.

10. Time pressure: As we get closer to September 30, 2024, the likelihood decreases as there's less time for it to happen and be reported by ISW.

Balancing these factors:

- The consistent official denials and ongoing contract recruitment suggest a low probability.
- However, Russia's past behavior and potential military needs indicate it's not impossible.
- The specific requirement for ISW reporting adds another layer of uncertainty.
- The timeline until September 30, 2024 provides a significant window for the situation to change.

Given these considerations, I believe the probability is low but not negligible. 

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.
