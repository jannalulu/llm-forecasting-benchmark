**Navigating an Open Convention: Potential Pitfalls for Kamala Harris and the Democrats in the 2024 Election**
President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement. This has led to the possibility of a brokered convention, where delegates fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot. A brokered convention has not occurred in 70 years, and could lead to a chaotic nominating process. The last time a brokered convention happened was in 1952, when Adlai Stevenson was nominated on the third ballot. Experts say that a brokered convention would be unpredictable and could lead to a candidate who is less likely to win the White House. However, some argue that a brokered convention could benefit the Democrats if their opponent is Donald Trump, who has high negatives. 'This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,' said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University. 'Because Donald Trump is so singularly unpopular as the opposing party nominee, it potentially does give the Democratic Party a small advantage,' he added.

**What's Next? – DW – July 21, 2024**
US President Joe Biden has announced that he will not run for re-election in the 2024 presidential election. This means that the Democratic Party needs to find a new presidential candidate or candidate. The party will hold a convention in August to nominate a new candidate. The convention is expected to be an 'open convention', where delegates are free to vote for any candidate they choose. The party will try to find a candidate who can unite the party and motivate voters across the ideological spectrum. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes in the first round, the convention will become a 'brokered convention', where party leaders and candidates will try to negotiate and form alliances to win over delegates.

**Brokered Convention, Open Convention Or ‘Mini-Primary'? Democrats Float Plan B As Biden's Fate In Doubt**
As President Joe Biden's fate in the 2024 election remains uncertain, Democrats are exploring options for choosing a replacement if he decides to drop out. The party is considering a 'mini-primary', where potential replacements would campaign and debate before the convention, or an open convention, where delegates would be free to vote for any candidate. If Biden stays in the race, a contested convention could occur, where his opponents would need to secure a significant share of his pledged delegates to win. Vice President Kamala Harris is seen as the most likely replacement option, with name recognition and a strong campaign war chest. Other names floated as potential replacements include Democratic governors and lawmakers.

**Explained: How a brokered convention to swap Joe Biden might impact Democrats' chances in the 2024 election**
President Joe Biden is facing pressure to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, but if he were to exit, a brokered convention could ensue. A brokered convention occurs when no candidate receives a majority of delegates on the first ballot. This would lead to a complex and potentially exhausting nominating process. The last time a brokered convention occurred was in 1952. If Biden were to drop out, there is no clear alternative replacement, and the convention would be a public relations event for the party and president. However, if a brokered convention were to happen, it could benefit Democrats as their opponent, Donald Trump, has high negatives. 'This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,' said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University.

**Jen Psaki pours cold water on proposal to switch to a brokered Democratic convention**
Jen Psaki, former Joe Biden White House press secretary and current MSNBC host, cautions that a brokered Democratic convention, proposed by some liberal commentators after Biden's poor debate performance, is easier to talk about than to execute. She highlights the potential consequences, including the president staying neutral and not endorsing his own vice president, empowering party insiders to choose the nominee, and potentially positioning an untested candidate for the national spotlight. Psaki also discusses the urgency of the 2024 election and the need for Democrats to rally behind Biden, despite his flaws, to prevent the erosion of democracy.

**Jim Fossel: A brokered convention is an undemocratic event**
Jim Fossel argues that a brokered convention, where the Democratic Party chooses its nominee without a primary election, is an undemocratic event. He criticizes President Biden for withdrawing from the race, citing his poor debate performance, and notes that this will lead to a brokered convention. Fossel believes that this process is undemocratic because it bypasses the voters and allows party insiders and activists to choose the nominee. He also questions the qualifications of these individuals to make such a decision.

**The Process to Choose Joe Biden's Successor as Democratic Party's Presidential Candidate**
As Joe Biden announced his decision not to run for re-election, the process to choose his successor as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate has begun. The key dates are August 1, when a telephonic vote will take place to select the nominee, and August 19-22, when the Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago. Kamala Harris, who was Biden's running mate, has been endorsed by the president, but it's the delegates who will ultimately decide who will lead the party in the 2024 presidential election. If more candidates emerge, such as Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, the party may face a 'brokered convention', where alliances will be formed to strengthen each candidate's chances. The candidate who wins the most delegates, exceeding 1,968, will be chosen as the Democratic Party's nominee.

**Who Will Be the Next US President? The Process of Selecting the Democratic Nominee**
President Joe Biden has announced the end of his re-election campaign, but it's unclear who will be the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. Kamala Harris, the current vice president, is a strong contender, but other governors, such as Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, may also run. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) had planned to hold a virtual vote in August to determine the nominee, but it's unclear if this will happen. If not, the nominee will be chosen at the convention, where delegates will play a crucial role. These delegates were chosen during the primary elections, where voters did not directly elect their preferred candidate, but rather selected delegates who will vote for the nominee at the convention. The delegates are not automatically committed to Harris, and may choose to support another candidate. This could lead to a 'brokered convention', where multiple candidates compete for the nomination. This scenario has not occurred in over 70 years, with the last 'brokered convention' taking place in 1952. A 'brokered convention' would involve multiple candidates vying for the nomination, with delegates negotiating and voting in multiple rounds until a winner is chosen.

**How the US Democratic Party Will Choose Its Next Presidential Candidate**
US President Joe Biden has announced the end of his re-election campaign, but it's not clear who will be the Democratic Party's nominee for the November election. Vice President Kamala Harris is a strong contender, but other governors, such as Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, may also run for the nomination. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) had planned a virtual vote in August to determine the nominee, but it's unclear if this plan will be maintained. If not, the nominee will be chosen at the convention, where delegates will play a crucial role. These delegates were chosen during the Democratic primaries, where voters did not directly elect their favorite candidate, but rather designated 4,000 delegates who will formally choose the party's nominee at the convention. The delegates are not automatically committed to Harris, and they may choose another candidate if they believe they have a better chance of winning against Republican Donald Trump. This could lead to a 'brokered convention', a scenario that has not occurred in over 70 years. In a brokered convention, multiple candidates may have a significant amount of support from delegates, leading to a competitive and unpredictable process.

**How An Open Convention Works — And How It Could Backfire And Cost Kamala Harris And Democrats The 2024 Election**
After President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, the Democratic Party is facing the possibility of a brokered convention, where delegates will vote to choose a new nominee. This would be the first brokered convention in 70 years. A brokered convention is a process where delegates fail to nominate a candidate in the first round, and voting continues until a candidate receives a majority of delegates. The last time this happened was in 1952. The process can be chaotic and unpredictable, with no clear standards or procedures. Some experts believe that a brokered convention could benefit the Democratic Party, as their opponent, Donald Trump, has high negative ratings. However, it could also lead to a divided party and a lack of unity behind the nominee.

President Joe Biden has dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement.

This has not happened in 70 years, and could lead to chaos. A brokered convention would require multiple rounds of voting until a candidate receives a majority of delegates.

**Biden has withdrawn from the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris. Here's what could happen next**
President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. This unexpected move has left Democrats scrambling to navigate a shift this late in the election year. With Biden's withdrawal, the party must now decide on a new nominee, with Harris being the most likely candidate. If the delegates fail to unite behind one candidate, a brokered convention could occur, where delegates act as free agents and negotiate with party leadership. Harris has acknowledged Biden's 'slow start' in the debate and emphasized character over style, while Trump's campaign has criticized her as a joke. Democrats are now racing to back Harris as the new nominee.

**President Biden dropping out could force an open convention at the DNC. Here's what that means**
President Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race has set the stage for a potential open convention at the Democratic National Convention. This would allow delegates to choose a new nominee, rather than automatically endorsing Biden. The deadline for candidates to enter the race is August 7, and the convention begins on August 19. Kamala Harris, who Biden has endorsed, would likely be a top contender, but other candidates such as Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, and Michelle Obama could also enter the race. The outcome would depend on the delegates' votes, with no direct participation from voters. A brokered convention could lead to a lengthy and complex process, with deals being brokered behind the scenes to commit delegates to certain candidates.

**What Happens Now That Joe Biden Has Dropped Out of the Presidential Race?**
After announcing his decision not to run for re-election, President Joe Biden's departure from the presidential race has opened up the Democratic Party's nomination process. The party will now hold an open convention, where delegates will vote for a new candidate. The process typically begins with primaries, where voters in each state choose their preferred candidate. The candidate with the most votes in each state wins the corresponding number of delegates. In the Democratic National Convention, the delegates will vote for a new presidential candidate. With Biden's departure, the 3,900 delegates he had won are now free to vote for any candidate. The party will try to find a candidate who can unite the party's diverse ideological spectrum. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, the convention will become a brokered convention, where powerful party figures and candidates will try to win over delegates. The process will continue until a candidate receives more than 50% of the votes. The new candidate will be chosen to represent the Democratic Party in the 2024 presidential election.

**The Path to Choosing Biden's Running Mate: A Democratic Party Conundrum**
US President Joe Biden announced the end of his re-election campaign, but it's unclear who will be the Democratic Party's nominee to challenge Republican Donald Trump in the November elections. Kamala Harris, the current vice president, is a likely candidate, but others, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, may also run. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) had planned a virtual vote in August to determine the nominee, but it's unclear if this plan will be maintained. If not, the new candidate will be chosen at the convention, where delegates who were chosen during the Democratic primaries will play a crucial role. These delegates are not automatically committed to Harris, and they may choose to support other candidates. This flexibility opens the possibility of a 'brokered convention', a scenario that has not occurred in over 70 years. A brokered convention would happen if there are multiple candidates with significant support from delegates, leading to a competitive process where candidates negotiate with delegates to secure their nomination.

**Will Kamala Harris be the Next Democratic Nominee?**
The possibility of a brokered convention at the Democratic Party's nominating convention is being discussed, as other candidates, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, may launch their own campaigns, challenging Kamala Harris's candidacy. The traditional process of selecting the party's nominee involves a virtual vote in August, but some party members consider this to be lacking in transparency. If the virtual vote is suspended, the new candidate will be chosen at the convention, where delegates who were chosen during the Democratic primaries will play a crucial role. These delegates are not automatically committed to Harris, and they may choose to support other candidates. This flexibility in the delegates' votes opens the possibility of a brokered convention, a scenario that has not occurred in over 70 years.

President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the 2024 presidential election race, leaving the United States in uncharted territory.

**Here's How Democrats Could Pick A New Nominee As Joe Biden Drops Out**
President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 race, leaving the Democratic Party to choose a new nominee. Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to have an advantage due to Biden's endorsement. The party could conduct a'mini-primary' to survey potential Biden replacements, which could involve a campaign blitz between hopefuls. If the party doesn't coalesce behind a new nominee, the convention could become a political cage match. Democrats could also hold an open convention, leaving Biden's delegates free to vote for whoever they please, or a brokered convention, where all delegates would show up uncommitted and subject to back-room deals. Harris is widely considered the most likely option to replace Biden due to her name recognition and ability to seamlessly take over his campaign war chest.

**How the Democratic Party Will Choose Its Next Presidential Candidate**
US President Joe Biden announced that he will not run for re-election. This means that the Democratic Party must now find a new candidate for the 2024 presidential election. The party's primary election process will take place in August, where delegates will vote to choose the party's nominee. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, the convention will move to a 'brokered convention', where party leaders and delegates will negotiate to find a compromise candidate. The process is similar to the one depicted in popular American TV shows such as 'West Wing' and 'House of Cards'. The last brokered convention was held in 1952. The Democratic Party's national committee and superdelegates will also play a crucial role in the process, as they can vote in the second round of voting. The new candidate will be chosen by the end of August and will represent the Democratic Party in the 2024 presidential election.

Kamala Harris is considered the frontrunner, but other candidates like Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, J.B. Pritzker, and Josh Shapiro are also in the running. The Democratic National Convention will select the new nominee, with roughly 3,900 pledged delegates and 700 'automatic' delegates, also known as superdelegates, having a say in the decision. The convention could result in an open convention or a brokered convention, where multiple candidates compete and the delegates vote for their choice. The new nominee will also have to choose a new vice presidential running mate, and the party will have to decide how to handle Biden's campaign funds.

**Biden's Withdrawal: How the Democratic Party Will Choose a New Presidential Candidate**
US President Joe Biden has announced that he will not run for re-election. This means that the Democratic Party must find a new candidate for the presidency within three months before the November 5 election. The party's national convention will take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22, where delegates will vote for the new candidate. The process is known as an 'open convention', where any candidate who has gathered the support of at least 600 delegates can run for the nomination. The current Vice President, Kamala Harris, is one of the likely candidates, but she cannot automatically replace Biden as the party's nominee. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes in the first round, the convention will move to a 'brokered convention', where delegates will negotiate and bargain with each other to find a consensus candidate. The process is expected to be intense and dramatic, with potential alliances and deals being formed to secure the nomination.

**What's Next? – DW – July 21, 2024**
US President Joe Biden has announced that he will not run for re-election in the 2024 presidential election. This means that the Democratic Party needs to find a new presidential candidate or candidate. The party will hold a convention in August to nominate a new candidate. The convention is expected to be an 'open convention', where delegates are free to vote for any candidate they choose. The party will try to find a candidate who can unite the party and motivate voters across the ideological spectrum. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes in the first round, the convention will become a 'brokered convention', where party leaders and candidates will try to negotiate and form alliances to win over delegates.

**Le ipotesi per sostituire Biden: Kamala Harris in cima alla lista (e la possibilità di una «convention contested o brokered»)**
There are two possible scenarios if President Biden decides to step down. The first is that he nominates Kamala Harris as his successor, who would then run for president with a vice president capable of winning votes in the crucial states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Alternatively, the Democratic Party could hold a brokered convention, where delegates would choose a new candidate. Some leaders are suggesting that Biden should step down for the good of the party and to preserve his legacy. If the party leaders support this decision, it's unlikely that other prominent candidates would emerge. However, there are also those who believe that a more radical change is needed, including the possibility of a contested convention. This would be a chaotic but also energizing scenario, with delegates free to choose from various candidates who would have appeared on TV in the days leading up to the convention. This would be a significant departure from the usual process, with the last brokered convention dating back to 1952.

Representatives from top cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase, Ripple, and Andreessen Horowitz, are attending the Republican National Convention (RNC) to make their case to GOP power brokers. This is part of an aggressive push to influence the 2024 elections in favor of the industry. The Republican Party has been increasingly embracing the industry and its policy goals, with former President Donald Trump courting digital asset enthusiasts on the campaign trail and the GOP platform including pro-crypto language. The firms plan to send delegations to both the RNC and the Democratic National Convention in August.

**Rob Richie: How to prepare for a brokered Democratic convention**
As the 2024 Democratic convention approaches, the party must consider how to choose a new nominee if Joe Biden withdraws. One option is for Biden to endorse Kamala Harris and ask his delegates to follow his lead. However, Rep. Jim Clyburn suggests that Harris should face a mini-primary among delegates before the convention. The article proposes using ranked-choice voting to determine the nominee, which was used effectively in four Democratic Party-run presidential primaries in 2020. The process would involve an initial traditional vote, followed by a ranked-choice vote if no candidate earns a majority. This would promote unity and majority rules, and could be used in future presidential election cycles.

**Brokered Convention, Open Convention Or ‘Mini-Primary'? Democrats Float Plan B As Biden's Fate In Doubt**
As President Joe Biden's fate in the 2024 election remains uncertain, Democrats are exploring options for choosing a replacement if he decides to drop out. The party is considering a 'mini-primary', where potential replacements would campaign and debate before the convention, or an open convention, where delegates would be free to vote for any candidate. If Biden stays in the race, a contested convention could occur, where his opponents would need to secure a significant share of his pledged delegates to win. Vice President Kamala Harris is seen as the most likely replacement option, with name recognition and a strong campaign war chest. Other names floated as potential replacements include Democratic governors and lawmakers.

**When was the last brokered convention?**
President Joe Biden has been under scrutiny since his debate performance on June 27, but he remains committed to staying in the race. If he drops out, the Democratic Party may hold a brokered convention in August to elect a replacement. A brokered convention occurs when a party's nominee isn't selected by a majority in the first round of delegate voting, allowing delegates to vote for another preferred candidate. The last brokered convention was held at the 1952 Democratic National Convention, where Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson won the nomination after three rounds of voting. Prior to 1968, brokered conventions were common, but the chaos at the Democratic National Convention that year led to the establishment of rules requiring delegates to be bound by primary election results. Since then, there has not been a brokered convention.

**Transcript: Ezra Klein Interviews Jamelle Bouie**
Ezra Klein interviews Jamelle Bouie, a Times Opinion columnist, about the possibility of Joe Biden running for re-election in 2024. Bouie discusses the risks of a brokered convention and the potential consequences of Biden's age and declining health. He also weighs in on the question of whether Biden is fit to serve as president and whether he should drop out of the race. Bouie argues that the decision ultimately lies with Biden and that the Democratic Party does not have the power to force him to step down.

**Don't fear a brokered convention: the ‘smoke-filled room' could be Dems' boon**
The Democratic Party is experiencing a collective anxiety attack. Democrats are worried that President Biden will likely lose in November if he remains on the ticket, as concerns about his age and declining mental abilities have become public. However, a brokered convention could be a blessing in disguise for the party, allowing them to reassess their options and potentially nominate a stronger candidate.

**Explained: How a brokered convention to swap Joe Biden might impact Democrats' chances in the 2024 election**
President Joe Biden is facing pressure to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, but if he were to exit, a brokered convention could ensue. A brokered convention occurs when no candidate receives a majority of delegates on the first ballot. This would lead to a complex and potentially exhausting nominating process. The last time a brokered convention occurred was in 1952. If Biden were to drop out, there is no clear alternative replacement, and the convention would be a public relations event for the party and president. However, if a brokered convention were to happen, it could benefit Democrats as their opponent, Donald Trump, has high negatives. 'This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,' said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University.

**How would a brokered convention to replace Joe Biden work - and could it backfire and cost Democrats the 2024 election**
President Joe Biden is facing pressure to drop out of the presidential race, and if he does, a brokered convention could occur for the first time in over 70 years. A brokered convention is a nominating convention where delegates fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot, and it would require multiple rounds of voting until a candidate receives a majority of delegates. The last time a brokered convention occurred was in 1952. If Biden were to exit the race, there is no clear alternative replacement, and the convention would be a wild and potentially exhausting process. The Democratic National Committee has emphasized that Biden is the only eligible candidate for nomination, and delegates can either vote for him or be marked present. However, if a brokered convention were to occur, it could benefit Democrats if their nominee is not Biden, as they would be facing Donald Trump, who has very high negatives.

**2024 election: Why the conventions might be weird this year**
The 2024 Republican and Democratic National Conventions are expected to be unusual due to uncertainty surrounding the ability of presumptive presidential nominees to serve a second term. Former President Donald Trump's ongoing legal issues and concerns over President Biden's health are casting a shadow over the conventions. The RNC in July will take place just four days after Trump's scheduled sentencing on 34 felony counts, and there is uncertainty within the party about his nomination. The DNC in August may not have a televised nomination process due to a virtual roll call vote, and there is a possibility that Biden could withdraw and trigger a brokered convention, which hasn't happened since 1952.

**Democrats are ironically declaring their support for Kamala Harris on social media**
Some left-leaning Twitter users are ironically declaring their support for Kamala Harris on social media, as Joe Biden's 2024 viability is in doubt. The sudden surge in Harris-centric memes shows that while some Democrats don't love the VP, they're desperate to dump Biden. Rep. Jim Clyburn has also expressed support for Harris if Biden were to step aside. The move could be seen as a way to avoid a brokered Democratic convention and to inherit the campaign apparatus built by Biden's team. A CNN poll found that Harris performed better than Biden in a hypothetical match-up with Trump. Some users are genuinely enthusiastic about Harris, while others are engaging in irony, posting memes and declaring themselves 'coconut-pilled'.

**Q&A of the Day – A History of Democrat's Brokered Conventions**
A listener asked about the history of brokered conventions in the Democratic Party. Brokered conventions occur when a party's nominee is not decided after the first round of voting at a party's convention. Historically, brokered conventions have not worked well for the Democrats, with only three out of 11 brokered conventions resulting in the party's nominee winning the election. The most recent brokered convention was in 1952, when Adlai Stevenson was nominated after three rounds of voting. The article highlights the challenges of a brokered convention, including the lack of time for voters to become familiar with a new candidate and the potential for the party to be divided. It also notes that the current dynamics make it unlikely that a brokered convention will occur this year.

The possibility of a new presidential candidate emerging from a brokered Democratic convention next month has been sparked by President Joe Biden's stumble in the recent debate. Biden has stated he has no intention of stepping aside, making it unlikely for another Democrat to challenge him at the convention. However, party rules do leave open the possibility of swapping out candidates in an emergency situation.

Jen Psaki, former Joe Biden White House press secretary and current MSNBC host, cautions that a brokered Democratic convention, proposed by some liberal commentators after Biden's poor debate performance, is easier to talk about than to execute. She highlights the potential consequences, including the president staying neutral and not endorsing his own vice president, empowering party insiders to choose the nominee, and potentially positioning an untested candidate for the national spotlight. Psaki also discusses the urgency of the 2024 election and the need for Democrats to rally behind Biden, despite his flaws, to prevent the erosion of democracy.

**How Democrats could replace Biden as presidential candidate**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance in the debate with former President Donald Trump, some Democrats are questioning whether he should be replaced as the presidential candidate for the 2024 election. According to Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, there are several scenarios in which Biden could be replaced, including him stepping down, being challenged by others, or withdrawing after the Democratic convention in August. If Biden steps down, his nearly 4,000 delegates could vote for a new candidate, and several potential replacements have been mentioned, including Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom. The process of choosing a new nominee would involve a free-for-all among Democratic heavyweights, with candidates needing to get signatures from 600 convention delegates to be nominated. If no one gets a majority, a 'brokered convention' would ensue, in which delegates would negotiate with party leadership to choose a nominee. If Biden steps down after the convention, the 435 members of the Democratic National Committee would choose a new candidate.

**U.S. Election: Can Democrats Replace Joe Biden as Their 2024 Nominee?**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance in the presidential debate, some Democrats are questioning whether he should remain the party's nominee for the 2024 election. Replacing Biden would be a high-risk move, as he won the primary votes and the delegates are beholden to him. If Biden were to exit the race, Vice President Kamala Harris would likely be the top contender, but she has struggled with low approval ratings. Other potential candidates could include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The process of replacing Biden would require securing signatures from 600 delegates and could lead to a brokered convention, where delegates would negotiate with party leadership to select a nominee. The risks of a contested convention are high, and Democrats must weigh the risks of sticking with Biden against the uncertainty of a contested convention and the potential for a divisive internal battle.

**When and where is the 2024 Democratic National Convention? Can another candidate be chosen?**
The 2024 Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago from August 19th to 22nd. Despite Joe Biden's poor performance in the debate, there are concerns that he may not be able to unite a winning coalition. A poll found that 62% of Democrats are enthusiastic about voting for Biden, but half of voters believe he will be replaced at the convention. The Biden campaign has acknowledged his poor performance but emphasized the importance of beating Donald Trump. The article discusses the rules for nominating a Democratic presidential candidate, including the role of superdelegates. Superdelegates can only vote in a contested convention, and their votes are not tied to specific candidates. The article concludes that the chance of Biden being replaced at the convention is minimal, but the party's power structure has protected its leader and incumbent, leaving few options for party members who had a viable shot of beating Biden in the primaries.

**Have the odds of a brokered convention increased after Biden's bumbling first debate?**
President Joe Biden's performance at the recent debate has led to renewed calls for him to step down and let someone else take the Democratic Party's nomination. Liberal pundits, such as New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, have urged Biden to 'bow out of the race.' However, Democratic lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former President Barack Obama, are sticking by the president. To replace Biden, someone would have to persuade the 4,000 pledged but not committed delegates to support them on the first ballot. A brokered convention could lead to chaos and potentially fracture the party. Biden's age and low polling numbers among younger voters could make it difficult for him to win the nomination. Some argue that the party should have more control over the nomination process, but others believe that would undermine the democratic process.

**Here's How Democrats Could Replace Joe Biden Before November**
Following a poor debate performance by President Joe Biden, Democrats are considering replacing him with another candidate before the 2024 presidential election. According to the Democratic National Committee's rules, Biden cannot be removed from the ticket by party leaders, but the convention can hold an open nominating process, allowing other candidates to take the lead. Several potential contenders have been mentioned, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. However, Harris's poll numbers are not inspiring, and she has faced criticism for her lack of activity since taking office. Meanwhile, Trump supporters are concerned about the possibility of a brokered convention, where the party's 4,000 delegates would choose a new nominee. The article also discusses the Supreme Court's recent ruling on homelessness, which allows cities to criminalize homelessness, and the lack of real-time fact-checking during the debate, which allowed Trump to spread misinformation. Additionally, the article touches on Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election results, his claims about golf, and his handling of immigration policy.
