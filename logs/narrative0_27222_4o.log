*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK, both renowned superforecasters, sit at a news desk.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, yesterday’s big question was whether Ukraine would have offensives reaching at least five miles into Russian territory by October 1st. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 95.67% for a "yes". Given the August 6th offensive, it was a high-probability event.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The unexpected advance into Kursk Oblast was a game-changer. The ISW map confirmed Ukrainian-held territory well beyond the five-mile mark.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Our models, considering the August developments and troop entrenchment, accurately reflected the situation. 

**NATE SILVER:** It’s fascinating how predictive analytics can be so precise, even in complex geopolitical scenarios.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** High Brier scores, Nate. The data doesn't lie.

*Superforecasters NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers and laptops scattered around.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the big question: On October 1, did Ukraine hold any territory five miles inside Russia?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. The August offensive was significant, but the probability of sustained control was low.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. By August 14, the news suggested a strong Ukrainian push, but also highlighted Russian counter-efforts.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The evacuation and trench digging showed intent, but our models predicted a temporary hold.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how the probabilities aligned with reality. Even in war, models hold.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The ISW map confirmed it—no Ukrainian territory five miles in.
