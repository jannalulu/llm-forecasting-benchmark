**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024**

*Three SUPERFORECASTERS, ANNA, JAMES, and LIAM, sit around a table, sipping coffee.*

**ANNA:** So, Apple's big announcement yesterday. Stacked batteries in the iPhone 16. 

**JAMES:** Our models had it at 85.50%. The rumors were strong, especially with the EU law pushing for battery innovation.

**LIAM:** True. The higher energy density and longer lifespan made it a no-brainer. Plus, the buzz about faster charging was everywhere.

**ANNA:** And the metal casing for easier replacements? That was the clincher.

**JAMES:** Remember, stacked batteries are still emerging tech for smartphones. Our models factored in the risk, but the signs were there.

**LIAM:** Well, another accurate prediction. 

**ANNA:** Indeed. Let's see what Apple does next.

*They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their foresight.*

Yeah, the MacRumors article hinted at it, but it was still a gamble. The increased battery density and faster charging were big selling points.

MAYA  
True. The stacked battery tech in EVs and medical devices is finally making its way to smartphones. Our models were right on the money.

LUCAS  
It's fascinating how accurate our predictions were, even with just the information up to August.

MAYA  
Another win for the models. Now, let's see how the market reacts.
