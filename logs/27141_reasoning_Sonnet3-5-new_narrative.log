Nate Silver: (reviewing data on his tablet) "Despite all the April intelligence and speculation about Ukraine's plans, especially around Putin's inauguration..."

Philip Tetlock: (interrupting) "Those reports from The Guardian and Newsweek had everyone on edge. The Ukrainian intelligence's bold claim about disabling it in the first half of 2024 really moved the needle on our models."

Nate: "Yet our models had it at 32.75%. The historical pattern of successful attacks in 2022 and 2023 suggested another attempt was likely, but Russia's enhanced defensive measures made it significantly harder."

Philip: "Precisely. The failed August 2023 attempt showed their improved countermeasures. Plus, Ukraine's resource constraints by mid-2024 meant they had to be more selective with high-profile operations."

Nate: "Sometimes the most anticipated events are the ones that don't materialize."

Nate Silver: (looking at data screens) "Despite the April intelligence reports and speculation around Putin's inauguration, our models had it at 12.75%."

Philip Tetlock: "Fascinating how the narrative shifted after May. The Ukrainian counteroffensive's focus on naval targets rather than infrastructure made the probability drop significantly."

Silver: "Remember those Guardian reports about HUR's plans? Everyone thought the symbolism of hitting it during Putin's fifth term would be too tempting to pass up."

Tetlock: "The data showed otherwise. Russia's enhanced air defense systems and Ukraine's limited drone capabilities by August made a successful strike increasingly unlikely. Looking back at our August 13th analysis, the patterns were clear."

Silver: "Sometimes the most anticipated events are the ones that never materialize. The bridge stands, but the story of its vulnerability changed the entire Black Sea dynamic."

Nate Silver: [examining data on a holographic display] "Despite Ukraine's bold predictions in April about attacking the Crimean Bridge, our models had it at 15.25%."

Philip Tetlock: "Fascinating how the probability spiked around Putin's inauguration in May. Those Telegram channels and Russian TV pundits really had everyone convinced."

Silver: "The April Guardian report about HUR's plans and Zelenskyy's approval made it seem plausible, but looking at Ukraine's diminishing drone capabilities and Russia's enhanced bridge defenses by August, the numbers told a different story."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The failed attempt in August 2023 showed how difficult targeting the bridge had become. Russia learned from the previous successful attacks."

Silver: "Sometimes the most anticipated events are the ones that never materialize. The data doesn't lie – it never does."
