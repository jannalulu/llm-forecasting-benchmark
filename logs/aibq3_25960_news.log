**First Case of Avian Influenza H5N1 Transmitted from Cow to Human with Respiratory Symptoms**
The US health authorities announced the first case in the world of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza transmitted from cow to human with respiratory symptoms. This is the second human case of avian influenza in Michigan and the third reported in the country this year. The patient, a dairy farm worker, was regularly exposed to infected cattle and did not wear protective equipment. The CDC reported that the three cases are not related. The recent announcement adds a worrying dimension to a outbreak that has affected millions of birds and marine mammals worldwide. The CDC stated that the current H5N1 virus circulating does not easily spread between people, but it is possible that it could change and infect humans.

**Preparation is Key to Saving Lives from Pandemics**
The rapid spread and evolution of the H5N1 avian influenza virus is causing alarm worldwide. The virus has been circulating between wild and domestic birds, and from there to marine and terrestrial mammals, causing significant outbreaks. Although transmission to humans has been confirmed in over 20 cases, mostly mild, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, this situation is causing a severe food security crisis in the United States, where the high presence of the virus in infected cow milk has triggered a health alert warning that consuming unpasteurized milk may pose a health risk, as well as the possibility of viral mutations increasing transmission. The article highlights the importance of global and local preparedness for preventing a new pandemic, including mechanisms for surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and communication. It also emphasizes the need for international cooperation and coordination, citing the upcoming Pandemic Agreement to be submitted to the World Health Organization's Assembly, which aims to ensure global commitment to preventing pandemics and mitigating their impact. However, the article notes that there are still significant disagreements between global North and South on funding, access to information, and accountability, which could hinder the agreement's effectiveness.

**Avian Influenza Virus Spreads Rapidly Among Mammals and Humans**
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has been spreading rapidly among mammals and humans, with two cases reported in the United States this year. The virus has been detected in over 40 species of mammals and has infected 868 humans worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that the virus has been transmitted from birds to humans through contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. The virus is highly contagious and can cause severe illness and death in humans. The CDC is monitoring the situation closely and has prepared 4.8 million doses of a vaccine specific to this strain of the virus as a precaution. Experts are concerned about the potential for widespread transmission among humans and are urging people to avoid exposure to infected animals and contaminated materials.

**Australia Reports First Human Case of Avian Influenza H5N1**
The Department of Health in Victoria, Australia, has reported the first human case of H5N1, also known as avian influenza, in a child who contracted the infection in India and has since recovered. A different highly contagious strain was found on a farm in the same region. However, tests confirmed that the outbreak is not related to the human case. The department stated that no other related cases have been identified, and the probability of additional human cases is very low, as avian influenza does not spread easily between people. The transmission of H5N1 to humans is rare, with a small number of human cases reported globally, resulting in death in some cases. The H5N1 strain is a highly contagious disease that primarily affects wild and domestic birds. The world is currently experiencing a pandemic of the disease, with most cases linked to contact with migratory wild birds, domestic birds, or local wild birds. There are many different subtypes (strains) of avian influenza, with most not infecting humans. Some subtypes, including H5N1, have a higher probability of causing disease and death in birds. They are known as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI). Significant outbreaks of HPAI viruses are being reported in birds and non-avian mammals outside of Australia.

**Avian Influenza H5N1: A Study Reveals Its Potential to Transmit Between Mammals**
A study published in the journal Nature found that the H5N1 avian influenza virus can be transmitted between mammals through contaminated cow's milk and can reach the mammary glands. The study, led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, isolated the virus from milk of an infected cow in New Mexico, USA, and demonstrated that it can replicate and cause disease in mice and ferrets, two common animal models for studying influenza in mammals. The detection of a subtype of the virus in a dairy farm in the United States in the spring of 2024 is the first documented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in cattle. Since then, it has been documented to spread between herds and infect other mammals, including humans, indicating a 'greater risk' to public health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been four recent cases in humans - workers - in the United States. While the current risk to public health is low, the CDC is monitoring the situation 'closely' and working with the 12 affected states. The study characterized the isolated virus and demonstrated that it can transmit through milk from infected cows to mice and ferrets, and even to the mammary glands of infected animals. The virus was also found to transmit from infected mice to their offspring. Aitor Nogales González, a scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, summarized that the study showed that animals can become infected by consuming contaminated milk and that there is vertical transmission in infected mice. However, the bovine H5N1 virus was transmitted inefficiently through respiratory transmission in ferrets. Some of these results are similar to those obtained with other H5N1 viruses in the past. However, they suggest that the virus isolated in the outbreak in cattle may have characteristics that facilitate infection and transmission in mammals, including humans. This conclusion is mainly due to the virus's ability to bind to cellular receptors present in the upper respiratory tract of humans, according to the Science Media Centre (SMC) Spain. 'Although the risk to the population, in general, is considered low, this situation could change in the future and we must remain alert. We must remember that the last pandemics of influenza have had the avian influenza as a fundamental actor', concludes Nogales. The new study aims to answer key questions related to the potential of the virus isolated in cows to transmit between mammals through different routes.

**EU Advises Increased Surveillance on Avian Influenza as Cases Rise**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has advised increasing surveillance on avian influenza cases, as the virus has been spreading among animals and humans. The ECDC has reported four cases of human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus in the US, and while transmission from animals to humans is still rare, the virus can spread to wild and domestic birds, causing outbreaks and occasional infections in mammals. The ECDC has emphasized the importance of raising awareness, but not alarm, and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to support early detection and containment of potential human cases. The agency has also strengthened its support for EU countries in laboratory activities on avian influenza, including preparing laboratories to detect and characterize zoonotic influenza viruses.

**Bird flu makes step in evolving toward human spread**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1, has infected over 100 cattle herds in 12 US states since March, resulting in four cases of cow-to-human infections. While ferrets are a good model for understanding flu transmission patterns, the virus does not transmit efficiently through respiratory droplets or airborne particles, making it difficult for the virus to spread from animals to humans. However, experts are concerned that the virus could mutate towards human-to-human transmission, potentially leading to a pandemic.

The researchers also observed transmission of the virus from infected rat pups to their offspring. According to Aitor Nogales González, a scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, the study demonstrates that animals can become infected by consuming contaminated milk and that there is vertical transmission in rat pups. However, the bovine H5N1 virus was transmitted inefficiently through respiratory transmission in ferrets. Some of these results are similar to those obtained with other H5N1 viruses in the past.

'Although the risk to the population, in general, is considered low, this situation could change in the future and we must remain vigilant. We must remember that the last pandemics of influenza have had the avian influenza as a fundamental actor', concludes Nogales. Elisa Pérez Ramírez, from the same Spanish research center, notes that the results have great relevance due to their impact on animal health and public health in the context of a very relevant and current health alert, avian influenza H5N1. Since the end of 2020, this virus has caused the death of millions of poultry in the world and hundreds of thousands of wild birds. 'In fact, we are living the largest epidemic of avian influenza in history', recalls SMC. Additionally, the virus has been acquiring progressively a greater ability to jump to mammals, first wild (with massive mortality of marine mammals in South America, for example), then mink in fur farms in Spain and Finland, outbreaks in domestic cats, and finally the jump 'most unexpected and probably the most worrying: dairy cattle in the United States'. Never before had this subtype been detected in ruminants, so the scenario is 'completely new with many questions'. The new study aims to answer some key questions related to the potential of the virus isolated in cows to transmit between mammals through different routes.

**Avian Influenza Outbreak: Is Spain at Risk?**
Since the end of March 2024, US health authorities have sounded the alarm after confirming the presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in 86 dairy cow farms across 10 states. The affected states are Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming. The outbreak has raised concerns in the dairy industry and among health authorities. Meanwhile, consumers are wondering if it is safe to consume their morning milk and if humans could be the next infected. On April 1, a worker at a Texas dairy farm was diagnosed with the virus, marking a concerning public health milestone. This case represents the first time the virus has been detected in cattle and the first time it has been transmitted from mammals to humans. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the presence of the virus in cattle, and experts warn that the risk is not limited to the United States. Joaquim Segalés, an investigator at the Animal Health Research Center, emphasizes that 'the outbreaks in the US are happening with distances of thousands of kilometers, which tells us that it can happen anywhere, as long as there is contact with infected birds.' The risk is real, and it is crucial to be alert. The article also highlights the importance of zoonosis, diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans, and the need to prevent the next pandemic.

**Scientists Warn of Deficient Surveillance of Avian Influenza Virus**
Scientists are increasingly concerned about the deficient surveillance of the avian influenza virus, which is keeping them several steps behind a possible new pandemic. The spread of the H5N1 virus to 129 dairy farms in 12 US states shows a change that could make it transmissible between humans. 'It's almost like a pandemic developing slowly', says Scott Hensley, a microbiology professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 'The threat is currently quite low (...) but it could change at any moment'. The sooner a jump to humans is detected, the sooner global health authorities can take measures to protect the population by developing vaccines, large-scale testing, and containment measures. State efforts to analyze dairy cows are inconsistent, while those for people exposed to sick livestock are scarce, according to government health officials and pandemic flu experts. Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that human surveillance is 'very, very limited' and described the US human influenza surveillance network as 'a passive notification and presentation mechanism'. Confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported in the US, Mexico, India, China, and Australia.

**Canada Closely Monitoring Avian Influenza Situation in the United States**
The Canadian authorities are closely monitoring the situation of avian influenza in the United States, where cases of the disease have been reported in farms, contaminating cattle and recently transmitted to humans. The authorities say they are taking the situation very seriously. The avian influenza, specifically the H5 and H7 subtypes, is a notifiable disease in Quebec, as it can be transmitted between animals and humans. While cases of avian influenza in humans are rare, three cases were reported in the United States last year, with two people showing eye symptoms and one person showing respiratory symptoms. Globally, 15 human cases of a specific H5N1 clade have been reported since its emergence in 2022, with most cases having a history of exposure to poultry. The Canadian government has raised its alert level and is urging farmers to increase their vigilance and biosecurity measures. The situation is concerning, as the virus has been detected in wild birds, cattle, and over 200 mammal species in the United States. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has increased its surveillance and protection measures, including requiring imported cattle to test negative for the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.

**New evidence sheds light on health emergency as virus rapidly spreads and evolves — here's what you need to know**
A new report highlights the rapid spread and evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which has been detected in dairy cows in the United States. The virus has spread globally, with rising global temperatures playing a significant role in its prevalence and emergence of new variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that other animals impacted by the virus include swans, foxes, bears, alpacas, and sea lions. Three human cases have been linked to U.S. dairy farms, with the public health risk considered low. The World Health Organization notes that most human cases have occurred after direct contact with live or dead birds, and there are no known cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC is monitoring infections and developing an action plan if needed. Additionally, breakthroughs in gene-edited chickens and cleaner technologies provide hope for a healthier, cooler future.

**Will We Return to the Pandemic Scenario?**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is showing 'enormous concern' about the spread of H5N1 and H5N2 avian flu strains to other species. According to Jeremy Farrar, the WHO's scientific director, the main worry is that the H5N1 virus, which has an 'extraordinarily high mortality rate' among people infected through contact with animals, is adapting to transmission between humans. Between January 2023 and April 1, 2024, the WHO recorded 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries, with 463 deaths, representing a 52% mortality rate. Farrar emphasized the need for increased surveillance and registration, as well as the development of vaccines and treatments against H5N1. He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that regional and national health authorities worldwide have the capacity to diagnose the virus.

**Can We Prevent an Avian Influenza Pandemic?**
The highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype of avian influenza has been spreading among animals worldwide, causing significant concern among public health experts. Since 2020, the frequency of infections in mammals has increased, and recent human cases in 2024 raise the possibility of a new global epidemic. To prevent an avian influenza pandemic, it is necessary to monitor and continuously surveil animal health, as well as implement effective biosafety strategies. Specialists emphasize the importance of conducting comprehensive tests in animals and humans to detect the H5N1 virus and its possible variants. Effective surveillance is crucial for monitoring the spread of the virus and identifying high-risk areas, allowing for the adoption of preventive measures. Despite the efforts of surveillance in various regions, the lack of resources and reluctance of animal owners represent significant challenges in collecting complete data. The challenges of trust and communication are evident, especially among agricultural workers, who may fear legal or financial consequences for participating in surveillance programs. Therefore, compensation programs are essential to mitigate these concerns and ensure that workers feel safe to participate in tests and implement biosafety practices. Vaccine development and distribution A vaccine is the most effective means of preventing the spread of viruses. Several countries and organizations are developing and stockpiling vaccine candidates for H5N1, with plans to produce millions of doses in the coming months. Vaccines with durability and broad efficacy are essential for controlling the disease. However, logistical and public acceptance challenges complicate the implementation of vaccination programs. The countdown to expiration of doses, the need to convince the public to vaccinate, and uncertainty about the vaccine's effectiveness against future virus mutations are significant obstacles. Therefore, new studies are essential to improve vaccination strategies and the vaccine formula. Preventing an avian influenza pandemic requires a multifaceted approach that includes rigorous surveillance, close collaboration between all involved parties, and the development of effective vaccines. Although there are many challenges, the implementation of these strategies can significantly reduce the risk of a new global epidemic, protecting both human and animal health.

**WHO Warns of Global Avian Flu Epidemic as Virus Spreads to Mammals**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the alarm about the avian flu, which has been declared a 'global epizootia'. The epidemic, which began in 2020, peaked two years later, with over 131 million deaths of domestic poultry in 67 countries on five continents. The WHO is concerned about the virus's ability to infect and kill new species, including mammals, and the potential for transmission to humans. In February, a highly pathogenic A(H5N1) outbreak occurred in dairy cow farms in the US, which alerted health authorities. The number of infected cows has continued to increase, with 101 farms affected in 12 states, although the number of deaths has been 'minimal'. The CDC confirmed that a person had been diagnosed with avian flu, a rare occurrence that had previously only happened in Hong Kong in 1997. The person had not been in contact with birds, but had been in contact with dairy cows. The CDC is investigating the cases, but the exact mechanism of transmission is still unclear. The WHO is concerned about the potential for the virus to jump to humans and is urging caution. The situation is particularly concerning because the virus has already infected over 40 species of mammals that are not typically infected with this type of virus. The WHO is working to develop a vaccine and is urging countries to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Avian Influenza A(H5N2) in Mexico: A Controversy and a Real Risk**
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a case of avian influenza A(H5N2) in Mexico on June 5, 2024. The case involved a 59-year-old man from the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City and died on April 24. The origin of the controversy surrounding the case began at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER), where a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed on April 24, which showed a positive result for influenza A virus without subtyping. The sample was later sent to the INER's molecular biology laboratory, where it was detected as positive for A(H5N2) virus. The contacts of the index case tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and B. However, the Mexican Secretary of Health, Jorge Alcocer, denied that Mexico had reported the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza, and the WHO clarified that the recent death of a patient in a Mexican hospital was not attributed to avian influenza caused by the A(H5N2) virus, but rather to multifactorial causes. The WHO reported a high-pathogenicity A(H5N2) outbreak in a poultry farm in Michoacán in March 2024, as well as low-pathogenicity A(H5N2) outbreaks in Texcoco and Temascapala, both in the State of Mexico. The ecology of highly pathogenic avian influenza has changed, shifting from sporadic outbreaks in terrestrial poultry to persistent circulation in aquatic poultry and potentially in wild aquatic birds. Historically, geographical barriers such as the Bering and Chukchi seas have limited the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from Asia to the Americas. However, these barriers appear to be incomplete, as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8 emerged in 2014 through recombination with low-pathogenicity North American viruses. Therefore, the possibility of an infection with the avian influenza virus is real, although the Mexican Ministry of Health indicates that there have been no reported cases in humans, and all contact tests were negative. Health, SEMARNAT, and Agriculture are implementing actions in the context of the WHO's 'One Health' initiative, which considers the public health risk of this virus to be low for Mexico.

**The Growing Danger of a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Pandemic**
Scientists and experts are sounding the alarm about the growing danger of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) pandemic, which could potentially be the next global health disaster. With a mortality rate of over 50% in humans, it is crucial to prevent the virus from becoming airborne and spreading rapidly. The US government and industry have been criticized for their lack of action, with the USDA and CDC failing to test and track infections, and the industry prioritizing profits over public health. The article calls for immediate action to prevent a pandemic, including mass testing of livestock and agricultural workers, contact tracing, and isolation of infected humans and animals. It also demands control of the CDC and USDA by public health workers, increased funding for public health, and regulation of the dairy industry to prioritize public health over profits.

**Bird flu FAQ: Symptoms, what Michigan outbreak means for pets and why wastewater matters**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus is spreading in the US and globally, with concerns about its potential to mutate and infect humans. The virus has been detected in wastewater in Michigan, with high levels found in six testing sites. While the virus has caused mild symptoms in humans, it is almost always deadly in poultry and can affect other animals, such as cows, raccoons, and foxes. The virus can also infect pets, including birds, cats, and ferrets, and can be transmitted through contact with infected animals or their waste. The CDC recommends taking precautions to avoid contact with infected animals and to ensure pets do not hunt birds or scavenge their carcasses. The virus can be transmitted through unpasteurized milk and raw eggs, but pasteurized milk and fully cooked meat and eggs are considered safe to consume. There is currently no vaccine available to protect against the H5N1 virus, and the CDC is working to develop one.

**Former CDC Director Warns of Potential Avian Influenza Pandemic**
According to Robert Redfield, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the next pandemic could come from the avian influenza virus, which spreads rapidly among poultry and livestock in the United States. Redfield stated, 'I think it's very probable that we will have an avian influenza pandemic, it's not a question of if, but when.' He added that once the H5N1 virus acquires the ability to transmit from human to human, that's when you'll have a pandemic. Currently, H5N1 does not easily transmit between humans, but the World Health Organization warns that as it spreads, it has the 'potential to mutate and become more contagious.' The H5N1 virus was first detected in 1996 in domestic waterfowl in southern China and is highly contagious among birds. A new outbreak was detected in 2020 among wild birds in Europe and has since spread to domestic poultry and occasionally to mammalian species such as foxes, otters, and cows. In the US, over 96 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks in 48 states have been infected with the virus, with 12 states reporting infected cattle herds. So far, three humans - all exposed to cattle - have been infected this year, according to the CDC, and the risk to the general public remains low.

**Next Pandemic Could be Avian Flu, Warns Former CDC Director**
A former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predicts that the next pandemic could be caused by the avian influenza virus, which is spreading rapidly among poultry and livestock in the US. 'I really think it's very likely that we will have a pandemic, it's not a question of if, but rather when', said Robert Redfield, former CDC director, during an appearance on NewsNation on Friday. Redfield, who served as CDC director during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2018 to 2021, added that once the H5N1 virus gains the ability to transmit from person to person, 'that's when we'll have a pandemic'. Currently, H5N1 does not transmit easily between humans, but the World Health Organization warns that as it spreads, it has the potential to mutate and become more contagious. The H5N1 virus was first detected in 1996 in domestic wastewater in southern China and is highly contagious among birds. It was first detected in a new outbreak among wild birds in Europe in 2020 and has since spread to domestic poultry and occasionally to mammalian species such as foxes, sea lions, and cows. In the US, over 96 million commercial and backyard poultry in 48 states have been infected with the virus, according to the CDC. The USDA says that farms in 12 states have been affected. So far, three humans who were exposed to livestock have been infected this year, according to the CDC. All have recovered. The CDC says the risk to public health from H5N1 remains low.

**Researcher: Now is the time to take action on H5N1 avian flu, because the stakes are enormous**
A researcher warns that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak in birds and mammals around the world could take hold in humans, causing a pandemic. The virus has already infected dairy cattle in Texas and has been detected in three dairy-farm workers in the United States, with one case resulting in respiratory symptoms. The researcher emphasizes the need for a collective shift in infectious disease management, prioritizing prevention over response, and calls for international cooperation and coordination to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccines and medications can be developed to prevent human-to-human transmission, but time is of the essence, and the stakes are enormous.

**Global Alert Over Avian Flu: New Vaccine Development**
The world is on alert due to the avian flu, with cases confirmed in the US, Mexico, and Australia. The US government has taken measures to prevent a possible epidemic, despite having hundreds of vaccines stored. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed experimental vaccines (CVV) H5 that are almost identical to the A(H5N1) virus detected in both birds and humans. This could be used to produce a human vaccine that, according to preliminary analysis, would provide good protection against the current circulating H5N1 viruses. The vaccine will have priority for those most exposed to the transmission of avian flu from poultry or animals, such as farm workers and veterinarians. However, there are no exact dates for the vaccination campaign yet.

**Avian Influenza Outbreaks in 19 Countries in the Americas**
A report on avian influenza outbreaks in 19 countries in the Americas has been released. The countries affected are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Falkland Islands, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The report states that the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus currently circulating in the region belongs to a genotype resulting from a recombination between wild bird viruses in Europe and low-pathogenicity viruses in wild and domestic birds during its global dissemination. This new genotype has spread rapidly from Europe to North America, Africa, and Western Asia through bird migration routes. Since the detection of the A(H5N1) virus in the Americas in 2021, 457 outbreaks have been reported in mammals in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, United States, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay. Between January and mid-May 2024, six countries in the region identified 210 outbreaks in birds and 78 outbreaks in mammals. According to the study, six human infections caused by avian influenza A(H5N1) were registered since 2022 in the Americas: four in the United States, one in Ecuador, and one in Chile. While affecting animals to a great extent, avian influenza outbreaks pose continuous risks to public health. Sporadic cases of virus detection in humans are mostly associated with direct contact with infected animals and contaminated environments. Current evidence suggests that the virus does not transmit easily from person to person, but it is necessary to strengthen surveillance to detect any possible change in this situation, experts pointed out.

**EU Concludes Contract to Purchase Avian Influenza Vaccine**
The European Union has concluded a contract to purchase up to 665,000 doses of a vaccine against avian influenza from the British laboratory Seqirus. The vaccine is intended to prevent the transmission of the virus to humans. Fifteen EU and EEA member states will participate in the purchase, including France and Finland, but not Germany. The contract allows each participating state to order vaccines based on their needs to prevent the spread or appearance of potential outbreaks. The first shipments are already being prepared for Finland, and others will follow. The vaccine can be acquired over four years, with an option for an additional 40 million doses. It will be intended for people most exposed to the potential transmission of avian influenza, such as poultry farmers and veterinarians. The Seqirus vaccine is currently the only authorized vaccine in the EU against human influenza caused by H5 strains of the avian influenza virus. Two viruses of this type are currently being closely monitored: H5N1, which has been causing significant biodiversity loss since 2020 and has been spreading in US cattle farms since March, and H5N2, which was discovered in March in poultry farms in western Mexico. The World Health Organization has reported the first human case of H5N2, which was identified as a multifactorial death. Scientists are concerned about the potential for more dangerous mutations, facilitated by the virus's circulation in many animal species. The World Health Organization has called for strengthening the global detection network. To date, no human-to-human transmission has been reported.

**Global Avian Influenza Outbreak: Understanding the Subtypes and Risks**
The global avian influenza outbreak has raised concerns due to the evolution of two subtypes of the virus, A H5N1 and A H5N2. Scientists from the US and Canada have classified the situation as 'preoccupying' due to the potential for genetic recombination, which could enable human-to-human transmission and trigger a new pandemic. Although this is difficult to predict with certainty, the risk exists. The A H5N1 subtype was first identified in domestic aquatic birds in southern China in 1996, and recently detected in dairy cows in the US, with three human cases reported, all with mild symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) also reported a case of a 2-year-old girl in Australia who contracted A H5N1 and is recovering. The A H5N2 subtype, considered generally of low pathogenicity in animals, was first detected in a human in Mexico, where a 59-year-old man died from pre-existing conditions, not directly from the virus. This was the first confirmed human case in a laboratory worldwide. According to the WHO, the A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans, so the probability of propagation remains low. However, The Lancet highlighted that a global binding treaty to address pandemics has not been finalized, and many countries are not prepared for a new health crisis. Experts warn that the A H5N1 subtype has replicated in dairy cows in the US, increasing the risk of improving its ability to replicate in mammals, including humans. While the risk to the general public is low, dairy farm workers are at higher risk. Experts also emphasize that it is possible, although unlikely, that the virus could evolve rapidly and trigger a pandemic. Measures to prevent the spread of the virus include avoiding markets and animal farms, maintaining good hand hygiene, and reporting any cases of sick or dead animals to veterinary authorities. People exposed to potentially infected animals should seek medical attention quickly and take measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

**US Detects Three Cases of Avian Influenza Virus in Humans, Raises Concerns of Pandemic**
The United States is experiencing a high level of vigilance due to the detection of three cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which is transmitted from birds to humans. The virus is known to be highly pathogenic and has a high mortality rate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported that the virus has been detected in nine states, including Michigan, Ohio, Idaho, South Dakota, North Carolina, Kansas, Connecticut, New Mexico, and Texas. The virus is believed to have been transmitted to humans through contact with infected birds, and the CDC has advised people to take precautions to avoid contact with birds and their waste. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed concern about the potential for the virus to spread to other countries and has recommended increased surveillance. The French government has also recommended increased surveillance and has expressed concern about the potential for the virus to spread to Europe. The experts are closely monitoring the situation and are preparing for the possibility of a pandemic.

**Colombia: No cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in humans reported**
The Colombian Institute of Health (INS) has reported that there have been no cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in humans. According to the INS, 536 samples of Acute Respiratory Disease (IRA) were studied, and none were found to be caused by avian influenza A (H5N1 and H5N2). The INS has been monitoring the risk of transmission of the virus from animals to humans and has been following up with people who live in areas where the infection has been detected. The entity has also been conducting a rigorous control of IRA grave inusitado cases. The first case of death in humans due to highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N2) was reported in Mexico, and the INS has continued to monitor the situation. The entity has also requested that healthcare professionals request a viral panel for IRA cases, especially for patients in the agricultural industry, healthcare workers, veterinarians, environmental workers, or those with underlying diseases.

**UNA Reminds that Avian Flu Virus is Not Highly Transmissible to Humans**
A UNA expert, Carlos Jiménez, a veterinarian at the School of Veterinary Medicine, stated that the H5N2 virus, which causes avian influenza, is not easily transmissible to humans because humans do not have the receptors in their respiratory tracts for the virus to enter cells. This statement comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the first death from avian influenza in Mexico. Jiménez recommends avoiding contact with birds if visiting Mexico. The H5N2 virus originated in China and arrived in Mexico in 1995, with other cases of infection reported in Japanese poultry workers in 2005 and Nigerian poultry workers in 2013, but without resulting in death.

**WHO Calls for Vigilance After Death in Mexico Due to Avian Influenza**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for vigilance after a death in Mexico due to avian influenza. The risk of human-to-human transmission remains low. Ian Brown, president of the network of experts on avian influenza, stated that recent infections in humans indicate that we must strengthen surveillance and follow the evolution of these viruses. The WHO reported 11 cases of avian influenza in 2024, including three cases of H5N1 associated with cattle in the United States. The cases have increased concern in health networks about the growing adaptation of the virus to mammals and a possible mutation of the virus. The transmission to cattle 'tells us that we should not assume that there are limits to where this virus can reach', added Brown. This Wednesday, the first death due to AH5N2 avian influenza was confirmed. The patient was a 59-year-old man who died on April 24 and the source of exposure to the virus is unknown. 'This is the first confirmed human case of infection with the AH5N2 virus reported globally. Additionally, the first reported infection with the AH5 virus in a person in Mexico', warned the WHO on its website.

**Why the Avian Influenza H5N1 Worries Scientists**
The H5N1 avian influenza virus is spreading rapidly among dairy cows in the United States, with three confirmed cases reported. The virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals. While there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health authorities are on high alert. The virus has a high pandemic potential, as humans have no immunity to it. Since its discovery in China 30 years ago, there have been around 900 reported human cases, with a fatality rate of almost 50%. The virus has spread to various mammals, including pigs and chickens, and has been found in at least nine US states. Scientists are searching for the virus in wastewater, but this method does not allow for tracing its origin. According to epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo, 'If H5N1 were spreading among people, we would know.' Despite the lack of testing, it is reassuring that only three cases have been confirmed, says biologist Michael Worobey. The virus can infect humans through the eye, as the cells in the human eye have receptors also found in birds. This means that the virus can spread through eye contact without requiring specific mutations. However, the cells in the human respiratory tract do not have these receptors, so the virus must acquire mutations to spread through coughing and sneezing. So far, analysis of the H5N1 genome from US dairy farms has not revealed any such mutations. The presence of H5N1 in farms where many people work increases the likelihood of a variant adapted to humans emerging. A possible scenario is the emergence of a recombinant strain in an individual already infected with seasonal flu. In any case, the outbreak in the US is a bad sign for preventing a future pandemic, whether caused by H5N1 or another virus. 'Before this disease was identified, it had spread for months under our nose in a completely new host', comments Worobey. The monitoring systems capable of tracking the spread of new pathogens in farms are the only way to prevent future pandemics. Without this tool, the next one could start in Texas like Wuhan.'

**First Human Death Caused by H5N2 Avian Influenza Virus Reported**
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported the first human death caused by the H5N2 avian influenza virus on June 5, 2024. The patient was infected with the virus in Mexico, which is the first reported case of human infection with the A(H5N2) virus globally. The WHO stated that the risk of transmission to the general population is low. The H5N2 virus is a type of avian influenza that primarily affects birds, but it can also infect humans in rare cases. The WHO has reported cases of human infection with other subtypes of H5 viruses, including H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8. The transmission of the virus to humans can occur through direct or indirect contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. Symptoms of avian influenza in humans include mild respiratory infection, fever, cough, pneumonia, difficulty breathing, and death.

**WHO Confirms First Global Death from AH5N2 Avian Influenza Virus**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first global death from the AH5N2 avian influenza virus. The case was detected in a laboratory in Mexico, where local health authorities have been monitoring the development of this variant of the virus. The patient, a 59-year-old man, died after contracting the disease under circumstances that are still being investigated. This is the first confirmed human case of infection with the A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first reported case of A(H5) infection in a person in Mexico. The AH5N2 avian influenza virus is a highly pathogenic variant of the influenza virus, and its transmission to humans is extremely rare. Mexican authorities are working closely with the WHO to identify the source of the infection and prevent future outbreaks.

**20 years of H5N1 Avian Influenza: From Asian Birds to American Cows**
It has been 20 years since the H5N1 avian influenza virus emerged, infecting around 900 people (half of whom died) since 2023. Despite its ability to infect various animals, including migratory birds, the virus has not yet learned to transmit efficiently from person to person. The virus has spread globally, affecting humans mainly in women and children who have come into direct contact with ducks and chickens in countries where the economy is based on domestic poultry farming. H5N1 has also begun to circulate in various mammals, including aquatic mammals, felids, and visons, and is now spreading in American cows. The virus accumulates mutations, but has maintained a greater affinity for avian receptors, mainly in the lower respiratory tract, rather than human receptors, which are present in the upper respiratory tract. This explains why avian viruses, unlike seasonal flu viruses, which reproduce in the nose and throat, often cause severe pneumonia but are less contagious. The current epidemic affecting dozens of farms in the US and causing three human cases of conjunctivitis (one with cough) in dairy farm workers who came into direct contact with animals should be a cause for concern? The concern stems from the spread of outbreaks and the fact that humans are frequently exposed to cows, but there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission. But if it adapts to be transmitted from person to person, would it remain as aggressive? These are questions that are difficult to answer at this time. In the absence of certainties, it is necessary to prepare for the worst scenario, avoiding unnecessary alarmism, improving surveillance systems, and the ability to respond (pre-pandemic vaccines based on H5 are already available), hoping not to face a new emergency in the near future.

**Technical Report: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Viruses**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a report on the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses, which have been circulating globally since 2022. The report provides an update on the situation, including three additional sporadic human cases in the United States and recent activity in wild birds, poultry, and other animals. The CDC continues to believe that the overall risk to human health remains low, but notes that the potential for influenza viruses to rapidly evolve and the widespread presence of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in wild birds and poultry outbreaks and dairy cattle in the United States means that additional sporadic human infections are anticipated. The report highlights the importance of continued comprehensive surveillance and readiness efforts to determine the public health risk and prepare for the possibility of increased transmissibility to and among people. The CDC also notes that H5 candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) produced by the CDC are expected to provide good protection against current clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI A(H5N1) viruses detected in birds and mammals, including dairy cattle. The report also discusses the genetic changes that may occur in HPAI A(H5N1) viruses during infection in mammals, including humans, and the potential impact on disease outcome and transmissibility. Overall, the CDC continues to closely monitor the situation and is prepared to respond to any changes in the risk to human health.

**Should we worry about a growing threat from 'bird flu'?**
Experts warn that a major human outbreak of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, is plausible and the risk is high. The virus was first detected in China in the late 1990s and has since caused 463 deaths among 888 cases. The high ratio of deaths to cases suggests that H5N1 could cause a major public health emergency if it leads to sustained person-to-person transmission. The likelihood of this has risen over the past four years due to the spread of the virus in wild and farmed bird populations, affecting poultry production and trade globally.

**New Case of Avian Influenza Transmission from Cows to Humans Raises Global Health Concerns**
Researchers have confirmed a second case of avian influenza transmission from cows to humans. The case is being closely monitored by global health authorities amid concerns about the virus's spread. The first case was reported in March this year, and since then, the virus has spread to even raw milk samples. Two people in the United States have contracted the disease after contact with infected cows, both farmers who reported mild symptoms and have since recovered. Studies suggest that the H5N1 strain has mutated to better adapt to mammalian cells. US authorities are monitoring the situation, stating that there has been no unusual influenza activity in people. To prevent potential human-to-human transmission, a study published in Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics recommends vaccination against the disease. Researchers at the University of Georgia suggest that vaccines remain our 'primary defense' against the potential spread of avian influenza, such as H5N1. The study examined vaccine tests in mice, ferrets, and primates, as well as clinical trials of human flu vaccines. The publication suggests that inactivated vaccines are a safe and accessible option that activates antibodies in the body. Avian influenza has already spread to various animals, including bears, cats, and penguins in Antarctica. According to experts, this proves that the virus is spreading to remote areas of the planet. In the midst of this scenario, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the risk of the spread of avian influenza in birds and mammals, which could lead to the virus mutating and infecting humans more severely and quickly, representing a global public health crisis.

**US Detects Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Alpacas for the First Time**
The US Department of Agriculture has confirmed the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in several alpacas on a farm in Idaho. This is the first time the virus has been detected in a mammal. The animals tested positive on May 16th. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) stated that the virus is not unexpected due to the existing infection in the farm's chickens and the mixing of multiple species of livestock. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have warned of a possible increased risk to human health due to the circulation of the virus among different mammals. While the current H5N1 virus does not easily spread between people, it is possible that it could change and start infecting humans more easily. However, there is currently no evidence of person-to-person transmission, and the risk of avian influenza in humans is considered low.

**Preparation is Key to Saving Lives from Pandemics**
The rapid spread and evolution of the H5N1 avian influenza virus is causing alarm worldwide. The virus has been circulating between wild and domestic birds, and from there to marine and terrestrial mammals, causing significant outbreaks. Although transmission to humans has been confirmed in over 20 cases, mostly mild, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, this situation is causing a severe food security crisis in the United States, where the high presence of the virus in infected cow milk has triggered a health alert warning that consuming unpasteurized milk may pose a health risk, as well as the possibility of viral mutations increasing transmission. The article highlights the importance of global and local preparedness for preventing a new pandemic, including mechanisms for surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and communication. It also emphasizes the need for international cooperation and coordination, citing the upcoming Pandemic Agreement to be submitted to the World Health Organization's Assembly, which aims to ensure global commitment to preventing pandemics and mitigating their impact. However, the article notes that there are still significant disagreements between global North and South on funding, access to information, and accountability, which could hinder the agreement's effectiveness.

**Avian Influenza Virus Spreads Rapidly Among Mammals and Humans**
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has been spreading rapidly among mammals and humans, with two cases reported in the United States this year. The virus has been detected in over 40 species of mammals and has infected 868 humans worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that the virus has been transmitted from birds to humans through contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. The virus is highly contagious and can cause severe illness and death in humans. The CDC is monitoring the situation closely and has prepared 4.8 million doses of a vaccine specific to this strain of the virus as a precaution. Experts are concerned about the potential for widespread transmission among humans and are urging people to avoid exposure to infected animals and contaminated materials.

**H5N1 Avian Influenza: What You Need to Know**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a second human case of H5N1 avian influenza in the United States, linked to an outbreak in cattle farms. The virus, a subtype of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), has been found in animals that were not previously infected, including goats and cattle. While the risk to the public is low, experts advise avoiding contact with sick or dead animals, and uncooked animal products, and frequent hand washing. H5N1 is a highly pathogenic virus that causes severe and deadly disease in birds, and can also infect mammals, including humans. The virus has been linked to widespread outbreaks in poultry farms in the US and other countries since 2022. While the virus can cause severe illness and death in humans, some cases may be mild or asymptomatic. The CDC is monitoring the situation closely and has not yet seen any changes in the virus that would indicate it is becoming more transmissible between humans. The virus can infect a wide range of animals, including birds, mammals, and reptiles, and has been found in at least 48 species of mammals in 26 countries. Humans can become infected through close contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. The virus can cause severe illness, including respiratory and neurological symptoms, and can be fatal in up to 50-60% of cases. Treatment involves antiviral medication, and vaccination is being developed in case of a sudden and widespread outbreak.

**Australia reports new bird flu case at poultry farm as global concerns rise**
Australia has reported a new case of highly pathogenic avian influenza at a poultry farm in Victoria, following a human case and a strain on an egg farm. The human case is of the H5N1 strain, while the farm cases are of the H7N3 strain. The affected farms are connected through joint management, staff, and machinery. Agriculture Victoria is working to contain and eradicate the virus, which has been a concern globally. This is the second human case in the US, following an outbreak among dairy cattle in nine states.

**Second Case of Avian Influenza H5N1 Transmitted from Cows to Humans Detected in the US**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported a second case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) transmitted from cows to humans in the United States. The patient, a worker at a farm in Michigan, had contact with infected cows and presented with only eye symptoms. The first case was reported in April in Texas. Both cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak of H5N1 in cattle, which was first detected in March and has since been found in nine states. The virus is highly pathogenic and can cause severe illness in humans, but the CDC says it poses a low risk to the general public and that initial tests did not find any changes in the virus that would increase transmission risk or reduce the effectiveness of antiviral medications.

**Michigan reports second human case of bird flu: Will there be a bird flu pandemic among humans?**
Michigan has reported a second human case of bird flu, a farmworker who was regularly exposed to livestock. This is the second case in the US, after a dairy worker in Texas tested positive in early April. The highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) is spreading across the country, but public health officials say the transmission of the virus among people has not yet been detected. Scientists believe the virus needs to mutate further to become easily transmissible among humans. While there is a low risk of a bird flu pandemic, experts are concerned about a lack of transparency in reporting cases, which could lead to undetected infections.

**Australia reports imported human H5N1 avian flu case and unrelated high path poultry outbreak**
Australia has reported its first human case of H5N1 avian flu, which was contracted by a child in India and has fully recovered. The child had a severe infection but no evidence of transmission in Australia was found. The risk is considered low as the virus does not spread easily among people. Additionally, a separate outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H7) has been reported at a layer farm in Victoria, which is not related to the human case. The Australian government is taking the incident seriously and is supporting Agriculture Victoria in its response.

**Australia Reports First Human Case of Avian Influenza H5N1**
The Department of Health in Victoria, Australia, has reported the first human case of H5N1, also known as avian influenza, in a child who contracted the infection in India and has since recovered. A different highly contagious strain was found on a farm in the same region. However, tests confirmed that the outbreak is not related to the human case. The department stated that no other related cases have been identified, and the probability of additional human cases is very low, as avian influenza does not spread easily between people. The transmission of H5N1 to humans is rare, with a small number of human cases reported globally, resulting in death in some cases. The H5N1 strain is a highly contagious disease that primarily affects wild and domestic birds. The world is currently experiencing a pandemic of the disease, with most cases linked to contact with migratory wild birds, domestic birds, or local wild birds. There are many different subtypes (strains) of avian influenza, with most not infecting humans. Some subtypes, including H5N1, have a higher probability of causing disease and death in birds. They are known as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI). Significant outbreaks of HPAI viruses are being reported in birds and non-avian mammals outside of Australia.

**Australia Reports First Human Case of H5N1 Avian Influenza**
Australia reported its first human case of H5N1 avian influenza, but there are no signs of transmission and the likelihood of more cases in humans is very low, according to the Victorian Department of Health. The affected child acquired the infection in India and showed symptoms in March, and has since fully recovered. A highly pathogenic avian influenza has also been detected on a large egg farm near Melbourne, but it is not the same strain that spread worldwide and infected dairy cows in the United States, according to Australian authorities. The farm has been quarantined after several birds died, and the Victorian Agriculture Ministry has imposed movement restrictions in the area and will destroy the birds. The lab tests show that the virus is an unidentified H7 strain that likely originated from wild bird populations and has been seen before in Australia, according to Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer, Graeme Cooke.

**Avian Influenza Outbreak: A Global Threat to Marine Life**
A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza, known as H5N1, is spreading rapidly around the world, causing widespread deaths among birds and mammals. The virus has been detected in at least 48 species of mammals and is strongly linked to the deaths of sea lions and seals. The virus has spread to the Antarctic, Africa, and Asia, and has also been detected in the Galapagos Islands. The impact on wild bird populations has been significant, with a 70% reduction in the number of northern gannets in their key breeding grounds. The true impact of the outbreak is difficult to quantify, as many birds and mammals may die in areas where there is no surveillance and it is not reported. The virus is primarily spread through contact with infected saliva, nasal secretions, or feces, and can be transmitted between mammals. Humans can also be infected, but the risk is generally considered low. Experts recommend avoiding close contact with sick or injured animals and detecting the virus early to limit its spread. Vaccination is also being considered, but it is difficult to apply to wild birds. The spread of the virus is exacerbated by climate change, which can increase the stress on animals and make them more susceptible to the virus.
