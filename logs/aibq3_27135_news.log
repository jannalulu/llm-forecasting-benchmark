**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs - IGN**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. According to CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company plans to reduce its workforce by more than 15% by the end of 2024. Gelsinger acknowledged that the news is 'painful' but necessary to align the company's cost structure with its new operating model. He stated, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected - and we've yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low.' The company will also offer an enhanced retirement program and voluntary departures for eligible employees. This is not the first time Intel has undergone layoffs since the pandemic, with the last round occurring in October 2022. The tech industry has seen a trend of mass layoffs and hiring freezes in recent years, with companies like Unity, Discord, Microsoft, and Google also making significant job cuts.

**Analysis-Megacap Stock Selloff Shows Investor Concerns About Too Much Tech**
The recent selloff in megacap tech stocks, including Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet, has highlighted concerns about over-exposure to the tech sector and the potential for more turbulence. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6% in its worst day since October 2022, while the S&P 500 slumped 2.3%. The rout comes after a months-long rally in a handful of massive technology and growth companies, pushing the S&P 500 to record highs this year. Investors are worried that the market may have become too optimistic about earnings growth, leaving stocks vulnerable if companies are unable to meet expectations in coming months.

**US Job Cuts: Google, Amazon, Tesla Hit Indians?**
In 2024, US job cuts are continuing at a worrying pace, affecting Indian professionals working for global giants like Google, Amazon, and Tesla. The tech industry, a major employer of Indian talent, has been particularly hard-hit, with companies like Amazon, Alphabet (Google's parent company), and Intel cutting jobs. Microsoft has reduced 1,900 positions in its gaming sector, while IBM plans layoffs but is focusing on hiring for AI roles. Indian engineers and technical staff involved in Intel's operations might face uncertainty as the company restructures its manufacturing business. Other companies like eBay, Unity Software, DocuSign, Snap, and Salesforce are also reducing their staff, and even retailers like Walmart and Nike are cutting jobs. This trend has serious implications for Indian professionals working in related sectors, leading to increased job insecurity.

**Large corporations expect to make more layoffs in the coming months**
Major corporations, including Google, Microsoft, Nike, Amazon, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, expect to make layoffs in the coming months. A survey by ResumeBuilder found that 40% of business leaders anticipate layoffs in 2024, with half of those surveyed believing a recession is possible. Vance Ginn, President of Ginn Economic Consulting, attributes the layoffs to a slowing economy due to inflation, reduced consumer demand, and increased debt. Some companies are trying to implement 48-hour work weeks or offer alternative opportunities to retain workers, but Ginn notes that this can put more stress on the economy. The increasing use of AI is also making workers question their next move, as some industries fully embrace its capabilities.

**Big tech layoffs present promise for AI-focused startups, companies**
The recent layoffs in big tech companies like Salesforce and Google due to artificial intelligence (AI) have created opportunities for AI-focused startups and companies to poach impacted workers. According to the World Economic Forum, AI is expected to replace tens of millions of jobs, but Jonathan Chu, director of engineering at rapid robotics, believes AI will create new jobs. 'New jobs are going to be created by the AI industry,' Chu said. 'New jobs will be created to drive and support the AI industry. Jobs you couldn't imagine before now exist because of AI technology that's out there.' Workers with AI skills have a competitive advantage in negotiations, as Joint Ventures CEO Russell Hancock noted, 'If you can do those things, this is the town for you, you can name your price and ka-ching,' he said. 'If you can't do those things, it's getting harder to be employed, even in the tech sector.'

**Intel to cut 15,000 jobs as layoffs in tech industry continue amid massive AI investment**
Intel announced it will lay off 15,000 employees, accounting for over 15% of its total workforce. The layoffs are part of a larger trend in the tech industry, where hiring is slowing and layoffs are increasing. Intel's Austin office, which has 2,100 employees, may be affected, but the company has not clarified if employees in Texas will be impacted. The layoffs are attributed to a 'mad scramble' to develop and capitalize on artificial intelligence, which has yet to prove profitable. This is not an isolated incident, as several tech companies in Austin, including Google, Unity, VMware, Expedia, Accenture, Hyliion, and Rooster Teeth, have also announced layoffs in recent months.

**Intel will lay off at least 15,000 employees**
Intel has announced a significant reduction in its global workforce, planning to lay off between 15,000 and 19,000 employees. The company aims to achieve $10 billion in cost savings by 2025 by reducing marketing and research spending and stopping 'non-essential' work. This move comes after Intel reported losses of $1.6 billion in the previous fiscal quarter, partly due to the shift of companies like Apple and Microsoft to in-house or Qualcomm-made chips. This is not an isolated incident, as tens of thousands of tech workers have been laid off in various sectors, including computing and gaming, by companies like Microsoft, Google, and Riot Games.

**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. In a note to employees, CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate.' He added, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected, and we have not yet fully benefited from powerful trends like AI. Our costs are too high, and our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both, particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is more challenging than previously expected.' Gelsinger also announced that the company will offer a improved retirement package and a voluntary leave program for eligible employees. He stated, 'These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I've done in my career.' He emphasized, 'My commitment to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency, and respect in the coming weeks and months.' This is the second round of layoffs at Intel since the COVID-19 pandemic, following a 5% reduction in staff in October 2022.

**The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020**
The tech industry experienced significant job instability following the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Apple initiating large-scale layoffs. Google's January 2023 layoff of 12,000 employees was the largest single layoff event in the tech sector since 2020. In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.

**Bay Area tech giant Intel to gut staff, slashing 15,000 workers**
Intel, the Bay Area tech giant, announced plans to slash 15,000 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, in an effort to save $10 billion in costs. CEO Pat Gelsinger described the move as 'the hardest thing' he's done in his career, citing the company's struggling financials and overly complex and bureaucratic workforce. Intel's revenue has decreased significantly, from $24 billion in 2020 to $24 billion in 2023, and Gelsinger stated that the company's costs are too high and margins are too low. The company will offer 'enhanced retirement offerings' and a 'program for voluntary departures' to some workers. The exact locations of the job cuts are still unknown, but this is one of the largest layoff rounds in tech history since Google and Meta's layoffs in 2022 and 2023.

**Intel's Restructuring Begins: 20,000 Employees to be Let Go**
Intel Corporation, one of the biggest companies in the technology world, announced that it is going through a strategic restructuring. As part of this process, the company plans to reduce its global workforce by over 15%, which translates to over 20,000 employees. Intel has started its layoffs process. In a statement sent to employees by CEO Pat Gelsinger, it was stated that the company aims to save $10 billion in costs by 2025. This means that Intel will have to cut around 20,000 positions by the end of 2024. Gelsinger acknowledged that this decision is 'necessary but painful' for the company. He stated that Intel will need to take bolder actions to address its financial difficulties and improve its profit margin. Intel's recent second-quarter earnings report showed a weaker performance than analyst expectations. Gelsinger said that Intel will change its work style from the ground up and wants to make its cost structure compatible with its new business model. Affected employees will be informed next week and a voluntary separation program will be offered. This move will also have a significant impact on the technology industry. The company, which is known to have over 100,000 employees, will reduce its workforce by 15%. This is the second major change for Intel, which reduced its workforce by 5% in October. Other big technology companies like Microsoft, Google, Unity, and Discord have also made similar moves, citing rising costs and slowing demand.

**Tech Market Sell-Off: 2 Stocks to Buy in 2024 Before It's Too late**
The tech market has experienced a sell-off in July, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index down by 9% since July 10. Despite this, the article suggests that tech remains a good place to find reliable long-term investments, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. Two stocks to consider buying before it's too late are Nvidia and Alphabet. Nvidia has fallen by 17% since early July, making it more attractive for new investors. The company has delivered massive revenue and earnings growth in recent years by cornering the market on AI graphics processing units (GPUs). Alphabet's shares have declined by 13% since July 10, driven by its earnings release and a new announcement from OpenAI. However, Alphabet's second-quarter results beat estimates on multiple fronts, with revenue jumping by 14% year over year and operating income soaring by 26% powered by significant growth in its AI-focused Google Cloud segment.

**Analysis: Megacap stock selloff shows investor concerns about too much tech**
The recent decline in megacap stocks, led by Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet, has raised concerns about the vulnerability of the market to weakness in the Big Tech trade. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6% in its worst day since October 2022, while the S&P 500 slumped 2.3%. The rout comes after a months-long rally in a handful of massive technology and growth companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, pushing the S&P 500 to record highs this year.

The recent decline in megacap stocks, including Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet, has highlighted concerns about the vulnerability of the market to weakness in the Big Tech trade. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6% in its worst day since October 2022, while the S&P 500 slumped 2.3%. The rout comes after a months-long rally in a handful of massive technology and growth companies, pushing the S&P 500 to record highs this year. The megacap stocks, dubbed the Magnificent Seven, have accounted for around a third of the S&P 500's 14% gain in 2024, making their trajectories a key factor in how broader markets will perform.

**Analysis-Megacap Stock Selloff Shows Investor Concerns About Too Much Tech**
The recent selloff in megacap tech stocks, including Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet, has highlighted concerns about over-exposure to the tech sector and the potential for more turbulence. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6% in its worst day since October 2022, while the S&P 500 slumped 2.3%.

**AI Fever Cools, Sending Nasdaq 100 Into $1 Trillion Tailspin**
The Nasdaq 100 Index plummeted by $1 trillion, its worst performance since October 2022, as investors grew skeptical about the return on investment (ROI) in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The selloff was triggered by Alphabet's earnings report, which featured a bloated capital expense, and Tesla's lack of details on its self-driving vehicle initiative. Traders are now paying more to protect against swings in tech, with options volatility on Nvidia and puts on Broadcom Inc. reaching new highs. The rout comes after a recent rotation from tech winners to small-cap stocks, and some market professionals are warning of an AI bubble.

**Tech Layoffs Lose Momentum as AI Takes Center Stage**
The wave of tech layoffs has lost momentum. After the horror year 2022, the big tech companies started laying off employees at the beginning of 2023 to signal to investors that CEOs understood the situation. Meta-CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the most aggressive, cutting 22% of the workforce. The stock market applauded, and Meta's stock price rose from $88 to a record high of $542. The rally is not unique to Meta; big tech stocks have seen significant gains over the past year and a half. Layoffs are no longer a major theme to keep investors happy. As a result, the number of layoffs in 2024 has been declining compared to the previous year. According to Layoffs.fyi, there were 60,000 layoffs in the US tech and internet sector from the beginning of the year to early July. Stocklytics reported around 100,000 layoffs worldwide in the tech sector. The largest layoffs occurred at the beginning of the year, with Tesla, SAP, Dell, Cisco, and Toshiba being among the companies that laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft also laid off almost 3,000 employees to establish a sustainable cost structure. The recent layoffs may seem manageable, but the critical question is how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the workforce. While most big tech companies are investing heavily in AI development, some are already replacing human workers with AI and openly communicating the move. IBM, for example, laid off employees in connection with AI initiatives and plans to replace almost 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will 'massively upskill all our employees in AI'. The statement sounded more like a threat than a reassurance.

**Google workers council expresses 'deep concern' over lack of information on continuing layoffs**
The European Works Council (EWC) of Google workers has expressed 'deep concern' over the lack of information on ongoing layoffs across the company's operations. The EWC, formed in December 2023, is an internal group established under Irish law, which gives staff the right to be consulted on issues related to job cuts, investments, mergers, and acquisitions. The group raised several issues, including the lack of forward-looking information and data provided by Alphabet, Google's parent company. The EWC also expressed concern about the company's current headcount planning and the lack of transparency on future layoffs. Google employees in Ireland have reported that layoffs have been taking place every month this year, with some departments and product areas being affected. The EWC has called for outstanding information to be delivered, and Google management has responded, stating that some of the EWC's statements were not a true reflection of the information shared during the meeting.

**Google In Talks To Buy Cyber Startup Wiz For $23B — Report**
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for approximately $23 billion. This deal would be the largest ever for a venture capital-backed company, surpassing Adobe's failed $20 billion deal to acquire Figma. Wiz, a cloud security startup, just raised $1 billion at a $12 billion valuation in May. The deal would essentially double Wiz's valuation and give Google a bigger slice of the cloud security market, as Wiz's software helps companies secure their cloud applications. This would not be Google's first big cybersecurity buy, as they previously acquired Mandiant for $5.4 billion in 2022.

**Why Google may have backed out from this biggest technology deal of the year 2024**
Alphabet, Google's parent company, has abandoned its pursuit of HubSpot, a customer relationship management software company, according to Bloomberg sources. The deal, which could have been one of the largest tech acquisitions of 2024, was reportedly dropped due to potential hurdles from US antitrust regulators and the company's shares plummeted 12% after the news. Alphabet had expressed interest in acquiring HubSpot earlier this year, but the discussions never reached the stage of in-depth due diligence. Representatives from both Alphabet and HubSpot declined to comment on the matter.

**Tech Sector's 2024 Layoffs Exceed 100,000; Women Bear Brunt**
The technology industry has seen over 100,000 layoffs in 2024, with women and the video game industry being disproportionately affected. Notable companies like Dyson, Tesla, SAP, Google, and Microsoft have all executed layoffs, with Dyson cutting 1,000 jobs, Tesla reducing its workforce by 14,500, and SAP downsizing by 8,000. The video game industry has seen significant layoffs at Electronic Arts, Activision, and Riot Games, with over 10,000 cuts in the sector. Women make up around 45% of the total layoffs, despite holding less than one-third of positions in the industry. Experts argue that seniority-based firing practices exacerbate the gender disparity and that companies must prioritize diversity and inclusion to maintain quality and equity in their products and services.

**Alphabet's biotech firm is set to close its R&D centres in Israel after upcoming layoffs**
Verily, a biotech company under Alphabet, is set to close its R&D centres in Israel, affecting 30 employees, by the third quarter. The decision is part of a refocus on core products and projects. A spokesperson for Verily stated, 'As part of our ongoing review of business needs, Verily has made the difficult decision to begin the process to close its R&D centre in Israel... This decision is in keeping with our strategy as we continue to streamline our overall company operations.' The real reason for the closure is Verily's plan for an initial public offering (IPO) and going its own separate way from Alphabet. The centre in Israel was established in 2021, and the team has been working on applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to biomedical problems. The company has been cost-cutting for over a year after falling short of revenue projections in 2023, and its parent company, Alphabet, has also been cutting employees.

**Why Tech Companies Are Laying Off Employees Despite Continued Innovation**
The technology industry has seen a wave of layoffs since 2023, with many companies, including Google, Tesla, Apple, and others, cutting jobs. Despite this, companies have continued to innovate, releasing a steady stream of artificial intelligence updates and new products. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, explained in an interview with 'Morning Brew Daily' that companies had hired too many people during the pandemic due to the surge in e-commerce sales and were forced to reduce staff once sales returned to normal. Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, also stated in a memo to employees that the company had increased its workforce by fivefold since 2020. However, despite this, companies are still laying off employees. According to CEOs, this is due to the need to adapt to a changing market and focus on AI development. Google, for example, is reorganizing its workforce to prioritize AI projects, such as its central processing unit based on ARM, and developing Gemini, a search engine supported by AI, and updating Google Workspace. Other companies, such as Microsoft and IBM, are also reorganizing their workforces to focus on AI development. It is unclear when this process will end, but it appears that technology companies are not slowing down in their pursuit of AI development.
