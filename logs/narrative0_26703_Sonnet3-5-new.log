SCENE: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 1, 2024.

NATE SILVER: (reviewing data on his monitor) Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

PHILIP TETLOCK: Indeed. When we last updated our forecasts in July, we had the probability of a Venezuelan invasion at 12.45%.

NATE: The referendum certainly raised tensions, but the combination of international pressure, particularly from the US military presence, and Venezuela's internal economic challenges made a full-scale invasion unlikely.

PHILIP: Exactly. While Maduro's rhetoric was aggressive, our models factored in Venezuela's military readiness and the diplomatic consequences. The UN Security Council's early warnings and Brazil's mediation efforts also played crucial roles.

NATE: (nodding) The border skirmishes in August had some worried, but our models held firm. Venezuela ultimately chose political posturing over military action.

PHILIP: Another accurate forecast in the books. Want some coffee?

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a quiet corner table, reviewing data on their laptops. Steam rises from their untouched coffees.

TETLOCK
(sighing)
Well, our models were right again about Venezuela and Guyana.

SILVER
Yes, we had it at 12.5%. The referendum last year was concerning, but the international pressure, especially from the US military presence in the region, acted as a significant deterrent.

TETLOCK
The economic costs would have been too severe for Maduro's government. Our models factored in the diplomatic isolation Venezuela would face, particularly from CARICOM and Brazil.

SILVER
(nodding)
The last data we got in July showed increased diplomatic engagement. Despite the heated rhetoric, the probability of actual military action remained low.

TETLOCK
Another crisis averted, though the territorial dispute remains unresolved.

They finally sip their coffees, contemplating the power of accurate forecasting.

TETLOCK
(stirring coffee)
Well, our models were spot-on again about Venezuela and Guyana.

SILVER
Indeed. Given the data we had until July 30th, our models showed only 12.45% probability of invasion.

TETLOCK
The diplomatic pressure from the US visits in late 2023 really dampened Maduro's ambitions. Even after that referendum, the economic costs were too high.

SILVER
(nodding)
The satellite imagery showing no significant troop movements near the border was a key indicator. Plus, Brazil's stern warnings about regional stability...

TETLOCK
And China's reluctance to back any military action, given their investments in Guyana's oil sector.

SILVER
Sometimes the most dramatic-looking situations resolve peacefully. That's why we let the data, not emotions, guide our predictions.

Well, our models were spot on again about Venezuela and Guyana.

SILVER
(nodding)
Indeed. Based on the data we had until July 30th, our models gave it a 12.3% probability.

TETLOCK
The referendum certainly raised tensions, but the international pressure, especially from the US presence in the region, served as a significant deterrent.

SILVER
The economic costs and diplomatic isolation Venezuela would have faced made a full-scale invasion unlikely. Though that border dispute from 1962 had us concerned for a while.

TETLOCK
Interesting how despite Maduro's aggressive rhetoric, they ultimately stuck to diplomatic channels.

SILVER
Just goes to show - even heated territorial disputes rarely escalate to actual invasions in the modern era.

Philip Tetlock: *nodding* "Indeed. The diplomatic pressure from the US and Brazil, combined with Venezuela's internal economic struggles, made a full-scale invasion unlikely. Though that December 2023 referendum had us worried initially."

Nate: "The turning point was really when the UN Security Council got involved in March. Once China made it clear they wouldn't support Venezuela's territorial claims, the probability dropped significantly."

Philip: "Exactly. Even with Maduro's saber-rattling, our models showed Venezuela lacked both the military capability and international support for such a move. The presence of US military advisors in Georgetown was quite the deterrent."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting."
