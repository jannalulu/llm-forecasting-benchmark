A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a holographic display, which shows Earth's magnetosphere and K-index data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, arms crossed)  
So, did AR3697 stir up anything between July 17 and 28?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 15.67%. Kp stayed below 5. Just minor flares, nothing major.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
The sunspot merged and flared in May, but this time it was all bark, no bite.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(looking at the hologram)  
It's fascinating. The sun's unpredictability keeps us on our toes, but our models nailed it.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Good thing, too. Last thing we need is more satellite disruptions.

The team chuckles, a shared relief at their accurate forecasting.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, laptops open. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday was intense. AR3697 didn't disappoint. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 92.75%. The Kp peaked at 5.7. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Impressive. The auroras were visible as far south as New York. 

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Amazing how AR3697 evolved. Remember the May flares? 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. It’s like watching a cosmic dance. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The space weather forecasts were spot-on. No satellite disruptions, thankfully. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Our models never miss. It's like seeing the future unfold. 

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And the sunspot's still there. More to come, perhaps? 

They exchange knowing smiles, the weight of their predictions confirmed by reality.

Our models had it at 85.67%. AR3697 was bound to stir things up.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

Indeed. The merging in May set the stage. But the Kp didn’t breach 6.

A Kp of 5.67. Just enough to light up the skies, but no major disruptions.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**
