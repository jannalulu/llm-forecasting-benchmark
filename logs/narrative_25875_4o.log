SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

FORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 3.25%. Biden's debate performance was a disaster, but his defiance was clear.

FORECASTER 2  
Indeed. The media frenzy was intense, but the Democratic establishment stood firm behind him.

His speech in North Carolina reinforced his resolve. The probability of him stepping down was always low.

FORECASTER 4  
The betting markets reacted, but our models remained consistent. No official withdrawal announcement by July 31st.

FORECASTER 1  
The narrative was compelling, but the probability never aligned with a Yes resolution.
