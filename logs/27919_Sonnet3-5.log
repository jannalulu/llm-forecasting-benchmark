To analyze this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Base rate: Political detentions are not uncommon in Venezuela, especially for opposition figures. However, high-profile presidential candidates are often treated differently.

2. Recent events: 
- An arrest warrant was issued for González on September 2, 2024.
- González has been in hiding and refusing to appear before the court.
- The government has been increasing pressure on opposition figures.

3. Time frame: We have about 2 weeks until the October 1 deadline.

4. International pressure: Several Latin American countries have condemned the arrest warrant, which may deter the government from acting.

5. Military support: González has expressed confidence in military support, which could protect him from arrest.

6. Government motivation: The Maduro regime likely sees González as a threat and has incentive to detain him.

7. Logistical challenges: González is in hiding, making it more difficult for authorities to locate and detain him.

Reasons for a lower probability:
- International pressure may deter the government from arresting González.
- The military's stance is uncertain and could protect González.
- González has successfully avoided detention so far while in hiding.

Reasons for a higher probability:
- An arrest warrant has already been issued, showing clear intent to detain González.
- The government has a history of detaining opposition figures.
- There's still time before October 1 for authorities to locate González.
- The regime likely sees González as a significant threat.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance González will be detained, but it's not certain given the challenges and potential consequences. The government has shown clear intent, but execution remains uncertain.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the evidence:

1. Legal pressure on González:
- An arrest warrant was issued for González on September 2, 2024.
- He's been summoned multiple times by the Supreme Court and failed to appear.
- The prosecutor's office has warned of severe consequences for non-compliance.

2. Regime's history and motivation:
- The Maduro regime has a track record of detaining opposition figures.
- There's clear motivation to suppress González as a political threat.

3. Recent actions against González's associates:
- Several members of González's campaign team have been detained.
- This suggests an escalating crackdown on the opposition.

4. González's current status:
- He appears to be in hiding to avoid arrest.
- This limits the regime's ability to immediately detain him.

5. Time frame:
- There's about 6 weeks until the October 1 deadline.
- This gives the regime time to locate and detain González, but also time for the situation to potentially de-escalate.

6. International pressure:
- There's significant international condemnation of the arrest warrant.
- This could deter the regime from following through, but historically hasn't always been effective.

7. Internal dynamics:
- The military's stance is crucial. While they've historically supported Maduro, there are hints of potential shifts.

Weighing these factors:

The regime has clear intent and a history of detaining opponents. The recent arrests of González's associates and the escalating legal pressure suggest a high likelihood of attempting to detain him.

However, González's current hiding status and international pressure provide some counterbalance. The relatively short timeframe also slightly reduces the chances of successful detention.

Given the Maduro regime's past actions and the current trajectory, I believe there's a significant chance González will be detained. However, the uncertainties around his location and potential international interventions keep this from being a near-certainty.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Base rate: Without specific data on how often opposition candidates are detained in Venezuela, I'll use a broad base rate for political detentions in authoritarian regimes. This suggests a moderate probability, perhaps around 30-50%.

2. Recent arrest warrant: An arrest warrant was issued for González on September 2, 2024, accusing him of various crimes. This significantly increases the likelihood of detention.

3. Government actions: The government has already detained some of González's campaign staff and other opposition figures. This pattern suggests a willingness to detain political opponents.

4. Time frame: With the arrest warrant issued and just over 2 weeks until the October 1 deadline, there's a relatively short window for action, which somewhat decreases the probability.

5. International pressure: Several Latin American countries have condemned the arrest warrant, which may deter the government from acting on it. However, the regime has shown resilience to international pressure in the past.

6. González's actions: He has refused to appear before the Supreme Court and is reportedly in hiding, making it more difficult for authorities to detain him.

7. Military stance: The military's position is unclear, but their support would be crucial for enforcing or resisting an arrest order.

8. Regime's calculation: The government may weigh the political costs of detaining a prominent opposition figure against the perceived threat he poses.

Balancing these factors:

- The arrest warrant and pattern of detaining opposition figures strongly suggest an intent to deprive González of liberty.
- However, his reported hiding and international condemnation create significant obstacles.
- The regime's past behavior suggests they may still act despite these obstacles.
- The short timeframe reduces the likelihood somewhat, but also creates urgency for the regime if they intend to act.

Given these considerations, I assess there's a significant chance González will be detained, but with substantial uncertainty due to the complex political dynamics.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 75.00%, with 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

To approach this question, I'll consider the key factors and evidence, then evaluate the likelihood of Edmundo González being deprived of liberty before October 1, 2024.

Key factors to consider:

1. Legal pressure: There's clear evidence of legal action against González, with arrest warrants issued and multiple summons to appear before the Supreme Court.

2. Government stance: The Maduro government appears to view González as a threat, with rhetoric escalating and accusations of crimes.

3. Precedent: Venezuela has a history of detaining opposition leaders.

4. International pressure: There's significant international attention and criticism of actions against the opposition.

5. Time frame: We have about 11 months until the resolution date, giving ample time for the situation to develop.

Evidence for a higher probability:

1. An arrest warrant has been issued for González on September 2, 2024, accusing him of various crimes.
2. González has refused to appear before the Supreme Court, which could be used as justification for arrest.
3. The government has already detained other opposition figures, including campaign staff.
4. The Prosecutor's Office has warned that failure to appear could result in arrest.

Evidence for a lower probability:

1. International pressure and scrutiny may deter the government from taking such a provocative action.
2. González appears to be in hiding, making it more difficult to detain him.
3. The government may calculate that arresting González could lead to more unrest or damage their legitimacy.
4. There's still potential for political negotiations or de-escalation.

Balancing these factors:

The evidence suggests a significant risk of González being detained. The legal groundwork has been laid with the arrest warrant and multiple summons. The government's rhetoric and actions against other opposition figures indicate a willingness to take strong measures.

However, the international attention and potential consequences of such an action provide some counterbalance. The government may hesitate to take such a dramatic step, especially if González remains difficult to locate.

Given the extended timeframe until October 1, 2024, and the volatile nature of Venezuelan politics, there's a considerable chance that González could be detained at some point, even if briefly.

Considering all these factors, I would estimate a relatively high probability, but with significant uncertainty due to the complex political dynamics at play.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll start by considering base rates and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided:

Base rates:
- Opposition leaders in authoritarian regimes often face arrest or detention, especially when they pose a credible electoral threat.
- Venezuela has a history of detaining opposition figures.

Key evidence for a higher probability:
1. An arrest warrant has been issued for González on September 2, 2024, accusing him of various crimes.
2. González has been summoned multiple times by the authorities and has refused to appear, which could be used as justification for arrest.
3. Other opposition figures and campaign staff have already been detained.
4. The regime appears to be escalating pressure on the opposition following the disputed election.

Key evidence for a lower probability:
1. González has gone into hiding, making it more difficult to arrest him.
2. There is significant international pressure and scrutiny on the situation.
3. The military's stance is somewhat uncertain, with some indications they may respect the election results.
4. Mass protests and potential instability could make the regime hesitant to make such a provocative move.

Balancing these factors:

The issuance of an arrest warrant is a strong signal of intent, and the regime has shown willingness to detain opposition figures. However, González's ability to evade capture so far and the potential domestic and international backlash create uncertainty.

The time frame (until October 1, 2024) is relatively short, which somewhat reduces the probability. If González can remain hidden for just a few more weeks, the question resolves as "No".

- Venezuela has a history of detaining opposition figures.

Key evidence for a higher probability:
1. An arrest warrant has been issued for González on September 2, 2024, accusing him of various crimes.
2. González has been summoned multiple times by the authorities and has refused to appear, which could be used as justification for arrest.
3. Other opposition figures and campaign staff have already been detained.
4. The regime appears to be escalating pressure on the opposition following the disputed election.

Key evidence for a lower probability:
1. González has gone into hiding, making it more difficult to arrest him.
2. There is significant international pressure and scrutiny on the situation.
3. The military's stance is somewhat uncertain, with some indications they may respect the election results.
4. Mass protests and potential instability could make the regime hesitant to make such a provocative move.

Balancing these factors:

The issuance of an arrest warrant is a strong signal of intent, and the regime has shown willingness to detain opposition figures. However, González's ability to evade capture so far and the potential domestic and international backlash create uncertainty.

The time frame (until October 1, 2024) is relatively short, which somewhat reduces the probability. If González can remain hidden for just a few more weeks, the question resolves as "No".

Given these considerations, I estimate a significant but not overwhelming probability of González being detained before October 1.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.
