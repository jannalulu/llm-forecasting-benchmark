*Three superforecasters sit at a table, sipping coffee and discussing the big tech news.*

**FORECASTER 1:** So, did Apple finally announce the iPhone with the graphene thermal system?

**FORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 85.75%. And guess what? It happened. They unveiled the iPhone 16 with graphene yesterday.

**FORECASTER 3:** Fascinating. The hints were there—MacRumors speculated about it months ago. Graphene's thermal conductivity is a game-changer.

**FORECASTER 1:** True. And the metal battery casing is a smart move for heat dissipation. But what if it hadn't happened?

**FORECASTER 2:** Our models would have adjusted. But they were spot on this time. It's rare for them to be wrong.

**FORECASTER 3:** It's incredible how accurately we can predict these things. On to the next big question, then?

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the event has resolved. Apple did not announce an iPhone with a graphene thermal system before October 1, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the reports from MacRumors, it was plausible but not imminent.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The July 30th news articles hinted at potential, but the lack of official announcements was telling.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Exactly. The industry buzz was there, but the timeline didn't align for a 2024 release.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Perhaps we'll see it in 2025. The technology's promising, just not ready yet.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Agreed. Our models are rarely wrong. The probability reflected the reality—Apple's innovation pace is steady, not rushed.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis.

JANE: (excited) So, did Apple finally announce it?

LIAM: (smiling) Our models had it at 75.00%. And they did! The iPhone 16 with a graphene thermal system is official.

EMMA: Incredible. The MacRumors leaks were spot on. But remember, it wasn't a done deal until today.

JANE: True. Apple's secrecy always keeps us on our toes. 

LIAM: Imagine the heat management improvements. Graphene's a game-changer.

EMMA: (nodding) Our models never lie. The data pointed to it, even with limited news by July.

JANE: (sipping coffee) Well, here's to another accurate prediction. What's next on the horizon?

They clink their cups, basking in the satisfaction of another forecasting triumph.
