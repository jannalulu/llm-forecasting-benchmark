Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence:
1. Most recent article (Sept 12) indicates lithium carbonate price is currently 73,500 CNY/T
2. Multiple articles indicate significant price pressures:
- Supply surplus globally (near 200,000 tons in 2024)
- Decreased electric vehicle demand
- Reduced subsidies in China
- Production cuts beginning

Timeline Constraints:
- Current price: 73,500 CNY/T
- Target: Below 70,000 CNY/T
- Time remaining: About 18 days until October 1
- Most recent futures price hit 69,700 CNY/T (very close to threshold)

Probability Calculation:
- Strong downward price momentum
- Multiple systemic pressures pushing prices lower
- Short timeframe means rapid moves possible
- Recent futures already touched target price
- Supply/demand fundamentals remain weak

Balancing Considerations:
- Potential short-term price stabilization
- Possible market interventions
- Seasonal demand variations

Forecast Reasoning:
High probability of crossing 70,000 CNY/T given current trajectory and market conditions.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this systematically:

Key Observations:
1. Current Lithium Carbonate Price Context:
- Multiple articles note prices are around 70,000-75,000 CNY/T currently
- Some sources like Indiatimes show prices already hitting 69,700 CNY/T
- Market sentiment is very bearish, with supply glut and weak EV demand

2. Price Trajectory:
- Prices have been steadily declining through 2024
- Most experts predict continued weakness in near term
- Some expect slight recovery in Q4 or 2025, but not imminently

3. Specific Question Parameters:
- Must fall below 70,000 CNY/T
- Between September 10-October 1, 2024
- Timeframe is only ~3 weeks
- Currently very close to threshold

Analysis:
- High probability of continued price decline
- Short timeframe reduces dramatic movement likelihood
- Recent CATL supply cut might provide mild price support
- Market oversupply remains significant

Balancing Considerations:
- Strong evidence suggesting prices will decline further
- Slight counterbalancing factors preventing immediate dramatic drop

Probability Calculation:
Base rate of price movement + specific market conditions = High likelihood of crossing threshold

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 76.50% being the most likely. Probability: 76.50%.

- From ~$80,000/ton in late 2022 to ~$10,500/ton currently
- Multiple recent articles confirm continued downward price pressure
- Some sources like Indiatimes report November futures already at 69,700 yuan

Supply/Demand Dynamics:
- Global lithium supply surplus forecast at ~200,000 tons in 2024
- Electric vehicle sales slower than expected
- China reducing EV subsidies
- Major producers like CATL cutting production

Specific Price Context:
- Most recent trading price (September 7 article) at 69,700 yuan
- Very close to the 70,000 threshold
- Short timeframe until October 1 (about 3 weeks)

- Citi predicts potential 20-25% near-term price rise
- Some analysts expect market stabilization

Key Calculation:
- Current price: 69,700 yuan
- Threshold: 70,000 yuan
- Difference: Only 300 yuan
