[Scene: A dimly lit office at Columbia University, October 1st, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

NATE: [removing his glasses] Well, that's it. The Atlantic didn't break last year's record.

TETLOCK: [nodding] Our models had it at 32.45%. The spring data was concerning, especially those 421 consecutive days of record temperatures. But the summer pattern didn't follow 2023's extreme trajectory.

NATE: The tropical Atlantic's heat in May had everyone worried. Remember those headlines about 90% of the region hitting record temperatures?

TETLOCK: [pulling up charts] Yes, but the ocean's remarkable ability to distribute heat played out differently this time. Even with temperatures staying above the historical average, breaking 25.4°C was a high bar.

NATE: [standing] Another reminder that even with clear warming trends, year-over-year records aren't guaranteed.

TETLOCK: Exactly. Though I suspect we'll be having very different conversations in the coming years.

Here's a 150-word script set on October 7, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at Columbia University. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on multiple screens]

NATE: (sipping coffee) Well, Phil, another Atlantic temperature season in the books. Our models nailed it again.

PHILIP: Indeed. Even with that unprecedented 421-day streak of record highs earlier this year, the probability of exceeding last year's August peak was surprisingly low.

NATE: Our models had it at 23.45%. The tropical Atlantic was blazing in May, but the pattern shift we spotted in the July data was telling.

PHILIP: The key was recognizing how the 2023 peak of 25.4°C was such an extreme outlier. Even with climate change accelerating, breaking that specific record in such a narrow timeframe was statistically improbable.

NATE: (nodding) Sometimes the hardest part of forecasting is accepting that rare events really are rare.

[Both turn back to their screens as the sun sets over Manhattan]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on multiple screens. It's October 1st, 2024, early morning.]

TETLOCK: [sipping coffee] Well, that's it. September's over.

SILVER: [nodding] Our models had it at 82.45%. The persistent warming trends, coupled with that unprecedented 421-day streak of record temperatures earlier this year, made it highly probable.

TETLOCK: The tropical Atlantic's behavior was particularly telling. When we saw those May readings with 90% of the region at record or near-record temperatures, it strengthened our confidence.

SILVER: [pulling up a chart] The parallel tracking with 2023's temperatures through June was crucial. Even with the two-week preliminary data lag, the trajectory was clear.

TETLOCK: Climate forecasting isn't baseball statistics, Nate, but this one followed the probability patterns beautifully.

[Both turn to watch the sunrise through the window, reflecting on the warming world outside.]
