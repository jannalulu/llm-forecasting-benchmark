INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING, OCTOBER 2, 2024

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a small table, newspapers scattered between them. Through the window, Nairobi's skyline is visible.

NATE
(stirring coffee)
Well, Phil, our models were right again. We had it at 15.25%.

PHILIP
(nodding)
The cabinet reshuffle in July was a clever move by Ruto. Bringing in opposition members diffused the tension just enough.

NATE
Those protests had real momentum though. When they barricaded him in the presidential compound, I thought...

PHILIP
(interrupting)
But authoritarian leaders often survive these challenges if they're willing to make strategic concessions. The tax hikes were unpopular, but not enough to topple a government.

NATE
Still, 39 deaths... Kenya's democracy took a hit.

PHILIP
(grimly)
Indeed. Though Ruto survived, the cost was steep.

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, despite all those protests in Kenya last summer, Ruto managed to hold onto power."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The cabinet reshuffling and bringing opposition members into the government was a masterful political move. Our models had it at 22.5%."

Nate: "The data was fascinating. When he fired his entire cabinet in July, there was a spike in probability, but incorporating opposition members stabilized things considerably."

Tetlock: "The protest deaths were concerning, but historically, Kenyan presidents have shown remarkable resilience. Once the police chief resigned and took the fall for the violence, Ruto's position strengthened."

Nate: "Just goes to show - even intense protests don't guarantee regime change without military or complete institutional support."

[They both nod, turning back to their computers]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, despite all the chaos in Kenya this summer, Ruto managed to hold onto power."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Those cabinet reshuffles and opposition appointments in July were crucial moves. Our models had it at 22.5%."

Nate: "The probability was higher during the peak of the protests, especially after that police chief resigned. But Ruto's strategic concessions really changed the trajectory."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The opposition's integration into the government effectively diffused the situation. Though 39 deaths during the protests... that was tragic."

Nate: "The models picked up on how similar situations played out historically - leaders who make tactical compromises while maintaining core power typically survive these crises."

Tetlock: "Another validation of probabilistic forecasting. Even in highly volatile situations, patterns emerge."
