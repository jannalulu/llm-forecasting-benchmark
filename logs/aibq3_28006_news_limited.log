**Harris's top takedown moments ahead of Trump debate: ‘I'm speaking'**
Vice President Kamala Harris is set to debate former President Donald Trump on September 10 in Philadelphia. Harris has a history of delivering memorable one-liners and zingers in past debates. Some of her top takedowns include 'I'm speaking', which she used six times against former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, and 'That little girl was me', which she used to describe her experience as a child who was bused to school to integrate her public schools. Harris has also used one-liners to cut through chaos and make a point, such as 'America does not want to witness a food fight, they want to know how we're going to put food on their table.' Harris has also grilled Trump appointees, including Brett Kavanaugh and William Barr, and has used her questioning to make a point about women's rights and government overreach. Harris's past debate performances offer clues to how she might take on Trump in their upcoming debate.

**"I'm Going To Let Her Talk": Donald Trump On Debate With Kamala Harris**
Donald Trump has announced that he will allow his opponent, Kamala Harris, to speak without interruption during their presidential debate next week, a shift from his usual combative style. Trump said, 'I'm going to let her talk.' The debate, hosted by ABC News, has been the center of a row over the rules for microphones, with Trump claiming the network is biased in favor of Harris. The rules state that microphones will be 'live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate.' Harris' team has expressed concerns that the muted microphones will disadvantage her and shield Trump from direct engagement. The debate is the first and potentially only opportunity for the two candidates to spar in person in a very close contest, with only two months until Election Day.

**Harris admits it: Wants open debate mics to sting Trump like Pence - Washington Examiner**
Kamala Harris has admitted that she wants open debate mics to 'sting' Donald Trump, similar to her 'I'm speaking' moments in the 2020 debate with Mike Pence. Harris is hoping to create more notable moments at next week's debate, which will be hosted by ABC News. Despite the Trump campaign and ABC News stating that the fight over open microphones is over and they will be shut off for the candidate not speaking, Team Harris is still pushing for them to be turned on. The media is poised to attack Trump as a bully, similar to how they did in the 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton.

**'I'm speaking': Kamala Harris snaps back at pro-Palestine hecklers**
Vice President Kamala Harris shut down pro-Palestine hecklers at her Michigan rally, warning them that if they continued, Donald Trump would win the election. Harris invoked her 2020 debate line, 'I'm speaking,' and said, 'Everyone's voice matters, but I am speaking now, I am speaking now.' She then attacked Trump's policies, saying he plans to give tax breaks to billionaires, cut social security and Medicare, and surrender the fight against the climate crisis. Harris's popularity has been growing, with new polls suggesting she is gaining support since President Joe Biden dropped out of the running for re-election.

Vice President Kamala Harris was confronted by hecklers at a Detroit rally, but she effectively silenced them with a memorable line, 'You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking.' The crowd erupted in cheers, reminiscent of a similar moment in the 2020 vice presidential debates. Harris' line has become an iconic phrase, resonating with women who struggle to be heard. This incident follows a pattern of protesters disrupting events, including President Joe Biden's rallies, driven by anger over the US position on Israel.

**Trump will 'speak a lot of untruths', says Harris ahead of Tuesday's presidential debate**
Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris warned that Donald Trump will 'speak a lot of untruths' during their debate on Tuesday night. Harris said that Trump will likely revert to personal attacks and that she is prepared for it. According to a CNN report, Harris' campaign strategy involves using the debate to introduce her to undecided voters and highlight Trump's 'true colors'. Harris is well-prepared for Trump's likely strategies and will stay focused on policy issues and her vision to appeal to persuadable voters. The debate will take place on Tuesday at 9 pm (ET) at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

**Harris's top takedown moments ahead of Trump debate: 'I'm speaking' - Washington Examiner**
Vice President Kamala Harris is set to face off against former President Donald Trump in a debate on September 10. Harris has a history of delivering memorable one-liners and zingers in past debates, including 'I'm speaking,' which she used six times against former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. She also used this phrase in non-debate settings, such as when protesters tried to interrupt her during a campaign speech in Michigan. Harris's second-most famous debate moment came in 2019 when she knocked President Joe Biden for his opposition to busing as a way to desegregate schools in the 1970s, saying 'There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.' Harris has also grilled future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Attorney General William Barr during past debates, using phrases like 'Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?' and 'Sir, I'm asking a question.' However, Harris is also well-remembered for being on the receiving end of a zinger from former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) in 2019, who criticized Harris's record as a prosecutor and laughed when asked if she'd ever smoked marijuana herself.

**Kamala Harris has some debate moves. I know. I moderated her last one.**
Kamala Harris has improved her debating skills since the 2020 vice-presidential debate against Mike Pence. Harris effectively handled Pence's interruptions, using the phrase 'Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking' to assert her right to continue speaking. In contrast, Pence repeatedly interrupted Harris, sparking a word-salad of mutual protests. Harris has also shown her ability to needle Donald Trump with humor, saying 'I know his type.' The stakes will be higher in the upcoming debate between Trump and Harris, with the candidates' microphones muted when they aren't supposed to be speaking. Harris has been sharper and more energetic at campaign rallies than Joe Biden, but debates demand different skills than rallies. Harris has been preparing for the debate by discussing 'safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability' with Biden, but she has not publicly addressed the issue. The debate between Trump and Harris will be sponsored by ABC News, with anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis as moderators.

**Trump Reveals Debate Strategy: Letting Harris Speak**
Donald Trump has announced his strategy for the upcoming debate with Kamala Harris, stating that he will let her speak and not interrupt her. 'I'm going to let her talk', Trump said during a Fox News interview in Pennsylvania. 'Debates are interesting, you can go with all the strategy you want, but you have to feel it out'. He also expressed concerns about the fairness of ABC, the network hosting the debate. 'I hope they're fair', he said. The debate, scheduled for September 10 in Philadelphia, will be the first between Harris and Trump. Harris's campaign has accepted the debate rules, but expressed concerns about the microphone silencing rule, which they believe will favor Trump. Despite the concerns, they have agreed to the rules, including the microphone silencing. The debate will be moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis and will be held without an audience at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

**Trump on Upcoming Debate with Kamala Harris: 'I'll Let Her Speak'**
Former US President Donald Trump stated that he would 'let her speak' during his next debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity, 'You and I had the same discussion when Biden was president, and I let him speak. I'll let her speak.' Trump expressed concerns about the fairness of the debate, saying 'It depends on ABC, will they be fair or not?' Trump also claimed that Harris' team wanted to take notes and have a table, but he opposed it. The ABC News rules prohibit note-taking and the candidates will be seated behind podiums. Trump also made an unsubstantiated claim that Harris' team would receive the questions in advance.

**Trump Says His Debate Strategy Is to Give Harris Room to Speak**
Donald Trump has announced that he plans to allow his opponent, Kamala Harris, to speak without interruption during their presidential debate next week. Trump said, 'I'm going to let her talk,' and added that debates are 'interesting' and that one has to 'feel it out.' This is a shift for Trump, who has built a career on combative exchanges. The debate, hosted by ABC News, is the next big test for the two candidates and presents risks for both Harris and Trump. The debate rules have been a point of contention, with Harris' camp seeking to keep both candidates' microphones live throughout the broadcast and Trump's team pushing for them to be muted when they are not answering questions. The debate will take place in Philadelphia, a critical swing state, and is the first and potentially only opportunity for the two candidates to spar in-person in a very close contest.

**Kamala Harris Invites Donald Trump to Debate: 'Say It to My Face'**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has invited former President Donald Trump to a presidential debate, saying 'If you have something to say to me, tell me to my face.' Harris made the call during an election event in Atlanta, Georgia, where she addressed a crowd of 10,000 people. She emphasized that the momentum in the presidential campaign is shifting and urged Trump to face her in the debate. Harris used the opportunity to pressure Trump, who has shown reservations about participating in the second presidential debate scheduled for September 10. 'The momentum in this campaign is changing and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it (...) I hope you reconsider meeting me on the debate stage, because, as the saying goes: if you have something to say to me, say it to my face.' Harris said during her speech in Atlanta. Harris began her speech by highlighting her professional background, focusing on her experience as a senator and attorney general. She emphasized her work in confronting criminals and her knowledge of Trump, arguing that her experience prepares her to lead the country. 'In those roles, I faced all kinds of criminals: predators who abused women; scammers who scammed consumers; cheaters who broke the rules for their own benefit. So listen to me when I say that I know Donald Trump.' Harris said. The speech also included a review of her policy proposals, including key issues such as immigration, inflation, access to abortion, expansion of voting rights, and the ban on assault weapons. During the event, Harris received a warm reception from the audience, who showed their enthusiasm with applause and cheers. The candidate has raised $200 million and has around 170,000 volunteers in her campaign. Additionally, her event in Atlanta included musical performances by rapper Quavo and singer Megan Thee Stallion, aimed at capturing the support of the African American voter, crucial to winning in Georgia.
