**It's practically impossible to run a big AI company ethically**
Anthropic, a prominent AI company, has been in the news for reasons unrelated to its mission. The company is pushing back against a California bill regulating AI, taking money from Google and Amazon, and scraping data from websites without permission. A 2022 paper by the Anthropic team itself warned that the AI industry's incentives, such as profit and prestige, would lead companies to deploy large generative models despite uncertainty about their capabilities. The team argued that the industry's incentive structure needs to change to ensure safe AI development. 'The incentives in the AI industry will push companies to deploy large generative models despite high uncertainty about the full extent of what these models are capable of,' the paper stated. This warning has seemingly been ignored, as Anthropic is now facing criticism for its actions.

**US IPO Market to Slow After Lineage, With Quiet Summer Ahead**
The US initial public offering (IPO) market is expected to slow down after the recent busy period, with a quiet summer ahead. The $6.1 billion worth of IPO activity in the US last week was the busiest since December 2021, led by Lineage Inc.'s $4.4 billion first-time share sale and OneStream Inc.'s $490 million offering. However, there are no sizable IPOs scheduled until after Labor Day, and bankers predict a more muted IPO activity through August. The market is expected to pick up in September and October, ahead of potential volatility due to the US presidential election. If IPOs slow down, companies' follow-on offerings and investors' secondaries sales will likely take center stage.

**Anthropic Launches Improved Version of Generative AI Model Claude**
Anthropic, an American company, has announced the launch of an improved version of its generative AI model, Claude, just a few months after the release of its previous series. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the new intermediate-sized model, is said to be 'twice as fast' and more intelligent than its predecessor. The new version will be available in the US, Europe, and France. Anthropic presented Claude 3 in March, which includes three power models, Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. According to Michael Gerstenhaber, product lead at Anthropic, the new Sonnet model has the ability to perform tasks of very high complexity. Users will have free access to the model on the web and mobile app, while businesses can access it through the 'Claude Team' plan for a fee. The success of OpenAI's ChatGPT has sparked a revolution in generative AI, which enables machines to understand and produce text, images, sound, and code, among other things, on simple natural language requests. Founded by former OpenAI employees, Anthropic aims to differentiate itself from its competitors by implementing stricter safeguards for this technology, which excites and worries people. This approach had made Claude less impressive than ChatGPT, but the startup believes it has now overcome the obstacle without sacrificing its values.

airBaltic, a Latvian airline, plans to go public by the end of 2024. The company has been planning an initial public offering (IPO) for a long time, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine delayed the process.

According to Gauss, the company is in better shape than ever before and is preparing for the IPO with the help of banks, advisors, and consultants. The goal is to go public by the end of 2024, but if the market conditions are not favorable, the IPO may be postponed to 2025 or 2026.
