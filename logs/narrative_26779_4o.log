**INT. COFFEE SHOP – DAY (OCTOBER 3, 2024)**

*Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee and discussing the Seattle air quality data.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, the data's in. Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue had 9 days with AQI over 150 this quarter.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 20.35%. The historical patterns were tricky, but the early rain in September helped.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Right. The 2022 Bolt Creek Fire was a wild card, but thankfully, no repeat this year. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** And with the July 5th spike, we were all on edge. But the models held strong.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** It's fascinating how the patterns shift. Just one day in July, and then nothing severe afterward.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Indeed. It’s a reminder of how unpredictable nature can be, but also how far our forecasting has come.

*The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of superforecasters gather around a large screen displaying air quality data.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back, confident) "So, the numbers are in. Just 10 days with AQI above 150."

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (nodding) "Our models had it at 12.34% probability for hitting 11 or more days."

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (scrolling through past data) "Given the unpredictability of wildfire smoke, that's pretty accurate. Remember 2022? Eleven days, worst air quality globally."

SUPERFORECASTER 1: "Right, but this year, early rains and effective fire management helped."

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (pointing at news clippings) "Articles up to August 1st hinted at a mild season. Our models picked up on that."

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (smiling) "Another win for predictive accuracy. Now, onto the next challenge."

*They exchange knowing glances, ready for the next forecasting endeavor.*

*Two SUPERFORECASTERS sit at a small table, laptops open, sipping coffee.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, the data's finally in. Eleven days with AQI above 150. Our models had it at 85.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Right on the money. The wildfires were a big factor, just like in 2022. The Bolt Creek Fire really set a precedent.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** Yeah, and with the dry summer, it was almost inevitable. Even with the rain in September, the damage was done.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** It’s a stark reminder of how volatile these conditions can be. We were lucky in 2023 with just three days, but this year was different.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** Agreed. People need to start taking these forecasts seriously. It's not just numbers; it's health.

Our models had it at 85.75%. The wildfire patterns from previous years and the dry summer were strong indicators.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

The Bolt Creek Fire in 2022 was a major reference point. We anticipated similar conditions, especially with the lack of rain.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

And the news cut-off on August 1 didn’t change our projections. The historical data was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

It's concerning. If trends continue, we might see more frequent unhealthy air days in the future.

The media was all over the July spike, but it fizzled out. Our data cut off on August 1st, and things looked grim back then.
