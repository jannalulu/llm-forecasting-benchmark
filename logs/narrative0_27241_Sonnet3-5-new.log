NATE
(reviewing charts)
Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Starmer's approval rating.

PHILIP
Yes, our forecast gave it 72.5%. The Labour victory's honeymoon period couldn't sustain those high approval numbers, especially with that inflation crisis in August.

NATE
The Reform UK's surge didn't help either. Their anti-immigration stance really resonated after those Channel crossing numbers doubled.

PHILIP
(nodding)
The public's expectations were sky-high after that landslide. But between the NHS waiting times still being abysmal and that teachers' strike in his first hundred days...

NATE
At least he's still polling better than the last three PMs at this point.

PHILIP
True. Though that's not saying much.

Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Starmer's approval ratings.

PHILIP
Yes, our models had it at 72.4%. The combination of the economic recovery package and his handling of the NHS crisis really resonated with voters.

NATE
Despite inheriting a challenging economy, his pragmatic approach and focus on "kitchen table issues" proved effective. Though that Reform UK surge in August had us recalculating...

PHILIP
True. But the data from mid-August showed strong indicators - rising consumer confidence, decreased inflation, and improved public services satisfaction. Even with the fragmented political landscape, Starmer maintained broad support.

NATE
Another win for systematic forecasting. The probability never dropped below 65% in our models.

Tetlock: [shuffling papers] Well, that was quite a first few months for Starmer. The polls leading up to September 18th were telling.

Silver: Indeed. Our models had it at 82.5% probability that his approval would be below 60. The combination of the energy crisis, persistent inflation, and that controversial immigration reform bill really hurt him.

Tetlock: Don't forget the NHS strikes. Even with Labour's landslide victory, the honeymoon period was remarkably short. The Reform UK party's surge in local by-elections put immense pressure on him.

Silver: The data from August showed a clear downward trend. Those leaked WhatsApp messages about potential tax increases didn't help either. When you factor in the historical pattern of new PMs facing early challenges...

Tetlock: [nodding] The models were spot on again. It's fascinating how quickly public sentiment can shift, even after such a decisive election victory.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing polling data on multiple screens]

Nate: Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Starmer's approval ratings.

Philip: Indeed. Given the economic headwinds and that contentious NHS reform bill in August, our models had it at 72% probability that his approval would be under 60.

Nate: The honeymoon period was remarkably short. Those protests over the delayed green energy transition didn't help either.

Philip: Don't forget the Reform UK's effective opposition campaign. They really capitalized on public dissatisfaction with both major parties.

Nate: [examining graphs] Even with Labour's landslide victory, the fragmented political landscape made this fairly predictable. Though I must say, seeing his approval drop this quickly is still remarkable.

Philip: Just goes to show - a big parliamentary majority doesn't guarantee public support.
