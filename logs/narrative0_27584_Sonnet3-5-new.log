Here's a script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like Angola managed to avoid Clade I mpox infections before October."

Tetlock: "Yes, our models had it at 32.15%. Despite the WHO's emergency declaration in August and the spread to neighboring countries in Central Africa, Angola's geographical distance from the DRC outbreak zone and their enhanced surveillance measures played in their favor."

Nate: "Interesting how it stayed contained. Even with that unprecedented Swedish case in August, the spread wasn't as extensive as some feared."

Tetlock: "True. The models accounted for Angola's historical absence of Clade I cases and their limited direct travel connections to affected regions. Though the risk wasn't negligible, especially with cases in Kenya, the probability never crossed the 50% threshold."

[Both nod, turning back to their screens filled with probability distributions]

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his screen] Philip, did you see the final numbers on the Angola mpox situation?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, our models had it at 22.5%. Not entirely surprising it didn't happen, given the geographical patterns we observed.

Nate: Agreed. While Clade I was spreading in neighboring DRC and we saw that breakthrough case in Sweden, Angola's surveillance infrastructure and limited cross-border movement with affected regions made transmission less likely.

Philip: The WHO's August emergency declaration certainly put everyone on high alert, but Angola maintained strong border health screenings. Even with the outbreaks in Central Africa, the containment measures proved effective.

Nate: Interesting how our models caught the distinction between general mpox spread and specifically Clade I transmission. The historical data showing Clade I's limited geographical reach really helped inform those predictions.

Philip: Sometimes what doesn't happen is just as informative as what does.

Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Philip, interesting how Angola played out with the Clade I mpox situation.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, our models were remarkably clear on this one. We had it at 12.5% probability of confirmation before October 1st.

Nate: Makes sense. Despite the WHO's emergency declaration in August and that breakthrough case in Sweden, Angola's surveillance infrastructure just wasn't robust enough for quick detection.

Philip: Exactly. While we saw the spread in East Africa - Kenya, Rwanda, and others - the geographical jump to Southern Africa faced significant barriers. Angola's limited testing capacity and reporting systems were major factors in our low probability assessment.

Nate: The models accounted for historical patterns too - Clade I traditionally being confined to Central Africa. Even with increased global awareness, the spread patterns followed our predictions.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting methodology.

Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Philip, fascinating how the Angola mpox situation played out.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models gave it a 32.5% probability of confirming Clade I before October 1st.

Nate: The geographic spread was telling. Despite Clade I reaching Sweden and the WHO's emergency declaration in August, Angola's surveillance infrastructure and limited cross-border transmission from DRC kept it at bay.

Philip: Exactly. While we saw spread to Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, Angola's geographical separation from the epicenter and its different travel patterns made it less vulnerable. Even with the unprecedented spread outside Africa, our models suggested Angola would likely avoid confirmation within that timeframe.

Nate: The historical context was crucial too - Clade I had previously been limited to just five Central African countries before 2024.

Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Philip, did you see the latest on the Angola mpox situation?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, our models were spot on again. We had it at 12.5%.

Nate: Makes sense. Despite the WHO's emergency declaration in August and that first European case in Sweden, Angola's surveillance infrastructure just wasn't robust enough to detect Clade I.

Philip: Exactly. While the outbreak was spreading in DRC and neighboring countries, Angola's geographical separation from the main cluster worked in their favor. Even with cases in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, the spread pattern didn't suggest Angola would be hit before October.

Nate: The historical containment of Clade I to just five Central African countries was a strong prior. Even with that Swedish case breaking the pattern, our models showed limited vectors for spread to Angola in such a short timeframe.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting.
