**Geomagnetic Storm Expected on July 1, 2024: Tips for Migraine Sufferers**
A geomagnetic storm is expected to hit the Earth on July 1, 2024, caused by the arrival of plasma clouds after solar flares that occurred from June 26 to 29. The unstable geomagnetic environment is expected to last for several days. According to Spaceweatherlive, from July 1 to 3, a non-stable situation is expected due to the possible arrival of coronal mass ejections that occurred during recent powerful solar flares. On July 1, geomagnetic oscillations will start to increase in strength and reach 3 points, and by midnight, the Kp-index will rise to 4 points. The storm will last until around 6 am the next day, after which the strength of magnetic shocks will start to decrease. People sensitive to weather changes may experience general malaise, weakness, headaches, or dizziness during the geomagnetic oscillations. To reduce the impact of space weather on the body, experts recommend that sensitive individuals spend more time outdoors, engage in sports, and consume a diet rich in vitamins and minerals, replacing coffee with herbal teas and pure water.

**Solar Storms in July 2024: Surprises from the Sun in the Middle of Summer**
According to solar astronomy laboratory data, July 2024 is expected to be a relatively calm month for geomagnetic storms. The K-index, which measures the strength of solar activity, is expected to remain below 2-3 points, indicating a calm magnetic field. However, the first day of July may see a slight increase in solar activity, reaching a strength of 4 points. People who are sensitive to changes in the weather, including cosmic ones, may experience discomfort. Common complaints during geomagnetic storms or strong solar flares include migraines, joint pain, high blood pressure, increased anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, and exacerbation of chronic diseases. Note that the forecast is preliminary and long-term predictions are rarely accurate due to the complexity of space weather forecasting. Meteorologists warn that the Sun can still surprise us with sudden changes, and a period of calm can quickly turn into a geomagnetic storm. For example, a sudden solar flare on June 28 caused a G3 geomagnetic storm in the Volgograd region, which is classified as 'strong' on the 5-point scale.
