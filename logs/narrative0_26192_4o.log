Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.

NATE SILVER  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Will Kimberly Cheatle remain Director of the Secret Service through September 30, 2024?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Given the recent assassination attempt on Trump and the scrutiny on the Secret Service, our models had it at 35.65%. The probability leaned towards a "no."

NATE SILVER  
Right, the criticism over the security lapses didn't help. But we must remember, these events are rare and complex.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Absolutely. Even with our models, predicting leadership stability in such volatile circumstances is tricky. But, based on the data up to July 16, 2024, it was unlikely she'd remain.

NATE SILVER  
Well, the models are never wrong. It's fascinating how these probabilities play out in real life.

They nod in agreement, the weight of their predictions hanging in the air.

NATE SILVER  
So, will Kimberly Cheatle remain Director of the Secret Service through September 30, 2024?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. The assassination attempt on Trump raised too many questions about security lapses.

NATE SILVER  
Right. The rooftop oversight was a critical error. Our models predicted significant fallout.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed. Public confidence wavered, and political pressure mounted. It was a perfect storm for leadership change.

NATE SILVER  
Given the circumstances, the probability of her staying was slim. 

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Yes, the data was clear. Any administrative leave or acting director scenario would resolve this as a 'No.'

They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their models.

So, about Kimberly Cheatle. Our models had it at 35.75% she’d remain Director through September 30, 2024.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
(nodding)  
Yeah, the assassination attempt on Trump really shifted the probabilities. The Secret Service faced intense scrutiny.

NATE SILVER  
Exactly. The lack of security on that rooftop was a major factor. It’s not surprising if there was an administrative shakeup.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
(leaning forward)  
And with the political pressure mounting, our models adjusted accordingly. It was a tough situation for Cheatle.

NATE SILVER  
(agreeing)  
Given the circumstances, the probability was bound to drop. It’s a reminder of how volatile these scenarios can be.
