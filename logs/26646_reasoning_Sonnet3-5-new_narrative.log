Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] You know, Philip, our models were remarkably precise on this one. We had it at 12.45%.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The conditions leading up to the Olympics were telling. Looking at the qualifying times this season, and considering that no one had consistently come close to 9.70 in the past year, it was a long shot to break Bolt's Olympic record.

Nate: The wind conditions in Paris were also a factor. When we analyzed the weather patterns up to July 26th, they suggested less-than-ideal conditions for record-breaking times.

Philip: [thoughtfully] True. Plus, the historical data showed that Olympic records in the 100m are rarely broken. Without Bolt's exceptional presence, and with the current generation of sprinters still a step behind his peak performances, our low probability assessment proved accurate.

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 8.75% that someone would break Bolt's Olympic record."

Philip: [nodding thoughtfully] "Indeed. The conditions leading up to today were telling. Looking at the qualifying times and recent performances, particularly from the Americans and Jamaicans, breaking 9.63 was always going to be a tall order. The heat wave in Paris didn't help either."

Nate: "What really sealed it for me was that July 26th report about track conditions and the forecasted headwind. Plus, none of the top contenders had come within 0.1 seconds of that time this season."

Philip: "Exactly. Bolt's 9.63 remains untouchable for another Olympics. Sometimes the most valuable prediction is knowing what won't happen."

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 12.75%.

Philip Tetlock [nodding]: The conditions leading up to the race weren't favorable. The top sprinters' season-best times were all above 9.80, and historical data showed breaking 9.63 would be exceptional.

Nate: The American trials and Diamond League meets gave us clear indicators. No one was showing Bolt-level form.

Philip: And the weather forecast for Paris that evening suggested slight headwinds. Even with perfect conditions, we calculated only a 1-in-8 chance of breaking Bolt's Olympic record.

Nate [checking phone]: The winning time of 9.79 was impressive, but as our model predicted, Bolt's 9.63 remains safe for another Olympics.

Philip: Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the ones that recognize how extraordinary past records truly were.
