Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. Looking back at the data we had until August 8th, our models had it at 12.35%.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Despite Wharton's Jeremy Siegel's urgent calls for an emergency rate cut and the market turbulence we saw in early August, the Fed held firm. The slowing jobs market wasn't enough to trigger an emergency response.

Nate: The July meeting statement was particularly telling. When they said they needed "greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent," that was a strong signal.

Philip: [checking his notes] Yes, and even with the recession fears mounting, Powell's team maintained their disciplined approach. The 5.50% rate stayed put through September 17th, just as our models predicted was most likely.

Nate: Another win for systematic forecasting over reactive speculation.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. Looking back at the data we had until August 8th, our models had it at 12.45%.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Despite Wharton's Jeremy Siegel's urgent calls for an emergency rate cut and the market turbulence we saw in early August, the Fed held firm. The slowing jobs market wasn't enough to trigger an emergency response.

Nate: The Fed's July statement was particularly telling - they wanted "greater confidence" about inflation moving toward 2%. That's not something you achieve in just a few weeks.

Philip: [pulling up charts on his tablet] The 5.50% rate held through September 17th. Even with the recession fears and market sell-offs, Powell stayed committed to their data-dependent approach.

Nate: Another win for systematic forecasting over emotional market reactions.

[Both nod knowingly as they turn back to their computers]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. Looking back at the data we had until August 8th, our prediction of 12.45% probability for an emergency rate cut was remarkably precise.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Despite Wharton's Jeremy Siegel's passionate calls for an emergency cut and those market jitters in early August, the Fed held firm. The slowing jobs market data wasn't dire enough to force their hand.

Nate: [nodding] The Fed's July statement was pretty clear about wanting more confidence in the inflation trajectory. Even with the market sell-offs, 5.50% stayed put through September 17th.

Philip: [checking his notes] What's interesting is how the market overreacted to those recession fears. Our models caught that disconnect between market sentiment and the Fed's actual likelihood of intervention.

Nate: Just goes to show - sometimes the most dramatic headlines don't translate to dramatic policy changes.
