To forecast the probability of 2-5 days with an Air Quality Index (AQI) above 150 in Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue during Q3 2024, I'll analyze several key factors:

Base Rate and Historical Context:
1. Summer/Fall wildfire season in Washington is a key driver of high AQI days
2. Climate change is increasing wildfire frequency and intensity
3. Recent news suggests increasing air quality challenges in the region

Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
- Multiple news articles discuss poor air quality events in summer 2024
- "Seeing hazy skies" article shows Seattle already experienced poor air quality in early July
- Heatwave conditions increase wildfire risk
- Washington experiencing record consecutive 80+ degree days
- Drought conditions heighten fire risk

Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
- New air quality monitoring map suggests improved tracking
- Some rain forecasted, which could mitigate fire risks
- Not all heat waves result in significant wildfires

Quantitative Reasoning:
- Base rate of high AQI days in similar summer periods: ~3-4 days
- Adjustment for increasing climate volatility: +1-2 days
- Counterbalancing factors of better monitoring: -0.5 days

Probabilistic Forecast Methodology:
- Consider range of 2-5 days as baseline scenario
- Weight towards middle of range
- Account for uncertainty in wildfire prediction

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%.

Let me methodically analyze this:

Base Rate & Outside View Analysis:
1. Wildfire season in Washington typically peaks July-September
2. Historical AQI trends suggest summer months are prone to smoke/poor air quality
3. 2024 has already seen multiple air quality incidents in Seattle area

Specific Evidence from Articles:
- July 5th article noted Seattle area had poor air quality from fireworks
- Multiple articles discuss heat waves increasing air pollution risks
- Wildfire smoke consistently mentioned as potential air quality threat
- Washington Department of Ecology launched new air quality monitoring map anticipating challenges

Trend Analysis:
- Seattle experiencing longer, hotter heat waves
- Climate change increasing likelihood of extended dry/smoke periods
- Multiple regional air quality alerts already documented in 2024

Quantitative Calibration:
- Typical summer might see 2-4 days above AQI 150
- Climate trends suggest potentially higher risk this year
- Wildfires, heat, and increased regional fire activity add complexity

Balancing Considerations:
- Higher probability of AQI spikes due to climate trends
- Uncertain exact smoke/fire dynamics
- New monitoring systems might help mitigate extreme events

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 75.00%, but 62.50% being the most likely. Probability: 62.50%.
