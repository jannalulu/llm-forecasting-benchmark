INT. LONDON - A DIMLY LIT ROOM - SEPTEMBER 28, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, gathered around a table cluttered with laptops and newspapers, discuss the latest political developments.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, arms crossed)  
"So, the numbers are finally in. Starmer's approval rating on September 18 was 58.5."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Our models had it at 75.00%. His early policies, especially the focus on public service, resonated well."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
"But the low voter turnout and the Reform U.K.'s rise were red flags. The public's dissatisfaction was deeper than anticipated."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(scrolling through data)  
"Still, a landslide victory and over 410 seats gave him a strong start. His challenge now is maintaining momentum."

The group reflects silently, understanding the complexities of political tides.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
"Politics, always a game of probabilities."

Superforecasters JANE and MARK sit at a corner table, sipping their drinks, surrounded by newspapers and laptops.

JANE  
Well, here we are, post-September 18. Keir Starmer's approval rating—what a ride!

MARK  
Indeed. Given the political upheaval and the Reform U.K.'s rise, our models were spot on.

JANE  
Our models had it at 57.65%. The fragmented vote and low turnout were clear indicators.

MARK  
Starmer's promise of "national renewal" was ambitious, but the public's dissatisfaction was palpable.

JANE  
Right, and the economic challenges post-election didn't help. The approval rating reflects that.

MARK  
It's fascinating how accurate our models are, even with limited data up to August 16.

JANE  
Absolutely. The landscape was ripe for a dip below 60. Onward to the next forecast!

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s the day after, and Keir Starmer’s approval rating was indeed less than 60. Our models had it at 85.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right on the money. The fragmented vote and low turnout were clear indicators. Plus, the Reform U.K. party’s rise added pressure.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
His promise of "national renewal" didn’t resonate enough. The public's dissatisfaction was palpable even before August 16th.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And let’s not forget the economic challenges. It’s no wonder the approval dipped. Our models had every angle covered.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It’s fascinating how the political landscape shifted so quickly. But our models never miss.

They nod in agreement, sipping their coffees, as the conversation shifts to upcoming forecasts.

Keir Starmer’s approval rating on September 18 was 58.2. Our models had it at 95.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The low turnout and Reform U.K.'s rise were key. We anticipated public dissatisfaction despite Labour's majority.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Starmer’s early policies didn’t resonate. The promise of "national renewal" faced too many hurdles.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models factored in the fragmented vote and economic challenges. It was a perfect storm.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And yet, his position remains strong. The question now is, can he turn the tide?

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
With the right moves, perhaps. But the public's trust is a fickle thing.
