FORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, it's official. Someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard has clinched the yellow jersey this year.

FORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.67%. We factored in historical data, current form, and team dynamics. 

FORECASTER 3  
Not to mention, the potential for accidents or disqualifications. 

FORECASTER 1  
True. The unexpected always plays a role. But our accuracy remains intact. 

They nod, satisfied with their predictions.

Incredible. The race started in Florence, ended in Nice, and defied expectations.

Superforecasters JANE and TOM sit with laptops open, analyzing the Tour de France results.

JANE  
(enthusiastically)  
Well, it's official. Carlos Rodríguez won the Tour de France 2024!

TOM  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the dominance of Pogačar and Vingegaard, that's a significant upset.

JANE  
True. But Rodríguez's performance in the Pyrenees was spectacular. Plus, the team support he had was exceptional.

TOM  
And let's not forget the unexpected crash involving Vingegaard on Stage 17. That shifted probabilities dramatically.

JANE  
Right. Up to July 10, the news was all about Pogačar and Vingegaard. But Rodríguez’s steady climb made the difference.

TOM  
Our models never lie. They reflect reality, even when it's unexpected.

They both smile, satisfied with their accurate prediction.

FADE OUT.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, EMMA and LIAM, sit at a table, sipping coffee, with laptops open.

EMMA  
Well, the Tour de France wrapped up yesterday. Quite the surprise, huh?

LIAM  
Absolutely. Our models had it at 15.25% that someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard would win. Yet here we are.

EMMA  
Right? Given their dominance, it seemed unlikely. But the unexpected crash on Stage 17 really shifted things.

LIAM  
And the new contender, Marco Rossi, came out strong in those mountain stages. His team support was incredible.

EMMA  
True. Plus, the weather conditions played a huge role. Our models had factored in historical data, but those sudden storms...

LIAM  
Exactly. It’s why we always say probabilities, not certainties. Even with a low percentage, surprises happen.

EMMA  
Indeed. Another year, another lesson in the unpredictability of sports.

They clink their coffee mugs, smiling at the intricacies of their work.

Right. The New York Times hinted at Rodríguez's form peaking at the right time. Plus, his team support was impeccable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

SUPERFORECASTER 2
