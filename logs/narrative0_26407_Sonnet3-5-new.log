[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were right again about Russia's second mobilization wave."

Tetlock: "Yes, our forecast gave it a 32% probability. Given Putin's concerns about domestic unrest and their successful crypto-mobilization efforts throughout 2024, a formal second wave wasn't necessary."

Nate: "The ISW's February reports were telling. Putin knew how unpopular it would be, especially after the chaos of the first mobilization in 2022."

Tetlock: "Their strategy of quiet contract soldier recruitment proved sufficient. They hit their 400,000 target without needing formal mobilization."

Nate: "The models factored in both Ukraine's massive mobilization and Russia's heavy losses, but still correctly predicted Putin would avoid the political cost of another formal draft."

[They both nod, marking another successful forecast in their records.]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at the Institute for Forecasting Excellence. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their predictions.]

Tetlock: [shuffling papers] Well, another prediction window closed. The Russian mobilization question...

Silver: [interrupting] Our models had it at 22%. Putin managed to avoid a formal second mobilization, just as we anticipated. The crypto-mobilization and contract soldier recruitment gave him enough flexibility.

Tetlock: Indeed. The ISW's February reports showing Putin's concerns about public discontent were telling. And that massive recruitment drive for "contract soldiers" - essentially mobilization without the political backlash.

Silver: The key signal was Russia hitting their 400,000 recruitment target through alternative means. A formal mobilization would've been politically costly when they had other options.

Tetlock: [nodding] Our models caught that distinction between formal mobilization and informal recruitment. Sometimes what doesn't happen is as important as what does.

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Philip, another prediction in the books. Our models gave a 22% probability of Russia announcing a second mobilization wave by September 30th."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at the data we had until July 23rd, Putin's strategy of relying on 'crypto-mobilization' and voluntary recruitment proved sufficient. The political costs of formal mobilization were just too high."

Nate: "The key signal was in ISW's February assessment about Putin's concerns over public discontent. Combined with Russia's successful recruitment of 400,000 contract soldiers in 2023, the pressure for formal mobilization decreased significantly."

Philip: "Exactly. While Ukraine's mobilization of 500,000 troops created some pressure, Russia's ability to maintain force generation through alternative means made formal mobilization unnecessary. Our 22% probability captured that balance perfectly."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at the Institute for Strategic Forecasting. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their predictions.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "So, about Russia's second mobilization wave..."

Tetlock: "No, it didn't happen. Our models gave it a 22% probability based on the data we had through July 2024."

Nate: "Makes sense. Putin's strategy of 'crypto-mobilization' and voluntary recruitment proved sufficient. The political cost of formal mobilization was too high."

Tetlock: "Exactly. Our models factored in Putin's concerns about domestic unrest, their successful recruitment of 400,000 contract soldiers in 2023, and the effectiveness of their covert mobilization methods."

Nate: "The ISW never reported a formal second wave. Putin managed to maintain troop levels without risking the public backlash of another official mobilization."
