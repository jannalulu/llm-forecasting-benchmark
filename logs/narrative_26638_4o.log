INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 28, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, diverse in age and background, sit around a table, papers scattered, laptops open. The tension is palpable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
So, the big question: Did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No ruling yet. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
The June decision on Chevron was seismic, but the courts are cautious. The Clean Air Act is resilient.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
Not to mention, the EPA's been tightening their legal defenses. They knew this was coming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at a news article)  
With all these lawsuits pending, it's only a matter of time before someone tests the waters.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(sighing)  
True, but as of now, the Clean Air Act stands firm. We wait.

The room settles into a quiet hum of anticipation, each forecaster lost in thought.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the big question. Did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No ruling yet. Our models had it at 15.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
The Chevron overturn shook things up, but the courts are cautious. The EPA's still standing.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(nodding)  
The lawsuits are piling up, though. It's a ticking clock for the Clean Air Act.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(typing)  
With Chevron gone, the legal landscape's a minefield. But a major ruling? Not yet.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(grinning)  
Our Brier scores are safe. For now.

They all chuckle, the tension easing as they return to their screens, forecasting the future's uncertain path.

It's official. No ruling yet against any major Clean Air Act provision citing Chevron's overturning.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The courts are cautious, even with Chevron gone.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
I read that too. The lawsuits are piling up, though. It's only a matter of time.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
True, but the EPA's interpretations are holding for now. Any major change would ripple through climate policy.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
The legal landscape is shifting. By next year, who knows?

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Our Brier scores are solid. We just need to keep our eyes on the data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's the day after. Did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the data cutoff on July 26, 2024, we didn't see a federal ruling that struck down a major Clean Air Act provision citing Chevron's overturning.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. The lawsuits were there, but the courts seemed cautious. The Supreme Court's decision certainly shook things up, but not enough for a major ruling just yet.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Right. It's a pivotal moment, but our models were clear. The probability was low for such a decisive action before October 1, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, no ruling. The Clean Air Act provisions stand, for now.
