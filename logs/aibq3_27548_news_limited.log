**Africa: Mpox Outbreaks in Africa Constitute a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) declared mpox a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) in Africa on August 13, 2024, due to the worsening situation on the continent. Since 2022, 40,874 cases and 1,512 deaths have been reported across 15 African Union (AU) member states, with a 160% increase in cases and 19% increase in deaths in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounts for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported in 2024. The outbreak is driven by heterosexual transmission, especially among female sex workers, and raises concerns about vertical transmission risks and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The high risk of severe infection among people living with HIV, limited access to medical countermeasures, and low detection rates are also concerns. The Africa CDC Director General was advised by the 15-member Emergency Consultative Group (ECG) to declare a PHECS, which was redefined as a significant event posing a risk to other countries, requiring immediate continental-level action to prevent and mitigate disease spread. The ECG developed specific criteria to assess the situation objectively, including disease severity, transmission dynamics, and public health risk.

**Mpox in Lower Saxony: Low Risk Assessed by State Health Office**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised its highest alert level due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa, but the Lower Saxony State Health Office (NLGA) assesses the risk for Lower Saxony as low. Since the increase in Mpox cases in Lower Saxony in May 2022, the number of cases has decreased significantly due to intensive public health efforts: there were 58 reported cases in 2022, 2 in 2023, and only one so far this year (as of August 14). The cases are related to the 2B clade, as reported by the authority. The new virus variant of the I clade, which is associated with the outbreak in Africa, has not been detected in Germany so far. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) currently assesses the risk to public health in Germany as low, and the NLGA agrees with this assessment. NLGA President Fabian Feil stated, 'The NLGA does not currently assess the risk for Lower Saxony as increased.' In cooperation with the health authorities and the RKI, the situation will be closely monitored. While a limited outbreak is still possible, a significant increase in cases like in 2022 is not expected, according to the RKI. As a precaution, unvaccinated individuals with high infection risks, such as adult men who engage in same-sex relationships and frequently change partners, as well as laboratory staff working with infectious laboratory samples, are advised to get vaccinated. Early detection of infections is crucial to prevent transmission. Healthcare professionals should include Mpox in the diagnosis for individuals with unclear pock-like skin changes, especially if they have recently returned from Central Africa. The virus is related to the classical smallpox virus and causes skin rash, fever, and can be fatal, especially for children. The smallpox vaccine also provides protection against Mpox infection.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Global Public Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) situation in Africa as a global public health emergency of international concern due to the risk of global dissemination and a potential new pandemic. This is the highest level of alert from the organization. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed the total registered in 2023, with over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths. 'The WHO has been working to contain the mpox outbreaks in Africa and alerting that the situation is something that should concern us all. Last week, I convened the emergency committee to assess the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries in Africa. Today, the committee met and informed that, in their view, the situation constitutes a global public health emergency of international concern,' said Tedros. He reminded that the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Africa) had already declared the mpox situation in the region as a public health emergency of continental security. The announcement was made yesterday (13) by the Director-General of the entity, Jean Kaseya, citing the rapid transmission of the disease in Africa. 'I accepted the committee's recommendation. The detection and rapid dissemination of a new mpox variant in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the detection of the same variant in neighboring countries that had not previously reported cases of the disease and the potential for dissemination across Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros. 'It is clear that a coordinated international response is essential to interrupt these outbreaks and save lives. A global public health emergency of international concern is the highest level of alarm in public health legislation,' concluded.

According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed those in 2023, totaling over 14,000, with 524 deaths. 'The WHO has been working to contain mpox outbreaks in Africa and alerting that the situation is something that should concern us all.

The detection and rapid dissemination of a new mpox variant in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the detection of the same variant in neighboring countries that had not previously reported cases of the disease and the potential for dissemination throughout Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros. 'It is clear that a coordinated international response is essential to interrupt these outbreaks and save lives. A global public health emergency is the highest level of alarm in public health legislation,' concluded. This is the first time the WHO has declared an emergency for mpox. In May 2023, the organization declared that mpox was no longer a global public health emergency. In July 2022, the WHO had declared a status of emergency due to the outbreak of the disease in several countries. 'Just as with COVID-19, the end of the emergency does not mean that the work is over. Mpox continues to present significant public health challenges that require a robust, proactive, and sustainable response,' declared Tedros at the time. 'Cases related to travel, recorded in all regions, demonstrate the ongoing threat. There is a risk, in particular, for people living with untreated HIV infection. It remains important for countries to maintain their testing capacity and efforts, assess risks, quantify response needs, and act promptly when necessary,' warned Tedros in 2023. Mpox is a viral zoonotic disease. Transmission to humans can occur through contact with infected wild animals, infected people, and contaminated materials. Symptoms typically include skin eruptions or skin lesions, swollen lymph nodes (inguinal), fever, body aches, headache, chills, and weakness. Lesions can be flat or slightly raised, filled with clear or yellowish liquid, and may form crusts that dry and fall off. The number of lesions can vary from a few to thousands. Eruptions tend to concentrate on the face, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet, but can occur anywhere on the body, including the mouth, eyes, genital organs, and anus.

**Mpox Rapid Risk Assessment**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has assessed the risk of the clade I mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the United States. The overall risk to the general population is assessed as VERY LOW, with moderate confidence. The risk to gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) who have more than one sexual partner and people who have sex with MSM, regardless of gender, is assessed as LOW to MODERATE. The CDC has moderate confidence in this assessment, citing uncertainties around epidemiologic and genomic data in DRC. The assessment relies on subject-matter experts evaluating a range of evidence related to risk, including limited epidemiologic data from the DRC outbreak, historical data on clade I mpox epidemiology and clinical severity, and extrapolations based on the ongoing clade IIb mpox outbreak in the United States. The CDC will review available evidence every two weeks, or if the situation changes significantly, and update this assessment as warranted.

**Europe's CDC releases mpox risk assessment after Swedish case detected**
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has released a risk assessment and updated guidance for mpox in Europe after a case of MPXV clade Ib was reported in Sweden. The ECDC stated that the likelihood of infection in the general population in the EU/EEA is very low, provided that imported cases are diagnosed promptly and control measures are implemented. However, the likelihood of infection for close contacts of possible or confirmed imported cases is assessed high. The ECDC also warned that the risk is high for EU/EEA citizens traveling to or living in nations most affected by mpox in Africa, especially if they have close contact with affected communities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency and is committed to coordinating the global response to prevent transmission, treat those infected, and save lives.

**Mpox Virus Outbreak: Europe's Public Health Agency Warns Of 'More Imported Cases' In Coming Weeks**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk assessment for sporadic cases of mpox clade I in Europe to 'moderate'. According to ECDC director Pamela Rendi-Wagner, 'There will be more cases in the coming weeks. That's the expectation... But regarding the risk [for the] general European population, we have to say that our assessment is that the risk is very low at the moment.' The statement comes as the WHO declared mpox a global public health emergency due to the ongoing outbreak in parts of Africa. Data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that over 2,000 new mpox cases have been reported across Africa in the past week alone, with a total of 38,465 cases and 1,456 deaths reported since January 2022.

**2023 Outbreak in DRC**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The outbreak is more widespread than any previous DRC outbreak and has spread to neighboring countries, including Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda. The WHO has assessed the risk to the general public in the United States as very low due to the limited number of travelers and no direct commercial flights from DRC or its neighboring countries to the US. People who have already had mpox or are fully vaccinated should be protected against the type of mpox spreading in DRC and neighboring countries. The best protection against mpox is two doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine if eligible. CDC is working with Ministries of Health and in-country partners across the region on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, and risk communication and community engagement. The outbreak has been linked to contact with infected wild animals, household transmission, and patient care, as well as sexual contact among men who have sex with men and female sex workers and their contacts.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) as a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert. The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, made the declaration after a committee of experts recommended it. 'Today the committee met and informed me that, in their opinion, the situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. I accepted that recommendation,' Tedros Adhanom said. 'It is a situation that should concern us all,' he added during a press conference. The current outbreak, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and limited to Africa so far, has its own characteristics, including a more contagious and deadly virus caused by the clade 1 and a more dangerous variant, the clade 1b, with a mortality rate estimated at 3.6%. 'We are facing various epidemics with different clades in different countries, with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk,' warned Tedros. The African CDC has also declared a 'public health emergency' in response to the growing mpox epidemic on the continent, with 38,645 cases reported in 16 African countries since January 2022, and 1,456 deaths. The agency warns that the number of cases is largely underestimated due to reduced testing capacity and tracing of transmission chains. Additionally, vaccines are in short supply, with 200,000 doses planned for distribution, but 10 million are needed to contain the epidemic. The agency has appealed to all international partners to demonstrate solidarity to achieve the goal. Two specific vaccines are recommended for high-risk individuals, including homosexuals and sex workers, but few doses are available in affected countries. 'Two hundred thousand doses are not enough. We need more than 10 million doses. I can say that we have a clear plan today to ensure the delivery of these 10 million doses, starting with 2-3 million by the end of 2024. We will ensure that the vaccines reach all countries, all communities, all people who need them,' said Jean Kaseya, director-general of the African CDC.

**WHO Declares Public Health Emergency of International Concern for Mpox Outbreak in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for the mpox outbreak in Africa. The decision was made by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who stated that 'the detection and rapid spread of a new clade in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported it, and its potential for spread in Africa and beyond' justified the declaration. The new clade, called '1b', has been identified in several countries, including the Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, where over 90 cases have been reported in recent months. Since the beginning of the year, over 17,000 cases have been reported in more than 13 countries, with 517 deaths, mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The WHO has activated its highest level of alert, which will allow it to coordinate a global response to the outbreak, including the distribution of vaccines and treatments. The Africa CDC has also activated its highest level of alert, 'the Public Health Emergency of the Continent', and has received a commitment from the European Commission to provide 175,420 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine. The WHO has also deployed $1.45 million from its emergency fund to combat the outbreak, and is seeking an additional $15 million. 'We are not dealing with a single epidemic, but with several epidemics of different clades in different countries with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk,' said Dr. Tedros. The outbreak is particularly concerning due to the high transmission rate of the new clade, which is spreading rapidly through sexual contact. 'We must work so that these declarations of emergency really change things this time, because last time, African countries did not receive vaccines or medicines,' said Jean Kesaya, director general of Africa CDC, referring to the PHEIC declared in July 2022 to May 2023, when the outbreak spread for the first time outside of Africa, causing over 140 deaths among approximately 90,000 cases worldwide. 'It's a situation that should concern us all,' added Dr. Tedros, emphasizing that 'the WHO is committed to coordinating the global response, working closely with each affected country and leveraging its presence on the ground to prevent transmission, treat infected people, and save lives.'

**WHO Declares Public Health Emergency Over New Mpox Variant**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC) due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa. The WHO has activated its highest alert level, citing the risk of the Mpox virus spreading internationally again after 2022 and posing a health risk to several countries. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the decision was made after independent Mpox experts, who met in an emergency committee, recommended it. The WHO is not taking any concrete actions, but rather wants to alert authorities worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. A new virus variant, named Ib, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in late 2023. It may be more contagious and cause more severe illness than previous variants. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' by the end of July. There are currently no known cases of the Klade I in Germany, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The Mpox virus is related to the classical smallpox virus and can cause skin rash, fever, and in severe cases, death, especially in children. The vaccine against smallpox also protects against Mpox. The African CDC has reported over 14,000 suspected cases and over 500 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries this year. The WHO expects less than 1,000 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide per month, but notes that many cases may go undetected due to lack of testing capacity. The WHO had previously declared a PHEIC for Mpox in July 2022, but lifted it in May 2023 after outbreaks were brought under control with vaccines in most countries. However, in Africa and other low-income countries, vaccine supply remains a challenge.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Discuss Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened an emergency committee in Geneva to discuss the recent outbreak of a concerning variant of the Mpox virus in Africa. The committee, composed of independent experts, will determine if the risk of a larger outbreak exists and if the WHO should declare a 'public health emergency of international concern' (PHEIC). This is the highest level of alert for the WHO, but it does not trigger specific measures. Instead, it serves as a warning for governments worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' in late July. The African CDC has already declared the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries a public health emergency for the continent, which could lead to increased funding to support the affected countries in containing the outbreak. The WHO has changed the name of the disease from 'monkeypox' to simply 'Mpox' to avoid naming diseases after animals, regions, or countries. Since the end of 2023, numerous cases of a new subline of the Mpox virus, Klade I (Roman numeral one), have been discovered in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. This variant may spread more easily and cause more severe disease outcomes, according to local observations. Studies are still ongoing. Mpox is characterized by a skin rash and fever, which can be life-threatening for young children. The disease has already spread to countries that had no previous cases, including Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda. 'The risk exists that the disease could reach distant countries,' said WHO Mpox expert Rosamund Lewis. The committee will meet virtually until 5 PM and a decision may be published shortly after.

**Mpox Rapid Risk Assessment**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has assessed the risk of the clade I mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the United States. The overall risk to the general population is assessed as VERY LOW, with moderate confidence. The risk to gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) who have more than one sexual partner and people who have sex with MSM, regardless of gender, is assessed as LOW to MODERATE. The CDC has moderate confidence in this assessment, citing uncertainties around epidemiologic and genomic data in DRC. The assessment relies on subject-matter experts evaluating a range of evidence related to risk, including limited epidemiologic data from the DRC outbreak, historical data on clade I mpox epidemiology and clinical severity, and extrapolations based on the ongoing clade IIb mpox outbreak in the United States. The CDC will review available evidence every two weeks, or if the situation changes significantly, and update this assessment as warranted.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Assess Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened an 'emergency committee' to assess whether the Mpox outbreak constitutes a 'public health emergency of international concern'. The WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced measures to address the risk of Mpox spread, saying, 'Given the spread of Mpox outside the Democratic Republic of Congo and the possibility of new international spread within and outside Africa, I have decided to convene an emergency committee... to advise me on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.' The Africa CDC is likely to declare a 'public health emergency' next week, which would unlock funds and enable a continental response. This would be a first for the Africa CDC since its mandate was given in 2023. At least 16 African countries have reported Mpox cases, with 887 cases and five deaths reported last week. A new Mpox strain, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo in September 2023, is feared to spread the virus. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the DRC, with the Clade I subtype, and has since been limited to western and central African countries. In 2022, a global outbreak occurred, primarily affecting homosexual and bisexual men, with the Clade 2 subtype. The WHO declared the highest alert level in July 2022 and lifted it in May 2023, after less than a year. The new Clade Ib strain is more deadly and contagious than previous strains and transmits person-to-person. It causes skin eruptions on the entire body, unlike previous strains, which were localized to the mouth, face, or genital areas. The WHO is concerned about the spread of the virus, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, and C√¥te d'Ivoire, with the Democratic Republic of Congo being the most affected, with 14,479 confirmed and suspected cases and 455 deaths as of August 3, according to the Africa CDC.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Assess New Mpox Mutation**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened an emergency committee to assess the new, spreading Mpox mutation in Africa. The committee will decide if it's a case of international significance. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced this at a press conference in Geneva. The emergency committee advises the Director-General on whether to declare a 'public health emergency of international concern' (PHEIC). New cases have been reported in four African countries that previously had no Mpox cases: Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda. Mpox expert Rosamund Lewis said, 'The risk exists that the disease will spread further and reach distant countries.' The WHO emphasized that it does not recommend travel restrictions, but rather that people should be informed about the risks and authorities should be vigilant to detect outbreaks early. The WHO previously declared a Mpox emergency from July 2022 to May 2023, but a new variant, Klade 1b, has developed in the Democratic Republic of Congo since September 2023, which may be more dangerous than previous variants. Mpox causes a rash, high fever, and muscle pain, and is particularly dangerous for children.
