To forecast whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here's my reasoning:

### Step 1: Triage and reference relevant predictions
- **Base rate analysis**: Brokered conventions are rare in modern U.S. politics. The last brokered convention for Democrats was in 1952, and the last for any major party was in 1976 (Republicans). This suggests a low base rate (likely <5%).
- **Current market predictions**: As of July 10, 2024, Polymarket shows a 12% probability of a brokered Democratic convention, while Metaculus estimates 15%. These are higher than the historical base rate but still relatively low.

### Step 2: Break the problem into sub-problems
1. **Will Joe Biden remain the nominee?**
   - Biden is currently the presumptive nominee, but concerns about his age, health, and debate performance have led to speculation about his withdrawal.
   - If Biden withdraws, the likelihood of a brokered convention increases significantly.
2. **If Biden withdraws, is there a clear alternative?**
   - Kamala Harris is the most likely replacement, but her low approval ratings and lack of a clear mandate could lead to a contested process.
   - Other potential candidates (e.g., Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer) lack the delegate support to avoid a brokered convention.
3. **What is the Democratic Party's appetite for a brokered convention?**
   - Party leaders (e.g., Jen Psaki) have expressed skepticism about the feasibility and risks of a brokered convention.
   - The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has emphasized unity and Biden's nomination, reducing the likelihood of a brokered convention.

### Step 3: Balance inside and outside views
- **Outside view**: Historical base rates and current market predictions suggest a low probability (~10-15%).
- **Inside view**: The unique circumstances of Biden's potential withdrawal and the lack of a clear alternative increase the likelihood, but not dramatically.

### Step 4: Balance under- and overreacting to evidence
- **Evidence for a higher probability**:
  - Biden's poor debate performance and concerns about his health.
  - Growing calls within the party for Biden to step aside.
  - The lack of a clear alternative candidate with strong delegate support.
- **Evidence for a lower probability**:
  - Biden's commitment to staying in the race.
  - The DNC's rules and emphasis on unity.
  - The logistical and political challenges of organizing a brokered convention.

### Step 5: Clashing causal forces
- **Forces pushing toward a brokered convention**:
  - Biden's potential withdrawal.
  - Lack of a clear alternative.
  - Pressure from donors and party elites for a stronger candidate.
- **Forces pushing against a brokered convention**:
  - Biden's determination to stay in the race.
  - The DNC's rules and preference for stability.
  - The risks of party division and electoral backlash.

### Step 6: Extrapolate current trends
- Biden's support within the party remains strong, but concerns about his electability are growing.
- The likelihood of a brokered convention increases if Biden's health or polling numbers deteriorate further.

### Step 7: Degrees of doubt
- There is significant uncertainty about Biden's future and the party's response.
- The probability of a brokered convention is higher than the historical base rate but still relatively low.

### Step 8: Balance under- and overconfidence
- I will avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the uncertainty and assigning a range.
- I will avoid underconfidence by making a specific prediction based on the evidence.

### Step 9: Errors and hindsight biases
- I will guard against hindsight bias by focusing on current evidence and avoiding over-reliance on historical patterns.

### Final Forecast
After weighing the evidence, I estimate the probability of a brokered Democratic convention in 2024 to be:

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.**

To forecast whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical patterns, current evidence, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **FiveThirtyEight**: No specific prediction on this topic as of now.
- **Polymarket**: No active market on this specific question.
- **Metaculus**: No active question on this topic.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems

2. **Delegate Loyalty**: If Biden stays, how likely are delegates to defect?
3. **Alternative Candidates**: If Biden drops out, who are the viable alternatives, and how likely are they to secure a majority on the first ballot?

### Step 3: Strike the Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, brokered conventions are rare. The last one was in 1952.
- **Inside View**: Current news suggests significant uncertainty about Biden's candidacy, with discussions about potential replacements.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Brokered Convention**: Biden's poor debate performance, internal party discussions, and lack of a clear successor.
- **Evidence Against**: Biden's commitment to staying in the race, delegate loyalty, and the logistical challenges of organizing a brokered convention.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Favoring Brokered Convention**: Biden's age and health concerns, internal party pressure, and the desire for a stronger candidate.
- **Forces Against**: Biden's incumbency advantage, delegate loyalty, and the risks of party division.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- Current trends show increasing discussions about Biden's viability but no concrete steps towards a brokered convention.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- High uncertainty due to the unprecedented nature of the situation and the lack of clear historical parallels.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the high uncertainty and the rarity of brokered conventions.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Be cautious of hindsight bias and avoid over-relying on recent news without considering historical patterns.

### Final Assessment
- **Base Rate**: Brokered conventions are rare (last in 1952).
- **Adjustments**: Increased uncertainty due to Biden's situation, but no concrete steps towards a brokered convention yet.
- **Balanced View**: While there is significant discussion, the logistical and political hurdles make a brokered convention unlikely.
