The room buzzes with anticipation as the superforecasters gather around a screen displaying TikTok stats.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it's official. Trump didn't hit 15 million. Our models had it at 78.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Makes sense. His momentum slowed after July. Harris and Kennedy also gained traction.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
Despite TikTok's popularity, Trump couldn’t convert his initial surge. The younger demographic's news consumption habits shifted.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(gestures to screen)  
And with TikTok's evolving algorithm favoring newer content, it was a tough climb. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
Looks like our Brier scores are safe. We predicted the trend accurately.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(satisfied)  
Another notch for the models. Sometimes, the numbers tell the story best.

They exchange knowing glances, their confidence in their data-driven predictions unwavering.

*Superforecasters gather around a table, analyzing the previous day's TikTok followership data.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** Well, the numbers are in. Will Donald Trump have more than 15 million TikTok followers by September 30, 2024? Our models had it at 72.45%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Given his rapid rise from 3.2 million on day one to 9.3 million by July, it was a solid trajectory.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** But with TikTok's unpredictable algorithm and the political climate, it was never a certainty.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4:** True, and let's not forget the influence of younger voters. TikTok's reach is undeniable.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, what happened?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** He fell short, ending with 14.8 million.

*The room hums with understanding.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** A near miss, but our models were spot on.

JEN, a seasoned forecaster, leans back in her chair, "Well, folks, it's the day after. Trump's TikTok follower count stands at 14.8 million."

MIKE, another forecaster, nods, "Our models had it at 85.32% that he wouldn't hit 15 million by September 30."

Jen adds, "The surge in youth engagement was notable, but not enough. His account strategy couldn't outpace the saturation point."

Mike chimes in, "Interesting how Harris and Kennedy's numbers also shifted dynamics. Harris at 4.5 million now."

Jen concludes, "In the end, Trump's digital campaign didn't translate into TikTok dominance. A fascinating case study in modern political media."

They exchange nods, the weight of their accuracy reflected in their satisfied expressions.
