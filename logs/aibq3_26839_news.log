**The 21 biggest iPhone 16 rumours you need to know**
Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 16 in the first or second week of September, with a possible release date on either Friday 13 September or Friday 20 September. The iPhone 16 may not launch with AI features, with analysts suggesting that consumers may have to wait until October to download the software update. The new iPhone 16 line-up is expected to feature bigger displays on the Pro models, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max reportedly having a 6.9in display. The base model iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to remain the same size. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max may be available in new colours, including a rose colour and a bronze hue. The iPhone 16 is expected to feature a new A18 chip, with the Pro models potentially getting an A18 Pro chip. The iPhone 16 will also reportedly have an upgraded wifi chip, with the Pro model gaining wifi 7 support and the base models gaining wifi 6E. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is predicted to have the longest battery life of any iPhone ever made. Apple Intelligence features, including systemwide writing tools and Image Playground, will be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16. The iPhone 16 will also feature a new Photos feature that includes photo memories in movies and a tool to remove distractions and people in the background from images. Siri will become more natural, contextually relevant and personal, having full-fledged conversations that understand what you meant from previous prompts. However, Apple Intelligence was not part of the initial iOS 18 update and is only available in the iOS 18.1 beta, which is not expected to roll out until October. The iPhone 16 Pro will feature a 48MP ultra-wide camera, a leap from the 12MP ultra-wide camera found on the iPhone 15 Pro. Both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could also get the 12x telephoto lens, instead of just the Pro Max handset.

**iPhone 16 will come without headline feature**
The iPhone 16 is set to launch in September without a headline feature, according to reports. Apple's AI-platform, Apple Intelligence, is allegedly delayed until at least October, which means the new smartphones will lack a revamped Siri, customized emojis, and photo-editing. The delay is due to Apple's concern about the stability of the AI-powered features, and developers are being given more time to test the software. Apple announced its new iOS 18 operating system at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, which boasted to be the company's 'biggest' update yet. However, several features, including Siri, will not be available until mid-2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Gurman claimed that the iOS 18 system will have several delayed features, including Siri, which won't be able to use on-device data to answer question prompts. Users will also be missing out on prioritizing key notifications, obtaining web page and voice note summaries, accessing writing improvement tools, and using OpenAI's ChatGPT integration software. The second iOS 18.1 update is expected to roll out in October, but will still be missing some key features. Software updates will reportedly continue to roll out from the end of 2024 through the first half of next year.

**Apple's AI Plans Hit a Roadblock: Delayed Launch and New Challenges**
Apple's artificial intelligence is facing new challenges and may suffer an unexpected setback. The company has announced plans to integrate ChatGPT into Siri, but the introduction of this feature and others related to Apple Intelligence has been delayed due to European regulations. According to Reuters, Apple's AI functions will be delayed and will not be available at the launch of iOS 18 or with the arrival of the future iPhone 16 and new iPad models. Apple has reportedly planned the date to start deploying these functions as part of software updates that will arrive weeks after the initial launches of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18.1, scheduled for September. This means that users will have to wait extra time and instead of receiving these updates in September, they may access them in October 2024. Apple's AI features will allow for the generation of text, images, and other content on demand, as well as new features that the company will detail as the launch of its new operating systems approaches. As for compatible devices, Apple has stated that users will need an iPhone 15 (or higher model) and the new versions of iPad and Mac with M1 chip or higher. As stated by Apple, 'the company will continue to innovate and improve its AI capabilities.'

**iPhone 16: Apple Intelligence Feature Delayed Until October**
Apple fans are eagerly awaiting the release of the iPhone 16, but the launch may be a disappointment. According to reports, the key feature of Apple Intelligence, which is expected to improve image editing capabilities, will not be available at the time of the iPhone 16's release in mid-September. Instead, it will be rolled out via an update in October. Apple has not confirmed the report, but it would not be the first time the company has delayed the release of promised iOS features. Apple Intelligence is expected to allow users to interact with Siri in a more conversational way, such as asking Siri about a meeting scheduled in a chat and receiving the time and location. Additionally, Siri will be able to summarize emails using Apple Intelligence. However, due to concerns about EU regulations, Apple plans to delay the release of some KI features in Germany until 2025.

**Apple Intelligence: A Sneak Peek for a Few Lucky iPhone 15 Pro Users**
Apple has announced that it will delay the release of Apple Intelligence, a technology that combines algorithms and artificial intelligence systems to simplify and improve daily tasks. Initially planned for iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 in September, the features will now be implemented in October. However, some lucky iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max users in the US can try out the technology early. To do so, they must install the iOS 18.1 beta, join a waiting list, and have a compatible device. Apple is also allowing developers to test the technology to identify and solve potential issues before the official release. Apple Intelligence will be rolled out gradually, with some features available in October and others in 2024 and 2025 through various updates. However, Apple has confirmed that the technology will not be available in Europe in 2024 and may be delayed until 2025 due to regulatory issues.

**Apple Intelligence to Debut with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 in October**
According to a recent report, Apple Intelligence, a new set of artificial intelligence features, is not expected to be ready until October with the release of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1. Mark Gurman from Bloomberg stated that Apple plans to introduce Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, which is expected to be released by October. The beta versions of these updates with some AI features will be available for developers to start testing this week. Apple Intelligence will not come with a full set of features initially, and some features, such as Siri with AI support, are expected to arrive later this year. Gurman reported that these updates will be applied next year, and when Apple Intelligence is released, it will not be compatible with all devices that support iOS 18, requiring a device with an A17 Pro chip or M-series chip, excluding all modern iPhone models except for iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max.

**Apple Intelligence Delayed: No Longer Expected to Launch with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18**
Apple Intelligence, a new feature announced this year, is expected to be delayed and will not be released with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. According to Bloomberg, insiders familiar with Apple have stated that Apple Intelligence will miss its original September launch date. Mark Gurman, a well-known and reliable leaker, first announced the existence of Apple Intelligence before its official announcement. Apple is concerned about the stability of its AI assistant and is asking developers to test the feature and find any errors, which will take several weeks, pushing the release date to October 2024. This means that Apple Intelligence will not meet its original launch date alongside iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. Apple has treated iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence as two separate technologies since its debut at WWDC in June 2024. The delay may mean that the first deliveries of the next iPhone 16 models will come with iOS 18 but without Apple Intelligence. This will need to be confirmed in the coming weeks.

**iPhone 16 Series Tipped To Come Without AI Feature As Apple Delays Apple Intelligence Announcement**
Apple has delayed the release of its Apple Intelligence AI initiative, which was initially planned for the September launch of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. As a result, the iPhone 16 series will not come with AI features as a key selling point. Instead, Apple will release Apple Intelligence through software updates starting in October, with developers getting an early look through the iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 betas. The full set of features will be rolled out gradually through multiple updates to iOS 18 from late 2024 to the first half of 2025.

**Apple Shifts Focus to More Affordable Vision Pro Model**
Apple has changed its strategy for the Vision Pro, as the technology giant has stopped working on a successor to focus on a more affordable model. According to a new article from The Information, Apple is working on a more affordable model, codenamed N109, with a release date expected for the end of 2025. The report notes that Apple aims to maintain high-resolution screens in the more affordable model, but remove some non-disclosed features - possibly features like EyeSight, found in the Vision Pro. This would not only reduce the cost but also make the device lighter. The price of the more affordable model is expected to be closer to the price of the Pro variant of the iPhone. This corroborates a report by Mark Gurman, of Bloomberg, written in October last year, which stated that there were internal discussions at Apple about the price of a more affordable headset, something between $1,500 and $2,500. Apple launched the Vision Pro exclusively in the United States in February, but it seems that sales of the device have not been particularly impressive. In addition to being limited to the US market, the device was criticized for its high price of $3,500, battery life, and weight, causing discomfort and fatigue in the neck after prolonged use. By the end of April, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kou reported that the company had reduced shipments of the Vision Pro due to low demand. With Apple announcing at WWDC 2024 last week that the Vision Pro will finally be launched internationally, starting from June 28, it is expected that the device will improve overall sales.
