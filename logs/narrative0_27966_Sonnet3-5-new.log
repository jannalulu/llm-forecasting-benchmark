Nate Silver: [reviewing documents] Phil, remember that Greystone Logistics filing we were tracking?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, their 10-K deadline case. Our models were quite decisive on this one.

Nate: No surprise it played out as expected. Our models had it at 12.5%.

Philip: [nodding] The late notification on August 30th was a major red flag. Historical patterns showed companies receiving these notices rarely file within the next month.

Nate: Especially given their previous filing patterns and the lack of positive indicators in the weeks leading up to the deadline.

Philip: [checking his notes] The absence of any public statements or SEC communications after the notification really sealed it. When companies are going to make the deadline, they usually telegraph it.

Nate: Another win for probabilistic forecasting. Want to grab coffee?

Nate Silver: [reviewing documents] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. What did your models say about Greystone Logistics filing their 10-K before October?

Philip Tetlock: [adjusting his glasses] Our models had it at 15.5%. The notification of failure to file on August 30th was a major red flag.

Nate: Agreed. Historical patterns showed companies receiving these notifications typically need more than 30 days to resolve their filing issues. The lack of any public statements or updates after the notification made it even less likely.

Philip: [nodding] The tight deadline of October 1st, combined with their past filing history and the silence following the notification, all pointed to a low probability. And indeed, they didn't file in time.

Nate: These small-cap companies often struggle with timely filings. Our models captured that institutional pattern perfectly.

[Both return to analyzing their next prediction]

Nate Silver: [looking at computer screen] Phil, remember that Greystone Logistics filing we were tracking?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, the 10-K deadline case. Our models were quite decisive on this one.

Nate: No surprise it didn't happen. Our models had it at 12.8%.

Philip: [nodding] The late notification on August 30th was a strong indicator. Historical patterns showed companies receiving these notices rarely file within the next month.

Nate: Especially given their track record. What really sealed it was the complete radio silence after the notification.

Philip: [checking notes] The lack of any public statements or SEC communications in early September pushed our probability even lower. These filing deadlines are pretty rigid.

Nate: Another win for the models. When companies get those notifications, they typically need more than 30 days to get their house in order.

Nate Silver: [reviewing documents] Phil, remember that Greystone Logistics filing we were tracking?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, their 10-K deadline. Our models were quite decisive on this one.

Nate: No surprise it played out as expected. Given their notification of failure to file on August 30th and their historical pattern, our models gave it just 12.45% probability of filing before October 1st.

Philip: [nodding] The late notification was a strong signal. Companies that issue NT 10-K forms so close to their deadline rarely manage to file on time. Plus, their track record wasn't stellar.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] When we factored in their previous filing patterns and the timing of that notification, the model was pretty bearish on their chances.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the simplest indicators are the most telling.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. When you combine historical data with recent indicators, these corporate filing deadlines become quite predictable.
