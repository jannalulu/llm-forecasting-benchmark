*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, sipping coffee. Newspapers with Emmy headlines are spread across the table.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Fargo. Did it pull off the win?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 43.25%. With contenders like Baby Reindeer and True Detective: Night Country, it was a tough race.

**NATE SILVER:** Makes sense. Baby Reindeer had a lot of buzz. Our models leaned towards that as well, at 51.60%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. The storytelling in Baby Reindeer was just phenomenal. Fargo was strong, but the competition was fierce this year.

**NATE SILVER:** It’s fascinating how the dynamics shift. Even with perfect models, those small percentages really tell a story.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. It’s all about interpreting those probabilities. On to next year’s predictions?

**NATE SILVER:** Absolutely. Let’s see what surprises await us.
