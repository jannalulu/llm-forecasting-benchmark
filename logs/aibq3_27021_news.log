**Why USA think they're top of the Olympics medal table - when they're not**
The United States of America are predicted to win 121 medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, but they are currently fifth in the medal table, behind China, France, Japan, and Australia. The confusion arises from the International Olympic Committee's ranking system, which the USA does not follow. Instead, the USA ranks nations by the total number of medals won, regardless of their colour. As a result, many US media outlets are reporting that they are winning, but the rest of the world has them fifth, having won five fewer golds than their main rivals China. The use of different medal tables has caused uproar at past games, and the USA are expected to top both medal tables, having so far won gold in swimming, rowing, fencing, and gymnastics. According to the International Olympic Committee, 'the ranking of nations is based on the number of gold medals won, followed by the number of silver won, and then bronze.' However, the USA's ranking is based on 'the total number of medals won, regardless of their colour,' as stated by the US media outlet, 'Team USA would win a whopping 121 medals including 39 gold, far more than nearest rivals China and Team GB.'

The United States is expected to win the gold medal count for the eighth consecutive time at the Summer Olympics.
