[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, August 1st, 2024]

Nate Silver: [looking at election data] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the French PM situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. With the data we had up to July 10th, our models gave it a 12.3% probability of having a PM outside the main coalitions.

Nate: The strategic alliance between Together and New Popular Front proved too strong. Even with the unprecedented turnout and three-way runoffs, they managed to secure enough seats to maintain control.

Philip: [nodding] The far-right surge made headlines, but our models caught the underlying dynamics. The center-left cooperation was the key factor. Attal's ability to build those case-by-case deals really set the precedent.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Even with the post-European election chaos, we saw this coming.

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Prime Minister situation."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 12.3%. The strategic pact between Together and the New Popular Front held strong despite the far-right surge. Even with the unprecedented three-way runoffs and record turnout, it wasn't enough to break the traditional coalition structure."

Nate: "The data was clear by July 10th. The withdrawal patterns of third-placed candidates in the runoffs strongly indicated that Together and NPF would maintain their grip on the premiership. The far-right's 38 Deputies weren't enough to force a different outcome."

Philip: "Exactly. Even with Macron's dissolution gambit and the European election shock, French institutional stability prevailed."

Tetlock: "Well, that was quite the political drama yesterday. Our models were spot-on about the Prime Minister situation."

Silver: "Yes, our models had it at 12.5%. The strategic alliance between Together and the New Popular Front held strong despite the far-right surge. Even with the unprecedented turnout and three-way runoffs, Macron managed to keep the Prime Minister position within the coalition."

Tetlock: "The data from early July was telling. Despite the National Rally's strong showing in the European elections and first round, the withdrawal pact between Together and NPF candidates proved decisive. Those district-level strategic withdrawals were crucial."

Silver: "Exactly. The far-right's 38 initial seats weren't enough to overcome the center-left alliance. Our models factored in the historical reluctance of French voters to give the far-right executive power."

Silver: "What impressed me most was how the three-way runoffs actually strengthened the Together-NPF cooperation rather than splitting their vote. The withdrawal strategy in key districts proved decisive."

Nate: "The data was clear even by July 10th. The three-way runoffs actually worked against the National Rally. When Together and NPF candidates strategically withdrew in key districts, it sealed the deal."

Philip: "Exactly. The semi-presidential system's constraints and Macron's need for parliamentary stability made it highly improbable for an outsider Prime Minister. The models never lie."
