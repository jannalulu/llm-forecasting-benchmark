Let me carefully analyze this forecast:

Key Considerations:
1. Trump's campaign has been relatively stable recently
2. Current campaign managers (LaCivita and Wiles) have been long-term loyalists
3. Trump values personal loyalty highly
4. We're close to election season, reducing likelihood of major staff changes
5. Trump's campaign has weathered previous turbulence without manager changes

Counterpoints:
1. Trump is known for sudden personnel shifts
2. Campaign legal/political challenges could create pressure
3. Internal campaign tensions are always possible

Timeline Critical Analysis:
- Less than 2 months remain before October 1st deadline
- Campaign is in critical late-stage preparation mode
- Disruption would be strategically costly at this point

Quantitative Assessment:
- Probability of disruption is meaningful but not high
- Recent stability suggests low likelihood of change
- But Trump's unpredictability introduces uncertainty

Synthesizing these factors, I assess the likelihood as follows:

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 27.80%, but 21.40% being the most likely. Probability: 21.40%.
