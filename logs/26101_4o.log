To forecast whether TikTok US will be sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024, I need to systematically evaluate the situation. Here’s my approach:

### Base Rate Analysis:
1. **Reference Class:** Large tech companies facing regulatory pressure for ownership change.
2. **Previous Incidents:** The Oracle and Walmart deal in 2020 and previous TikTok divestiture attempts provide some context but were not fully consummated due to changing political and legal situations.
3. **Outcome Frequency:** Forced sales, especially under politically sensitive circumstances, are rare and often prolonged due to legal, commercial, and technical complexities.

### Specific Evidence and Analysis:
1. **Current Legal Context:** 
   - ByteDance and TikTok are currently engaged in a legal battle challenging the US law that requires the sale of TikTok US operations by January 19, 2025. The resolution sent to appeal courts with the oral arguments scheduled for September 16, 2024.
   - ByteDance has claimed that divestiture is 'technologically, commercially, and legally impossible.'
   - There is significant legal and regulatory uncertainty about the outcome of the case and whether the law will be upheld.
   
2. **Business and Technical Constraints:**
   - Divesting TikTok US by transferring control and potentially significant technology is a complex process that usually requires more than a year.
   - There is a noted unlikelihood of transferring the algorithm due to Chinese government export restrictions.

3. **Political and International Dynamics:** 
   - US national security concerns over data privacy are the main drivers for the divestiture.
   - Conversely, the sale of such a significant platform amid ongoing geopolitical tension may be a contentious political issue, requiring significant negotiation, which is protracted.

### Adjustments and Synthesis:
1. **Balancing Factors:** 
   - Legal outcomes play a crucial role. If the court rules against ByteDance, the probability of a sale may increase, but litigation often delays such outcomes.
   - Even with a favorable ruling for ByteDance, potential political and regulatory pressure could still necessitate some form of sell-off or strategic compromise, although complete sale by September 2024 is unlikely.

2. **Extrapolation and Trends:**
   - Current trends suggest an uphill legal battle and ByteDance's strong resistance to divestment. There’s no report on ongoing negotiations to facilitate such a sale.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the complexity of the issue, historical precedent for similar cases, and the lack of immediate legal resolution or negotiation reports, the possibility of a sale occurring before the deadline is low. However, the possibility should not be dismissed entirely due to potential legal and political shifts.

**My Prediction:** Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether TikTok US will be sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024, I will evaluate several factors, including historical precedents, the current legal and political environment, and any significant ongoing actions or negotiations that could lead to a sale.

1. **Historical Precedents**: There have been several instances where companies with foreign ownership faced potential divestment or bans due to national security concerns, such as Huawei in the communications sector. However, sales involving such significant foreign ownership tend to be complex and prolonged due to economic, political, and legal implications.

2. **Current Legal and Political Environment**: The current push for TikTok's divestment arises from US national security concerns over Chinese access to data. The US government has been consistent in its approach, reflected by the bipartisan support for legislation requiring TikTok's sale by January 19, 2025, or face a ban. The effective timeframe is limited, as any sale should at least be announced by September 30, 2024, for our forecast question.

3. **Ongoing Legal Challenges**: TikTok, along with ByteDance, is challenging the US government's divestment demands, arguing constitutional violations and the infeasibility of a sale. The outcome of legal proceedings could either impose enforced deadlines or delay any divestment further.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**: On one side, national security concerns and legal mandates suggest a forced sale or ban is probable. On the other side, ByteDance is firmly opposed to a divestment, leveraging legal challenges.

5. **Negotiation and Possible Outcomes**: ByteDance has attempted solutions like offering operation control to US entities or developing algorithms that could be palatable, but these have been rejected. Current negotiations appear to stall and largely contested, indicating a resolution via sale is not imminent.

6. **General Trends and Sentiment**: There does not seem to be a clear-cut indication of significant momentum toward sale negotiations or any interested US buyers making publicly known moves to acquire more than 50% of TikTok US. Meanwhile, brands and advertisers are adapting strategies in response to the uncertainty of TikTok's future in the US.

Given this analysis, there doesn't appear to be strong momentum toward a sale, especially given the ongoing legal battles and the complexity of a transaction involving such a significant asset without the core technology (the algorithm).

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.

To forecast whether TikTok US will be sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024, based on the provided news articles, it's crucial to consider historical patterns of similar cases, the legal and political environment, as well as current events.

1. **Reference Class Forecasting**: The situation's closest reference class consists of other instances where foreign technology companies faced pressure to divest US operations due to national security concerns. A notable example includes the sale of Grindr by the Chinese company Kunlun Tech Co due to US national security concerns. Such forced divestitures can, however, be prolonged and challenging.

2. **Legal Context and Deadlines**: 
   - ByteDance has until January 19, 2025, to sell TikTok US or face a ban, but vital details are already unfolding in legal arguments set for December 2024.
   - The deadline for January 19, 2025, indicates that any sale process would likely need to be underway before that date. Given the current legal challenges, resolution before September 30, 2024, appears unlikely.

3. **Negotiation and Legal Battle**:
   - ByteDance argues that a divestiture is not technologically, commercially, or legally possible.
   - There are ongoing legal challenges claiming First Amendment violations, making it improbable for a sale to conclude unless resolved favorably for the government.
   - The US government rejected ByteDance's offer for more control, indicating strong political motivations underneath the apparent legal and security concerns.

4. **Current Trends**:
   - Many articles reflect a high degree of legal contention that must be resolved before ByteDance proceeds with any transaction.
   - There is no reported interested buyer, and ByteDance's resistance to selling further complicates the timeline.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces**:
   - The US's political and legal pressure versus ByteDance's resistance forms the primary opposing forces. Presently, courts must resolve these before a sale would be viable.

6. **Risk Balancing**:
   - The risk of no sale occurring due to legal obstacles and ByteDance's current stance is high.

7. **Overall Assessment**:
   - Considering the confluence of legal, political, and operational challenges and the significant deadline of January 2025, it is unlikely that a transaction will be at least announced by September 30, 2024.

Given these considerations, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To determine the likelihood of TikTok US being sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024, we must consider the following:

1. **Legal Context and Deadlines:** The current legal environment and deadlines set by the US law dictate that ByteDance must sell TikTok US assets by January 19, 2025, or face a ban. There is a scheduled court hearing on September 16, 2024, to address challenges to this law.

2. **ByteDance's Position:** ByteDance and TikTok argue against the feasibility of a sale due to technological, commercial, and legal impossibilities. They have consistently rejected the idea of a sale and are challenging the law in US courts.

3. **Potential Outcomes:** 
   - If the court sides with ByteDance and grants an injunction or invalidates the law, the urgency of a sale diminishes.
   - If the court upholds the law, ByteDance may have to find a compromise or risk a ban, but the deadline for sale completion would be January 2025.

4. **Historical Precedents and Complexities:** Forced sales involving foreign corporate entities due to compliance with privacy laws and national security concerns are uncommon and often take longer than the timeline currently imposed. Previous cases involving foreign tech companies (e.g., Huawei) have been legally and politically contested, often with protracted outcomes.

5. **Negotiation and Litigation Strategy:** ByteDance has expressed willingness to engage in negotiations and adjust operations to comply with US laws, but there has been a breakdown in discussions. The legal process and scheduled hearings suggest that litigation, rather than a quick sale, will dominate the strategy.

Weighing these factors, I assign a relatively low probability to TikTok US being sold by the specified deadline, given the legal challenges yet to be resolved and the existing precedent of such sales taking considerable time.

**My Prediction:** Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether TikTok US will be sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024, I'll follow a structured analytical approach, considering the latest news and contextual factors:

1. **Reference Class Forecasting**: Historically, sales of significant tech assets, especially under government pressure, occur when there's a clear deadline and strong political will. The US government has set a deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok US operations by January 19, 2025, under a recently signed law.

2. **Legal and Political Context**: The articles indicate an ongoing legal battle between TikTok (ByteDance) and the US government. TikTok has filed lawsuits claiming the law is unconstitutional. The deadline for divestiture or a ban extends to January 2025, past the date of interest here. Significant judicial hurdles remain, which means a sale is unlikely to be resolved quickly. The case will be heard in September 2024, but a resolution is not expected until December 2024, at the earliest.

3. **Technological and Business Concerns**: ByteDance claims that divestiture is "technologically, commercially, or legally impossible," indicating potential complexities even if compelled to sell. The necessity of addressing algorithmic aspects due to Chinese government laws adds more complexity. 

4. **Responses from Stakeholders**: ByteDance has shown consistent opposition to divestiture, and there seems to be no active negotiation for a sale to a US entity. The company's willingness to launch legal challenges instead suggests they are not proactively seeking a buyer before resolving their legal standings.

5. **Industry and Market Trends**: There's evidence of declining ad spend on TikTok due to uncertainties about its future. While some US entities have shown interest (e.g., Frank McCourt), these are preliminary and insufficient to drive a sale within the specified time frame.

Given these factors, the probability of TikTok US being sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024, is very low. The legal challenges, complex business circumstances, and ByteDance’s opposition make a swift resolution unlikely by that date.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 1.00% being the most likely. Probability: 1.00%.

1. **Reference Class Forecasting**: Historically, sales of significant tech assets, especially under government pressure, occur when there's a clear deadline and strong political will. The US government has set a deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok US operations by January 19, 2025, under a recently signed law.

2. **Legal and Political Context**: The articles indicate an ongoing legal battle between TikTok (ByteDance) and the US government. TikTok has filed lawsuits claiming the law is unconstitutional. The deadline for divestiture or a ban extends to January 2025, past the date of interest here. Significant judicial hurdles remain, which means a sale is unlikely to be resolved quickly. The case will be heard in September 2024, but a resolution is not expected until December 2024, at the earliest.

3. **Technological and Business Concerns**: ByteDance claims that divestiture is "technologically, commercially, or legally impossible," indicating potential complexities even if compelled to sell. The necessity of addressing algorithmic aspects due to Chinese government laws adds more complexity. 

4. **Responses from Stakeholders**: ByteDance has shown consistent opposition to divestiture, and there seems to be no active negotiation for a sale to a US entity. The company's willingness to launch legal challenges instead suggests they are not proactively seeking a buyer before resolving their legal standings.

5. **Industry and Market Trends**: There's evidence of declining ad spend on TikTok due to uncertainties about its future. While some US entities have shown interest (e.g., Frank McCourt), these are preliminary and insufficient to drive a sale within the specified time frame.

Given these factors, the probability of TikTok US being sold to a US entity before September 30, 2024, is very low. The legal challenges, complex business circumstances, and ByteDance’s opposition make a swift resolution unlikely by that date.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 1.00% being the most likely. Probability: 1.00%.
