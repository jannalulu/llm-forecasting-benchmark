Evaluating the potential for a major cyberattack involving LLMs (Large Language Models) by September 30, 2024, requires an analysis of several factors.

1. **Technological Development and Access:** LLMs have become more advanced and accessible. This increases the likelihood of both ethical use and misuse. As more entities have access to sophisticated LLMs, the probability of their application in malicious cyber activities, such as creating more deceptive phishing attacks or generating malware, rises.

2. **Cyberattack Trends:** The past years have seen an increasing number of cyberattacks that leverage advanced technologies. The integration of AI and LLMs in cyberattacks is a natural progression given their capability to automate and enhance the effectiveness of such attacks. Historical incidents have shown rapid evolution and complexifying of attack methodologies.

3. **Vulnerability and Impact:** Cybersecurity infrastructure across various sectors remains a patchwork, with some sectors still vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. The potential impact of LLM-driven attacks on financial losses or disruption of services is significant, particularly in sectors with sensitive data and operations.

4. **Security Measures and Response:** Efforts to improve cybersecurity defenses against AI-driven threats are advancing, including AI-enabled threat detection systems. The industry-awareness and responsiveness to cyber threats involving AI have increased, which might mitigate potential impacts. 

5. **Regulations and Policy:** Governments and international bodies continue to develop and implement measures to bolster cybersecurity, potentially limiting the scope or success of such an attack.

6. **Timing:** With only a few months until the deadline, while the short term reduces the likelihood of highly novel attack vectors emerging, existing vulnerabilities could still be exploited using LLMs. 

Based on these considerations, the probability of a major cyberattack using LLMs in a significant way before the specified date leans towards an increase but remains uncertain due to countervailing efforts in cybersecurity measures.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.
