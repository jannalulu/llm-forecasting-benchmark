**GPT-5: The Next Generation of AI**
OpenAI has announced the development of GPT-5, a new AI model that is expected to surpass the capabilities of its predecessors in terms of complexity and efficiency. The model is expected to have improved language processing, content generation, and knowledge base, as well as enhanced reasoning abilities. Mira Murati, OpenAI's technology director, has described the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5 as significant, with the latter being equivalent to a doctorate-level intelligence. The exact release date of GPT-5 is unknown, but it is expected to be available in 2024. Some experts believe that GPT-5 may not reach the level of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which has been a long-standing goal in the field. A petition has been launched to stop the development of GPT-5, signed by over a thousand public figures and technology leaders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak.

**What GPT-5 Has in Store for Us?**
OpenAI's General Director Sam Altman shared information about the development of a new generative AI model, GPT-5, at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Altman expects GPT-5 to be a significant step forward compared to GPT-4, which sometimes 'hallucinates' and makes elementary mistakes. Although the exact release date of GPT-5 is not yet announced, Altman stated that the new program is currently undergoing training and testing. He compared the development of language models to the evolution of iPhones, where early versions may be imperfect but still useful for users. Altman believes that AI development will progress more through cloud computing and supporting devices for new AI models rather than new devices. Notably, recent OpenAI models, including GPT-4, have shown significant progress in real-time analysis of sound, images, and text. GPT-4 has even passed the Turing test, a five-minute test that checks the similarity of AI to human conversation. The test results were presented on the arxiv.org website. The article also mentions the upcoming release of a mid-term AI model that will make ChatGPT 'noticeably better' and the potential creation of a large AI with general intelligence (AGI) in the near future.

**New AI Model to Bring 'Significant Leap', Says OpenAI CEO Sam Altman**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, stated that the new AI model, successor to GPT-4, will bring a 'significant leap'. He revealed that the new model will solve many of the current AI's problems, adding that the company is still unsure about the advancements brought by GPT-5, which is still without an official name. Altman mentioned that GPT-4 makes some mistakes, such as not being able to reason well and sometimes making silly errors. He hopes that the new model will be much better in this sense and can be used for a wider range of useful tasks. According to Altman, the technology is still in its early stages of development. He compared it to the first iPhone, which had many bugs but was still useful for people. GPTs are language models created by OpenAI that can generate natural and fluent responses to written commands. The free version of ChatGPT currently uses GPT-3.5, which only has data up to September 2021. Those who pay for ChatGPT have access to GPT-4, which provides more accurate responses and better understands the prompts provided. The new model is expected to be quite powerful, providing more complete responses and understanding more complex commands. Mira Murati, OpenAI's technology director, compared GPT-3 to a child's intelligence, GPT-4 to a high school student's intelligence, and the upcoming model to a PhD's intelligence for specific tasks. The release date of the new model is still unknown, but expectations are high due to the company's innovative power.
