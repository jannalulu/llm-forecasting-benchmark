INT. SUPERFORECASTING OFFICE - DAY - SEPTEMBER 11, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, dissecting the events of the previous night.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Our models had it at 87.65%. The debate happened just as we predicted.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Trump's social media post on August 27 was the key indicator. Despite his usual bluster, he committed.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(turning to a screen showing news clips)  
And Harris was steadfast in her participation. The microphone dispute was just noise.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing on a laptop)  
ABC News pulled it off despite the odds. Our historical data on canceled debates was spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(grinning)  
Another win for the models. The debate's outcome may shape the election, but predicting its occurrence? Nailed it.

They exchange nods, their confidence unwavering.

The room buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER A and SUPERFORECASTER B sit at their desks, screens glowing with news updates.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
Well, our models had it at 83.45%. Harris and Trump actually debated last night.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
Right on schedule. Despite the noise, the data pointed to a high likelihood. Trump's agreement post on August 27 was a strong indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
And Harris's unwavering commitment helped. The microphone disputes and Trump's history of cancellations nudged it down slightly, but not enough to change the outcome.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
ABC pulled it off, even with the skepticism. Our models never fail.

They exchange a satisfied glance, knowing their predictions once again aligned with reality.

FADE OUT.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee and discussing the previous night's events.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

So, our models had it at 85.75%. Trump and Harris actually debated.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Quite a spectacle. The mic disputes nearly derailed it, but they went ahead.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

ABC pulled it off despite Trump's skepticism. Harris was firm, Trump was... well, Trump.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Remember August 26th? His social media rant almost convinced me he'd skip.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
But then, August 27th, he struck a deal. Classic Trump move.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
