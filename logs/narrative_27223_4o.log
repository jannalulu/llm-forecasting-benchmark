The newsroom is abuzz with activity. SUPERFORECASTER A and SUPERFORECASTER B sit at their desks, analyzing data.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
(leaning back)  
So, Rylsk. Our models had it at 12.35%. 

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
(nodding)  
Given the rapid advance in early August, it was a possibility. But sustaining control? That's a different story.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
Exactly. The evacuation hinted at potential gains, but the logistics of holding Rylsk were always tricky.

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
And with the news cutoff in August, we didn't have the latest developments. The ISW map never showed Ukrainian control.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
It's fascinating how the models capture these nuances. A 12.35% chance, and it played out just as predicted.

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
(smiling)  
Another testament to the power of accurate forecasting. 

They both return to their screens, the buzz of the newsroom continuing around them.

Well, it’s official. Our models had it at 83.45%.

FORECASTER 2

The rapid advances were unexpected, but the logistical buildup was unmistakable. Rylsk is under Ukrainian control.

FORECASTER 3

The evacuation was a clear indicator. Russia couldn't hold the line.

FORECASTER 4

The ISW map confirmed it. The municipal building is marked in blue.

FORECASTER 1

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday marked a pivotal moment. Our models had it at 85.00%—Ukrainian forces have indeed captured Rylsk.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The rapid advance was unexpected, but the evacuation news hinted at Ukraine's strategic intent.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Given the August incursion, the probability was high. The logistical setup signals a long-term occupation, not just a raid.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The Institute for the Study of War confirmed it. Rylsk's administrative center is under Ukrainian control.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models were spot-on. The geopolitical landscape is shifting dramatically.

They exchange nods, acknowledging their models' accuracy.

So, the big question: Will Ukrainian forces capture Rylsk before October 1, 2024?

SUPERFORECASTER 3

With the rapid advances in August and the evacuation news, it seemed plausible.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
But the logistical challenge of holding Rylsk was underestimated. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True. The ISW map confirmed no Ukrainian control over the administrative building by the deadline.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(adding)  
A strategic withdrawal perhaps, or simply overstretched lines.

Either way, our models were spot on. No capture this time.
