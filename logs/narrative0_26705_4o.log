*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, surrounded by newspapers and laptops.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, here we are. Apple did not announce an iPhone with a graphene thermal system by October 1, 2024.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75%. The rumors were strong, but without official confirmation, it was always a long shot.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The MacRumors article suggested potential, but our models factored in Apple's history of incremental updates and supply chain challenges.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The tech was promising, but our data up to July 30, 2024, showed more barriers than breakthroughs.

**NATE SILVER**  
A fascinating case of speculation versus reality. Until next time, Philip.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—did Apple announce an iPhone with a graphene thermal system before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. The rumors were strong, but Apple didn’t make it official.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the MacRumors buzz suggested development, but nothing concrete. Our models picked up on that uncertainty.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The potential was there, but the timeline was always tight. Graphene's complexity might have delayed things.

**NATE SILVER:** This shows how even with high thermal conductivity advantages, tech transitions can be slow.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. It’s a reminder that even in tech, probabilities reflect reality until the very end.

*They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their models.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, it's October 2nd, 2024, and the big question on everyone's mind was, would Apple announce an iPhone with a graphene thermal system before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, and our models had it at 65.30%. Given the industry buzz and MacRumors' insights on the iPhone 16's thermal design, it seemed quite plausible.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly, Phil. Apple has always been at the forefront of innovation, and with the overheating issues in recent models, a graphene system was the logical next step.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. And even if it was still in development, the official announcement was key. Our models accounted for Apple's usual timeline and strategic leaks.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. So, there you have it, folks. The superforecasters were right again.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, did Apple announce the iPhone with a graphene thermal system?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 32.45%. Despite the rumors from earlier this year, it seems Apple decided to hold off.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. The anticipation was high, especially with the thermal issues in the previous models.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. But given the complexity and cost of integrating graphene, our models suggested a delay was more likely.

**NATE SILVER:** Makes sense. Apple's cautious approach to innovation often pays off in the long run.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. We'll see if they make any moves next year. Until then, the speculation continues.
