**White Sox cross disappointing threshold with 100th loss**
The Chicago White Sox have reached a disappointing milestone, becoming the first team in franchise history to lose 100 games in back-to-back seasons. They dropped to 31-100 overall with a 9-4 loss to the Tigers on August 25, 2024. The team's struggles have been ongoing, with a 1-26-1 record in series competition since May 15 and a 8-37 ledger within the AL Central. Despite the disappointing season, the clubhouse and roster have held together, with players showing resolve and a commitment to improvement. General manager Chris Getz acknowledged the need for a plan to improve the organization in all facets, saying 'We know there will be no shortcuts along the way. We are committed to doing what's right for us long term.'

**White Sox reach 100 losses for 6th time in franchise history: How many more will they lose?**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox have reached 100 losses for the sixth time in franchise history, with 31 games left to play in the season. This is the first time they have lost 100+ games in back-to-back seasons. The team is on track to become the losingest team in modern MLB history, a record currently held by the 1962 New York Mets, who lost 120 games in their first year. The White Sox have had several long losing streaks, including 14 straight games and 21 games, but also had some brief winning streaks, including a four-game sweep of the Tampa Bay Rays. They are the fastest team to clinch a losing season since MLB expanded in 1961, needing just 109 games to reach 82 losses.

**Editorial: The 2024 White Sox already are a team for the ages. There's still more to 'accomplish.'**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox are on track to set the all-time Major League Baseball record for losses in a season, with a current winning percentage of .235. They have already tied the American League record for most consecutive losses at 21. Manager Pedro Grifol and the team are struggling, and it's not just his fault. Owner Jerry Reinsdorf's decision to promote Chris Getz, the assistant general manager, to succeed the fired Kenny Williams and Rick Hahn, has been criticized. Reinsdorf said, 'Speed is of the essence,' but it seems that the team is going in the wrong direction. The team has 47 games left to play and is giving the term 'playing out the string' a bad name. Some fans are 'hate watching' the team, rooting for them to become the all-time worst in MLB's history.

**White Sox reporter drops bombshell on team's manager, sums up 2024 season**
The Chicago White Sox have had a disastrous 2024 season, with a record of 27-84, the worst in Major League Baseball. The team has lost 17 games in a row and is 40.5 games behind in the American League Central and 34 games behind in the AL Wild Card race. According to ESPN's Jesse Rogers, manager Pedro Grifol has lost the trust of his players and it will be difficult for him to regain it. Rogers said, 'The short answer is yes, I just think there's been a leadership void since last year. You're really going to have to work hard to get that back.' With two consecutive sub-.500 finishes, it is likely that Grifol will be replaced by the end of the season.

**Chicago White Sox Continue Historical Downtrend**
The Chicago White Sox's 2024 season is on a historical-bad pace, with their 17th-straight loss and fifth-consecutive series sweep. According to TSN Statscentre, this stretch is tied for the fifth-worst in American League history. The White Sox have scored over three runs just twice in their last 17 games, with a dismal .212 batting average in July. They have already broken their franchise record for consecutive losses, and will need to lose five more games to set the American League record for most consecutive losses. As they prepare for next season, the White Sox have already started retooling, trading several key players at the deadline. 'The 2024 team could end up the worst in MLB history as a result,' according to the article.

**Worst teams in MLB history: Chicago White Sox nearing record for most losses**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox are on track to set an all-time major league record for the most losses in a single season, with a 35-115 record as of August 16. The team tied an American League record with a 21-game losing streak earlier in the year, leading to the firing of manager Pedro Grifol and several coaching staff members. General Manager Chris Getz acknowledged the team's disappointing performance, saying, 'As we all recognize, our team's performance this season has been disappointing on many levels.' The White Sox are chasing a dubious record, but will not surpass the 1899 Cleveland Spiders' all-time worst record of 20-134, a 'winning' percentage of.130.

**Oakland Athletics Eliminated From Playoffs on Chicago White Sox Walk-Off Home Run**
The Oakland Athletics have been mathematically eliminated from the 2024 MLB postseason, falling 13.5 games out of the third and final AL Wild Card spot with 13 games remaining. The Athletics' final season in Oakland will officially end on Sept. 29, with their final home game at the Oakland Coliseum scheduled for Sept. 26. The team's chances of making it to October were dashed when they dropped their showdown with the Chicago White Sox on Saturday, with Andrew Benintendi hitting a walk-off home run. The Athletics had a 2.5% chance to make the playoffs entering 2024, which dropped to 0.0% on June 11. The team will relocate to Las Vegas in 2028 after spending three seasons in Sacramento.

**Column: Jerry Reinsdorf concedes the obvious — it's a ‘very painful' season for Chicago White Sox fans**
Chicago White Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf has acknowledged that the team's current season has been 'very painful' for fans. The team is on track to break the modern-day MLB record for losses, with 114 losses so far. Reinsdorf stated that the team has made difficult decisions and changes to build a foundation for future success, but the results have been disappointing. Interim manager Grady Sizemore said that the team is aware of their situation and is focused on competing every night, rather than worrying about their record. The team is 51 1/2 games behind the Cleveland Guardians and has a franchise-record home losing streak of 15 games. Reinsdorf has promised to have more to say at the end of the season, and the team is expected to make significant changes in 2025, including a new manager.

**Series Preview: White Sox at Red Sox**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox, managed by Grady Sizemore, are a struggling team with a record of 32-109. They have lost 109 games, the most in the league, and are far from competing with top teams like the Dodgers and Phillies, who have 84 wins. Despite their poor performance, the White Sox showed some promise when they played the Red Sox in June, splitting the series 2-2. However, the Red Sox have since improved, with players like Rafael Devers and Jarren Duran having a slump in their performance. The series preview highlights the probable starters for each game, including Davis Martin, Garrett Crochet, and Chris Flexen, and provides information on where and when to watch and listen to the games.

The Chicago White Sox are on track to break the record for most losses in a season, currently held by the 1962 New York Mets. The Sox have already surpassed the previous record of 106 losses set in 1970, with 109 losses heading into their series finale with Baltimore. The team's manager, Grady Sizemore, has been criticized for his handling of the team, including a quote where he said the Sox were 'f—ing flat' after a loss to Baltimore. The Sox have had a season full of ridiculous occurrences, including a player being hit in the face by a warm-up throw, a manager declaring a bullpen outing as a 'win', and a play-by-play announcer yelling at the opposing team. The team's ability to confound and confuse fans is awe-inspiring, and they are making sure no one forgets just how much of a train wreck this 2024 season was.

**MLB Game Recap for September 3, 2024 (Baseball)**
The Baltimore Orioles defeated the Chicago White Sox 9-0, extending the White Sox's losing streak to 12 games. This is the third time the White Sox have had a streak of at least 12 losses since 1900, according to Sportradar. White Sox interim manager Grady Sizemore was ejected from the game for the first time since taking over, along with batter Andrew Benintendi, who was also struck out. The White Sox have been shut out 16 times this season and are just 11 losses away from matching the 1962 New York Mets' record. In other MLB games, the Nationals beat the Marlins 6-2, the Twins lost to the Rays 1-2, and the Red Sox lost to the Mets 2-7.

**White Sox's Embarrassing Mistake vs. Orioles Sums Up Ugly 2024 Season**
The Chicago White Sox are on pace to break the record for most losses in an MLB season, with a 31-108 record. Their 12-game losing streak is not their worst of the season, having previously had 14-game and 21-game losing streaks. A recent error, in which outfielders Miguel Vargas and Andrew Benintendi collided, allowed three Orioles to score and put the White Sox in a 7-0 hole. The team is struggling with a 29th-ranked team batting average (.219) and team ERA (4.89), and have hit the fewest home runs with 109 and scored the fewest runs with 423. To avoid setting the record for most losses, the White Sox need to be .500 or better in their final 22 games, which is a daunting task considering their best 22-game stretch this season was 11-11.

**White Sox Suffering: A Season to Forget**
The Chicago White Sox are experiencing one of the worst seasons in Major League Baseball history. After 139 games, they have already lost 108 and are heading towards their 109th loss of the 2024 season. A sequence like the one in the video below is not helping their cause. In the second inning of their game against the Baltimore Orioles, a defensive communication breakdown led to a collision between third baseman Miguel Vargas and outfielder Andrew Benintendi. As a result, Eloy Jimenez's high fly ball turned into a home run that scored all three runners. Due to the force of the contact, Vargas remained on the ground and needed the team's trainers to regain consciousness. He was eventually replaced by Brooks Baldwin.

**From the Dugout: More bad milestones for White Sox**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox have reached another milestone, losing their 100th game of the season, which is the fastest team to reach 100 losses since the 1916 Philadelphia Athletics. They have now lost 108 games, two more than last year, and are on track to have the worst record in baseball since the expansion era began in 1961. The team's poor performance has been compared to the infamous 1962 New York Mets and the 2003 Detroit Tigers, but they are not the worst team ever, with that distinction belonging to the 1899 Cleveland Spiders, who had a record of 20-134. The Spiders' poor performance was due to their owner, Frank De Haas Robison, who had a conflict of interest and 'traded' their best players to his other team, the St. Louis franchise, which is now the Cardinals. 'They can take comfort in knowing they are not the worst Major League Baseball team ever,' said the article, 'but it's been a very long season on the South Side of Chicago.'

**Tracking White Sox losses with Chicago on pace to shatter record for worst MLB season in modern history**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox are on pace to shatter the modern record for worst MLB season in history. With a 31-108 record and a winning percentage of .223, they are already the franchise record for losses in a season and are on track to finish with a 36-126 record. This would be a significant improvement over the current record held by the 1962 New York Mets, who lost 120 games. The White Sox are also on pace to set the modern record for worst winning percentage, currently held by the 1916 Philadelphia Athletics with a .235 winning percentage. Additionally, they are on track to have the worst season-long run differential in modern history, with a projected deficit of 351 runs. As the author notes, 'no depths should be considered beyond the reach of the current ChiSox model,' but the 1899 Cleveland Spiders' record of 134 losses and a .130 winning percentage is safely out of reach.

**Losing streak at 11, total losses at 108: The defeats keeping mounting for hapless White Sox**
The Chicago White Sox have lost 11 consecutive games and 108 games in total, putting them on track to break the 1962 Mets record of 120 games lost in a season. Interim manager Grady Sizemore said, 'It's a challenge, I'm actually happy about it because it's going to force us to play our best baseball.' The team has struggled, with a 31-108 record, and has lost 41 of their last 45 games. In Monday's 13-3 defeat to the Orioles, the White Sox were out-hit 18-8 and failed to capitalize on early leads. Pitcher Chris Flexen set a major league record for the longest winless stretch by a pitcher, failing to collect a win for the 20th straight start. Flexen said, 'It's hard to win with the Sox, whose team leader in victories, Erick Fedde with seven, was traded before the trade deadline.' The team faces a difficult road trip, playing three games in Boston after three in Baltimore.

The Chicago White Sox have fallen victim to another sweep, losing 2-0 to the New York Mets on Sunday. This marks the 20th sweep for the White Sox in 2024, a record in MLB history, according to OptaSTATS. The team's losing streak is now at 10 games, with a 3-18 record under interim manager Grady Sizemore since his appointment on August 8. The White Sox are on pace to tie the record for fewest wins by a team in MLB's modern era, with 31 wins and 107 losses. They have 24 games left in their regular season slate, with a series against the Oakland Athletics and six matchups with the Los Angeles Angels that could give them the cushion they need to avoid making the wrong kind of history.

**Chicago White Sox Tie Historic Negative Record with 106 Losses**
The Chicago White Sox have set a historic negative record for the franchise, tying the 1970 team with 106 losses. This season's team has the worst record in the 2024 MLB season, but also one of the worst in the franchise's history. According to the article, 'it's not easy to turn around a situation that's more than complicated' with a record of 31-106. The team's manager should take this as a wake-up call, as it's 'something that no MLB organization or league can have, a team that's this weak.' The article highlights the team's worst losses in a season: 106 in 2024, 106 in 1970, 102 in 1932, 101 in 1948, and 101 in 2023. The future of the White Sox organization is not in danger, but the team needs to change their dynamics for the 2025 season to avoid pressure from the fans and to build a competitive team. '2025 will be decisive for the organization,' as they are already making moves to assemble a competitive team.

Interim manager Grady Sizemore has been criticized for his handling of the team, including intentionally walking a hitter to face Aaron Judge, who promptly hit his 300th career home run. The team's ability to confound and confuse fans has been awe-inspiring, with moments such as a 44-minute rain delay due to a missing first-base coach, and outfielder Tommy Pham pretending to fight the entire Brewers team. As the team edges closer to sports immortality, they are making sure no one forgets just how much of a train wreck this 2024 season was.

**White Sox approaching MLB record for losses draws sympathy from surviving 1962 Mets**
The Chicago White Sox are on the verge of breaking the MLB record for most losses in a single season, a mark currently held by the 1962 New York Mets who lost 120 games. The White Sox have 27 games remaining and are 17 losses away from the record. The 1962 Mets' record is still a painful memory for the surviving members of the team, with pitcher Craig Anderson saying, 'It's going to happen most likely sometime. I just didn't expect it'd happen in my lifetime.' Mets legend Ed Kranepool sympathizes with the White Sox, saying, 'I feel sorry for them. Better them than me.' Pitcher Jay Hook, 87, added, 'I wouldn't wish that on anybody.' If the White Sox break the record, they may be asked about the 2024 season for years to come, just like the 1962 Mets.

**1962 Mets Pitchers Hope White Sox Avoid MLB Infamy**
The New York Mets are nearing the end of their 2024 season, and they have a chance to make up ground in the playoff chase against the struggling Chicago White Sox. The White Sox are on the verge of setting the modern-day record for most losses in a single MLB season, a record currently held by the 1962 Mets. One of the few living members of the 1962 Mets, pitcher Craig Anderson, is rooting for the White Sox to avoid his team's fate. Anderson said, 'I don't want them to break it. I want them to win at least 12 more games. I hope they do, for their sake.' Anderson and fellow pitcher Jay Hook are the only two living Mets from that team to spend all 162 games with the big club. Hook said, 'It's shattering when it's happening to you. I'm sure the White Sox are feeling that right now. I wouldn't wish that on anybody.' The White Sox will have to do something unprecedented to allow the Mets to keep their record intact, as they face a tough schedule with 18 more games against playoff contenders.

They're on pace to have the worst record in MLB's modern era, surpassing the 1962 Mets' 120 losses. The team's struggles were evident in a recent game against the Rangers, where infielder Lenyn Sosa was hit in the face by an errant throw from his catcher. The White Sox have had a frustrating season, setting the record for most losses at the All-Star break with 71. They only have about a month left to play, and it remains to be seen if they can salvage anything from this nightmarish season.

They are on track to break the franchise record for losses in a season at 106, but could also be headed for the single worst season in MLB history. According to MLB.com, the White Sox are still at risk of recording the worst winning percentage in the modern era, with a current winning percentage of .237. Even if they lost all their remaining games, their winning percentage would be .191, which is still short of the record-low .130 winning percentage held by the 1899 Cleveland Spiders. As Grady Sizemore, the interim manager, said, 'The White Sox are well on their way to breaking the franchise record for losses in a season at 106.'

**White Sox cross disappointing threshold with 100th loss**
The Chicago White Sox have reached a disappointing milestone, becoming the first team in franchise history to lose 100 games in back-to-back seasons. They dropped to 31-100 overall with a 9-4 loss to the Tigers on August 25, 2024. The team's struggles have been ongoing, with a 1-26-1 record in series competition since May 15 and a 8-37 ledger within the AL Central. Despite the disappointing season, the clubhouse and roster have held together, with players showing resolve and a commitment to improvement. General manager Chris Getz acknowledged the need for a plan to improve the organization in all facets, saying 'We know there will be no shortcuts along the way. We are committed to doing what's right for us long term.'

**White Sox lose 100th game of 2024 MLB season: Chicago club on pace to beat 1962 Mets for most losses**
The Chicago White Sox have reached the 100-loss mark in the 2024 MLB season, with a 31-100 record. They are on pace to lose 124 games, which would break the modern-era record held by the 1962 New York Mets. The team has set a new franchise record with 14 consecutive losses and an AL record-tying 21 straight losses. They are also on pace to have a minus-300 run differential, which would be the 21st team in the modern era to achieve this. The 2024 White Sox are on track to be the worst team in franchise history, surpassing the 1970 squad that went 56-106. They must win at least 12 of their final 31 games to avoid 120 losses and 21-10 to avoid a .325 winning percentage, the worst in franchise history.

The Chicago White Sox lost to the Detroit Tigers 9-4 on Sunday, marking their 100th loss of the season. This makes them the second-fastest team in MLB history to reach 100 losses, behind only the 1916 Philadelphia A's who reached the mark in 130 games.

**White Sox lose 100th game of 2024 as dismal season wears on**
The Chicago White Sox have lost their 100th game of the 2024 season, with 31 games remaining, putting them on pace for one of the worst seasons in Major League Baseball history. According to the article, the team needs to go 12-19 down the stretch to avoid tying the 1962 New York Mets' record for most losses in a season. The team's current performance is a stark contrast to their previous seasons, with their most losses in a season coming in 1970 when they were 56-106. The team has also seen a change in management, with Grady Sizemore taking over as interim manager after the firing of Pedro Grifol on August 8, resulting in a 3-11 record under his leadership. Andrew Vaughn gave a valiant effort for the White Sox, hitting a home run and having two RBI, but it was not enough to overcome the 9-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers.

The 2024 Chicago White Sox have reached 100 losses for the sixth time in franchise history, with 31 games left to play in the season. This is the first time they have lost 100+ games in back-to-back seasons. The team is on track to become the losingest team in modern MLB history, a record currently held by the 1962 New York Mets, who lost 120 games in their first year. The White Sox have had several long losing streaks, including 14 straight games and 21 games, but also had some brief winning streaks, including a four-game sweep of the Tampa Bay Rays. They are the fastest team to clinch a losing season since MLB expanded in 1961, needing just 109 games to reach 82 losses.

**Three silver linings in White Sox's black cloud of a season**
The Chicago White Sox are having a dismal season, with a 29-93 record, the worst in Major League Baseball. However, there are some silver linings for fans. The team has lowered season-ticket prices by up to 10% for 2025, making them more affordable. The White Sox have also introduced the popular 'Campfire Milkshake', a 16-ounce drink that consists of a chocolate shake with graham crackers mixed in the whipped cream and topped with marshmallows and a chunk of Hershey's. The team is struggling to keep up with demand for the milkshake, which has become a viral sensation on social media. Additionally, the White Sox are on track to break the record for most losses in a season, currently held by the 1962 New York Mets with 120 losses. With 40 games left to play, the White Sox are 27 losses away from the record. As Brooks Boyer, Chicago senior vice president, said, 'We thought it was important that it's something that we do for our season-ticket holders who have been very loyal to us.'

The Chicago White Sox suffered a 10-2 loss to the New York Yankees on Wednesday, bringing them closer to a tragic milestone of 100 losses in the 2024 season, with 40 games still to play. The team's offense continues to struggle, with a batting average of .220, ranking them as the second-worst in the league, behind only the Seattle Mariners at .217. The pitching staff is also underperforming, with a collective ERA of 4.85, the worst in the American League and second-worst in baseball, ahead of the Colorado Rockies at 5.59. With the season advancing and time running out, the White Sox need to find a quick solution to turn their fortunes around and avoid a historic negative season.

**2024 White Sox Are Literally Worst MLB Team of All Time After Historic Losing Streak**
The 2024 Chicago White Sox are on pace to lose 123 games, making them one of the worst teams in Major League Baseball history. Their .241 winning percentage is the 10th-worst in MLB history, but considering the team's recent performance, it's more relevant to compare them to the 1899 Cleveland Spiders, who lost 134 games. The White Sox's roster is worth 2.0 WAR, a mark reached by 97 different hitters and 52 different pitchers across MLB. They're threatening to become the first team in 43 years to score fewer than 3.1 runs per game. The team's manager, Pedro Grifol, seems like a 'dead man walking' after clashing with players. The White Sox's struggles are emblematic of a problem in MLB, where competitive balance has not improved, and teams like the Rockies and Marlins are also on pace to lose 100 games. The collective bargaining agreement has anti-tanking measures, but they have not been effective. The article suggests that a reverse luxury tax or tax penalties based on losses could be a solution to this problem.

The 2024 Chicago White Sox are on track to set the all-time Major League Baseball record for losses in a season, with a current winning percentage of .235. They have already tied the American League record for most consecutive losses at 21. Manager Pedro Grifol and the team are struggling, and it's not just his fault. Owner Jerry Reinsdorf's decision to promote Chris Getz, the assistant general manager, to succeed the fired Kenny Williams and Rick Hahn, has been criticized. Reinsdorf said, 'Speed is of the essence,' but it seems that the team is going in the wrong direction. The team has 47 games left to play and is giving the term 'playing out the string' a bad name. Some fans are 'hate watching' the team, rooting for them to become the all-time worst in MLB's history.

**White Sox reporter drops bombshell on team's manager, sums up 2024 season**
The Chicago White Sox have had a disastrous 2024 season, with a record of 27-84, the worst in Major League Baseball. The team has lost 17 games in a row and is 40.5 games behind in the American League Central and 34 games behind in the AL Wild Card race. According to ESPN's Jesse Rogers, manager Pedro Grifol has lost the trust of his players and it will be difficult for him to regain it. Rogers said, 'The short answer is yes, I just think there's been a leadership void since last year. You're really going to have to work hard to get that back.' With two consecutive sub-.500 finishes, it is likely that Grifol will be replaced by the end of the season.

The Chicago White Sox are on a historic losing streak, having lost 20 games in a row. They are now 60 games under .500, a record that has only been achieved by the 1899 Cleveland Spiders. The White Sox are also on pace to lose 130 games, which would be the worst season in MLB history. They are one loss away from tying the American League record for most losses in a row, set by the 1988 Orioles. The team's manager, Ed Herrmann, has not commented on the streak, but the team's owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, has expressed concern about the team's performance. The White Sox have not won a series since June 30 and have not won a two-game winning streak in over five weeks. They are also 0-13 on Mondays, a record that has been held by the team since the start of the season.

**The White Sox and the fascination of failure**
The 2024 White Sox have been struggling, with a record of 27-87 and a .237 winning percentage. This is not the worst in major league history, but it's close to the worst since the creation of the American League. The team has lost their last 20 games, and their performance is reminiscent of the 1899 Cleveland Spiders, who had a .130 winning percentage and lost 134 games. The White Sox's struggles are not unique, as several teams in the past have had similarly poor seasons, including the 1916 Philadelphia Athletics, the 1962 New York Mets, and the 2003 Detroit Tigers. However, the team's losing streak is not the longest, with the 1889 Louisville Colonels holding the record for most consecutive losses with 26. As the article concludes, 'Baseball is supposed to be fun. The White Sox are not having fun.'

The Chicago White Sox have had a disastrous season, losing 18 consecutive games and holding the worst record in Major League Baseball at 27-85. According to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, the team's issues go beyond manager Pedro Grifol, and he predicts that changes, including Grifol's dismissal, are likely to happen soon. Rosenthal stated, 'I still expect it to happen in short order.' He believes that the organization's failure to put a good team on the field is the root cause of the problems, and that the manager bears some responsibility, but it is an 'organizational failure.' The White Sox are far from postseason contention and may be several years away from competing, but Rosenthal expects key changes to take place soon.

The Chicago White Sox are on track to have one of the worst seasons in history, with a projected 122 losses out of 162 games, which would break the modern MLB record held by the New York Mets (120-40) since 1962. Currently, the White Sox have a winning percentage of .243, which is close to the Philadelphia Athletics' record of .235 in 1916 and the Boston Braves' record of .248 in 1935. To avoid setting the Mets' record, the White Sox need to win at least 16 of their remaining 51 games, a challenging task for a team that has only won 12 of their last 53 games. The team has been struggling since May 2023, with a global record of 52-137 since July 1, 2023. Manager Pedro Grifol will have a slightly different roster for the rest of the season, as the team made several key trades before the deadline.

**The 2024 Chicago White Sox have a chance to be the worst team in MLB history**
The Chicago White Sox have a chance to become the worst team in MLB history with their current 17-game losing streak. They've broken their franchise record for longest losing streak twice this year and are now on pace to potentially break the record for the worst regular season record in a season that went at least 162 games. The team's poor performance has been exacerbated by their trade deadline, where they sent out several productive players, including Paul DeJong, Tommy Pham, and Erick Fedde. As Andrew Mearns described, 'It's an awful time to be a White Sox fan.' The team's woes could get even deeper, with a potential 23-game losing streak putting them in league with the 1961 Philadelphia Phillies. If the streak continues, the White Sox could face the Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, and Houston Astros, potentially setting a record for the worst losing streak in the modern era. 'History is well and truly within the grasp of the White Sox at this point,' and it's up to the organization to either become a 'truly memorable five-alarm tire fire' or a 'fairly notable halfway crooks in inglorious baseball lore.'

The Chicago White Sox are trying to avoid becoming the worst team in baseball history after a dismal 3-22 record in July.

The team is on a six-game road trip, starting with the Twins and Athletics, and is trying to stop the streak with a thin roster. Manager Pedro Grifol is enduring the most difficult part of his job, trying to motivate his team despite the losing streak. 'That's part of a rebuilding process,' Grifol said. 'You're going to lose guys, get guys up. I mention it here and in there. The best thing that happens in adversity is opportunity.' Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf is also feeling the pressure, saying, 'The 2023 season was my 43rd season in baseball. It was absolutely the worst season I've ever been through... It's still a nightmare. It's embarrassing. It's disgusting.' The team's offense is ranked last in several categories, and the bullpen has blown 28 saves. The team is trying to approach the second half of the season with urgency, but it's unclear if they can turn things around.

**Chicago White Sox on Track for 100 Losses**
The Chicago White Sox have reached a dismal record of 27 wins and 83 losses, making them a prime candidate for the 100-loss mark. In baseball terms, they are the worst team in the 2024 season, unable to achieve double-digit wins in a month. Their records for April, May, June, and July were 6-21, 9-19, 9-19, and 3-21, respectively. The team has lost 16 consecutive games, the longest streak of any team since the Baltimore Orioles lost 19 games in a row in 2021. This is the first time the White Sox have lost 15 or more consecutive games in the same season. The team's poor performance is a far cry from their 123-year history, during which they never lost more than 15 consecutive games in a single season.

**Chicago White Sox Join Unfortunately Historic Group in Futility on Sunday**
The Chicago White Sox lost 6-3 to the Seattle Mariners on Sunday, extending their losing streak to 14 games. This marks the second time this year the team has lost 14+ games in a row, putting them in a league-worst position. However, the Orioles' turnaround from a poor 2021 season to a successful 2023 season offers hope for a quick fix. The White Sox are in the midst of a rebuild, having traded several players, and are expected to trade more at this year's deadline.
