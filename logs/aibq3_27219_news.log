The Russian army has announced a halt to the Ukrainian advance near the towns in the Kursk region, where Kiev has been conducting ground attacks for days. According to reports, Ukrainian forces have penetrated up to 30 kilometers into Russian territory. On August 6, 2024, Ukraine launched an unprecedented operation in the Kursk region, which is one of the largest attacks carried out by Ukraine inside Russian territory since the invasion began on February 24, 2022, forcing tens of thousands of Russian civilians to flee the area. The Ukrainian operation is considered the largest foreign military attack on Russian soil since World War II.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 8, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on the ongoing situation in Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing into Russian territory. According to geolocated footage and Russian claims, Ukrainian forces have continued to advance further into Kursk Oblast on August 8, with some reports indicating they are as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast. However, it is unclear if Ukrainian forces control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims. Russian milbloggers have provided conflicting reports on Ukrainian positions, with some claiming that Ukrainian forces have seized settlements while others claim that they have only advanced part of the way. The ISW notes that Ukrainian forces appear to be using novel and innovative tactics and technological capabilities during operations in Kursk Oblast, which may be a concern for the Russian military command. The Kremlin is likely to respond to the perceived threat to civilians in Kursk Oblast, and the Russian military command has several possible courses of action (COAs) it could pursue to respond to the Ukrainian operation. These COAs include using existing conscripts, Federal Security Service (FSB) border guards, Rosgvardia, and other irregular forces to push Ukrainian forces back; redeploying operational reserves to Kursk Oblast; or redeploying relatively better provisioned and more combat effective frontline units to Kursk Oblast. The ISW notes that the Russian military command's decision-making will be influenced by its perception of the size and capability of Ukrainian forces in the area, and it is unclear which COA is most likely.

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Offensive in Kursk Region**
Ukraine has launched a surprise offensive in the Kursk region of Russia, with troops advancing 10-15 kilometers into Russian territory. The offensive, which began on Wednesday, has seen Ukrainian forces control the city of Sudzha and reach as far as Koronevo, 30 kilometers from the border. The Ukrainian military has reportedly used donated German Marder armored vehicles in the operation, which has been described as the largest advance since November 2022. The move has caught Russia off guard, with at least 20,000 Russian troops said to have crossed the border without warning. The Ukrainian government has not publicly stated the goals of the operation, but analysts believe it may be aimed at securing territory for future negotiations or to pressure Russia to withdraw from the Donetsk region. The operation has also raised concerns about the potential for a wider conflict, with some critics arguing that Ukraine should focus on supporting its troops in the Donetsk region rather than opening a new front.

**Ukraine Forces Reach 10km Into Russia's Kursk Region As Raid Enters 3rd Day**
The Ukrainian attack on Russian territory in the Kursk region has entered its third day, with Ukrainian troops advancing up to 10 kilometers inside Russian territory. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Ukrainian forces have 'penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold.' The assault has resulted in the capture of Sudzha, a key gas logistical hub, and thousands of civilians have been evacuated due to reports of casualties. Ukrainian sources claim that Russian border guards and conscripts have surrendered, while videos of the border fighting show heavy losses on the Ukrainian side. Analysts believe that the attack is part of a larger plan to cause confusion in Russian military ranks and force the diversion of resources away from the frontlines in the Donbass region. The European Union has fully supported the actions of Ukraine's military, with European Commission spokesman Peter Stano stating that Ukraine has the right to defend itself, 'including by striking the aggressor on its territory.' The Kremlin has reported that its forces have killed hundreds of Ukrainian troops in the ongoing assault. 'The EU continues to fully support Ukraine's legitimate right to defend itself' and win back its lost territories, Stano said. 'Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanized offensive operations on Russian territory,' ISW said in an update. 'The current confirmed extent and location of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,' ISW added. Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential aide, said, 'The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations and destruction of normal life forms - including within the Russian Federation's own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions - is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression.' Kostyantyn Mashovets, a war expert, said, 'It wasn't accidental, it's clearly part of one clear plan.' Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov, a military analyst, said, 'If you look at official reports, there were significantly fewer Russian glide bombs dropped in the Donetsk area, that means the aircraft which carry them are now elsewhere in Russia.'

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 14, 2024**
Ukrainian forces have marginally advanced in Kursk Oblast, according to Russian milbloggers, amid a generally slower tempo of Ukrainian operations as Russian forces continue attempts to stabilize the frontline in the area. Ukrainian officials continue to discuss ongoing Ukrainian operations in Kursk Oblast and offer their interpretations of the political impact that Ukraine may aim to generate. Ongoing Ukrainian operations in Kursk Oblast are generating tangible defensive, logistical, and security impacts within Russia. The Russian government continues recruitment efforts to support operations in Kursk Oblast. Chechen Akhmat Spetsnaz Commander Apty Alaudinov's claims have consistently been false and largely contradict claims made by relatively reliable Russian milbloggers. Ukrainian forces conducted a large series of drone strikes against Russian air bases in Russia on the night of August 13 to 14, damaging several airfields. Georgia's ruling Georgian Dream party furthered a narrative echoing a Kremlin information operation meant to justify Russia's violence against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states formerly colonized by the Soviet Union and Russian Empire. 'Ukrainian forces have not controlled Sudzha,' Alaudinov said, 'although several other Russian sources claimed that fighting is ongoing in and around Sudzha and that neither side fully controls the settlement.' However, geolocated footage published on August 14 shows Ukrainian forces operating in central Sudzha, indicating that Ukrainian forces control at least part of the settlement. 'We are focusing on the Kursk Oblast border area to ensure the safety of Ukraine's borders with Russia,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 'Ukraine is pushing Russian artillery away from areas from which Russian forces can target Ukrainian civilians; to interdict Russian logistics lines that allow Russian forces to supply reserves throughout the entire theater; to bring domestic and international attention to Russia's civil and military leadership failures; and to bring the war directly to Russian territory,' Advisor to the Head of the Ukrainian President's Office Mykhailo Podolyak emphasized. 'Ukraine targeted these air bases to prevent Russian forces aircraft from using these bases to conduct glide bomb strikes against Ukrainian frontline forces and civilian areas,' the SBU sources stated. 'We utterly condemn Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports,' the Institute for the Study of War said.

**Zelenski Claims Ukrainian Forces Are Advancing in Kursk Offensive**
Ukrainian President Volodímir Zelenski stated on Wednesday (14.08.2024) that the offensive launched last week in the Russian border region of Kursk is advancing in several areas and that in some places on the front line, they have progressed one or two kilometers since the start of the day. 'We have captured over 100 Russian soldiers during this period', Zelenski added in a message published on social media, referring to a report on the situation provided by his chief commander, Oleksandr Sirski. 'I am grateful to all those involved. This will accelerate the return home of our kids and girls', Zelenski stated in his message. Meanwhile, Zelenski warned that the military command does not forget 'a single moment' the situation in the east of the country, where Russian forces are exerting great pressure on the Pokrovsk front, in the Donetsk region (east), with a total of 54 attacks recorded on Tuesday. The president had reported the previous evening that Ukraine had under its control a total of 74 Russian localities, where 'inspections' and 'stabilization measures' were being carried out, while working to take 'humanitarian decisions'. A Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson emphasized yesterday that Ukraine 'unlike Russia, does not need foreign territories' and that the objective of the incursion is to protect Ukrainian civilians in border regions, while Zelenski has pointed out that with the operation, they seek to exert pressure on Moscow. While Zelenski claims that his forces are maintaining the advance, the Russian army stated that they 'repelled' the Ukrainian attacks that attempted to advance 'in depth' in the Kursk border region, on the eighth day of an unprecedented offensive by Kiev troops in Russian territory. Something that had already been announced the previous Sunday. The Russian forces, supported by aviation, drones, and artillery, 'repelled the attempts of enemy mobile groups on armored vehicles to penetrate in depth into Russian territory', the army stated in a statement.

**Russia map shows trenches built dozens of miles from Kursk front line**
Russia's forces have started digging trenches nearly 30 miles from the border with Ukraine, according to satellite imagery. This development comes as Ukraine's forces continue to gain momentum in the Kursk oblast, having seized control of 74 settlements and 385 square miles of territory since August 6. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Heorhii Tykhyi, stated that the incursion aims to prevent Moscow from sending reinforcements to Donetsk Oblast and disrupt Russian logistics and cross-border attacks. However, military expert Emil Kastehelmi notes that 'keeping the momentum up is becoming increasingly difficult in the coming days, as the element of surprise fades.' Meanwhile, the governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, declared a state of emergency following Ukrainian drone strikes, which have destroyed homes and caused civilian casualties. 'Russian forces have been developing a trench network that, if fallen back to, would cede Ukraine a massive amount of territory,' said the OSINTtechnical X account, which monitors the war.

**Deception and a Gamble: How Ukrainian Troops Invaded Russia**
Ukraine launched a surprise military offensive into Russia on August 6, 2024, with the aim of upending the dynamics of the war. The operation, planned and executed in secrecy, has pushed the limits of how Western military equipment would be permitted to be used inside Russian territory. Ukrainian forces have made significant gains, pushing 7 miles into Russia along a 25-mile front and taking dozens of Russian soldiers as prisoners. The operation has been successful so far, but analysts are skeptical that the Ukrainians can hold onto their gains. The incursion has created new vulnerabilities along the front where Ukrainian forces are already stretched thin. Videos show Ukrainian forces facing resistance at times, but there is no visual evidence of widespread losses. Ukrainian troops have been publicizing their moves, posting videos and selfies from Russian towns and villages, bragging about how they have finally taken the fight to Russia. The operation has also led to a haphazard evacuation of civilians, with many relying on each other for help. The city of Kursk has filled with people fleeing the fighting, with aid centers set up by charity groups to help those in need. 'We all have joy in our hearts,' said Oleksandr, a Ukrainian infantry soldier, 'but we realize that there are still difficult challenges ahead.'

**Ukrainian Troops Advance 800 km2 in Russian Territory**
According to Russian sources relayed by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and analyzed by AFP on Tuesday, Ukrainian troops have advanced 800 km2 in the Russian region of Kursk. Ukraine has claimed control of 1,000 km2 of Russian territory in this border region. After months of retreat on the Eastern front, Ukraine launched its largest cross-border attack against Russia on August 6. In comparison, Russia has advanced 1,360 km2 in Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024, while Ukraine's counter-offensives on its own territory have only reclaimed 20 km2, according to AFP analysis. Ukraine's failed summer counter-offensive in 2023 allowed Kiev to retake up to 250 km2 from Russian forces in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. However, Russian advances in Ukrainian territory have not slowed since the August 6 attack: the Russian army has conquered an additional 69 km2 since then and 111 km2 in total since early August, adding to the 201 km2 taken in July. In total, Russia has taken 65,891 km2 of Ukrainian territory since the invasion on February 24, 2022. With Crimea annexed in 2014 and Eastern regions already under Russian control before the war, Russia occupies 108,070 km2, or 18% of Ukraine's internationally recognized borders.

**Ukraine Regains Control of 1,000 Square Kilometers of Russian Territory**
Ukraine has taken control of 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory in the Kursk region, according to the country's army chief Oleksandr Syrskyj. This was announced in a video shared by President Volodymyr Zelenskyj on the platform X. Ukraine launched a surprise offensive on Russian soil last week, which is reportedly the largest since Russia's full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. The offensive has reached approximately three miles into Russia. According to Russian sources, 28 areas in the region are under Ukrainian control, and 121,000 people have fled Kursk since Ukraine launched its ground offensive. Russian President Vladimir Putin claims that the offensive is an attempt by Ukraine to stop the Russian offensive in the Donbass region and to gain a better negotiating position in future talks. Zelenskyj confirmed in a video on Telegram on Monday that Ukrainian forces are operating in the Kursk region, praising the soldiers and commanders for their 'steadfastness and decisiveness'.

**Russia States that Ukrainian Troops Have Entered 30km into Russian Territory**
Ukrainian forces have advanced 30 kilometres into Russian territory, the most significant advance since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. According to the Russian Defence Ministry, fighting has taken place in the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russian Foreign Affairs, stated that Ukraine is 'intimidating the peaceful Russian population.' However, Ukrainian officials have not reported any decrease in Russian operations in the region, despite speculation that the attack on Kursk may be an attempt to alleviate pressure on Ukrainian forces. Russian officials have evacuated 76,000 people from the Kursk frontier zone and declared an emergency situation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the attack for the first time in a statement, saying that the situation is 'complex and difficult.'

**Thousands of Ukraine troops ready to defend land captured in attack into Russia**
Ukrainian forces have launched a significant attack into Russia, capturing territory in the Kursk region and pushing 7.5 miles over the border. Thousands of troops, including experienced brigades, are standing by to fight. The operation aims to fortify Ukraine's northern and eastern borders with Russia and its ally, Belarus, and create a buffer zone to protect vulnerable areas. A Ukrainian official says: 'It's true that the operation has lifted the morale of the general Ukrainian population but it was not conceived as merely a PR exercise.' The official adds that one of the aims is to use occupied Russian territory as a bargaining chip in future peace negotiations to trade for Ukrainian occupied land. The operation has humiliated Putin and shattered Russian complacency about achieving victory through prolonged, bloody attrition. Putin has vowed revenge, and most Ukrainians are braced for a series of vengeful attacks.

**Ukraine hopes to destabilize Russia with Kursk incursion**
Ukraine has advanced about 30 kilometers into Russia and is digging trenches, following an unexpected incursion into Kursk Oblast last week. The attack, which is the most significant offensive maneuvering from Ukraine since the war began, may be an attempt to force Russia to negotiate the return of captured Ukrainian territory. A Ukrainian official stated, 'The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border.' The official added that 'thousands' of people were involved in the incursion, with the goal of destabilizing Russia and forcing its army to respond to 'light, fast-moving attacks.' This move could be an attempt to force Moscow's hand in negotiations, as Ukraine is increasingly fatigued by the conflict and Kyiv has signaled its readiness to negotiate an end to the war.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance Deep into Russian Territory, Challenging Kremlin Assumptions**
A Russian official in the Kursk region has urged more residents to evacuate due to the 'very tense situation' in the area, where Russian forces are still trying to respond to an unexpected Ukrainian attack after almost a week of intense fighting. Over 76,000 people have left their homes in areas of Kursk, where Ukrainian troops and tanks crossed the border on August 6 and reportedly advanced up to 30 kilometers (19 miles) into Russia. The Ukrainian forces advanced quickly on the population of Sudzha, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border. According to reports, they still control the western part of the town, where there is an important natural gas transit station. The Ukrainian operation is being carried out under strict secrecy, and its objectives - especially if the forces of Kiev aspire to control territory or if it is a rapid operation - are still unclear. The operation has been a setback for Russia's efforts in recent months to break through Ukrainian defenses in some points on the front in eastern Ukraine. As the general retired Andrei Gurulev said, 'Unfortunately, the group of forces that protects the border does not have its own intelligence assets.' 'Nobody wants to see the truth in the reports, everyone wants to hear only the good news.' Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Black Bird Group, said that probably the most difficult phase of the Ukrainian incursion will begin now, with the entry of Russian reserves into the fighting. 'If the Ukrainians advance further from where they are now, it will be a tough battle, unlike the first moments of this offensive.' The Ukrainian progress in Russian territory 'challenges the operational and strategic assumptions' of the Kremlin forces, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington. The advance could lead to Russia deploying more military assets along the long border between the two countries, the group said in an analysis on Sunday night. They also described the Russian contingent responding to the incursion as 'disorganized and hastily formed.'

**Wherefore Kursk?**
The recent Ukrainian incursion into Kursk oblast seems counterintuitive given the country's already stretched defenses. However, the author believes that the invasion is a strategic move to relieve pressure on the rest of the front line. By moving the border 20 kilometers into Russian territory, Ukraine can force Russia to deploy troops to contest this new front line, limiting their ability to launch offensives in other areas. This will lead to massive Russian losses and provide relief for exhausted Ukrainian troops. The author suggests that the change in US policy allowing Ukraine to attack into Russian territory with the regular army is a key factor in this decision. Ukraine initially committed a small force to test the Russian response, but after initial success, several brigades were moved in to support the operation and expand the occupied territory. The author expects Ukraine to widen the strip of occupied territory and force Russia to destroy their own towns and infrastructure as they try to drive out the Ukrainians.

**Ukraine has already advanced 30 km inside Russia while the Russian army constructs a new defense line 60 km from Ukraine**
Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 30 kilometers into Russia's Kursk region, marking the deepest incursion into Russian territory since the full-scale war began in February 2022. According to senior Ukrainian officials, the operation involves thousands of troops. President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the attack, saying it is an effort to 'squeeze the war out from Ukraine into the territory of the aggressor.' Russian forces have been engaging Ukrainian troops near villages deep within Russian territory. Satellite imagery analyzed by BBC reveals that Russia is constructing new defensive lines near the Kursk nuclear power plant, approximately 8 kilometers from the facility and nearly 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Analysts suggest that the Kursk operation may be an attempt to force Russia to redeploy troops, potentially relieving pressure on beleaguered Ukrainian defenses in the east.

**Ukraine Advances Deeply into Russian Territory in Kursk Region**
Ukrainian forces have advanced at least 30 km into Russian territory in the Kursk region, marking the deepest and most significant incursion since Moscow launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the attack for the first time, saying that Ukraine was pushing the war 'onto the territory of the aggressor.' 'Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and ensure the necessary pressure on the aggressor,' Zelensky said in his nighttime address to the country in Kiev. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry reported that its forces had captured several settlements in the Kursk region, including Guevo, where soldiers were filmed removing the Russian flag from a administrative building. The Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces had repelled Ukrainian troops near the cities of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, but images and videos verified by the BBC appear to show a Russian attack near the village of Levshinka, about 25 km from the Russian-Ukrainian border. Ukrainian forces have also been seen taking administrative buildings in Sverdlikovo and Poroz, and intense fighting has been reported in Sudzha, a city of about 5,000 people. 'We are on the offensive. The goal is to challenge the enemy forces, inflict maximum losses, and destabilize the situation in Russia, as they are unable to protect their own border,' a Ukrainian official told AFP. The Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces had 'frustrated attempts by enemy mobile groups with armored vehicles to invade deeply into Russian territory.' However, in an apparent admission that Ukrainian forces have advanced deeply into the Kursk region, the ministry reported the involvement of Ukrainian troops near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are about 25 km and 30 km from the Russian-Ukrainian border, respectively. 'When Russia needs to fight on its own territory, when the Russian people are fleeing, when people care, this is the only way to show them that they need to stop this war,' Ukrainian parliamentarian Oleksiy Goncharenko told the BBC. The Kursk offensive comes after weeks of Russian advances in the east, where a succession of villages has been captured by Kremlin forces. Some analysts have suggested that the Kursk attack is part of an effort to force Russia to redeploy forces away from eastern Ukraine and relieve pressure on besieged Ukrainian defenses. However, the Ukrainian official told AFP that there has been little reduction so far in Russian operations in the east. 'This is a great provocation,' Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the beginning of the week. Moscow has retaliated against the Ukrainian attack. Ukrainian emergency services said that a man and his four-year-old son were killed in a missile attack in the capital during the night. Ukrainian air defenses also destroyed 53 of the 57 attack drones launched by Russia during its nighttime airstrikes, authorities said. Four North Korean-made missiles were also fired as part of the barrage, they said. Russia was forced to turn to the isolated Asian state to rearm its forces. The US said that large quantities of military equipment were sent by Pyongyang.

The Ukrainian counteroffensive has reached approximately three miles into Russian territory and is near the towns of Tolpino and Obsjtjy Kolodez in the Kursk region. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, clashes are ongoing in the area. However, a high-ranking official in Ukraine's security services disputes Russian claims that 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers are involved, stating, 'It is false. It is thousands.' In the past few days, over 76,000 people have been evacuated in the Kursk region.

**Ukraine Advances in Russian Region of Kursk: Six Days of Military Incursion**
Ukraine has made significant advances in the Russian region of Kursk, with their military forces pushing 35 kilometers into Russian territory. The Ukrainian army has taken control of areas near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, located 25 and 30 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, respectively. The Russian Ministry of Defense has confirmed that Ukrainian forces have reached these areas, and the governor of Kursk, Alexei Smirnov, has confirmed the entry of a Ukrainian subversive group into the Belovsky district, an area adjacent to the town of Sudzha. Over 76,000 people have fled the localities near the border in the Kursk region since the start of the offensive. Ukraine has also launched drone attacks on several border regions of Russia, including a nighttime attack on the city of Kursk that left 13 injured. The Ukrainian army has taken control of a strategic object of Gazprom in Sudzha, according to a video shared on social media, which shows Ukrainian soldiers standing in front of a Gazprom office. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, mentioned the operation indirectly in his nightly speech, stating that Ukraine is 'moving the war' to Russian territory. The Ukrainian military has maintained secrecy about the details of the operation, but it is believed that its objective is to destabilize Russian forces and strengthen Kiev's position in future negotiations. 'We are on the offensive. The goal is to stretch the enemy's positions, inflict the maximum losses, destabilize the situation in Russia - because they are unable to protect their own borders - and transfer the war to Russian territory,' said a security official to AFP. The same high-ranking security official highlighted that the operation has raised the morale of both the army and Ukrainian society, exhausted after more than two years of Russian invasion. However, the official also acknowledged that the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine continues, although the intensity of the attacks has decreased slightly. 'This operation demonstrated that we can attack and advance,' he emphasized.

**Ukraine advanced more than 30 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region – Diario La Página – 2024-08-11 18:55:49**
Ukrainian forces have advanced more than 30 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Small Ukrainian groups have reached areas such as Kromsky Biki and Moliutino, while larger units are consolidating and fortifying positions closer to the border. ISW notes that Ukrainian forces are taking advantage of the low density of Russian troops in the region and are advancing deep into the Russian rear. However, Russia has redeployed troops and weapons to the western Kursk region, including BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers and tanks. According to DeepState, a Ukrainian portal, Ukrainian defense forces launched the attack on Tuesday near the villages of Sverdlikovo and Oleshnia, capturing them after brief or no fighting. 'Mountains of bodies in Oktiabrskoe,' DeepState wrote, alongside a geolocated video of the destroyed vehicles and multiple bodies of Russian soldiers inside. 'The enemy managed to stop the first assault on Nikolaevo-Darino, but not for long,' DeepState also reported. Russia has imposed an emergency roaming regime between telecom operators in the Kursk region to guarantee service amid the incursion of Ukrainian troops.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance into Russian Territory in Kursk Region**
Ukrainian forces have reportedly advanced 25-30 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. This is the first time since the Russian invasion in February 2022 that Ukraine has sent soldiers onto Russian state territory. Ukrainian troops have been fighting in the region for almost a week, and a high-ranking Ukrainian official said that thousands of soldiers are involved in the operation. 'We are in the offensive. Our goal is to expand the enemy's positions, inflict maximum losses, and destabilize the situation in Russia, as it is unable to protect its own border,' the official said. The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has stated that the pressure on Russia is necessary, saying 'Russia has brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done.' The situation in the region remains tense, with heavy fighting reported in the city of Sudscha, and Ukrainian troops have been filmed taking control of administrative buildings in the region. Satellite images have also shown new defense lines being built by Russia near the Kursk nuclear power plant, which is part of the gas transport route from Russia to the EU.

The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has stated that the pressure on Russia is necessary, saying 'Russia has brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done.' The situation is considered a risky move, as Ukraine may not be able to hold onto the territory in the long term without additional troops and equipment.

**Moscow Says Ukrainian Troops Now 30 Kilometers Inside Russian Territory as Zelenskyy Admits Kursk Incursion**
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy confirmed that Kyiv was conducting a cross-border offensive into Russia, with Ukrainian forces advancing more than 10 km into the western Kursk region. Russia's defence ministry reported engagements with Ukrainian forces near towns located 25 km and 30 km from the border, marking Ukraine's deepest incursion since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Zelenskyy stated, 'Ukraine is demonstrating its ability to restore justice and apply the necessary pressure on the aggressor.' Ukrainian forces have reported capturing several settlements in the Kursk region, including Guevo, a village approximately 3 km inside Russia. A senior Ukrainian official informed the AFP news agency that the operation involved thousands of troops, significantly more than the minor incursion initially reported by Russian border guards.

**Ukraine Advances into Russian Territory, Launches Ground Offensive**
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukrainian forces have advanced three miles into Russian territory and are near the towns of Tolpino and Obsjtjy Kolodez. The Ukrainian military has launched a ground offensive, a first since the invasion began in February 2022, targeting Russian territory. Ukraine denies reports of 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers participating in the offensive, with a high-ranking official stating, 'It's false. It's thousands.' The official also clarified the purpose of the attacks: 'The goal is to stretch out the enemy's front lines, cause as many losses as possible, and destabilize the situation in Russia to the point where they can no longer defend their borders.' Ukrainian sources claim that the ground offensive is being carried out with Ukrainian resources, and that they have not informed Western allies of the plan. The Kremlin has warned of a 'powerful response' to the Ukrainian offensive, with Maria Zacharova, spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, stating, 'Kiev threatens the peaceful population of Russia. A powerful response from the Russian army will not be long in coming.' Russian forces have reportedly shot down several Ukrainian drones, with one crashing into a residential building in Kursk, injuring over a dozen people. Over 76,000 people have been evacuated in the Kursk region, with the governor urging local authorities to speed up the evacuation process.

**Ukraine Advances into Russian Territory, Marking Deepest Incursion Since 2022 Invasion**
Ukrainian forces have advanced at least 30 km into Russian territory in the Kursk region, marking the deepest and most significant incursion since Moscow launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the attack for the first time, saying that Ukraine was pushing the war 'onto the territory of the aggressor.' Zelensky praised the 'warriors' of Ukraine and said that he had discussed the operation in Russia with the country's top military commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi. The Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces had faced Ukrainian troops near the towns of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, while the Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region entered its sixth day. A Ukrainian official told AFP that thousands of troops were involved in the operation, much more than the initial small incursion reported by Russian border guards. The official said, 'We are on the offensive. The goal is to challenge the enemy forces, inflict maximum losses, and destabilize the situation in Russia, as they are unable to protect their own border.' The Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces had 'frustrated attempts by enemy mobile groups with armored vehicles to invade deeply into Russian territory.' However, in an apparent admission that Ukrainian forces have now advanced deeply into the Kursk border region, the Russian Defense Ministry reported the involvement of Ukrainian troops near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez - which are about 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border. 'We are taking the war much closer to peace than 100 peace summits,' said Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian parliamentarian, praising the operation. 'When Russia needs to fight on its own territory, when the Russian people are fleeing, when people care, this is the only way to show them that they need to stop this war.' The Kursk offensive comes after weeks of Russian advances in the east, where a succession of villages was captured by Kremlin forces. Some analysts suggested that the Kursk attack is part of an effort to force Russia to redeploy forces away from eastern Ukraine and ease pressure on besieged Ukrainian defenses. However, the Ukrainian official told AFP that there had been little reduction so far in Russian operations in the east. In response to the Ukrainian attack, Moscow has retaliated. Ukrainian emergency services said that a man and his four-year-old son were killed in a missile strike in the capital during the night. Ukrainian air defenses also destroyed 53 of the 57 attack drones launched by Russia during its nighttime air raids, said authorities from the air force. Four missiles made by North Korea were also fired as part of the barrage, said. Russia was forced to turn to the isolated Asian state to re-supply its ammunition. The US said that large quantities of military equipment had been sent by Pyongyang.

**Ukrainian Army Advances 20 km into Kursk Region of Russia**
The Ukrainian army has advanced 20 km into the Kursk region of Russia, the largest incursion into Russian territory by Ukrainian forces since the start of the war in February 2022. According to new footage, many Russian soldiers have been captured and killed in the fighting. Russian officials have declared a 'terrorist regime' in the Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk regions, imposing restrictions on traffic and media usage. The Ukrainian army has reached the town of Sunza, a transit hub for European gas supplies, which is located about 10 km from the border. This is the fifth day of the Ukrainian army's largest attack on Russian territory since the start of the war. Ukrainian Defense Ministry confirmed that their forces have reached Sunza, a town with a population of 5,500 people. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that it has sent additional troops and military equipment to the Kursk region, where intense fighting is ongoing. The Wagner mercenary group is also believed to have been deployed to the region. Ukrainian media outlets have reported that Ukrainian forces have advanced 30 km towards the city of Kursk and have established control over some settlements in the area.

**Zelenskyj on Ukraine's Offensive in Kursk: 'Pushing the War into Russian Territory'**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj stated that Ukraine aims to push the war into Russian territory. Zelenskyj commented on Ukraine's offensive into Russia for the first time, with Ukrainian troops advancing into the Russian region of Kursk on Wednesday. According to Zelenskyj, 'I am grateful to each of our military units that ensure this,' as he wrote on X. Zelenskyj reported receiving information from the front about the goal to push the war into Russian territory, saying, 'Ukraine proves that the country can restore justice and ensure necessary pressure on the aggressor.' Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine, leading to mass evacuations in the Kursk region, with 76,000 people reportedly evacuated, according to Russian authorities and the Tass news agency. Unconfirmed reports suggest that Ukrainian forces were at least 35 kilometers deep into Russian territory on Friday.

**Lukashenko: Ukrainian Forces Advance 30-35 km into Russian Territory**
Belarusian self-proclaimed president Alexander Lukashenko stated that Ukrainian forces have advanced 30-35 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region. He made this statement on August 10, 2024, at a meeting in the Shklovsky district of the Mogilyov region, according to the state agency Belta. Lukashenko said, 'Two days ago, the attack on the Kursk direction, where they have advanced several dozen kilometers - 30-35 already today. They are digging in there.' He also stated that, under these circumstances, it would be difficult for Russia to hold 'peaceful negotiations' with Ukraine. The operation in the Kursk region is ongoing, with a recent video showing Ukrainian soldiers in the Russian city of Sudzha, Kursk region.

**Full Offensive? Ukraine Is Now Taking the Fight to Russia (As In Inside Russia)**
The Ukrainian military has launched a significant offensive operation inside Russia, capturing 135 square miles of territory and advancing 15 miles into Kursk Oblast. This marks a shift from a cross-border raid to a full-blown offensive, threatening key Russian logistical lines and potentially even a nuclear facility. Russian casualties have been heavy, with over 1,140 men reportedly lost in 24 hours. Ukrainian losses are also substantial, but many wounded soldiers return to combat. The move is seen as an alternative strategy to the stalled counteroffensive along the contact line, aiming to force Russia to divert resources. As Stavros Atlamazoglou notes, 'It remains to be seen whether the Ukrainian military leadership launched the offensive just to distract the Russian forces, or if Ukraine means to establish a foothold on enemy territory and expand the contact line.'

**Russia maps show dramatic impact of Ukraine advances in 24 hours**
Ukrainian forces have made significant advances into Russia's Kursk region in just 24 hours, despite Russia's efforts to contain the offensive. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have 'rapidly advanced' into Kursk, with some reports suggesting they have reached as far as 22 miles into Russian territory. The Russian Ministry of Defense claims that Ukraine has lost nearly 1,000 servicemen and 27 armored vehicles, but ISW notes that Ukrainian forces 'most certainly do not control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims.' Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the raid was intended to 'squeeze something out' of Russia and ensure Moscow bargains earnestly in future negotiations. Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, believes Ukraine's motives are likely 'building back up for another go at a counteroffensive in 2025' to try and reverse the momentum of the war and put the Russians on the backfoot. Savill also noted that there is a symbolic motive at play, with Kyiv intending to 'send a signal that they've got the stamina for a long conflict, and indeed one in which the balance will turn in their favor.'

**Ukrainian Forces Advance into Russia, ISW Reports**
According to the American think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 35 kilometers into the Kursk Oblast in Russia. The ISW report cites geolocation data and reports from Russian 'military bloggers' that Ukrainian forces have reached the villages of Kromskije Byki and Molutino, 35 km from the Ukrainian border and 17 km from the Russian city of Lgow. However, these are only small groups of soldiers that do not appear to be preparing to hold these territories. The ISW report notes that Ukrainian forces are using innovative tactics and their technological capabilities to their advantage in the Kursk Oblast. The think tank also believes that the Kremlin will likely try to retake the Russian territory occupied by Ukrainian forces and stop their further advance into Russia, as significant Ukrainian gains in Russia would be a 'strategic blow' to Vladimir Putin. 'It seems that Ukrainian forces are able to use small groups of armed men to conduct attacks behind the front line due to the low presence of Russian soldiers in the border area of the Kursk Oblast,' the ISW report states. 'Larger Ukrainian units, according to reports, are operating in areas of the Kursk Oblast closer to the border, where they are consolidating and strengthening their positions.'

**Ukraine Expands Offensive into Russian Territory**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive into Russian territory, targeting the Lipetsk region with drones that hit the military airport and a power plant. The attack is the most significant against Russian territory since the start of the war in February 2022. According to the Russian army, around 1,000 soldiers and 20 armored vehicles and tanks are involved. Ukraine has not officially claimed responsibility for the operation, but President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a speech that Russia should 'feel' the consequences of its invasion. 'Russia has brought war to our land and should feel what it has done,' he said, without directly referring to the attack. The Russian Defense Ministry reported that a total of 75 drones were shot down in the regions of Belgorod, Kursk, or Lipetsk, or in the annexed Crimean peninsula. The Russian authorities have warned of air attacks in several regions, and the Defense Ministry has assured that the operation to destroy Ukrainian formations continues. According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces have made significant territorial gains since the start of the offensive. 'Geolocated videos and Russian statements indicate that Ukrainian forces have continued to advance rapidly in the Kursk region on August 8, and are present in areas up to 35 kilometers from the border,' the analysts say, although 'they probably do not control' all the territory. The Russian Defense Ministry has assured that 'the operation to destroy Ukrainian army units continues' with bombings, rockets, and artillery strikes against the troops that have crossed the border. Moscow has sent reinforcements to 'prevent penetration' inside the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the attack as a 'large-scale provocation' by Kiev. International allies of Ukraine have been surprised by the incursion. The US Department of State has expressed support for Kiev but has not commented directly on the operation. The Russian army has confirmed that fighting with Ukrainian forces continues for the fourth day in the Kursk region, where the emergency has passed from 'regional' to 'federal' level, the highest. 'The army continues to repel the attempt of Ukrainian forces to penetrate in depth into the Kursk region,' the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. 'The operation to destroy Ukrainian formations continues,' the ministry said, assuring that it 'prevents' Ukrainian raids. According to the Moscow bulletin, the total number of losses of the enemy army, in four days of offensive, amounts to 945 soldiers killed.

The conflict in the Russian region of Kursk continues into its fourth day. Russia has announced plans to 'suppress' the Ukrainian advance, focusing on the region of Sumy. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 10 kilometers into Russian territory. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that the 'deployment to destroy units of the Ukrainian army' will continue. Ukrainian forces have reportedly fortified their positions, including in the border town of Sudscha.

'The Oblast Sumy has never experienced so many air attacks per day,' he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the Ukrainian advance as a 'large-scale, targeted provocation.'

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 8, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on the ongoing situation in Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing into Russian territory. According to geolocated footage and Russian claims, Ukrainian forces have continued to advance further into Kursk Oblast on August 8, with some reports indicating they are as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast. However, it is unclear if Ukrainian forces control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims. Russian milbloggers have provided conflicting reports on Ukrainian positions, with some claiming that Ukrainian forces have seized settlements while others claim that they have only advanced part of the way. The ISW notes that Ukrainian forces appear to be using novel and innovative tactics and technological capabilities during operations in Kursk Oblast, which may be a concern for the Russian military command. The Kremlin is likely to respond to the perceived threat to civilians in Kursk Oblast, and the Russian military command has several possible courses of action (COAs) it could pursue to respond to the Ukrainian operation. These COAs include using existing conscripts, Federal Security Service (FSB) border guards, Rosgvardia, and other irregular forces to push Ukrainian forces back; redeploying operational reserves to Kursk Oblast; or redeploying relatively better provisioned and more combat effective frontline units to Kursk Oblast. The ISW notes that the Russian military command's decision-making will be influenced by its perception of the size and capability of Ukrainian forces in the area, and it is unclear which COA is most likely.

**Russia says it halted Ukrainian incursion into its territory**
Ukrainian forces have launched a cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk region, according to US and Ukrainian officials. The operation, which began on Tuesday, aims to disrupt and demoralize Russian forces, as well as divert Russian forces away from other parts of the eastern front. US officials do not believe Ukraine intends to hold Russian territory for the long-term. Russia claimed to have halted the incursion, but latest evidence suggests fighting continues in the Kursk region. Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into the region, according to the Institute for the Study of War. Ukraine's allies have not commented on the situation, but the EU's foreign affairs and security policy spokesperson said that Ukraine has the right to defend itself, including striking an aggressor on its territory. The White House was taken by surprise by the developments, but stated that the US is supportive of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia's aggression. Ukrainian troops have found themselves under increased pressure along the 600-mile frontline as Moscow continues its slow, grinding offensive.

**Ukraine's Attack on Russia: A Calculated Risk**
Ukrainian forces have made advances into Russia's Kursk Oblast, with reports suggesting they have reached up to 10 kilometers into Russian territory. The Russian defense minister, Valeriy Gerasimov, has stated that over 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers have attempted to occupy the region, but the attack has been repelled. However, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has accused Ukraine of 'wanton bombing of civilians' in the area. Putin's spokesperson, Dmitri Medvedev, has called for Russia to invade the rest of Ukraine. Nupi researcher, Julie Wilhelmsen, notes that Medvedev's statements should be taken with a grain of salt, as he has become one of the most hawkish figures in Russian politics. Wilhelmsen suggests that it is more important to focus on Putin's statements, as they are more indicative of Russia's intentions. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, has not directly mentioned the attack in his daily video address, but has stated that it is important to continue to 'destroy the enemy effectively and steadfastly' to defend the country. Experts believe that Ukraine's goal is to create uncertainty among the Russian forces and to weaken their presence in the Donbas region. The attack has also put pressure on Putin, who is trying to maintain a narrative that the war is not costing Russia too much. The Ukrainian forces are taking a calculated risk by not taking unnecessary losses, but are willing to free Russian soldiers from the front lines in Ukraine to fight on Russian territory. The attack has also led to a breakdown in the Russian narrative, with Russian bloggers and media outlets reporting on the situation in a way that is critical of the government. The Ukrainian government has not ruled out the possibility of using the attack as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. 'If we get back the occupied territories, we'll get back the Kursk region,' said Nupi researcher Jakub M. Godzimirski. 'Putin has had to swallow many camels since February 2022, and now the war has been going on for 2.5 years and has affected millions of Russian families. The more power Ukraine gets through successful operations, the better the conditions will be when the war ends at the negotiating table.'

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Offensive in Kursk Region**
Ukraine has launched a surprise offensive in the Kursk region of Russia, with troops advancing 10-15 kilometers into Russian territory. The offensive, which began on Wednesday, has seen Ukrainian forces control the city of Sudzha and reach as far as Koronevo, 30 kilometers from the border. The Ukrainian military has reportedly used donated German Marder armored vehicles in the operation, which has been described as the largest advance since November 2022. The move has caught Russia off guard, with at least 20,000 Russian troops said to have crossed the border without warning. The Ukrainian government has not publicly stated the goals of the operation, but analysts believe it may be aimed at securing territory for future negotiations or to pressure Russia to withdraw from the Donetsk region. The operation has also raised concerns about the potential for a wider conflict, with some critics arguing that Ukraine should focus on supporting its troops in the Donetsk region rather than opening a new front.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance into Russian Territory in Kursk Region**
Ukrainian forces have made significant gains in their offensive, advancing up to 10 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region. According to the Institute for the Study of War, this is a notable tactical success for Ukraine. However, military experts do not believe this marks a turning point in the war. The Russian side has made mistakes, particularly in their intelligence and espionage, allowing the Ukrainian forces to advance further than they did during the Russian offensive on Kharkiv in May and June. The Russian military's response has been slow and ineffective. Despite this, the situation remains serious for Kyiv, with fighting ongoing in the Sumy region in the north and the Donbas region in the south. The Ukrainian military operation was carried out under strict secrecy, even from their Western allies. This is largely due to a new online mobilization system, where every conscript must register themselves in a database. This has increased the number of deployable soldiers, with the authorities now having sufficient reserves to replace soldiers who have been at the front for over two years. The Ukrainian forces are now able to launch a public relations campaign to demoralize the enemy and boost morale at home. According to polls, the number of Ukrainians who support negotiations for a ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow is at an all-time high, nearing 50%. The Ukrainian military is also using drones to attack Russian targets, with over 520 long-range attack drones launched against Russia in July. The Russians, on the other hand, are focusing on attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure. A resident of Kursk said, 'There are air alarms two to three times a day, and even more at night.' The war has now reached Russian territory, with the west's initial hesitation and lack of military support for Ukraine in the first two years of the war having failed to prevent this. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, their forces prevented Ukrainian units from advancing deeper into the Kursk region on Thursday. President Vladimir Putin called the Ukrainian advance a 'large-scale provocation.' Ukrainian government officials have not commented on the scope of the operation around the town of Sudscha.

**Ukraine Forces Reach 10km Into Russia's Kursk Region As Raid Enters 3rd Day**
The Ukrainian attack on Russian territory in the Kursk region has entered its third day, with Ukrainian troops advancing up to 10 kilometers inside Russian territory. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Ukrainian forces have 'penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold.' The assault has resulted in the capture of Sudzha, a key gas logistical hub, and thousands of civilians have been evacuated due to reports of casualties. Ukrainian sources claim that Russian border guards and conscripts have surrendered, while videos of the border fighting show heavy losses on the Ukrainian side. Analysts believe that the attack is part of a larger plan to cause confusion in Russian military ranks and force the diversion of resources away from the frontlines in the Donbass region. The European Union has fully supported the actions of Ukraine's military, with European Commission spokesman Peter Stano stating that Ukraine has the right to defend itself, 'including by striking the aggressor on its territory.' The Kremlin has reported that its forces have killed hundreds of Ukrainian troops in the ongoing assault. 'The EU continues to fully support Ukraine's legitimate right to defend itself' and win back its lost territories, Stano said. 'Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanized offensive operations on Russian territory,' ISW said in an update. 'The current confirmed extent and location of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,' ISW added. Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential aide, said, 'The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations and destruction of normal life forms - including within the Russian Federation's own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions - is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression.' Kostyantyn Mashovets, a war expert, said, 'It wasn't accidental, it's clearly part of one clear plan.' Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov, a military analyst, said, 'If you look at official reports, there were significantly fewer Russian glide bombs dropped in the Donetsk area, that means the aircraft which carry them are now elsewhere in Russia.'

**Battles Rage in Russia's Kursk Oblast as Ukrainian Troops Advance**
Clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces are ongoing in Russia's Kursk Oblast, with Ukrainian troops reportedly advancing up to 10 kilometers into Russian territory. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, its forces are engaging Ukrainian troops in the Sudzhansky and Korenovsky districts, but reports from Russian Telegram channels suggest that fighting has reached Sudzha, a small town near the Ukrainian border. Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, claimed that the Ukrainian advance had been stopped, but the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that geolocation footage indicates Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 10 kilometers into Kursk Oblast, passing through at least two Russian defense lines and a stronghold. The region has been a focal point of tension since Russian forces were pushed back across the border in April 2022. As Russia intensifies its attacks in Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast, the ongoing clashes in Kursk Oblast are a significant development in the ongoing conflict.

**Study finds Ukranian forces have advanced 10 kilometers into Russia**
Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk region, according to the Institute for the Study of War. The incursion, which involved around 1,000 troops and two dozen armored vehicles and tanks, has centered on the logistical hub of Sudzha, a town of around 5,000 inhabitants. Russia's top general has vowed to crush the incursion and push the Ukrainian fighters back to the border. The Institute for the Study of War notes that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold. 'Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers (six miles) into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanized offensive operations on Russian territory,' the ISW says.

**Ukraine Advances into Russian Territory, Captures 11 Settlements**
According to the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances of up to 10 kilometers in the Russian oblast of Kursk, as part of ongoing mechanized offensive operations. The analysis is based on the examination of geolocated videos published in the last 48 hours, which show Ukrainian armored vehicles advancing to positions 10 kilometers from the border. 'The current extent and confirmed position of the Ukrainian advance in the Kursk oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,' the ISW said. A Russian internal source stated that Ukrainian forces have taken 45 square kilometers of territory within the Kursk oblast since launching the operation on August 6. Other Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces have captured 11 settlements, including Nikolaevo-Daryino, Darino, and Sverdlikovo, and are operating within Lyubimovka. Videos shared on Telegram show civilians fleeing the areas involved in the clashes, with hundreds of people reportedly evacuated. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the Ukrainian offensive as 'a provocation,' while the Ministry of Defense initially denied the presence of Ukrainian soldiers and equipment in Russian territory before later admitting to the breach and providing information on the effective intervention of Russian forces, as said by 'The current extent and confirmed position of the Ukrainian advance in the Kursk oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,' the ISW said.

**Ukrainian troops were seen pushing 6 miles into Russian territory, and the Kremlin can't decide if it's a 'large-scale provocation' or 'under control'**
Ukraine launched a rare assault into Russian territory, pushing 6 miles into the Kursk oblast with infantry and armored vehicles. The Russian region's acting governor, Alexey Smirnov, announced a state of emergency, but said the 'situation is under control.' However, Russian officials called the incursion a 'large-scale provocation' and Vladimir Putin called a meeting to discuss the issue. Ukraine's military advance has been reported to have stretched further east to the border town of Sudzha, where Smirnov said people were injured and buildings were damaged. Some reports from Russian military bloggers contradict claims that the fighting had come to a standstill, with one channel reporting that Ukrainian units were advancing in the northeast and seizing villages. The exact scale of the resources committed by Ukraine to this attack is still unclear, but some observers speculate that the incursion was meant to draw Moscow's attention and resources away from the eastern front. 'The Kiev regime has undertaken another large-scale provocation, firing indiscriminately from different types of weapons, including rockets, at civilian buildings, residential houses, ambulances,' Putin said, per state media. 'The enemy's long preparation for the attack, alas, has borne fruit,' said Rybar, a Telegram channel run by military blogger Mikhail Zvinchuk. 'The situation is under control,' Smirnov said, but Putin's meeting with his security heads suggests otherwise. 'The Kiev regime has undertaken another large-scale provocation,' Putin said, adding that Ukraine had also sent 11 tanks and dozens of armored vehicles. 'The enemy's long preparation for the attack, alas, has borne fruit,' the channel wrote, adding that fighting had become 'difficult.'

**ISW confirms advance of Ukrainian troops 10 kilometres deep into Russia's Kursk Oblast**
Experts from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) have confirmed that Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 10 kilometers deep into Russia's Kursk Oblast. According to ISW, Ukrainian forces have broken through at least two Russian defence lines and a stronghold. The Kremlin's response to the Ukrainian offensive has been contradictory, as Russian officials are trying to balance presenting the effort as a notable escalation while avoiding overstating its implications and risking domestic discontent, as stated by ISW. 'Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanised offensive operations on Russian territory on 7 August.' The advance was confirmed through geolocation footage released on 6 and 7 August, which shows Ukrainian armoured vehicles moving into position along the 38K-030 motorway, approximately 10 kilometers from the Russian-Ukrainian border.

**Ukraine Invasion Day 897: Kursk region incursion**
Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanized offensive operations on Russian territory on August 7. According to Russian sources, Ukrainian forces have seized 45 square kilometers of territory, captured 11 settlements, and are operating within Lyubimovka. Russian forces were driven out of the village of Sverdlikovo overnight, and an unknown number of Russian soldiers are nearly encircled in Oleshnya. Ukrainian forces reportedly used a first-person view (FPV) drone to down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over Kursk Oblast. The Kremlin's response to Ukrainian offensive activities in Kursk Oblast has been contradictory, and select Russian milbloggers have criticized the Russian military command for not detecting preparations for or preventing Ukrainian offensive operations. Ukrainian forces continue to successfully adapt their drone capabilities, and Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Head Kyrylo Budanov assessed that Russian offensive potential will culminate within one and a half to two months.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance 10 Kilometers into Russian Kursk Region**
According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces have advanced 10 kilometers into the Russian Kursk region. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) analyzed data and confirmed the advancement of Ukrainian forces into the region. The ISW stated, 'Confirmed that on August 7, Ukrainian forces advanced 10 kilometers into the Kursk region of Russia in the context of ongoing mechanized assault operations on Russian territory.' The ISW also noted that Ukrainian forces have breached at least two Russian defensive lines and an outpost. The Russian government's reaction to Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region has been inconsistent, with officials trying to balance representing the efforts as a significant escalation by Ukraine while avoiding exaggerating the potential consequences and risking internal discontent. Some Russian 'military' bloggers have criticized the Russian military command for not preparing for Ukrainian offensive operations in the Kursk region or preventing them. Ukrainian forces have also successfully adapted their capabilities in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), using a FPV-drone to shoot down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over the Kursk region. The head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, estimated that the Russian offensive potential will reach its climax within 1.5-2 months, which aligns with the ISW's assessment of Russia's current offensive potential. The head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Daniel Bell, stated that Russia has been torturing 95% of Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Russian prisons. The Central Election Commission of Moldova announced that it will not register the pro-Russian 'Victory' electoral bloc for the presidential election and referendum in October 2024. A Russian court sentenced Andriy Kurshin, the administrator of the Telegram channel of the Russian ultranationalist blogger 'Moscow Calls', to 6.5 years in prison for publishing 'fake' information about Russian military personnel. Ukrainian forces have recently regained positions south of Chasiv Yar, while Russian forces have advanced northeast of Siversk, southwest of Donetsk, and in the border areas of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

**How deep into Russian territory has Ukraine's surprise August incursion reached?  --  Meduza**
On August 6, 2024, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) entered Russian territory near the city of Sudzha in the Kursk region. The Ukrainian operation, which involved several battalions of the 22nd Mechanized Brigade, special forces, and air defense systems, deeply penetrated Russian defenses, facing weak forces. Meduza reports that the Russian military launched airstrikes using jets, helicopters, and Iskander missiles, but the Ukrainian troops continued their offensive. At least one Russian helicopter was shot down. The scale of the Ukrainian operation remains unclear, but it is evident that the Russian local territorial defenses in Kursk were caught off guard.

**Putin humiliated as Ukraine saboteurs launch surprise assault deep in Russian territory**
Approximately 300 Ukrainian soldiers launched a surprise cross-border attack into Russian territory on Tuesday, reaching as far as six miles (10 km) inside Russia, according to Moscow. The attack, which was bolstered by 11 tanks and more than 20 armored fighting vehicles, was initiated at 8am and persisted throughout the day between the border villages of Nikolayevo-Daryino and Oleshnya in Russia's Kursk region. Russian claims of successfully repelling the incursion were quickly proved false, with reports from Russian military bloggers and social media footage indicating the Ukrainian attack was highly significant. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the anti-disinformation department at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, acknowledged the attack's occurrence, suggesting it had not been fully defeated. Military analysts suggest the attack could aim to divert Russian forces to defend an underactive part of the front since spring 2022 and boost Ukrainian morale. However, critics in Ukraine argue such assaults yield no long-term military advantage.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance Deep into Russian Territory in Kursk Oblast**
On August 6, 2024, the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) entered the territory of Russia in the area of the city of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast. The scale of the operation remains unknown. According to reports, several battalions of the 22nd Mechanized Brigade of the VSU, supported by special forces and air defense systems, crossed the border and by the evening of August 7, had advanced deep into Russian territory. They were met by weak forces, including border guards and infantry from a 'polk prikrytiya granitsy' (a border protection unit) created in 2023, which was largely composed of conscripts. The VSU was able to push through the Russian defenses, despite being hit by Russian air strikes and 'Iskander' missiles. At least one Russian helicopter was shot down. By the evening of August 7, the VSU had achieved several successes, including capturing the 'Sudzha' border crossing and taking several dozen Russian border guards prisoner. They also captured a gas measurement station near the border crossing. The VSU advanced west of the border crossing, reaching the road from Rylsk to Sudzha in the area of Sverdliovo, where they were hit by Russian air strikes and operational-tactical missiles. The main part of the VSU group turned towards Rylsk along the road, capturing the villages of Leonidovo and Zeleny Shlyakh. However, it is unclear if the VSU has entered the city of Sudzha itself, although they have approached it from the west and possibly from the south. The city's quarters have been heavily damaged by Ukrainian shelling, and many civilians remain in the area.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 6, 2024**
Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted a series of cross-border raids into Kursk Oblast on August 6, but Russian milbloggers largely dismissed the claims. Ukrainian officials have largely yet to comment on the raids. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu heavily overexaggerated Russian advances in Ukraine since mid-June 2024, stating that Russian forces have seized 420 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory, when in fact ISW has observed evidence confirming that Russian forces have seized approximately 290 square kilometers since June 14. Russian officials continue coordination and military cooperation with Iran ahead of the Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel out of concern for Russian interests in the region. Armenia continues to abstain from the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Russian forces advanced east of Toretsk, and fighting continued in various areas of Ukraine, including Kharkiv Oblast, Luhansk Oblast, and Donetsk Oblast.
