*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a roundtable, papers scattered, a digital clock showing 15:54:00.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did Apple announce a portless iPhone before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 42.35%. Despite rumors about the iPhone 16 Ultra, Apple didn't make it official.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. The possibility was there, especially with the MacRumors hints. But I guess the tech wasn’t ready.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Our models considered the industry trends and Apple's cautious innovation pace. A portless design is still a leap.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, it seems the world will wait a bit longer for the wireless future.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. But with Apple's history, it's only a matter of time.

*They nod, sharing a knowing smile as the scene fades out.*
