**Macron Rejects Left-Wing Alliance's Proposal for New Prime Minister**
French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected the left-wing alliance's proposal to name a new prime minister, instead opting to continue with an interim government until mid-August. The left-wing coalition, which won a majority of parliamentary seats in the recent election, suggested Lucie Castets, a specialist in financial crimes, as a candidate for prime minister. Macron stated that the name is not the issue, but rather the question of which majority can emerge in the National Assembly. He added that until mid-August, they are not in a position to change things without creating chaos. The Olympic Games in Paris, which will take place from next Friday to August 11, pose a significant logistical and security challenge for France. The country is currently in a parliamentary impasse since the election, with no party having a majority in the lower house of Parliament.

**Macron Accepts Premier Attal's Resignation, Calls for Republican Forces to Work Together**
French President Emmanuel Macron has accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. The Élysée Palace announced in a statement: 'In order to conclude this period as quickly as possible, it is up to the republican forces to work together to build an alliance around projects and actions serving the French and French women.' According to Le Parisien, Prime Minister Attal and his ministers will remain in office for ongoing business, likely until the Paris 2024 Olympics, from July 26 to August 11. Attal's resignation is a consequence of the legislative election results, which saw the left-wing coalition of the New Popular Front win 182 seats. Macron's centrists came second with 168 seats, and the far-right Rassemblement National, led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, won 143 seats. Negotiations for a new government appear to be far from conclusion. None of the three major blocks has a majority to govern alone, and the most plausible hypothesis seems to be an alliance between Macron's centrists and a moderate part of the New Popular Front.

**The Prime Minister of France pledges to support family finances to confront the rise of the extreme right and left**
French Prime Minister Macron's coalition, 'Together', is facing a tough challenge in the upcoming parliamentary elections after losing to the far-right National Rally party in the European Parliament elections. Macron's coalition is focusing on promoting democratic values and economic management to counter the rise of extreme right and left parties. According to Attal, the policies of these parties would lead to mass unemployment. He warned, 'Let us not jump from a high height into the unknown without a parachute.' The elections will be held in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.

**No New Government Before Mid-August**
Lucie Castets, a 37-year-old high-ranking official, has been chosen by left-wing parties to become the next Prime Minister of France. She stated, 'I am ready; we are ready. I ask the President of the Republic now to take his responsibilities and name me Prime Minister.' However, President Emmanuel Macron has called for a grand coalition and urged parties to work together, potentially taking time. Macron announced that no one will be named before the end of the Olympics, which means waiting until at least mid-August. The current government will remain in place to handle daily affairs and emergencies during the competition.

**Macron Rejects Left-Wing Alliance's Attempt to Name New Prime Minister**
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that his outgoing government will remain in place until mid-August, during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, rejecting a left-wing alliance's attempt to name a new Prime Minister. The left-wing coalition, led by the Nouveau Front populaire français, had proposed Lucie Castets, a specialist in financial crime, as a candidate for Prime Minister. However, Macron stated that the name is not the issue, but rather what majority can emerge in the National Assembly. He added that until mid-August, they cannot change things, as it would create chaos. The Olympics pose a significant logistical and security challenge for France, with 35 sites and around 10,500 athletes. The country is currently in a parliamentary deadlock, with no party having a majority in the Assembly, which is fragmented into three blocs.

**France's New People's Front Names Lucie Castets as Prime Minister Candidate**
The New People's Front (Nouveau Front Populaire), a left-wing coalition in France, has chosen Lucie Castets as its prime minister candidate. The coalition, which includes the Left Front (LFI), the Greens (EEVL), the Socialist Party (PS), and the Communist Party (PCF), won the first round of the early general election on June 30 with 33.15% of the votes. The coalition's candidate, Lucie Castets, is a financial crime expert. French President Emmanuel Macron has not commented on the coalition's prime minister candidate, saying 'The issue is not the name, the issue is: Which majority will emerge in the National Assembly? We are not in a position to change anything until August, because it would create chaos.' Macron also stated that the current government will continue until the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and will focus on the games. After the Olympics, Macron will appoint a new prime minister.

**French Left-Wing Parties Agree on Single Candidate for Prime Minister**
The French left-wing parties' coalition, 'New Popular Front', has agreed on a single candidate for the post of Prime Minister of France. According to Marine Tondelier, the head of the 'Green' party, this decision was made after the coalition's victory in the parliamentary elections. The coalition won 182 seats in the National Assembly. Macron has stated that he will not appoint a new head of government or make changes to the cabinet until at least mid-August, citing the need to avoid chaos. The victory of the left-wing coalition has been seen as a lesson for all of Europe, with former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras calling it a 'lesson for the whole of Europe'. Over 200 candidates from Macron's centrist block and the left have withdrawn from the second round of the parliamentary elections to prevent the far-right from gaining an absolute majority.

**Macron Announces New Prime Minister and Government After Paris Olympics**
French President Emmanuel Macron announced that a new prime minister and government will be appointed after the Paris Olympics, which will take place from July 26 to August 11. Macron stated that the current government will continue to handle current issues and that immediate appointment of a new prime minister and subsequent formation of a new government would create problems. The pause in forming a new government, which Macron previously proposed, will last at least until mid-August. The results of the early parliamentary elections in France, held on July 8, showed that the left-wing coalition 'New Popular Front' won 182 seats, followed by Macron's party 'Together' with 168 seats and the 'National Union' coalition led by Marine Le Pen with 143 seats. After the election results, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal announced his intention to resign, which Macron accepted on July 16. The French government will continue to perform its duties until a new government is formed.

**Macron Suggests Pause in Government Formation During 2024 Olympics**
French President Emmanuel Macron has recommended that political parties take a pause in discussions about forming a new government during the 2024 Olympics. Macron did not clarify whether this means he will not appoint a prime minister until the end of the Games. The Olympics will take place in Paris from July 26 to August 11, and the Paralympics from August 28 to September 8. Macron's statement comes as the French parties have been unable to agree on a coalition government after the June 9 parliamentary elections, which did not give any party an absolute majority. Macron appointed the snap elections after his presidential alliance lost the European Parliament elections.

**Macron to Maintain Attal as Interim Prime Minister Until End of Paris Olympics**
French President Emmanuel Macron will maintain Prime Minister Gabriel Attal as an interim prime minister until the end of the Paris Olympics, which start on July 26 and end on August 11. Macron informed Attal and his team that the government will be in an interim state and hinted that the situation may 'last for some time'. The cabinet met nine days after the second round of legislative elections, which reconfigured the political landscape in the country. The elections resulted in a fragmented parliament, with no party or coalition obtaining an absolute majority of 289 seats. The New Popular Front (NFP), a left-wing alliance, came in first place, ahead of Macron's centrist alliance and the far-right National Rally party. The new legislature will begin on Thursday, July 18, when the new president of the National Assembly will be elected. Macron did not rule out the possibility of the Council of Ministers meeting occasionally during this interim period. The left-wing coalition that won the legislative elections without an absolute majority is still unable to agree on a candidate for prime minister. Socialists, communists, and ecologists are pushing for a candidate from civil society, while the main party in the coalition, France Insoumise, is opposed to this idea. The proposal has not been approved by the main party in the coalition, and several parliamentary sources have confirmed that the proposed candidate is Laurence Tubiana, a 73-year-old economist and climate architect. Tubiana has been criticized by some sectors of the main party in the coalition, who see her as close to President Macron.

**France's Early Parliamentary Elections: A Possible Rise of Far-Right Forces**
French voters began casting their ballots in the early parliamentary elections on June 30, 2024, which may lead to the rise of far-right forces to power for the first time since the Nazi era. The elections, which will be held in two rounds, may affect European financial markets and Western support for Ukraine, as well as France's nuclear arsenal and global military power, according to Associated Press. The elections come amid frustration with President Emmanuel Macron's economic policies and rising anti-immigrant sentiment. Marine Le Pen's National Rally party has been gaining popularity, while a new left-wing coalition, the 'New Popular Front', poses a challenge to Macron's centrist party 'Together for the Republic'. Macron has called for early elections after his party's defeat in the European Parliament elections earlier in June. The polls suggest that the National Rally may win a majority in parliament, which could lead to Macron appointing Jordan Bardella, the party's 28-year-old leader, as prime minister. This would be the first time since World War II that a far-right government has taken power in France.
