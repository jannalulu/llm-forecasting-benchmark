**Rivian posts 'defining' Q2 earnings even as future remains uncertain**
Rivian published its second quarter earnings, with mixed results. The company produced 9,612 vehicles and delivered 13,790 vehicles, a drop from previous quarters but in line with expectations due to retooling at its manufacturing facility. Rivian unveiled two new in-house motor configurations and launched a second generation of the R1 platform, which includes hundreds of design, engineering, and performance upgrades. Revenue rose to $US1.16 billion, beating market expectations, but gross profit losses increased year-over-year to $US451 million. Net loss for the second quarter of 2024 increased to $US1,547 million. CEO RJ Scaringe said the company will likely see cost reduction from the factory retooling realised in the second half of the year, reaffirming the company's target of reaching a profit in the last quarter of 2024. Scaringe also stated, 'The second quarter has been a defining one for Rivian.' He added, 'We have demonstrated strong execution during the quarter with the plant retooling upgrade and launch of second generation R1 vehicles.' Rivian is also partnering with Volkswagen Group to develop next-generation electrical/electronic architecture for electric vehicles, with Volkswagen committing to invest up to $US5 billion.

**Hold On! Don't Buy Rivian Stock Ahead of Earnings. Wait for the Drop.**
Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is expected to release its second-quarter 2024 earnings after the bell on August 6. Based on its key financial and operational indicators, Rivian stock is a 'Hold' going into the upcoming earnings report. While production and delivery figures have met expectations, profitability still needs to be achieved. The company's recent plant upgrades have improved production efficiency, but Rivian still needs to be more profitable. Analysts' EPS estimates have changed 15 times in the last 90 days, indicating uncertainty among analysts regarding Rivian's financial stability. Rivian's market position is solidifying in the competitive EV sector, but the company's path to profitability is still under construction. The company's strategic initiatives, including developing the R2 platform, are crucial for its long-term lead. Therefore, it is prudent to hold off on buying Rivian stock until after the Q2 earnings report to gauge the company's performance post-earnings before making further investment decisions.

**Rivian (RIVN) to release critical Q2 earnings: Here's what to expect**
Rivian (RIVN) is set to release its critical Q2 2024 earnings on August 6, 2024. The company has been aggressively cutting costs to achieve a gross profit by the end of the year. In the second quarter, Rivian delivered 13,790 vehicles, a slight increase from the first quarter. However, production at its Normal, IL plant fell to 9,612 vehicles, a trend expected after a planned shutdown in April. CEO RJ Scaringe has said that the upgrades have made 'meaningful' impacts on costs and efficiency. Rivian expects to cut costs even more with the introduction of new tech, such as its Maximus motor or 'Enduro Gen 2.' Despite a 'messy' second quarter, Rivian remains on the path to profitability, with executives reiterating that the company will achieve its first positive gross profit by the end of the year. According to Estimize, Rivian is expected to report a loss of $1.17 per share on revenue of $1.18 billion in Q2 2024. Rivian's stock is up 42% over the past three months, but share prices are still down 40% over the past year.

**RIVN Warning: This May Be Your Last Chance to Escape Rivian Stock.**
Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) may be facing a crucial test after its recent stock rally. The company is set to release its second-quarter 2024 financial results on August 6, which could be a major letdown if the market has front-run its assumption of amazing results. Additionally, Rivian is facing a setback in California's legal system, where a judge has ruled that the company will go to trial over allegations that it encouraged employees to steal trade secrets from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). With Rivian's history of income negativity and no expected profits for years, investors should be cautious and consider making defensive portfolio adjustments before the company's results are released.

**Rivian: 2025 May Be A Painful Transition Year**
Rivian's (RIVN) stock price continues to lack bullish support despite a $5 billion investment from Volkswagen (VWAGY). This is due to Rivian's projected lack of profitability until 2027. While management guides a 'modest positive gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024,' it is expected to be a slim profit margin. Additionally, Rivian's main facility will not be producing vehicles for more than a month in the second half of 2025, implying further cash burn. Despite optimism about its competitive pickup truck, EDV, and future R2/R3 pipelines, the intermediate term prospects are likely to be limited. With a downtrend in stock prices, things may get worse before they get better.

**Rivian Announces Production Halt and Decline in Deliveries**
Rivian, an American electric vehicle manufacturer, has announced a production halt for over a month in 2025 to prepare for the production of its next small car, which is set to be released in 2026. The company also expects a decline in deliveries for the third quarter of this year, without specifying a figure, as it rushes to rebuild its inventory after closing its factory in April due to cost reduction needs. Rivian is currently losing thousands of dollars per vehicle, with a loss of around 39% over the selling price of each electric car. The company has partnered with Volkswagen, which will inject $5 billion to create a 'joint venture' for the production of next-generation battery-powered cars. RJ Scaringe, Rivian's CEO, stated, 'The current environment is extremely competitive in terms of prices.' He criticized the 'very low-cost' competition that has led to the bankruptcy of several automakers in recent years, including Fisker. Rivian plans to expand its operations in Europe from 2026, when it will have up to three models available for sale in both North America and Europe.
