To assess the probability of Revolut obtaining a UK banking license before September 30, 2024, I'll begin by identifying the key factors influencing this event:

1. **Historical Context and Reference Class:** Revolut has been awaiting a UK banking license for over three years, a process typically fraught with regulatory hurdles. In the fintech sector, firms like Monzo and Starling Bank have faced similar challenges but have already secured their licenses, suggesting it is possible but challenging. The lengthy process for Revolut signals potential difficulties unique to its situation.

2. **Current Company and Regulatory Status:**
   - **Internal Developments:** Revolut's significant growth in revenue and profitability, alongside efforts to improve auditing processes and corporate governance, suggest readiness to meet regulatory standards. However, issues with financial crime controls and complex ownership structures are persistent concerns.
   - **Regulatory Feedback:** While company executives are optimistic about receiving the license soon, there are indications from sources like the ECB and internal chaos reports that suggest significant regulatory hesitations remain.

3. **External Market and Economic Factors:**
   - **Fintech Environment:** The fintech landscape is competitive, and regulatory bodies are wary of granting licenses to entities that might pose a financial or operational risk. Revolut being a large-scale operation could both expedite or further delay their approval process.
   - **Upcoming Events:** The upcoming UK general election might influence regulatory decisions, either hastening resolution or adding delays if priorities shift.

4. **Recent News Reports:** The articles and news reports suggest a mixed bag of optimism from company executives and ongoing regulatory challenges. Revolut reports growth and readiness but lacks a definitive breakthrough announcement. The market perception of Revolut's valuation and its strategic moves (like relocating headquarters) generally indicates a commitment to securing the license and expanding operations.

Balancing these components, the key is understanding that while Revolut has made strides in addressing issues raised by regulators, ongoing hurdles persist. Given the time frame until September 2024, the situation remains fluid but leans towards eventual resolution.

Considering these points:

- Revolut's growth and financial stability argue in favor of eventual approval.
- Persistent regulatory concerns and past delays suggest caution for near-term prospects.
- The mixed messages from new reports - optimism from Revolut, skepticism from regulatory bodies - add an element of uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast whether Revolut will obtain a UK banking license before September 30, 2024, I will consider several factors including historical data, Revolut's current situation, the complexities described in the news articles, and the factors influencing regulatory approvals.

1. **Base Rates and Reference Classes**: Generally, acquiring a banking license in the UK is a complex process that can range from less than a year to several years, especially for fintech companies which face additional scrutiny regarding their business models and financial health. Since Revolut has been pursuing this license for over three years, the prolonged timeline suggests additional complications.

2. **Current Evidence and Trends**:
   - **Positive Indicators**:
     - Revolut has shown significant profitability and growth in 2023 with a profit before tax of £438 million and increased revenues. This solid financial performance might enhance their credibility in gaining a banking license.
     - The company has been enhancing financial controls and improving audit processes, which are usually prerequisites for obtaining a banking license.
     - The optimism expressed by Revolut’s CEO and other executives regarding the nearing decision suggests a positive insider sentiment.

   - **Negative Indicators**:
     - Regulatory hurdles and issues with internal governance, such as allegations of money laundering, continue to be problematic, as highlighted in the articles.
     - The involvement of the European Central Bank in pushing for improved controls at Revolut’s EU subsidiary mirrors challenges the company might face with UK regulators.
     - Delays beyond typical timeframes for companies like Monzo and Starling Bank, which already secured licenses, indicate potential complexities specific to Revolut.

3. **Causal Forces and Market Sentiment**:
   - Regulatory authorities in the UK have a mandate to protect financial stability, which may cause hesitancy in granting licenses to fast-growing fintech firms. Revolut's move to distance itself from cryptocurrency and focus on growth stability is a response to align with regulatory expectations.
   - The upcoming UK general election could influence regulatory focus and priorities, potentially causing further delays.

4. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**: While Revolut has successfully operated with licenses in over 30 countries, the unique regulatory environment in the UK represents a significant challenge. Their optimism, financial improvements, and marketing of substantial valuation in pursuit of share sales contrast with inherent regulatory skepticism and past issues.

5. **Error Analysis**: Historical forecasting errors often stem from overconfidence in trends or underestimations of regulatory complexities. Hence, a balanced view considers the optimism expressed by Revolut and its market performance, counterbalanced by documented regulatory hesitance.

Given these considerations and weighing the positive business performance against regulatory caution and unresolved issues, I make the following forecast:

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast whether Revolut will obtain a UK banking license before September 30, 2024, I will analyze the available information and apply forecasting principles:

1. **Base Rate Considerations**: Fintech companies like Revolut often face significant regulatory hurdles in obtaining banking licenses. Similar cases like Monzo and Starling show that the process can take several years but is ultimately achievable given proper compliance and financial health.

2. **Current Status**: Revolut has been waiting for over three years for the UK banking license. Recently, they have recorded substantial profits and revenue growth, a clean audit, and an increase in regulatory compliance efforts, suggesting progress toward meeting regulatory requirements.

3. **Potential Obstacles**: Despite positive financial indicators, Revolut faces issues such as complex ownership, regulatory hurdles, and safeguarding concerns that can delay the process.

4. **Regulatory Environment**: The UK regulatory framework is stringent, and the FCA's past behavior suggests a cautious approach, especially for companies with complex structures or a history of noncompliance.

5. **Expert Opinion and Company Confidence**: Statements from Revolut's leadership express confidence, but without a concrete timeline for approval, optimism must be cautiously interpreted.

6. **Recent Developments**: Revolut's improved financial reporting, clean audit opinion, and strategic corporate moves like relocating headquarters and expanding workforce suggest they are making significant strides toward compliance.

7. **External Evidence**: There are no publicly available predictive models or bets (such as from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket) directly addressing this question. However, the broader fintech and regulatory context provides guidance.

Based on the combination of these factors, while Revolut has demonstrated positive trends, lingering regulatory concerns and the lack of a specified timeline indicate uncertainty. Thus, adjusting the base rate probability upward due to recent financial and operational improvements but still accounting for known regulatory challenges leads me to the following probability estimate.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To begin my forecast, it is important to use both the inside and outside views. The inside view involves considerations specific to Revolut's current situation, while the outside view involves reference classes and historical data regarding the acquisition of banking licenses by fintech companies.

**Outside View and Base Rates:**  
Historically, fintech companies face significant hurdles in obtaining banking licenses. High-profile examples like Robinhood and others show that regulatory approvals can take several years, often beyond initially expected timelines. Notably, Revolut has been in this process since 2021, placing it in a similar position to these cases. Historical trends suggest lower likelihood of resolution as initially anticipated due to regulatory scrutiny, internal processes, and governance complexities.

**Inside View and Recent Developments:**  
Revolut has made significant progress recently:  
- Record profit and revenue growth signal financial health, an important factor for obtaining a license.  
- A clean audit opinion, which tackles one of their previous problem areas.  
- Confidence expressed by CEO and public statements imply positive outlooks, but these can be biased or over-optimistic.  
- Continued expansion efforts, including a new headquarters, point to strategic positioning, though these are not direct indicators of regulatory success.

**Challenges and Concerns:**  
- Ongoing scrutiny over internal controls, governance issues, and the broader pressure on fintech companies, like potential money laundering concerns.
- The ECB scrutiny on Revolut’s EU operations hints at regulatory concerns that could apply similarly in the UK.
- Competitors having secured licenses earlier increases market pressure; however, it doesn't directly impact Revolut's case resolution.

**Probabilistic Assessment:**  
Considering historic base rates and current events, an estimate should reflect both Revolut's improvements and lingering regulatory challenges. The absence of timelines for approval, regulatory scrutiny, and the approaching deadline all factor into a tempered estimate.

**Balancing Risks and Uncertainties:**  
Given these factors, balance of optimism from financial growth and caution due to regulatory hurdles is crucial. Achieving a calibrated estimate requires acknowledging Revolut's business optimism with realistic regulatory constraints. Given these discussion points, adjusting upwards from a baseline fintech regulatory approval benchmark while weighing issues unique to Revolut.

Thus, the likelihood of Revolut obtaining a UK banking license before September 30, 2024, considering both historical precedent and current status indicators, is set as follows:

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 50.00%, but 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.

To forecast whether Revolut will obtain a UK banking license before September 30, 2024, I will evaluate the situation using the evidence provided.

**1. Base Rates and Reference Classes:**
In the UK, it generally takes fintech companies a few years to secure a banking license after application. Monzo and Starling, as comparator fintech firms, took around 2-3 years to obtain their licenses. Revolut applied for its license in 2021, so it has been approximately three years since its application.

**2. Recent Developments and Current Status:**
- Revolut has been profitable and has shown significant growth in revenue and customers.
- The company has addressed earlier auditor concerns by releasing its financial results on time, which is crucial.
- CEO and company representatives are optimistic about obtaining the license soon, though this may be biased.
- Persistent regulatory issues have been highlighted, specifically around governance and internal controls.
- There are both positive (financial performance and audit improvements) and negative (operational governance and regulatory concerns) indicators.

**3. Extrapolation and Trends:**
Revolut's financial performance is strong, which could help mitigate some regulatory concerns. However, the recognition and positive resolution of these governance issues remain crucial. The move to a new headquarters and expansion plans indicate laid groundwork for operations as a licensed bank.

**4. Balancing Evidence and Adjustments:**
- While positive financial and audit results are promising, persistent issues, especially regulatory in nature, pose significant risks.
- The possible influence of geopolitical or regulatory changes in the UK should be considered, although these are inherently uncertain.

**5. Weighing Clashing Causal Forces:**
- Positive financial momentum and expansion plans vs. regulatory and operational hurdles.
- Internal optimism for a license vs. external skepticism from analysts regarding the timeline.

Based on these considerations, I will express this forecast in a probabilistic range:

"My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%."

Monzo and Starling, as comparator fintech firms, took around 2-3 years to obtain their licenses. Revolut applied for its license in 2021, so it has been approximately three years since its application.

**2. Recent Developments and Current Status:**
- Revolut has been profitable and has shown significant growth in revenue and customers.
- The company has addressed earlier auditor concerns by releasing its financial results on time, which is crucial.
- CEO and company representatives are optimistic about obtaining the license soon, though this may be biased.
- Persistent regulatory issues have been highlighted, specifically around governance and internal controls.
- There are both positive (financial performance and audit improvements) and negative (operational governance and regulatory concerns) indicators.

**3. Extrapolation and Trends:**
Revolut's financial performance is strong, which could help mitigate some regulatory concerns. However, the recognition and positive resolution of these governance issues remain crucial. The move to a new headquarters and expansion plans indicate laid groundwork for operations as a licensed bank.

**4. Balancing Evidence and Adjustments:**
- While positive financial and audit results are promising, persistent issues, especially regulatory in nature, pose significant risks.
- The possible influence of geopolitical or regulatory changes in the UK should be considered, although these are inherently uncertain.

**5. Weighing Clashing Causal Forces:**
- Positive financial momentum and expansion plans vs. regulatory and operational hurdles.
- Internal optimism for a license vs. external skepticism from analysts regarding the timeline.

Based on these considerations, I will express this forecast in a probabilistic range:

"My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%."
