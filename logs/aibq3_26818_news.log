**Donald Trump's TikTok Strategy: Reaching a New Audience**
Donald Trump, a former US president, has launched a TikTok account and is using it to communicate with his followers. Despite having a relatively low activity level, his account has gained 8.6 million followers and his first video has received 157.2 million views. This allows him to reach a disappointed audience who have left traditional social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Alexandre Eyries, an expert, notes that this may not directly influence voters, but can indirectly spread his message through online users who may become relays of communication. Trump's use of TikTok is seen as a way to connect with a younger audience who may not be interested in traditional politics.

**Trump's TikTok Dominance: Why His Content is Winning Over Young Voters**
Donald Trump is dominating the TikTok platform, with 7.5 million followers, compared to Joe Biden's 450,000 followers. Trump's posts, featuring him at events, are more popular than Biden's, which feature him in a more serious and political tone.

**Trump leans into his star power on TikTok to court young voters**
Former President Donald Trump has expanded his social media reach by opening an account on TikTok, attracting more followers in less than 24 hours than the Biden reelection campaign since February. This move has raised concerns for President Biden, who needs a large turnout from young voters to win re-election. TikTok is a popular platform among young people, with 175 million users in the US, and has been a lightning rod for controversy due to concerns over national security, privacy, and election interference. Trump has racked up 6.1 million followers since posting his first video, while Biden has gained 374,000 followers. Trump has touted the disparity in followers, saying 'No one shows up to see Joe Biden speak in person and they certainly don't want to watch him on TikTok.' Whether Trump can drive young voters his way remains to be seen, but the opportunity exists, with over 60% of US adults under 30 using TikTok.

**Trump seeks to court young male voters in new TikTok gambit**
Donald Trump's presidential campaign is planning to post short-form videos on TikTok targeting young men with messages on inflation and other economic issues. Trump joined TikTok in June and has already gained 5.5 million followers. The campaign aims to tap into frustration among young people with the post-pandemic inflation surge and Trump's message will focus on economic issues. Trump's campaign has said there will be significant and growing activity on TikTok, which is used by a majority of adults under 30. The Biden campaign does not have an individual TikTok account, but has a account with 360,000 followers. Young voters are a key demographic for both campaigns, with Trump's campaign trying to make inroads with young males and Biden's campaign focusing on his policies.

Former US President Donald Trump has created an official account @realdonaldtrump on TikTok. Within two days of opening the account on June 1, 2024, Trump gained over 3.5 million followers. The account has already posted a video titled 'The President is also on TikTok' which has garnered over 60 million views. As the presidential election approaches on November 5, 2024, Trump is in a close competition with incumbent President Joe Biden. Biden's campaign is already active on TikTok, with over 340,000 followers. However, Biden has signed a bill that would ban TikTok if its Chinese owner ByteDance cannot sell the service by January next year. ByteDance is challenging this decision in court. Trump also attempted to ban TikTok in 2020, but the attempt was blocked by the court. In March 2024, Trump stated that TikTok poses a threat to national security, but banning the service would harm many young people.

**Trump Joins TikTok, Surpasses 3 Million Followers**
Former US President Donald Trump joined the popular video-sharing platform TikTok on Saturday, surpassing 3 million followers. Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, posted a video showing him waving to the crowd during an open-hand fighting match in Newark, New Jersey, saying it was an honor. His first post received over 33 million views in 12 hours and has gained over 2.9 million likes. Trump is currently facing a series of criminal and civil lawsuits at the federal and local levels. He became the first former US president to be convicted of a crime after a jury in New York found him guilty of all 34 criminal charges related to falsifying business records in an attempt to hide financial payments to a porn star in 2016, just before the presidential election. Trump's rival in the 2024 presidential election, President Joe Biden, had already opened a TikTok account in February and has over 340,000 followers. TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance filed a lawsuit against the US government on May 7, citing a law that forces the company to sell the app or face a ban in the country. Biden signed a bill banning TikTok into law in April after it was approved by both houses of Congress. The ban, citing national security concerns due to the app's Chinese ownership, sparked widespread criticism from various quarters inside and outside the US, with people questioning the motivations behind Washington's suppression of the popular app and raising concerns about the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the principle of fair competition.

Despite the app being under scrutiny in the US due to national security concerns, political strategists see TikTok as a crucial tool for reaching younger voters in the 2024 presidential election. Trump's campaign is already outpacing Biden's engagement on the app, with a two-to-one ratio of pro-Trump to pro-Biden content. Strategists predict that TikTok could play a significant role in defining the 2024 elections, as more Americans get their news from social media and younger voters are feeling disillusioned with politics.

Despite previously wanting to ban TikTok when he was president, Trump has changed his stance, considering it a threat to national security but not wanting to ban it due to the potential backlash from young people and the strengthening of Meta, the company behind Facebook, where Trump was banned for two years after the January 6th Capitol attack.
