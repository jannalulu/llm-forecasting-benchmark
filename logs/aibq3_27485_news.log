**Traders now betting on smaller Fed rate cut in September**
The likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut at the September 2024 meeting is certain, but traders are now betting on a smaller 25 basis points (bps) cut rather than a jumbo 50 bps cut. According to the latest CME futures prices, the probability of a 50 bps cut has decreased to 32% from 53% last week, while the odds of a 25 bps cut have risen to 68% from 47%. This shift is driven by recent economic data, including positive inflation readings from the PPI and CPI, and stronger-than-expected retail sales data, which supports the view of a soft landing and a smaller cut. As a result, stocks have bounced back strongly after a recent sell-off, with the soft landing theory gaining steam. As Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, said, 'The Federal Reserve uses interest rate adjustments as a tool to control inflation and stabilize the economy. A rate cut can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, while a rate hike can slow down an overheating economy and keep inflation in check.'

**US Fed must go big with 50 bps interest rate cut in September or risk recession: Experts | Mint**
Wall Street experts believe that the US Federal Reserve must implement a significant 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a potential recession. The Fed has maintained the benchmark interest rate at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, in line with market expectations. As the US central bank has kept borrowing rates steady for 12 months to combat inflation, experts warn that a more substantial rate cut is necessary to mitigate the looming economic storm.

**Fed expected to cut rates by 25 bps at September meeting: economist survey**
A recent survey of 51 economists by Bloomberg found that most expect the Federal Reserve to cut their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at their next meeting in September, contrary to calls for a 50-bp cut or an inter-meeting move. The economists' view aligns with Fed officials' statements that the central bank will be deliberate and patient in setting policy. Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said, 'We think financial markets might force the Fed to cut inter-meeting but otherwise don't think last week's data is enough of a reason.' The survey found that 60% of economists described the labor market as solid, though somewhat softened, while 24% called it significantly weakened but likely to stabilize. Traders, however, are leaning toward a 50-bp cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, giving that outcome a 54.5% probability vs. a 45.5% probability for a 25-bp reduction.

**What a U.S. Rate Cut Is Nearly Guaranteed**
A 25 bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September is 'nearly guaranteed', according to market expectations. Bank stocks, such as JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, have already been trading at a high level for the year. However, official government reports, including job growth figures, have been found to be inaccurate. The Labor Department reported that total payroll employment from April 2023 to March 2024 was overstated by 818,000, which would change the figure by 0.5%. Despite this, private education, health services, and government added jobs. The Fed's decision to cut interest rates may be delayed if August's inflation report shows that price hikes are not moderating, potentially leading to a rate cut in November or December.

**U.S. Fed minutes indicate potential rate cut in September**
According to the U.S. Federal Reserve's July 30-31 meeting minutes, the Fed is likely to cut interest rates at its September meeting if economic data continues to come in as expected. The minutes stated that while inflation data was encouraging, additional information was needed to confirm that inflation is moving towards the 2% objective. However, participants viewed the incoming data as enhancing their confidence that inflation is moving towards the objective, and the majority observed that easing policy at the next meeting would be likely if data continues to come in as expected. The minutes also noted that factors such as waning pricing power, moderating economic growth, and excess household savings accumulated during the pandemic would continue to put downward pressure on inflation. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group's FedWatch Tool showed a 62% probability of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points at the September meeting.

**US Federal Reserve Considers Rate Cut**
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) has considered a rate cut at its recent meeting, according to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released yesterday. Although the Fed decided to keep the interest rate unchanged, 'a clear majority' of the Fed officials believed that a rate cut in September would be likely, provided that incoming economic data continues to meet expectations. Several committee members noted that the progress in reducing inflation, combined with rising unemployment, provides a plausible argument for a 0.25 percentage point rate cut. The Fed has kept its interest rate at 5.25-5.5% for over a year, aiming to curb inflation and cool the labor market without stifling economic growth. As one committee member noted, 'it was a great day' for the economy, but the Fed is cautious and will continue to monitor the situation.

**Federal Reserve Minutes Suggest Strong Lean Towards Cutting Interest Rates in September**
The Federal Reserve's meeting minutes showed that policymakers are leaning towards cutting interest rates in September, with many wanting to cut rates immediately. Although the Fed decided to keep interest rates unchanged, they left the door open for a potential cut in September. The market had expected the Fed to cut interest rates in September, with rates ranging from 5.25% to 5.50%. It is expected that interest rates will be cut by up to 1 percentage point by the end of this year. The majority of policymakers at the Fed indicated that 'if the data continues to flow as expected, it would be likely to ease policy at the next meeting', according to the meeting minutes released on Wednesday. Many policymakers considered the current interest rate setting to be 'binding', while a few participants argued that in light of the ongoing decline in inflationary pressures, keeping interest rates unchanged would mean that monetary policy would continue to exert pressure on the economy. The meeting minutes also showed that some policymakers expressed concerns that an early cut in interest rates could lead to a resurgence in inflation. The rapid increase in unemployment rates has led to a discussion about cutting interest rates, with some analysts suggesting that the Fed should consider cutting borrowing costs by half a percentage point in the next meeting. The unemployment rate has risen from 3.4% in early last year to 4.3% in the previous month. The meeting minutes described the labor market as 'strong but not overheating'. The market showed little reaction to the meeting minutes, with stocks rising slightly and bond yields falling, as the minutes largely confirmed the market's expectations.

**Probability of Fed Cutting Rates by 50 Bp in Sept 32.5%: Fedwatch Tool**
The probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 50 basis points in September has increased to 32.5%, according to the FedWatch Tool. This comes after the probability of a 25 basis point cut was 67.5%. The dollar index has been trading near its lowest level in over a year against the Euro and Sterling, and a weak job market has made interest rate cuts more probable. As stated in the minutes of the July 30-31 FOMC meeting, several Fed officials were keen on an interest rate cut at the September policy meeting. Additionally, a Labor Department report revealed a weaker job market, with employers adding fewer jobs than originally reported in the year through March. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 18.

**Fed Meeting Minutes Suggest Interest Rate Cut in September**
The recent Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting minutes, released on August 21, revealed that 'most members' believe it will be appropriate to cut interest rates in the US in September. The probability of a 50-basis-point (0.5 percentage point) cut in the coming month has increased, but a 25-basis-point (0.25 percentage point) cut is still the majority, according to data from the CME Group. The Fed members observed that the real GDP growth in the US was solid in the first half of the year, although slower than the robust pace seen in the second half of last year. The final domestic purchases of the private sector (PDFP) also moderated in the first half, but less than the growth of GDP, according to the document. The participants also noted that the long-term inflation expectations remained well-anchored, although they adopted caution about controlling the index. For the end of the year, the chance of a cumulative decline of 125 points (1.25 percentage points) increased, although the possibility of a 100-point (1 percentage point) decline still prevails. 'Most participants observed that the factors that contributed to recent disinflation, probably, will continue to exert downward pressure on inflation in the coming months,' the document states. 'Many participants noted that the moderation of labor cost growth as the labor market conditions reequilibrate will continue to contribute to disinflation, particularly, of non-housing service prices.'

**Federal Reserve Notes Suggest 'Likely' Interest Rate Cut in September**
The Federal Reserve's recent meeting notes suggest that a 'likely' interest rate cut in September is becoming more probable. According to the notes, 'the overwhelming majority' of participants at the July meeting 'noted that, if the data develops in line with expectations, it would be appropriate to ease the rate at the next meeting'. Although all Fed policymakers voted to keep the interest rate stable in July, the notes reveal that some officials wanted to ease the rate during the July meeting, citing 'recent progress on inflation and job growth as a plausible reason to lower the rate by 25 basis points'. A 25 basis point cut is equivalent to a quarter percentage point. The notes also show that policymakers were confident in the inflation outlook and were willing to ease the rate if inflation continued to decline steadily. The notes state, 'With respect to inflation outlook, participants judged that recent data had strengthened their confidence that inflation would be durably moving towards 2 percent'. The markets are expecting a cut in September, which would be the first since the pandemic intervention.

**Fed minutes reveal likely rate cut in September amid easing inflation and labor market concerns**
The Federal Reserve's July meeting minutes revealed that the 'vast majority' of participants believe a rate cut in September is suitable, with 'several participants' considering a 25-basis-point reduction. Recent data on inflation indicates a significant decrease in price pressures, and labor market concerns are growing due to overstated payroll gains. Despite these mixed signals, the Fed is leaning towards a rate cut in September, with traders anticipating a reduction in interest rates. The evolving economic indicators will be crucial in shaping the Fed's decision on whether to adjust interest rates.

**Federal Reserve Meeting Minutes Suggest Rate Cut in September**
The Federal Reserve's meeting minutes from July 30-31 showed that most policymakers agreed that they would likely lower the federal funds rate in September if inflation continued to decline. The minutes stated that 'the majority' of policymakers 'noted that if the data continues to appear as expected, it would be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting.' The Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate at 5.3% in July, which is the highest level in nearly a quarter century. Market participants have already considered it certain that the Federal Reserve will announce its first rate cut in four years when it meets on September 17-18. A rate cut by the Federal Reserve would ultimately lead to a decrease in car loan and mortgage interest rates, and could also lead to an increase in stock prices. The meeting minutes also highlighted that 'many' policymakers believe that the current interest rate stance is restrictive, while 'a few' participants argued that leaving the interest rate unchanged would increase pressure on the economy. Despite all Federal Reserve officials agreeing to keep the interest rate steady in July, the minutes noted that 'many' policymakers believed that the progress in lowering inflation, combined with rising unemployment rates, 'provided a reasonable argument for reducing the 25-basis-point target range.' The Federal Reserve maintained its monetary policy settings for the eighth consecutive meeting in July, as widely expected. In its policy statement, the central bank said it is 'attentive to risks on both sides of its dual mandate,' a change from its June statement, which said it was 'highly attentive' to inflation risks. Although the Federal Reserve reiterated that it does not expect to cut interest rates until it has more confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%, statements by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the post-meeting press conference effectively confirmed a rate cut in September. Powell said, 'We are approaching the point where we would be cutting rates,' and added that cutting interest rates might be considered in September. He also noted that there was 'a real discussion' about cutting interest rates at the July meeting. Powell's cautious comments and the soft labor market data allowed the markets to price in a 25-basis-point rate cut in September. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a 50-basis-point rate cut had risen to nearly 50% earlier in August. With the upbeat retail sales for July and the weekly jobless claims data that eased concerns about the economic slowdown in the United States, the chances of a large rate cut of 25% have decreased.

**Fed Officials Open Door to Interest Rate Cut in September**
A majority of Federal Reserve officials have opened the door to a potential interest rate cut in September, considering the recent inflation data. During the Fed's last meeting on July 30-31, several members noted that the recent progress in fighting inflation and the rise in unemployment made a 25 basis point rate cut in September 'likely', according to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released on Wednesday. However, this view was not the majority. Nevertheless, 'most members emphasize that, if the data continues in the expected direction, it would probably be appropriate to ease monetary policy at the next meeting'. The minutes also highlight the 'confidence' of FOMC members in data showing that inflation is heading towards the 2% target. Despite market nervousness in recent weeks, including a sharp drop on Wall Street 10 days ago, due to concerns about a potential recession, the Fed's chairman Jerome Powell is expected to address the issue at the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, starting on Friday. Most analysts expect a 0.25 percentage point rate cut in September, followed by regular cuts at the two subsequent meetings before the end of the year, according to the FedWatch tool from CME Group. After a continuous decline in 2023, US inflation experienced a slight rebound at the beginning of 2024 before slowing down, delaying the first rate cut, which was initially expected in the second quarter of the year. However, prices seem to have resumed a slowdown trend, approaching the 2% target, while the US unemployment rate has slightly increased to 4.3%.

**Federal Reserve Members Expect Interest Rate Cut in September**
According to the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, a 'vast majority' of members believe that it will be appropriate to cut the interest rate in September, assuming economic data continues to come in as expected. Several members noted that progress in inflation and the decrease in unemployment would justify a 25-basis-point cut in the July meeting. Many directors commented that the policy remains restrictive, but the majority emphasized the importance of maintaining a data-dependent stance. The document states that the team's inflation forecast was slightly lower than expected, reflecting received data and the lower projected usage of resources. The members expect inflation to be around 2% by 2026.

**Fed minutes show policymakers leaning towards September cut**
According to the Federal Reserve minutes from July, policymakers were strongly leaning towards an interest-rate cut at their September policy meeting. Several officials were willing to reduce borrowing costs immediately, citing abating inflation pressures and a cooling job market. The minutes noted that a 'majority' of Fed officials saw risks to the job market as having increased while risks to the inflation mandate had been reduced. Fed officials expect to cut its benchmark interest rate next month by a quarter of a percentage point from the current 5.25%-5.50% range, with some analysts suggesting a half-percentage-point reduction. Fed governor Michelle Bowman cautioned that there were 'upside risks to inflation', and that policymakers should consider a range of possible scenarios for the September meeting. As Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting press conference, 'if we do get the data that we... hope we get, then a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting'.

**Fed Officials Open to Cutting Interest Rates in September**
The majority of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy committee members considered it 'appropriate' to reduce interest rates in September, according to the central bank's minutes released on Wednesday. The minutes stated that 'most participants observed that, if the data continue on the expected trajectory, it would probably be appropriate to ease the policy (monetary) at the next meeting.' This has likely fueled expectations that the Fed will implement its first rate cut in this cycle in September. Investors are eagerly awaiting Jerome Powell's statements at the end of the week, hoping to gain insight into the Fed's future steps and the scope of interest rate cuts. In the last Fed meeting, several members 'highlighted that recent progress in the fight against inflation and high unemployment provides a basis for a 25 basis point cut in the reference interest rate in September,' according to the meeting's minutes. The minutes also indicate the 'confidence' of FOMC members in data showing that 'inflation is heading towards the Fed's 2% annual target.' The markets have been showing signs of nervousness in recent weeks, fearing a recession in the US due to high interest rates aimed at controlling inflation. High interest rates make credit more expensive and discourage consumption and investments, thus moderating price pressures. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at the annual meeting of central bank directors in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Friday. Most analysts expect a 0.25 percentage point reduction in interest rates in September, according to the FedWatch system by CME.

**USD/CAD remains on the defensive below 1.3650 ahead of FOMC Minutes**
The USD/CAD pair remains on the defensive, trading near 1.3620, as markets expect a 25 bps rate cut in September. The US Federal Reserve's (Fed) dovish comments and expectations of a rate cut have weakened the US Dollar. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the US economy does not show signs of overheating, while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggested discussing a potential US interest rate cut in September due to concerns about the weakening labor market. Meanwhile, the softer Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reports support the case for another rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC), with traders fully pricing in a 25 bps cut in September and an additional 50 bps of easing for the final two meetings of the year. This might drag the Loonie lower and cap the downside for USD/CAD.

**Powell likely to start rate cutting cycle in September with 25 bps: Berman**
The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is likely to start a rate cutting cycle in September with a 25 basis point (bps) cut, according to Berman. The primary reason for this is that the FOMC feels they are behind the curve. As of Friday's close, the U.S. futures markets were pricing in eight 25 bps rate cuts over the next year, which would take the overnight rate to 3.5 per cent. However, this is considered too aggressive unless there is a harder economic landing. The base inflation rate is likely to be higher than the two per cent level for a considerable period, and the worst outcome would be for too much stimulus lifting inflation again. Berman notes that the bond market is telling us a hard landing is coming, but the stock market is telling a different story. Companies more sensitive to falling rates are expected to perform better in the next few years than growth-oriented companies that are more fully valued.

**US Interest Rate Cut Probability Returns to Majority Scenario**
The probability of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting US interest rates by 100 basis points (bp) in 2024 has returned to being the majority scenario, according to the CME Group's monitoring. The chance of rates ending the year between 4.25% and 4.50% is now 43.3%. The probability of a smaller cut, of 75 basis points, is 39.4%. For the September meeting, there was a slight increase in the probability of a 50 basis point cut, now at 27.5%. However, the majority view still favors a minimum reduction of 25 bp, with a 72.5% chance. The bets for a larger interest rate cut followed the release of US housing starts data, which fell well above market expectations and raised doubts about the strength of the US economy.

**Traders now betting on smaller Fed rate cut in September**
The likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut at the September 2024 meeting is certain, but traders are now betting on a smaller 25 basis points (bps) cut rather than a jumbo 50 bps cut. According to the latest CME futures prices, the probability of a 50 bps cut has decreased to 32% from 53% last week, while the odds of a 25 bps cut have risen to 68% from 47%. This shift is driven by recent economic data, including positive inflation readings from the PPI and CPI, and stronger-than-expected retail sales data, which supports the view of a soft landing and a smaller cut. As a result, stocks have bounced back strongly after a recent sell-off, with the soft landing theory gaining steam. As Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, said, 'The Federal Reserve uses interest rate adjustments as a tool to control inflation and stabilize the economy. A rate cut can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, while a rate hike can slow down an overheating economy and keep inflation in check.'

**US Fed must go big with 50 bps interest rate cut in September or risk recession: Experts | Mint**
Wall Street experts believe that the US Federal Reserve must implement a significant 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a potential recession. The Fed has maintained the benchmark interest rate at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, in line with market expectations. As the US central bank has kept borrowing rates steady for 12 months to combat inflation, experts warn that a more substantial rate cut is necessary to mitigate the looming economic storm.

**US Federal Reserve ‘must go big with 50 bps interest rate cut in September' or risk recession: Experts**
The US Federal Reserve has maintained its benchmark interest rates at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, in line with Wall Street estimates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has set the stage for a potential rate cut in September, citing progress toward lower inflation and a cooler job market. Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, warns that the Fed must 'go big' with a 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a looming economic storm. Consumer prices in the US rose modestly in July, fueling expectations of a rate cut. Powell said, 'a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table' when the Fed next meets in September.

**Yields mixed after CPI supports 25 bp Sept cut, with 50 bp not ruled out**
U.S. Treasury yields fell on Wednesday after the July consumer inflation reading came in lower than expected, supporting a Federal Reserve easing of at least 25 basis points in September, with 50 bps not ruled out. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.2% monthly increase and 3.0% annual increase, which was in line with the actual numbers. The odds of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting had been nearly split between 50 bps and 25 bps, but futures moved in favor of a 25 bps cut after the report. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, said, 'The market is thinking that inflation is a little bit more sticky than the Fed was expecting, and they're penciling out some of that 50 basis point pricing.' Traders are still pricing in a full percentage point of easing from the current 5.25% to 5.5% fed funds rate by year-end. Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading, said that the Fed should go with 50 bp in September if fed funds are to fall by 100 bp over the remaining three meetings in 2024. The yield on the 10-year note fell 2.6 basis points to 3.828%, while the 2-year note yield rose 1.2 basis points to 3.9537%.

**Wednesday's CPI Inflation to Decide on 25 bps or 50 bps FED Rate Cut**
Economists expect Wednesday's CPI inflation report to significantly impact financial markets. Some analysts predict a partial reversal of June's lower-than-expected inflation figures, forecasting modest increases in both headline and core CPI. This data could play a key role in shaping the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding potential rate cuts in September. The headline CPI is projected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, while the core CPI is forecasted to see a monthly increase of 0.2%. A robust CPI figure could prompt a 25 basis point rate cut, while a weaker reading might lead to a more aggressive 50 basis point reduction. The market will be closely watching how this report influences the Fed's September meeting, as it could signal the beginning of a new phase in monetary policy.

**Fed expected to cut rates by 25 bps at September meeting: economist survey**
A recent survey of 51 economists by Bloomberg found that most expect the Federal Reserve to cut their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at their next meeting in September, contrary to calls for a 50-bp cut or an inter-meeting move. The economists' view aligns with Fed officials' statements that the central bank will be deliberate and patient in setting policy. Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said, 'We think financial markets might force the Fed to cut inter-meeting but otherwise don't think last week's data is enough of a reason.' The survey found that 60% of economists described the labor market as solid, though somewhat softened, while 24% called it significantly weakened but likely to stabilize. Traders, however, are leaning toward a 50-bp cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, giving that outcome a 54.5% probability vs. a 45.5% probability for a 25-bp reduction.

**US Interest Rate Futures Price in Inter-Meeting Fed Cut**
US interest rate futures have priced in an inter-meeting interest rate cut, with August 2024 SOFR futures indicating a 25 basis point (bps) cut and September futures showing a 100% chance of at least a 50 bps rate reduction. However, some market participants are skeptical about a rate move before the Fed's September meeting. Jim Caron, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said, 'The Fed is not there to support financial market prices because people are upset with their returns. Their job is to see that markets are functioning properly.' Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee cautioned against taking too much signal from a global stock market sell-off, saying, 'The law doesn't say anything about the stock market; it's about the employment and it's about price stability.' The next Fed meeting is on Sept. 17-18.

**Federal Reserve to cut by 50bps in September and November: Wells Fargo**
Wells Fargo analysts predict two 50 basis point rate cuts at the Federal Reserve's meetings on September 18 and November 7, citing emerging economic indicators and labor market vulnerabilities. They note that the FOMC has largely succeeded in returning inflation to its 2% target, but that recent data suggests the risks to the 'full employment' part of the dual mandate are rising. The bank argues that the FOMC needs to revert to a neutral policy stance quickly to prevent a cycle of labor market weakness, and forecasts a series of cuts, including a 25 bps reduction in December, followed by additional cuts in 2025. According to Wells Fargo, 'the FOMC needs to get back to a 'neutral' stance of policy quickly or else it risks a vicious circle of labor market weakness.'

**Wall Street, analysts ramp up bets for 50 bps rate cut in Sept after July jobs report**
The recent US jobs data has led to a shift in market expectations, with many analysts now calling for a 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point cut have jumped to 71.5% from 22% a day ago. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said, 'I am stunned by how quickly the market narrative has changed about what the Federal Reserve should do.' Several brokerages, including JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman Sachs, have called for bigger or earlier interest rate cuts, with some expecting a 50 basis point cut in September and November, followed by 25 basis point cuts at each subsequent meeting. 'We now think the FOMC cuts by 50bp at both the September and November meetings, followed by 25bp cuts at every meeting thereafter,' JPMorgan's Michael Feroli said. Citi's Veronica Clark and Andrew Hollenhorst added, 'We now expect the Fed to start the cutting cycle with 50bp rate cuts in September and November, followed by 25bp cuts at each subsequent meeting until reaching a policy rate of 3-3.25% by mid-2025.'

**The Fed confirmed a rate cut coming in September**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has hinted at a potential rate cut in September, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating that '...a reduction in the policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.' Powell emphasized that the decision will depend on inflation data, but set a relatively low threshold for incoming data. He also rejected the idea of starting with a 50 bps cut. As a result, mortgage rates are expected to decline in the near to medium term, with rates already decreasing from 7.10% to 6.70% in the past month. This has led many buyers to wait for further declines, although this tactic is considered risky.

Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased 2.9% in the second quarter. The Fed will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. When asked about a September rate cut, Powell said 'we have made no decisions about future meetings. That includes the September meeting.'

**Fed Chairman Powell Signals Potential Rate Cut in September**
Federal Reserve Chairman Powell held a press conference after maintaining the policy interest rate at 5.25-5.50%, the highest level in 23 years, despite market expectations. Powell stated that the labor market has reached a better balance and unemployment rates have remained low, while inflation has decreased significantly. He emphasized that the bank is committed to maintaining a restrictive monetary policy stance to balance demand and supply and reduce inflationary pressures. Powell noted that inflation has slowed down significantly over the past two years, but remains above the long-term target of 2%. He stated, 'We do not anticipate lowering the interest rate until we have more confidence that inflation is sustainably declining to 2%. The second-quarter inflation data has increased our confidence, and better data will further strengthen it. We will continue to make decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis.' When asked about the possibility of a September rate cut, Powell said, 'We are approaching the point where a rate cut may be appropriate. The question is whether the data, the evolving outlook, and the risk balance are consistent with increasing confidence in inflation and a strong labor market. If this test is met, a rate cut may be possible at the next meeting in September.' Powell also stated that the bank's path forward is dependent on the economy's performance and that they can imagine scenarios ranging from zero to several rate cuts. When asked about the possibility of a 50-basis-point rate cut, Powell replied, 'This is not something we are currently considering. No decision has been made at this time.'

**Federal Reserve maintains rate at 5.25%-5.50% as risks come into better balance**
The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark interest rate at 5.25%-5.50% on Wednesday, citing a more balanced risk to its goals of stable prices and maximum employment. The committee acknowledged economic activity remains solid, but inflation remains 'somewhat elevated.' The statement suggests the Fed is now considering both inflation and employment risks, rather than solely focusing on inflation. This has led some analysts to believe a September rate cut is possible. The probability of a 25 basis-point rate cut has increased to 95.5%, while the odds of a 50-bp cut have dropped to 4.5%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference to provide more insight into the committee's decision. 'Chair Powell will now need to perform a delicate balancing act at the presser,' said David Alton Clark, 'Powell needs to signal the FOMC is open to a rate cut in September, yet still remain data dependent.'

**Fed Opens Door to Rate Cut in September, Citing Rising Unemployment**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has maintained its interest rates at their highest level in 20 years, but has opened the door to a potential cut in September, as it is now concerned about rising unemployment rather than just inflation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, 'If the conditions are met, the rate cut could occur as early as the September meeting.' He added, 'The general sentiment within the committee is that the economy is approaching the time when it will be appropriate to reduce our rates.' This would be the first rate cut since March 2020, when the COVID-19 crisis forced the Fed to lower interest rates to zero. The Fed is now considering a rate cut as the US economy is showing signs of slowing down, and the unemployment rate is expected to rise. The Fed's decision to maintain interest rates at 5.25-5.50% was made unanimously. The Fed is also concerned about the risks of inflation and unemployment, and is trying to balance these two aspects of its mandate. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for September 17-18, and Jerome Powell is expected to provide more details on the potential rate cut.

**Fed Holds Rates Steady, Signals September Cut Amid Cooling Inflation**
The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain interest rates at 5.25% to 5.5%, but signaled a potential rate cut in September due to easing inflation and a cooling labor market. The committee's post-meeting statement acknowledged the moderation in job gains and the slight rise in the unemployment rate, while noting that inflation remains 'somewhat elevated.' Economists and investors expect a rate cut in September, and the Fed will closely monitor labor market trends and inflation to achieve a balanced risk between inflation and employment. According to Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed's goal is to foster maximum employment, and the rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1% and the slowdown in hiring underscore the Fed's cautious stance. As inflation trends more favorably towards the 2% target, the September meeting is poised to be pivotal, with Powell's upcoming press conference being closely watched for further insights into the central bank's strategies.

**Federal Reserve Meeting: Interest Rates Unchanged, but Rate Cut in September Possible**
The Federal Reserve's meeting on July 31 is expected to keep interest rates unchanged, but investors are looking for signals that a reduction in rates is possible in September. According to ING strategists, the Fed will use this meeting to lay the groundwork for a rate cut in September. James Knightley, an economist, said, 'The next FOMC will be used to set the stage for a rate cut in September, while the Fed supports the need to move from a restrictive to a more neutral policy.' Some market observers, including former Fed President William Dudley and Mohamed El-Erian, have argued for a more aggressive easing of monetary policy than currently expected. The Fed is expected to maintain its interest rate at 5.25-5.5% and signal that a rate cut in September is becoming more likely. This would be the first rate cut since the pandemic in 2020. The meeting comes at a time of economic uncertainty, with the inflation rate increasing by 2.5% in the last year and the growth rate slowing down. Some economists have warned that maintaining high interest rates for too long could damage the labor market and shake the confidence of businesses and consumers.

**Fed Meeting: Will Interest Rates Be Cut in September?**
The Federal Reserve's (Fed) Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting on Tuesday to determine the US monetary policy, with analysts watching for a possible interest rate cut in September due to the persistent but moderate improvement in inflation. Most analysts expect the Fed to keep interest rates between 5.25% and 5.5%, their highest level since 2001. The focus will be on the press conference by Fed President Jerome Powell, who may provide hints about a possible first cut in September, marking the start of the new semester after the summer. This 0.25 percentage point cut would be in line with the conclusions of most Fed governors, who expect a cut before the end of the year if the data monitored by the issuer - inflation, GDP, and employment - remains on an appropriate track. According to Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, 'a modest 25 basis point cut in September seems probable, and if everything goes well, we could see an additional cut before the end of 2024.' James Knightley, chief economist at ING, notes that analysts should be paying attention to changes in the language of the Open Market Committee's statement, which would be an indicator of a cut in September, something that the data appears to support.

Thomas Urano, co-chief investment officer at Sage Advisory, said, 'The whisper expectation is for the Fed to acknowledge softness in inflation and the labor market and maybe acknowledge the potential for policy adjustment in September.' The rate futures market continues to price in a 67 bps rate cut in 2024, with some investors increasingly pricing in a 50 bps cut. Greg Wilensky, head of US fixed income at Janus Henderson Investors, said, 'The Fed will be responsive as to how the economy evolves as far as talking about a 50 basis-point cut.'

**Fed to Meet, Possible Interest Rate Cut in September on the Table**
The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (Fed) began its two-day meeting on Tuesday to determine the US monetary policy, with analysts expecting a possible interest rate cut in September due to the persistent but moderate improvement in inflation. The majority of analysts believe that the Fed's conclusions at the end of the meeting will not be surprising, and interest rates will remain in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, their highest level since 2001. The focus will be on the post-meeting press conference of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who may provide clues about a possible first cut in September, marking the start of the new semester after the summer. According to the majority of Fed governors, a quarter-point cut in September is expected, in line with the conclusions of the majority of governors, who expect a cut in interest rates before the end of the year if the data monitored by the issuer - inflation, GDP, and employment - remains on an appropriate path. As of now, inflation has been maintained on a moderate downward trend and, although it remains far from the 2% target, all indications suggest that the rate of improvement has responded consistently to high interest rates. 'A modest 25-basis-point cut in September seems likely, and if everything goes well, we could see an additional cut before the end of 2024,' said Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree.

**Fed Meeting May Signal Future Interest Rate Cut**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is set to hold a meeting today, which may signal a future cut in interest rates to combat high inflation. The Fed has kept interest rates high since last year, ranging from 5.25% to 5.50%, making credit more expensive for Americans. The institution is considering lowering rates in the coming months, but wants to ensure that price increases continue to slow down. The inflation rate has slightly decreased to 2.5% in June, down from 2.6% in May, according to the PCE index. Analysts at BPI expect the Fed to keep interest rates between 5.25% and 5.50% at the July meeting, with a potential first cut of 25 basis points after the summer. Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, predicts that the Fed will use this meeting to prepare for a potential first rate cut in September. Nathan Sheets, chief economist at Citi, notes that the process of disinflation is underway and suggests that the Fed should start the cycle of rate cuts in September. The September meeting is the last before the US presidential elections, which have recently seen a significant shift after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Despite high interest rates, the US economy remains solid, with the GDP growing at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter and the unemployment rate rising slightly to 4.1% in June, remaining among the lowest in the past 50 years.

However, some experts believe that investors' rate cut bets may be overly dovish, given the recent improvement in business activity and GDP growth. The next Fed meeting will provide fresh clues on the Fed's future course of action, with Chair Powell's conference expected to shed light on whether a September cut is indeed a done deal and what the plans are thereafter.

**US Fed Rate Cut on Radar, Will Bitcoin (BTC) Breakout In August?**
The US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on July 31 will be crucial for Bitcoin and the crypto market. The probability of a 25 bps rate cut in September is 85.8%. Analysts predict an eventual breakout above $70,000, but Bitcoin may need further macro help, such as lower inflation and projected Fed rate cuts, to trigger the upward rally. The US CPI report is scheduled for August 20. Meanwhile, precious metals like Gold and Silver may rally in August, with some analysts predicting Silver to reach $35 in 2-3 weeks and Gold to rally to $2,600 plus.

**US inflation trajectory is likely to favour policy rate cuts in September**
The US inflation trajectory is expected to favor policy rate cuts in September, driven by strong productivity growth, cooling labor markets, and decreasing inflation in the housing component. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the preferred measure of the Federal Reserve, has moderated significantly since its peak in 2022, driven by supply chain normalization, a healthy economic slowdown, and tighter monetary policy. The article discusses three main factors that sustain the outlook for inflation: strong productivity growth, cooling labor markets, and decreasing inflation in the housing component. The authors expect two 25 bps cuts in interest rates this year and subsequent 25 bps cuts every other policy meeting until early 2026, when rates should rest at 3.75-4%.

**Markets Expect 100% Chance of Rate Cut in September**
Investors are now 100% certain that the Federal Reserve will start reducing interest rates during its September meeting. According to 'Fed Watch' data, investors expect a 91.4% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut, an 8.4% chance of a 50-basis-point cut, and a very low chance of a 75-basis-point cut. For this month's meeting, the most likely scenario (93.3%) suggests that the interest rate will remain within the range of 5.25% to 5.50% without change, with a weak possibility of a 25-basis-point cut. Consumer Price Index data for June, released last week, showed a 0.1% decrease from the previous month, with an annual inflation rate of 3%, the lowest level in three years. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments yesterday reinforced investors' expectations, as he stated that policymakers will not wait until inflation reaches the target of 2% before cutting interest rates.
