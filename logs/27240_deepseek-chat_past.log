To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 50 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, current events, and probabilistic reasoning.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Current Context**: As of August 2024, Keir Starmer's approval rating has plummeted to 3% due to riots, anti-migrant protests, and criticism of his handling of crises. This is a significant drop from his post-election high of 36% in July 2024.
- **Historical Trends**: Approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers tend to decline after initial honeymoon periods, especially during crises. For example, Boris Johnson's approval ratings dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate scandal.
- **Base Rates**: Historically, approval ratings below 50% are common for UK Prime Ministers during crises or periods of public dissatisfaction. For instance, Theresa May's approval rating fell below 50% during the Brexit negotiations.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: Starmer's approval rating is currently at 3%, a historic low.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend shows a sharp decline from 36% in July to 3% in August, driven by riots, protests, and policy missteps.
3. **Future Events**: The next six weeks (until September 18) could see further developments, such as policy changes, economic shifts, or new crises, which could influence public opinion.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The current riots and protests are severe, and Starmer's handling has been criticized. This suggests continued low approval ratings.
- **Outside View**: Historically, approval ratings can recover if crises are resolved effectively or if new policies gain public support. However, recovery from such a low base (3%) is rare.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting**: Ignoring the severity of the current crises and the sharp decline in approval ratings would be a mistake.
- **Overreacting**: Assuming that the current low rating will persist indefinitely without considering potential policy changes or public sentiment shifts would also be a mistake.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Ongoing riots, protests, criticism of policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits), and public dissatisfaction.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for effective crisis management, policy adjustments, or external events that could shift public opinion.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend shows a rapid decline in approval ratings. If this trend continues, Starmer's approval rating is likely to remain below 50% on September 18, 2024.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a high degree of certainty that Starmer's approval rating will remain below 50% given the current context and trends. However, there is a small chance of recovery if significant positive developments occur.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- It is prudent to assign a high probability to the event (approval rating below 50%) but not absolute certainty, as unforeseen positive developments could occur.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that approval ratings can recover, but the current situation is extreme, making recovery unlikely in the short term.

### Final Forecast
Given the current approval rating of 3%, the sharp decline, and the ongoing crises, it is highly likely that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 50% on September 18, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.90%, but 98.00% being the most likely. Probability: 98.00%.**

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 50% on September 18, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
As of today (August 16, 2024), there are no publicly available predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus specifically addressing Starmer's approval rating on September 18, 2024. However, recent news articles and polling data provide insights into his current approval trajectory.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: Assess Starmer's current approval rating and trends.
2. **Historical Context**: Compare Starmer's situation to historical approval ratings of UK Prime Ministers in their first few months.
3. **External Factors**: Evaluate the impact of ongoing events (e.g., riots, policy decisions) on his approval.
4. **Trend Extrapolation**: Project the current trend forward to September 18, 2024.

### Step 3: Strike the Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, UK Prime Ministers often experience a "honeymoon period" followed by a decline in approval ratings. For example, Boris Johnson's approval dropped significantly after initial highs during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
- **Inside View**: Starmer's approval has plummeted from 36% in July 2024 to as low as 3% in early August due to riots, policy missteps (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits), and perceived poor handling of crises.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for Decline**: Multiple polls (Savanta, Opinium) show Starmer's approval dropping sharply in August 2024, with net approval as low as 3%. The riots and policy backlash are significant negative factors.
- **Counterevidence**: Starmer's initial approval was relatively high (36%), suggesting some residual goodwill. If the riots subside and policies stabilize, his approval could recover slightly.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, policy backlash, and public dissatisfaction with crisis management.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for policy adjustments, calming of riots, and public desire for stability.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- Starmer's approval has dropped from 36% in July to 3% in early August. If this trend continues linearly, his approval could remain below 50% by September 18, 2024.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- High confidence that his approval will remain below 50% given the current trajectory and lack of significant positive developments.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the trend is strongly negative, there is a small chance of recovery if external factors improve. However, this is unlikely to push his approval above 50%.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors and Avoid Hindsight Bias
- Historical patterns suggest that approval ratings rarely recover quickly after such sharp declines, especially in the absence of major positive events.

### Final Forecast
Given the current trajectory, historical patterns, and lack of countervailing positive forces, I estimate that Keir Starmer's approval rating on September 18, 2024, will almost certainly be below 50%.

**My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 30.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.**

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 50% on September 18, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here’s my reasoning:

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - As of August 16, 2024, Keir Starmer's approval rating has plummeted to 3% according to multiple sources (e.g., Opinium, Savanta). This is a significant drop from his post-election high of 36% in July 2024.
   - The Politico Poll of Polls, which aggregates reputable polling data, will be the definitive source for resolution. However, current trends suggest a sharp decline in approval due to recent events (e.g., riots, policy backlash).

### 2. **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
   - **Current Approval Rating:** Starmer's approval is at 3% as of August 2024, a historic low.
   - **Trend Analysis:** Approval ratings have been declining rapidly since July 2024, driven by riots, policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits), and perceived poor handling of crises.
   - **Timeframe:** From August 16 to September 18, 2024, is approximately one month. Given the steep decline, it is unlikely that Starmer's approval will recover significantly in such a short period.

### 3. **Balance Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Inside View:** Starmer's approval is currently at 3%, and the trend is downward. The riots and policy backlash have created a negative feedback loop.
   - **Outside View:** Historically, approval ratings for new PMs tend to stabilize or recover slightly after initial drops, but Starmer's situation is unusually severe. The base rate for such a steep decline recovering to above 50% within a month is extremely low.

### 4. **Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - The evidence of a 3% approval rating is strong and corroborated by multiple sources. Overreacting would involve assuming a miraculous recovery, which is not supported by historical trends or current events.

### 5. **Clashing Causal Forces**
   - **Negative Forces:** Riots, policy backlash, and public dissatisfaction are strong negative forces driving approval down.
   - **Positive Forces:** Potential government actions to address crises or improve public perception could stabilize or slightly improve ratings, but these are unlikely to outweigh the negative forces in such a short timeframe.

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - The current trend is a sharp decline. Extrapolating linearly, it is highly unlikely that Starmer's approval will rise above 50% by September 18, 2024.

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is minimal doubt that Starmer's approval will remain below 50% given the current data and trends. The only uncertainty is whether the question will be annulled if he is no longer PM by September 18.

### 8. **Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
   - Given the overwhelming evidence, it would be overconfident to predict a recovery above 50%. The data strongly supports a prediction below 50%.

### 9. **Learn from Errors**
   - Historical patterns show that approval ratings rarely recover from such lows in such a short time. Overestimating the likelihood of recovery would be a mistake.

### Final Forecast:
Given the current approval rating of 3%, the steep downward trend, and the lack of time for significant recovery, I predict that Keir Starmer's approval rating will almost certainly be below 50% on September 18, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 10.00%, but 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 95.00%.**

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 50 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical patterns, current trends, and the specific context provided by the news articles.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers tend to decline after the initial "honeymoon period." For example, Boris Johnson's approval rating dropped significantly after the initial vaccine rollout success. Similarly, Keir Starmer's approval rating has already shown a sharp decline from its peak in July 2024.
- **Current Polling Data**: As of August 2024, Starmer's approval rating has plummeted to 3% according to some polls, with others showing a net approval of -16. This suggests a significant decline in public support.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: Starmer's approval rating is currently very low, with some polls showing it at 3% and others at -16.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend since July 2024 has been sharply downward, driven by riots, protests, and criticism of his handling of key issues.
3. **Future Events**: The question is whether this trend will continue or stabilize by September 18, 2024.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The current situation is dire for Starmer, with riots, protests, and policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits) contributing to a sharp decline in approval.
- **Outside View**: Historically, approval ratings for new Prime Ministers tend to stabilize after initial declines, but the current situation is more severe than typical "honeymoon period" declines.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting Risk**: Ignoring the sharp decline in approval ratings and assuming a quick recovery.
- **Overreacting Risk**: Assuming the current low ratings will persist indefinitely without considering potential stabilization or recovery.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, protests, policy missteps, and public dissatisfaction.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for policy adjustments, public fatigue with protests, and possible stabilization of the political environment.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend is sharply downward, with no immediate signs of reversal. Extrapolating this trend suggests that Starmer's approval rating will remain below 50 by September 18, 2024.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a high degree of certainty that Starmer's approval rating will remain below 50, given the current trend and lack of positive catalysts.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the current trend strongly suggests a low approval rating, there is always a small chance of unexpected events that could improve public perception.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that approval ratings can stabilize, but the current situation is more severe than typical declines.

### Final Forecast
Given the current trend and the lack of positive catalysts, it is highly likely that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 50 on September 18, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 50 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical patterns, current trends, and the specific context provided by the news articles.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers tend to decline after the initial "honeymoon period." For example, Boris Johnson's approval rating dropped significantly after the initial vaccine rollout success. Similarly, Keir Starmer's approval rating has already shown a sharp decline from its peak in July 2024.
- **Current Polling Data**: As of August 2024, Starmer's approval rating has plummeted to 3% according to some polls, with others showing a net approval of -16. This suggests a significant decline in public support.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: Starmer's approval rating is currently very low, with some polls showing it at 3% and others at -16.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend since July 2024 has been sharply downward, driven by riots, protests, and criticism of his handling of key issues.
3. **Future Events**: The question is whether this trend will continue or stabilize by September 18, 2024.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The current situation is dire for Starmer, with riots, protests, and policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits) contributing to a sharp decline in approval.
- **Outside View**: Historically, approval ratings for new Prime Ministers tend to stabilize after initial declines, but the current situation is more severe than typical "honeymoon period" declines.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting Risk**: Ignoring the sharp decline in approval ratings and assuming a quick recovery.
- **Overreacting Risk**: Assuming the current low ratings will persist indefinitely without considering potential stabilization or recovery.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, protests, policy missteps, and public dissatisfaction.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for policy adjustments, public fatigue with protests, and possible stabilization of the political environment.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend is sharply downward, with no immediate signs of reversal. Extrapolating this trend suggests that Starmer's approval rating will remain below 50 by September 18, 2024.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a high degree of certainty that Starmer's approval rating will remain below 50, given the current trend and lack of positive catalysts.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the current trend strongly suggests a low approval rating, there is always a small chance of unexpected events that could improve public perception.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that approval ratings can stabilize, but the current situation is more severe than typical declines.

### Final Forecast
Given the current trend and the lack of positive catalysts, it is highly likely that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 50 on September 18, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 50% on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, current events, and probabilistic reasoning.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers tend to decline after the initial "honeymoon period" post-election. For example, Boris Johnson's approval rating dropped from around 60% in early 2020 to below 50% within a year. Tony Blair, despite a strong start, saw his approval ratings fluctuate significantly over time.
- **Current Context**: Keir Starmer's approval rating has already shown significant volatility. After a strong start (36% approval in July 2024), it plummeted to as low as 3% in early August 2024 due to riots, protests, and criticism of his handling of crises. Recent polls suggest some recovery, but the trend remains downward.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: As of August 2024, Starmer's approval rating is reported to be around 35% (Opinium poll), down from earlier highs.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend is downward, driven by public dissatisfaction with his handling of riots, protests, and policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits).
3. **Future Events**: The next six weeks (until September 18, 2024) could see further developments, such as economic announcements, policy implementations, or new crises, which could influence public opinion.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historical trends suggest that approval ratings for new Prime Ministers often stabilize or decline after initial highs. Given Starmer's current challenges, a further decline is plausible.
- **Inside View**: Starmer's specific challenges (riots, protests, unpopular policies) are severe and could continue to weigh on his approval ratings. However, his government may take corrective actions to regain public trust.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting Risk**: Ignoring the severity of the current crises and their impact on public opinion could lead to underestimating the likelihood of a sub-50% approval rating.
- **Overreacting Risk**: Assuming that the current low ratings will persist indefinitely without considering potential recovery efforts could lead to overestimating the likelihood.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Public dissatisfaction with crisis management, unpopular policies, and potential economic challenges.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential government actions to address crises, policy adjustments, and public fatigue with protests.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current downward trend continues, Starmer's approval rating could fall below 50% by September 18, 2024. However, linear extrapolation may not account for potential stabilization or recovery efforts.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the potential for new events (positive or negative) to influence public opinion. The range of possible outcomes is wide.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the volatility of approval ratings and the potential for rapid changes, it is prudent to assign a wide probability range rather than a single point estimate.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical forecasting errors often arise from over-reliance on recent trends without considering potential turning points. Balancing trend analysis with scenario planning is crucial.

### Final Forecast
Considering the current downward trend, historical patterns, and the potential for recovery efforts, I estimate that there is a **65% probability** that Keir Starmer's approval rating will be less than 50% on September 18, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.**
