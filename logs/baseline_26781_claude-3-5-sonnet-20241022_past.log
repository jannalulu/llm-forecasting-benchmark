Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Time horizon: This is a short-term forecast (about 2 months from now until October 1, 2024)

2. Historical context:
- Ruto was elected in 2022 and his term runs until 2027
- Kenya has never had a successful presidential impeachment
- While Kenya has faced political instability, it hasn't had a successful coup since independence
- Constitutional mechanisms for removal are complex and time-consuming

3. Current situation:
- While there has been some opposition and protests against Ruto's policies
- No immediate constitutional crisis
- Military appears loyal to civilian leadership
- No serious impeachment proceedings underway
- Opposition is active but lacks numbers for constitutional removal

4. Risk factors:
- Economic challenges and public dissatisfaction
- Regional instability
- Historical precedent of political violence
- Health/accident risks (though Ruto appears healthy)

5. Mitigating factors:
- Short timeframe (2 months)
- Strong institutional frameworks
- International support for stability
- Recent election legitimacy

Given the short timeframe and lack of immediate serious threats to his presidency, the probability is low but not zero due to unforeseen circumstances.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 3.75%, with 1.25% being the most likely. Probability: 1.25%.
