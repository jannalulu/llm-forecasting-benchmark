**San Luis Potosí Reports No Cases of Mpox Clade I Variant**
The National Epidemiological Surveillance Committee (CONAVE) in Mexico has issued an epidemiological alert regarding the Mpox clade I variant. The Secretary of Health in San Luis Potosí, Ymuri Vaca Avila, stated that the goal is to have medical units across the country monitor and report probable cases to reduce the spread of the disease and provide timely medical attention to those infected. According to Avila, there have been no cases of the Mpox clade I variant in San Luis Potosí this year, and only 10 cases were reported in 2022 and 5 in 2023. The symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and skin lesions, which can appear on the face, hands, and other parts of the body. To confirm a case, a positive result from a real-time PCR test or identification of samples analyzed by the Mexican Institute of Public Health (InDRE) is required. Avila recommended that the population frequently wash their hands, cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoid sharing food and drinks, and use face masks when near an infected person. She also advised to clean and disinfect areas where an infected person has been, avoid close contact, and properly dispose of contaminated items.

**Mexico's Mpox Cases: A Growing Concern**
As of 2024, there have been 49 confirmed cases of mpox (monkeypox) in Mexico, with none of the new clade 1 or clade 1b strain, but rather clade II. Of these 49 cases, 47 are men and 2 are women. The 49 confirmed cases of mpox were derived from 212 suspected cases. The 11 states with mpox cases are led by Mexico City, which accounts for over 50% of the cases, followed by Quintana Roo and Jalisco. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) was declared on August 14, 2024. The Mexican Ministry of Health recommends reporting suspected cases to 5519469772 or censida@salud.gob.mx. The ministry also explained the two phases of the disease, which can last from two to four weeks. The first phase includes symptoms such as fever, headache, and muscle pain. The second phase, which appears two to three days after the onset of symptoms, is characterized by the appearance of blisters on the face and then on the rest of the body. To prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to avoid contact with others, frequently wash hands, wear a mask, avoid sharing food and utensils, and disinfect areas where the infected person has been. Activists in Mexico are demanding the application of existing vaccines, but the federal government has ignored their requests, citing a 'mediocre' effect, despite other countries applying them to vulnerable groups.

**Mexico Issues Epidemiological Alert for Mpox, Confirms 49 Cases**
The Mexican Ministry of Health (Ssa) has issued an epidemiological alert for the mpox disease, also known as monkeypox, and has confirmed 49 cases in the country in 2024. This is in response to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation to declare a public health emergency of international concern due to the monkeypox outbreak. The National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (Conave) has issued the alert to request that medical units across the country monitor and report suspected cases. Conave stated that the goal of the alert is to reduce the chains of transmission and provide timely medical attention to infected individuals. As of August 3, the Epidemiological Surveillance System has identified 212 probable cases in 2024, with 49 confirmed cases distributed across 11 states. The only clade identified in the analyzed cases is clade II, and no new variant clade 1b has been detected. According to Conave, 'Our country has a Response Plan for the management of mpox that includes actions of national response coordination; community involvement, empowerment, and participation; diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, comprehensive care, and risk communication; the plan is updated according to the current requirements of the ESPII and is activated upon the epidemiological alert.' The committee also called on citizens to report suspected cases through the phone number 5519469772 or the email censida@salud.gob.mx. Mpox is a zoonosis, a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans, and is caused by the virus of the smallpox-like disease. According to the WHO and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the disease is primarily transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected animal blood, bodily fluids, skin lesions, or mucous membranes. Secondary transmission from person to person can occur through close contact with infected respiratory secretions, skin lesions, or objects that have recently come into contact with infected fluids or materials. Mpox can also be transmitted through inoculation or through the placenta, resulting in congenital smallpox, as stated by the WHO. Symptoms of mpox include a skin rash that can appear on hands, feet, face, mouth, chest, or near the genitals, which can progress through various stages, including scabs, before healing. In the initial stages, the rash may appear as pimples or blisters, causing pain and itching, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

**Mexican Ministry of Health Issues Alert on mpox**
The Mexican Ministry of Health has issued a new alert regarding the mpox virus, formerly known as monkeypox. The alert emphasizes the importance of maintaining rigorous epidemiological surveillance in response to the increase in outbreaks in Africa and the potential threat of a new variant. According to the authorities, there have been 212 probable and 49 confirmed cases of mpox in 11 federal entities of Mexico since the beginning of 2024. Although Mexico has not identified the new clade 1b variant circulating in Africa, health authorities remain on high alert for the possibility of its introduction into the country. 'The goal of the alert is for medical units across the country to vigilantly monitor and report probable cases to reduce the chains of transmission and provide timely medical attention to infected individuals,' the Ministry of Health stated in the alert. The alert emphasizes the need for medical personnel to strictly follow epidemiological surveillance actions and ensure timely attention to patients. The presence of outbreaks in Africa, associated with a different variant from 2022, increases the risk of incidence for Mexico, it affirms. The Mexican Response Plan for mpox, which includes national coordination, community participation, and epidemiological surveillance, is updated in accordance with the requirements of the Public Health Emergency of International Importance (PHEIC). Mpox presents in two clinical phases: the first, lasting between five days, includes symptoms such as fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle pain. The second phase is characterized by the appearance of blisters and rash, which usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. In the event of symptoms, the Ministry of Health recommends the following to the general population: frequent handwashing with soap and water or alcohol gel, covering the nose and mouth with the inside of the elbow when coughing or sneezing, avoiding sharing food, drinks, utensils, and plates, washing clothes, towels, eating utensils, and bedding that have come into contact with an infected person, cleaning and disinfecting areas where an infected person has been, avoiding contact with lesions, and seeking medical attention and avoiding contact with others if symptoms are present.

The confirmed cases in Mexico have only been identified as clade II, with no cases of the new clade 1b variant detected. The country has a Response Plan for Mpox, which includes coordination, community involvement, diagnosis, and communication. The plan is updated according to the current requirements of the International Public Health Emergency of Importance (ESPII), which has been activated in response to the alert. The symptoms of Mpox typically last for two to four weeks and include fever, intense headache, swollen lymph nodes, back pain, muscle pain, and a lack of energy. The disease progresses in two stages, with the first stage characterized by fever, headache, and swollen lymph nodes, and the second stage marked by the appearance of small blisters and a rash that spreads from the face to the rest of the body. The Ministry of Health recommends that the general population take precautions such as frequent handwashing, covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoiding sharing food and drinks, and wearing medical masks. They also recommend washing and disinfecting clothing, utensils, and bedding that have come into contact with an infected person, and avoiding contact with lesions and other people if symptoms are present.
