To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here's my reasoning:

### 1. **Base Rate Analysis (Outside View)**
   - Historically, month-over-month core CPI increases in the US have rarely been 0.0% or less. Over the past decade, such occurrences have been infrequent, typically during periods of economic downturns or significant disinflationary pressures.
   - Recent trends (e.g., July 2024 core CPI at +0.2%) suggest that inflation is moderating but remains slightly positive. The base rate for a 0.0% or negative core CPI reading is low, likely below 10%.

### 2. **Current Trends and Data (Inside View)**
   - **July 2024 Data**: Core CPI increased by 0.2% month-over-month, matching expectations. This suggests that inflationary pressures are easing but remain persistent, particularly in categories like shelter and services.
   - **August 2024 Expectations**: Based on recent reports, inflation is expected to continue moderating, but there is no strong evidence of a sharp decline to 0.0% or below. The Federal Reserve's focus on core inflation and its target of 2% suggests that further disinflation is likely, but not to the extent of a flat or negative reading in August.
   - **Labor Market and Economic Activity**: The labor market is softening, with unemployment rising to 4.3% in July. This could exert downward pressure on inflation, but the effect is likely gradual rather than immediate.

### 3. **Clashing Causal Forces**
   - **Downward Pressures**: 
     - Declining energy prices (e.g., fuel prices fell 3.8% in June).
     - Softening labor market and rising unemployment.
     - Slowing shelter inflation, which has been a major driver of core CPI.
   - **Upward Pressures**:
     - Persistent service inflation, particularly in categories like medical care and auto insurance.
     - Housing costs, while moderating, remain elevated.

### 4. **Adjustments and Balancing Evidence**
   - While downward pressures are present, they are unlikely to push core CPI to 0.0% or below in August. The base rate and current trends suggest a continuation of modest positive inflation.
   - The probability of a 0.0% or negative reading is low but not negligible, given the softening labor market and moderating inflation trends.

### 5. **Final Probability Estimate**
   - Based on the above analysis, I estimate the probability of core CPI being 0.0% or less in August 2024 to be **15%**. This reflects the low base rate, current trends, and the balance of clashing causal forces.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here's my reasoning:

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - I do not have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this exact question. However, I can infer market expectations and expert opinions from the provided news articles.

### 2. **Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems**
   - **Sub-problem 1:** What is the historical trend of core CPI month-over-month changes?
   - **Sub-problem 2:** What are the current economic conditions and their impact on inflation?
   - **Sub-problem 3:** What are the latest data points and expert forecasts for August 2024?

### 3. **Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Outside View:** Historically, core CPI month-over-month changes have been positive, with occasional dips. For example, in July 2024, core CPI increased by 0.2% MoM, and in June 2024, it increased by 0.1% MoM. The base rate for core CPI MoM changes being 0.0% or less is relatively low.
   - **Inside View:** Current economic conditions, such as moderating inflation trends, softening labor market data, and expectations of Fed rate cuts, suggest that inflationary pressures are easing. However, shelter costs and other persistent factors (e.g., auto insurance) continue to exert upward pressure.

### 4. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - The latest data (July 2024) shows core CPI at 0.2% MoM, which is in line with expectations. The trend over the past few months has been a gradual moderation in inflation, but not a sharp decline. Overreacting to a single month's data (e.g., July's 0.2%) would be unwise, but the trend is informative.

### 5. **Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work**
   - **Downward Forces:** Moderating inflation, softening labor market, declining energy prices, and expectations of Fed rate cuts.
   - **Upward Forces:** Persistent shelter costs, rising auto insurance prices, and potential supply chain disruptions.

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - The trend over the past few months has been a gradual moderation in core CPI, with MoM changes hovering around 0.1% to 0.2%. Extrapolating this trend suggests that August 2024 core CPI is likely to remain in this range.

### 7. **Strive to Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a small but non-negligible chance that core CPI could dip to 0.0% or below, given the softening economic conditions and downward pressure on inflation. However, the base rate and current trends suggest this is unlikely.

### 8. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence**
   - While the probability of core CPI being 0.0% or less is low, it is not zero. I will assign a small but meaningful probability to this outcome.

### 9. **Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
   - Potential errors include overestimating the impact of softening labor market data or underestimating the persistence of shelter costs. I will adjust my forecast to account for these risks.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above reasoning, I estimate that the probability of the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 being 0.0% or less is **15%**. This reflects the low base rate for such an event, the current moderating trend, and the persistent upward pressures from shelter and other costs.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, recent data, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, month-over-month core CPI increases of 0.0% or less are relatively rare. Over the past decade, such occurrences have been infrequent, typically during periods of economic slowdown or deflationary pressures.
- **Recent Trends**: The July 2024 core CPI increased by 0.2%, consistent with the trend of moderate inflation. The core CPI has been gradually decelerating, with year-over-year core CPI at 3.2% in July, down from 3.3% in June.
- **Market Expectations**: The market is pricing in a high probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, suggesting that inflation is expected to remain subdued.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
- **Economic Indicators**: Key indicators such as shelter costs, energy prices, and labor market conditions will influence core CPI. Shelter costs, a significant component, rose by 0.4% in July, but other components like used cars and airfares saw declines.
- **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Fed's stance on interest rates, influenced by inflation and labor market data, will impact inflationary pressures. A rate cut in September could signal further easing of inflation.
- **Global Economic Conditions**: External factors such as global supply chain stability and commodity prices will also play a role.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: Recent data shows a gradual deceleration in core CPI, with some components like shelter costs still exerting upward pressure. However, other components are showing signs of moderation.
- **Outside View**: Historically, month-over-month core CPI increases of 0.0% or less are rare, especially in a growing economy. The current trend suggests a continuation of moderate inflation rather than deflation.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Lower Inflation**: The deceleration in core CPI, particularly in components like used cars and airfares, supports the case for lower inflation. The Fed's potential rate cut also indicates a dovish stance.
- **Evidence for Stable or Slightly Higher Inflation**: Shelter costs, a significant component, continue to rise, and labor market conditions, while softening, are not yet weak enough to trigger deflationary pressures.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Upward Pressure**: Shelter costs, which account for a large portion of core CPI, are still rising. Labor market conditions, while softening, are not yet weak enough to significantly reduce wage pressures.
- **Downward Pressure**: Declines in used car prices, airfares, and other components are contributing to the deceleration in core CPI. The Fed's potential rate cut could further ease inflationary pressures.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- **Current Trend**: The core CPI has been increasing at a moderate pace, with a 0.2% increase in July. The trend suggests a continuation of moderate inflation rather than a sharp decline.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- **Confidence Level**: Given the rarity of month-over-month core CPI increases of 0.0% or less and the current trend of moderate inflation, the probability of such an event is low but not negligible.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- **Prudence**: While the evidence suggests a low probability of a 0.0% or less increase, it is important to acknowledge the possibility, especially given the Fed's dovish stance and potential economic slowdown.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors and Avoid Hindsight Bias
- **Historical Errors**: Overestimating the likelihood of deflationary pressures has been a common error in past forecasts. It is important to balance the evidence and not overreact to short-term trends.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, the most likely scenario is a continuation of moderate inflation, with a month-over-month core CPI increase of around 0.2%. The probability of a 0.0% or less increase is low but not negligible.

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.**

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here's my reasoning:

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - I do not have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this exact question. However, I can infer market expectations from the news articles provided, which suggest a general trend of moderating inflation and expectations of a 0.2% MoM increase in core CPI for July 2024. This trend is likely to continue into August.

### 2. **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
   - **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, core CPI MoM increases of 0.0% or less are rare. Over the past decade, core CPI has rarely fallen to 0.0% or below, except during extreme economic disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - **Trend Analysis**: Recent data shows a consistent trend of core CPI increasing by 0.1% to 0.2% MoM, with July 2024 reporting a 0.2% increase. This suggests a stable, albeit slowing, inflationary environment.
   - **Economic Indicators**: The labor market is softening, with rising unemployment (4.3% in July 2024), and the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates in September. These factors could exert downward pressure on inflation but are unlikely to cause a sudden drop to 0.0% or below.

### 3. **Balance Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the probability of core CPI MoM being 0.0% or less is low, likely in the range of 10-20%.
   - **Inside View**: Current trends and economic indicators suggest a continuation of modest inflation, with a 0.1% to 0.2% MoM increase in core CPI for August 2024. The likelihood of a 0.0% or less increase is slightly higher than the historical base rate but still relatively low.

### 4. **Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - While recent data shows inflation moderating, there is no evidence of a sharp decline that would push core CPI to 0.0% or below. Overreacting to the possibility of a rate cut or labor market softening would be premature.

### 5. **Clashing Causal Forces**
   - **Downward Forces**: Softening labor market, potential rate cuts, and moderating shelter prices.
   - **Upward Forces**: Persistent inflation in categories like auto insurance and medical care, as well as the lagged effects of previous price increases.

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - Core CPI has been increasing by 0.1% to 0.2% MoM. Extrapolating this trend suggests a similar increase for August 2024, making a 0.0% or less increase unlikely.

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a small but non-negligible chance (10-20%) that core CPI could be 0.0% or less, driven by unexpected economic shocks or data revisions. However, the most likely outcome is a 0.1% to 0.2% increase.

### 8. **Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
   - While the historical base rate and current trends suggest a low probability of 0.0% or less, I will not rule it out entirely, given the uncertainty in economic conditions.

### 9. **Learn from Errors**
   - Past errors in forecasting inflation have often stemmed from underestimating the persistence of inflationary pressures or overestimating the impact of economic shocks. I will avoid overconfidence in either direction.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 being 0.0% or less is low but not negligible. The most likely outcome is a 0.1% to 0.2% increase.

### 4. **Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - While recent data shows inflation moderating, there is no evidence of a sharp decline that would push core CPI to 0.0% or below. Overreacting to the possibility of a rate cut or labor market softening would be premature.

### 5. **Clashing Causal Forces**
   - **Downward Forces**: Softening labor market, potential rate cuts, and moderating shelter prices.
   - **Upward Forces**: Persistent inflation in categories like auto insurance and medical care, as well as the lagged effects of previous price increases.

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - Core CPI has been increasing by 0.1% to 0.2% MoM. Extrapolating this trend suggests a similar increase for August 2024, making a 0.0% or less increase unlikely.

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a small but non-negligible chance (10-20%) that core CPI could be 0.0% or less, driven by unexpected economic shocks or data revisions. However, the most likely outcome is a 0.1% to 0.2% increase.

### 8. **Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
   - While the historical base rate and current trends suggest a low probability of 0.0% or less, I will not rule it out entirely, given the uncertainty in economic conditions.

### 9. **Learn from Errors**
   - Past errors in forecasting inflation have often stemmed from underestimating the persistence of inflationary pressures or overestimating the impact of economic shocks. I will avoid overconfidence in either direction.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 being 0.0% or less is low but not negligible. The most likely outcome is a 0.1% to 0.2% increase.

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.**

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here's my reasoning:

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - I do not have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this exact question. However, I can infer market expectations from the news articles provided, which suggest a general trend of moderating inflation and expectations of a 0.2% MoM increase in core CPI for July 2024. This trend is likely to continue into August.

### 2. **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
   - **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, core CPI MoM increases of 0.0% or less are rare. Over the past decade, core CPI has rarely fallen to 0.0% or below, except during extreme economic disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - **Trend Analysis**: Recent data shows a consistent trend of core CPI increasing by 0.1% to 0.2% MoM, with July 2024 reporting a 0.2% increase. This suggests a stable, albeit slowing, inflationary environment.
   - **Economic Indicators**: The labor market is softening, with rising unemployment (4.3% in July 2024), and the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates in September. These factors could exert downward pressure on inflation but are unlikely to cause a sudden drop to 0.0% or below.

### 3. **Balance Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the probability of core CPI MoM being 0.0% or less is low, likely in the range of 10-20%.
   - **Inside View**: Current trends and economic indicators suggest a continuation of modest inflation, with a 0.1% to 0.2% MoM increase in core CPI for August 2024. The likelihood of a 0.0% or less increase is slightly higher than the historical base rate but still relatively low.

To forecast whether the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 will be 0.0% or less, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, recent data, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, month-over-month core CPI increases have been positive in most months, with occasional dips. Over the past year, core CPI has consistently increased by 0.1% to 0.3% monthly, with only a few instances of 0.0% or negative changes.
- **Recent Trends**: In July 2024, core CPI increased by 0.2%, matching expectations. The trend over the past few months has been a gradual moderation in inflation, with core CPI rising at a slower pace compared to earlier in 2024.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
- **Economic Indicators**: Key drivers of core CPI include shelter costs, which have been rising but at a slower pace, and other services like healthcare and transportation, which have shown mixed trends.
- **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Fed has signaled a potential rate cut in September, which could influence inflation expectations. However, the immediate impact on August CPI is likely minimal.
- **Energy and Food Prices**: While excluded from core CPI, energy prices can indirectly affect core inflation through transportation and production costs. Recent energy price trends have been relatively stable.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: Recent data suggests a continuation of the moderation trend, with core CPI likely to increase by 0.1% to 0.2% in August.
- **Outside View**: Historical base rates indicate that a 0.0% or negative change is rare but not impossible, especially given the current economic conditions and the Fed's focus on inflation control.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Recent News**: Articles from August 2024 highlight a cooling inflation trend, with core CPI easing for the fourth consecutive month. This supports the view that inflation is moderating but does not suggest a sharp decline.
- **Risk of Overreaction**: While the trend is downward, the likelihood of a 0.0% or negative change is still low, given the persistent upward pressure from shelter costs.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Upward Forces**: Shelter costs, which account for a significant portion of core CPI, continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace.
- **Downward Forces**: Weakening consumer demand and moderating price increases in other categories, such as used cars and airfares, are contributing to the overall moderation.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- **Trend Analysis**: If the current moderation trend continues, core CPI is likely to increase by 0.1% to 0.2% in August, similar to July.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- **Confidence Level**: Given the consistency of recent data and the historical base rates, I am moderately confident in my forecast.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- **Prudence vs. Decisiveness**: While the trend suggests a continuation of moderation, I will not overstate the likelihood of a 0.0% or negative change, as it remains a low-probability event.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- **Hindsight Bias**: I will avoid over-relying on recent data and ensure that my forecast is grounded in both historical trends and current conditions.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, the most likely scenario is a 0.1% to 0.2% increase in core CPI for August 2024. The probability of a 0.0% or negative change is low but not negligible.
