*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are. October 2nd, 2024. The question on everyone's mind: Did the CDC's risk assessment for mpox exceed "Low"?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.25%. The latest data up to August 23 didn't indicate a significant shift in risk factors. 

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The CDC's update from July 8 still pegged the risk as "Very Low," and the situation in Sub-Saharan Africa didn’t escalate as some feared.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models accounted for the potential spread, but the probability remained low. The public health measures were effective.

**NATE SILVER:** So, a sigh of relief for now. But the vigilance continues.

*They exchange nods, acknowledging the complexity of forecasting in a world of uncertainties.*

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers in hand.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the CDC's assessment on mpox risk didn't change. Our models predicted a low probability of that happening.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right, Nate. Our models had it at 15.23%. The risk remained "Very Low," just as we expected.

**NATE SILVER:** Given the recent spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, there was some concern, but the U.S. population's immunity and the pathogen's low infectiousness kept the risk down.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The CDC's July assessment held strong. No surprises here.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a testament to the accuracy of our forecasting models. Another win for data-driven predictions.

*They both nod, satisfied, as the camera fades out.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did the CDC's risk assessment for mpox exceed "Low" before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 23.45%. Given the data up to August 23rd, the situation in Sub-Saharan Africa didn’t escalate as feared.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and the CDC maintained their "Very Low" assessment. It seems the containment measures were effective.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The models, as always, proved reliable. This was a low-probability event, and the numbers reflected that.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the robustness of predictive analytics. Until next time.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 12.34%. Given the CDC's July assessment and the limited spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, it seemed unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the "Very Low" risk in July was a strong indicator. Plus, the population's immunity and effective treatments played a big role.
