Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Vingegaard is currently 3rd in GC, 1:14 behind Pogacar
- He has just won Stage 11, showing strong form
- He's recovered well from his April crash injuries

2. Historical Context:
- Vingegaard won Tour de France in 2022 and 2023
- He has proven ability to overcome deficits against Pogacar
- Strong team support from Visma-Lease a Bike

3. Positive Factors:
- Recent Stage 11 victory shows excellent form
- Psychological boost from beating Pogacar in sprint
- Strong recovery from serious injuries
- Experience in winning Tour de France
- Still relatively early in the race with key mountain stages ahead

4. Negative Factors:
- Currently trailing Pogacar by 1:14 in GC
- Coming back from serious crash in April
- Pogacar showing strong form
- Uncertain impact of recovery on three-week endurance

5. Key Considerations:
- Mountain stages yet to come where gaps typically form
- Proven ability to perform in third week
- Strong team support
- Recent demonstration of competitive form

Looking at all these factors, Vingegaard has shown he's recovered well and is competitive, but faces a significant challenge in overcoming Pogacar's lead. His recent stage win demonstrates he has the form to compete, but the time gap is substantial.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.25% being the most likely. Probability: 40.25%
