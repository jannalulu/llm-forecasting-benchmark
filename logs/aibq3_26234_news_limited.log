**US Avian Influenza Outbreak: A Growing Concern for Human Health**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported cases of avian influenza H5 in wild and domestic birds, as well as commercial and recreational poultry, since January 2022. Over 97 million birds have been affected, with 1,161 outbreaks detected in 48 states. The virus has also infected cattle, with the first cases reported in Texas in March. The CDC has stated that the risk to the US population remains 'low'. A fourth person, in Colorado, has been infected with avian influenza in relation to an outbreak in cattle, according to health authorities. The CDC has emphasized the importance of monitoring and testing for the virus, as well as developing vaccines and treatments. Experts are concerned that the current surveillance efforts may not be sufficient to detect new outbreaks, and that the virus could potentially spread to humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low, but that it is essential to be prepared for a potential pandemic. The US and Europe are stockpiling doses of pre-pandemic flu vaccine, and some countries are taking measures to protect their populations, such as vaccinating workers in the poultry industry.

**Avian Influenza H5N1: A Growing Public Health Concern**
A recent study revealed that the H5N1 avian influenza virus poses a 'greater risk to public health'. The virus, which affects birds and is caused by the Orthomyxoviridae virus, can be classified as low-pathogenicity, causing mild or asymptomatic disease, or high-pathogenicity, causing severe disease that can spread rapidly. According to the CDC, from March 2024 to now, there have been 1,390 people monitored, 60 people tested for the new influenza A, and 4 cases of avian influenza H5 identified. The CDC has various surveillance systems to monitor key indicators of influenza. In the US, there have been 5 reported cases of avian influenza in humans, with the first case occurring in 2022 after exposure to supposedly infected poultry.

**Mexico Concludes Avian Influenza Emergency After Eight Weeks Without Virus**
Mexico has concluded the sanitary emergency for avian influenza, declared in December, after experts confirmed the absence of the virus in wild birds, backyard farms, and technological units for eight weeks. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development announced the conclusion of the National Animal Health Emergency Device (Dinesa) for avian influenza AH5N1, activated in December to protect the national poultry industry. The report showed that between September 26, 2023, and May 3, 2024, 20 cases of avian influenza were confirmed in the country, with 90% of them in wild birds and backyard farms, and only two technological farms affected in Ciudad Obregón, Sonora. The authorities emphasized that the controlled application of 67.6 million doses of emergency vaccines against AH5N1 was authorized in 324 poultry production units in six states, and that the country remains free of the disease, having recovered the condition of being a zone free of avian influenza AH5N1 from the World Organization for Animal Health (OMSA) on May 13, 2024.

**WHO Warns of Global Avian Flu Epidemic as Virus Spreads to Mammals**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the alarm about the avian flu, which has been declared a 'global epizootia'. The epidemic, which began in 2020, peaked two years later, with over 131 million deaths of domestic poultry in 67 countries on five continents. The WHO is concerned about the virus's ability to infect and kill new species, including mammals, and the potential for transmission to humans. In February, a highly pathogenic A(H5N1) outbreak occurred in dairy cow farms in the US, which alerted health authorities. The number of infected cows has continued to increase, with 101 farms affected in 12 states, although the number of deaths has been 'minimal'. The CDC confirmed that a person had been diagnosed with avian flu, a rare occurrence that had previously only happened in Hong Kong in 1997. The person had not been in contact with birds, but had been in contact with dairy cows. The CDC is investigating the cases, but the exact mechanism of transmission is still unclear. The WHO is concerned about the potential for the virus to jump to humans and is urging caution. The situation is particularly concerning because the virus has already infected over 40 species of mammals that are not typically infected with this type of virus. The WHO is working to develop a vaccine and is urging countries to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Mexico becomes first victim of H5N2 avian influenza; WHO sounds alarm over new pandemic**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first human death from H5N2 avian influenza in Mexico. The case was identified on May 23rd in a resident of the State of Mexico, who was hospitalized in the capital. Authorities are still investigating the origin of the contagion. Although avian influenza poses a potential risk to public health, the risk to the general population is currently considered low, according to official information. The WHO has also announced the extension of a 12-month deadline to achieve a treaty aimed at preparing the world for future pandemics, after failing to reach a definitive agreement this year. The treaty aims to define more clearly when to declare a 'pandemic' and establish commitments to solidarity and equity in access to medical products and financing during health emergencies.

**US Sees Surge in Avian Influenza Cases Among Humans**
The United States is experiencing a surge in cases of avian influenza among humans, with a fourth American case reported in Colorado. The rapid evolution of the virus and its ability to cross species barriers quickly have raised concerns that it could spread from person to person. The World Health Organization's scientific director, Jeremy Farrar, has expressed 'enormous concern' about the global spread of the virus. The increase in human cases is largely due to the rapid spread of the infection among animals, which increases the likelihood of a new avian influenza virus emerging in the human population. The H5N1 subtype, a current variant of avian influenza, is capable of mutating over time and exchanging genes with other infecting viruses, accelerating the phenomenon. The Colorado resident recently infected with the virus presented mild symptoms, primarily conjunctivitis, and had direct contact with infected cows. The state of Colorado is the most affected, with over a quarter of its cattle herds containing cases of avian influenza, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health. Meanwhile, the virus continues to destroy poultry farms, with the Iowa producers having lost 23.3 million birds since 2022, and the US Department of Agriculture estimating that the virus has caused the death of 96.6 million birds nationwide. Europe is not currently affected by this surge in avian influenza cases, as the virus has strongly receded this year, with the total number of detections on the continent being the lowest since the 2019-2020 epidemiological year.

**Scientists Warn of Potential Pandemic as Avian Influenza Spreads**
Scientists monitoring the spread of avian influenza are increasingly concerned that gaps in surveillance could leave them several steps behind a new pandemic, according to interviews with over a dozen leading experts in infectious diseases. The new subtype of avian influenza H5N1 in migratory birds since 2020 has raised concerns about its potential to become transmissible between humans. Infections have also been found in other mammals, including alpacas and domestic cats. 'It seems like a pandemic is developing slowly', said Scott Hensley, professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. 'At this moment, the threat is quite low... but that could change in the blink of an eye'. The sooner a jump to humans is detected, the sooner global health authorities can take measures to protect the population by developing vaccines, large-scale testing, and containment measures. However, the US federal surveillance of dairy farms is limited to testing before crossing state borders, while state-level testing efforts are inconsistent, and testing of people exposed to sick animals is scarce, said health officials and experts on pandemic flu. 'We need to know which farms are positive, how many cows are positive, how the virus spreads, for how long these cows remain infectious, and the exact route of transmission', said Dutch flu expert Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low because there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, some experts warn that there are sufficient concerns to start preparing for a possible human outbreak, although the triggers for taking action differ depending on the role played in the response, said Richard Hatchett, executive director of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The CEPI aims to create a library of vaccine prototypes for pandemic pathogens, which would help pharmaceutical companies start large-scale production and distribute vaccines where needed within 100 days of an outbreak.

**New evidence sheds light on health emergency as virus rapidly spreads and evolves — here's what you need to know**
A new report highlights the rapid spread and evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which has been detected in dairy cows in the United States. The virus has spread globally, with rising global temperatures playing a significant role in its prevalence and emergence of new variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that other animals impacted by the virus include swans, foxes, bears, alpacas, and sea lions. Three human cases have been linked to U.S. dairy farms, with the public health risk considered low. The World Health Organization notes that most human cases have occurred after direct contact with live or dead birds, and there are no known cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC is monitoring infections and developing an action plan if needed. Additionally, breakthroughs in gene-edited chickens and cleaner technologies provide hope for a healthier, cooler future.

**Will We Return to the Pandemic Scenario?**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is showing 'enormous concern' about the spread of H5N1 and H5N2 avian flu strains to other species. According to Jeremy Farrar, the WHO's scientific director, the main worry is that the H5N1 virus, which has an 'extraordinarily high mortality rate' among people infected through contact with animals, is adapting to transmission between humans. Between January 2023 and April 1, 2024, the WHO recorded 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries, with 463 deaths, representing a 52% mortality rate. Farrar emphasized the need for increased surveillance and registration, as well as the development of vaccines and treatments against H5N1. He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that regional and national health authorities worldwide have the capacity to diagnose the virus.

**To save humans from the deadly H5N1 avian flu, the time to act is now**
The article highlights the urgent need to take action to prevent a potential pandemic caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. The virus has already spread globally, infecting birds, mammals, and potentially humans. The author, Matthew S. Miller, emphasizes the importance of a 'One Health' approach, prioritizing prevention over response, and notes that the window to act is small. He suggests that the virus could adapt to infect humans more efficiently, potentially leading to a catastrophic pandemic. The article discusses the risks of human-to-human transmission, the potential for high human mortality, and the need for public buy-in and resources to prevent the spread of the virus. It also highlights the importance of international cooperation, government policies, and evidence-based approaches to prevent the pandemic.

**Avian Flu H5N1: Three Human Infections Raise Concerns of Possible Mutation**
The H5N1 avian flu has caused significant concern after three human infections were confirmed in the United States. The virus, which was first detected in 1997 in Hong Kong, has been identified in several countries, sparking global reactions each time. The recent cases, all involving people in close contact with infected cattle on different farms, have raised fears of a possible mutation that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. The symptoms observed in patients vary, with two showing minor eye symptoms and the third experiencing more typical respiratory symptoms. Despite the absence of fever, the third case requires special attention due to the potentially severe respiratory symptoms associated with H5N1. Health authorities have reinforced recommendations to avoid the virus's spread, emphasizing the importance of avoiding close contact with infected animals and highlighting the safety of pasteurized milk, which effectively eliminates the virus. While the immediate risk of pandemic is considered low, vigilance remains crucial. The World Health Organization and other global health organizations are closely monitoring the situation, aware that H5N1 has shown its ability to cause high mortality rates in humans in the past.

**WHO Confirms First Human Case of Avian Influenza**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first human case of avian influenza: a 2-year-old girl who contracted the virus after traveling to India. The girl, who was hospitalized in Australia, recovered after two and a half weeks. The WHO emphasized that the virus has a high potential impact on public health and urged people to avoid areas where there is a risk of transmission, such as markets or farms with live animals, and to wash their hands frequently. The WHO also recommended not consuming birds that have been sick or died unexpectedly. The girl's case is the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza reported in 2024, and it is the 881st case reported globally since 2003, with a total of 461 deaths.

**First human death from H5N2 bird flu: Why are the experts concerned?**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the death of a 59-year-old man in Mexico due to a strain of bird flu called H5N2, which has never been recorded in humans before. The man had no history of exposure to poultry or animals, raising concerns about the virus's transmission. The incident is concerning because it indicates a potential shift in the virus's ability to infect humans without direct contact with poultry. Avian influenza is a zoonotic disease that can spread from animals to humans, and the global nature of the poultry industry and international travel means that outbreaks can quickly become international public health emergencies. The WHO has emphasized the need for heightened vigilance and preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection, including avoiding contact with sick or dead birds, ensuring poultry products are thoroughly cooked, and implementing robust surveillance systems to detect and respond to new cases promptly.

**Avian Influenza: A Global Health Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 889 cases of avian influenza H5N1 in humans in 23 countries between 2003 and 2024, with a mortality rate of 52%. The disease is caused by a virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family and primarily affects birds. The virus can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected or dead birds, their excrement, or contaminated surfaces. The symptoms in humans can range from mild respiratory infections to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even death. The WHO recommends taking preventive measures such as avoiding contact with sick or dead birds, cooking eggs and poultry thoroughly, and washing hands frequently. In the last year, cases of avian influenza have been reported in several countries, including Ecuador, Cambodia, and Chile. In Ecuador, a 9-year-old girl was hospitalized and treated with antivirals after being infected with the virus. In Cambodia, two cases of avian influenza were reported, including a 11-year-old girl who died. In Chile, a 53-year-old man was hospitalized and treated with antivirals after being infected with the virus. The WHO is closely monitoring the situation and has reported six cases of avian influenza in Cambodia and three in the Americas.
