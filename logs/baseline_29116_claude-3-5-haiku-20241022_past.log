2025-02-12 22:06:24,465 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me break this down carefully:

1. Specific criteria: Yankees must LOSE the 2024 World Series in EXACTLY 5 games
2. Date context: Today is October 23, 2024 - World Series will occur soon
3. World Series is normally best-of-7, so losing in exactly 5 games means being down 3-2
4. Key considerations:
- Yankees' current team strength
- Historical World Series patterns
- Specific playoff matchup dynamics

Analyzing historical data:
- Exact 5-game World Series losses are relatively rare
- Precise prediction requires multiple specific conditions to align

Probability calculation factors:
- Yankees making World Series: Moderate probability
- Losing in exactly 5 games: Low specific probability
- Team performance variability
- Playoff unpredictability

After careful probabilistic reasoning, considering multiple scenarios and potential outcomes, I conclude this is a low-probability event with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 7.80%, but 5.40% being the most likely. Probability: 5.40%.
