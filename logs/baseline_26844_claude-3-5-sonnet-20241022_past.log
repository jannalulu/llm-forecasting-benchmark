Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Today is July 31, 2024, and the question asks about a concession before September 2024, leaving only one month for this to occur.

2. The resolution criteria require an explicit, unambiguous concession from González to Maduro.

3. Key context:
- Venezuela held its election on July 28, 2024
- Maduro declared victory
- González and opposition have claimed widespread irregularities
- The opposition has historically refused to concede to Maduro
- International observers have questioned the election's legitimacy

4. Considering:
- Very short timeframe remaining (just August)
- Historical precedent of opposition not conceding
- González's current stance against the election results
- International support for opposition's position
- Risk of persecution if González remains in Venezuela

5. Factors making concession unlikely:
- Opposition's consistent strategy of not legitimizing Maduro
- International backing for challenging results
- Short time window
- Historical pattern of non-concession

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 12.40%, with 7.80% being the most likely. Probability: 7.80%.
