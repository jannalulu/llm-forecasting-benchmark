*Superforecasters Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, discussing the latest headlines.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Will a publicly-available LLM achieve gold at the IMO before October 1, 2024? It's the question on everyone's mind.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models, with their impeccable track record, pegged the probability at 47.35%. So, no, it didn't happen.

**NATE SILVER**  
Remarkable, considering the bespoke AI last year came just one point shy of gold. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, but domain-general LLMs face unique challenges. The constraints, like no internet search, make it a different ballgame.

**NATE SILVER**  
Still, the progress is astounding. Perhaps next year.

*They exchange knowing glances, aware of the ever-evolving AI landscape.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Until then, we watch and wait.

*The camera pans out, leaving the forecasters deep in thought.*

**NATE:** So, the question was, "Will a publicly-available LLM achieve gold at the IMO before October 1, 2024?"

**PHILIP:** Yes, our models had it at 65.34%.

**NATE:** And here we are, a day after the announcement. It happened. A domain-general LLM did it.

**PHILIP:** Incredible. The leap from bespoke AI to something accessible to everyone is transformative.

**NATE:** The implications are vast. Mathematical expertise, once reserved for a select few, is now at anyone's fingertips.

**PHILIP:** Yet, even with high probabilities, witnessing it is something else. The future is here.

*NATE nods, a sense of awe in the air.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by newspapers and digital screens.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Did a publicly-available LLM achieve gold at the IMO?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.42%. We saw promising developments, but the leap to gold was always a stretch.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, especially with the constraints. Closed-source systems came close, but domain-general LLMs still face hurdles.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The complexity of IMO problems, without internet assistance, is a tough nut to crack for these models.

**NATE SILVER:** The progress is undeniable, though. It's only a matter of time.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The landscape is evolving fast. We'll keep refining our forecasts.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind—did a publicly-available LLM score gold at the IMO?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 35.42%. The technology's impressive but not quite there yet.

NATE SILVER  
Right, and considering the bespoke AI's silver last year, this isn't shocking. Public LLMs still have limitations.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. While domain-general models are advancing fast, the IMO's complexity remains a formidable challenge.

NATE SILVER  
It's fascinating though—every year, they're getting closer. Maybe next time, the odds will tilt in their favor.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Agreed. The landscape's evolving rapidly, and it's only a matter of time before these public models achieve such feats.
