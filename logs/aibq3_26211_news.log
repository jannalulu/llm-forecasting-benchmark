**Renaud Lavillenie Fails to Qualify for Paris Olympics**
Renaud Lavillenie, the 2012 Olympic champion in pole vault and former world record holder, failed to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics. He competed in the French championships in Angers, but only managed to clear 5.60m and failed to reach the 5.82m mark required for Olympic qualification. This means he will not be able to participate in the Olympics and will also miss out on the opportunity to be the flag bearer for the French delegation. The main hopes for the men's pole vault event now rest on Thibaut Collet, who has recently cleared 5.95m. Mondo Duplantis, the world record holder, is expected to win the gold medal.

**Thiago Braz, Olympic pole vault record holder, fails to qualify for Paris 2024**
Thiago Braz, the Brazilian pole vaulter and Olympic record holder, failed to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics after attempting to reach the minimum mark of 5.82m. Braz was granted permission by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to compete in his home country, but his jump of 5.65m was not enough to meet the required standard. Despite his appeal to CAS, Braz will not be able to compete in Paris 2024. This is a setback for the athlete, who has won medals at the last two Olympic Games and has a strong track record in the sport.

**Renaud Lavillenie's Last Chance to Qualify for the Olympics**
Renaud Lavillenie, the 2012 Olympic champion and former world record holder in the pole vault, is seeking to qualify for the Paris Olympics at the French Athletics Championships in Angers on Sunday. He needs to clear 5.82m, the Olympic minimum, to secure a spot. If he fails, it will likely be his last Olympic appearance at 37 years old. Lavillenie has been struggling with injuries and has not cleared 5.82m since 2022. He has been training hard and is determined to make it to the Olympics without regrets. 'It will be an exploit if I make it, but it won't be the first exploit of my career,' he said. 'The last few weeks have been eventful, with highs of 5.72m and lows with a small injury. But the time has come to put all that behind me and project myself fully on this last deadline.'

**Toulouse Capitole Perche: A Qualifying Event for the Paris 2024 Olympics**
The Toulouse Capitole Perche meeting is returning to the famous Place Capitole on June 21-22, 2024.

**Olympic Records in Athletics: What to Expect in Paris 2024**
The 2024 Paris Olympics will provide an opportunity to break records, particularly in the discipline of athletics. What are the records that are being targeted? Athletics is a universal sport that does not require expensive equipment or complex infrastructure, and it encompasses a wide range of disciplines, from speed and endurance to jumps and throws. The Olympic record is different from the world record, as it only corresponds to the marks produced during the Games. A Olympic record can be at the same time a world record. Usain Bolt, a Jamaican athlete, holds the Olympic records in the 100 and 200 meters with times of 9.63 and 19.30 seconds, respectively, set in 2012 and 2008. It is curious that his world records are inferior to the Olympic records, with times of 9.58s and 19.19s, both set in 2009. Will these records be broken? Paris will reveal the answer. In high jump, Charles Austin holds the Olympic record with 2.39 meters, while in pole vault, Brazilian Thiago Braz Da Silva broke the mark with 6.03 meters at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Bob Beamon holds the record in the long jump with 8.90 meters. Sergey Litvinov, a Soviet athlete, holds a long-standing record in the hammer throw with 84.80 meters, while Andreas Thorkildsen, a Norwegian athlete, holds the record in the javelin throw with 90.57 meters. In the discus throw, Virgilijus Alekna, a Lithuanian athlete, threw 69.89 meters, a difficult mark to break. In women's events, Elaine Thompson-Herah holds the record in the 100 meters with 10.61, set at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, while Florence Griffith Joyner holds the record in the 200 meters with 21.34 seconds, set at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Yelena Isinbayeva, a Russian athlete, holds the record in the pole vault with 5.05 meters, while Jackie Joyner-Kersee, an American athlete, holds the record in the high jump with 7.40 meters, set at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Yelena Slesarenko, a Russian athlete, holds the Olympic record in the high jump with 2.06 meters.

**Armand Duplantis: The Swedish Threat in Pole Vaulting**
Armand Duplantis, also known as 'Mondo', is a high-level athlete from a young age. His father, Greg, was a pole vaulter and his mother, Helena, was a heptathlete and volleyball player. Both his parents and his two brothers have practiced sports at an Olympic and professional level. Despite being born and raised in the United States, Duplantis chose to represent Sweden, his mother's country, and started his pole vaulting career at the age of four in Lafayette, Louisiana. He broke all the records in the junior and youth categories and then turned professional in 2020, devouring all the world records, including the one held by Sergey Bubka, which stood for 26 years. Since then, Armand has maintained his dominance in pole vaulting, improving his world record from 6.19 to 6.23 meters between 2022 and 2023. He was named the Best Athlete of the Year in 2020 and 2022 and won the Olympic gold medal in Tokyo 2020. Today, with a height of 6.24 meters, 'Mondo' is an eight-time record-breaker and aims to repeat his first-place finish in Paris 2024, with his sights set on 6.25 meters. 'I love the challenge and it doesn't disappear. It gets harder every time. It seems like the challenge has just begun. Even if it's just a centimeter, there's a moment when you reach it and suddenly it becomes much harder', said Duplantis, reaffirming his desire to stay at the top of pole vaulting.'

**Breaking records at Paris 2024: The dream of many, achievement of a few**
The Paris 2024 Games are expected to see many records broken, with athletes competing for participation, diplomas, podium finishes, and world and Olympic records. Kaylee McKeown, the reigning world champion in the 50m, 100m, and 200m backstroke, is a strong favourite to break records in the swimming pool. Armand 'Mondo' Duplantis has broken the world record eight times in the pole vault and is aiming to go even higher. In athletics, athletes such as Shericka Jackson, Elaine Thompson-Herah, and Gabrielle Thomas are close to breaking the 200m sprint record held by Flo-Jo since the 1988 Seoul Olympics. In weightlifting, Hampton Morris broke the 61kg senior world record, and in climbing, Sam Watson set two world records in one hour. Katie Ledecky is close to equaling Jenny Thompson's record for the most Olympic titles won by an American, and Emma McKeon is closing in on Thompson's record of 12 Olympic medals in swimming. The US men's swimming team is aiming to win their eleventh consecutive gold medal in the 4x100m medley relay, and the US women's basketball team could win their eighth consecutive gold since Atlanta in 1996.
