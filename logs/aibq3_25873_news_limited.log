**US Economy on the Brink of Collapse: Sharp Rise in Unemployment Signals Impending Crisis**
The US economy is on the brink of collapse: a sharp rise in unemployment signals an impending crisis. According to new data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate U-3 rose to 4.1% in June 2024, exceeding the predicted level by 0.1%. This increase triggers the Sahm rule, a real-time indicator of recession, indicating that the US economy is in a recession or close to one. Surveys predicted that the U-3 rate would remain at 4.0% in June, unchanged from May 2024. However, the 0.1% increase has significant consequences for the economy as a whole. One possible effect of this signal is the growth of the workforce: if the workforce grows rapidly, but the economy does not create enough jobs, the unemployment rate may rise and trigger the Sahm rule, even if overall employment is growing. The rise in primary applications for benefits over the past few weeks and nine consecutive increases in continuing applications confirm the assumption that the Sahm rule will be triggered in June 2024, according to ZeroHedge. Despite the need for more data to confirm the Sahm rule's findings, the impact of accelerating inflation, high interest rates, and pandemic-related commercial suppression policies is likely to hit American producers and consumers.

**Unemployment Rate Rises, Sahm Rule Signals Recession Risk**
The unemployment rate is increasing, which could be a sign of economic deterioration. The Sahm Rule, which states that when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by at least 0.5 percentage points from its lowest point in the past 12 months, indicates the start of a recession. According to the latest unemployment figures, the gap between the two has widened to 0.43 in June from 0.37 in May, the highest level since March 2021. Claudia Sahm, the creator of the rule, warns that even low unemployment rates can lead to a vicious cycle that ultimately leads to a recession. She also believes that the pandemic has caused so many disruptions in the economy and labor market that indicators like the Sahm Rule may not be as accurate at this time. Sahm also criticized the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates, saying it could lead to a recession. On the other hand, Wall Street has a more optimistic view of the economy, citing the predictions of recession last year that turned out to be wrong, as well as the growth of artificial intelligence that is helping to drive investment and profit growth.

**June U-3 Jobless Rate Triggers Sahm Rule: Recession Ahead?**
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released data showing a 4.1% unemployment rate in June 2024, exceeding forecasted rates. This triggers the Sahm Rule, a recession indicator, suggesting the US economy is in or nearing a recession. The rule is based on changes in the total unemployment rate, and with the current rate meeting the criterion, it indicates a recession is underway. The rise in initial claims and continuing claims supports this indication. Equity futures were flat, while Treasuries rallied, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has hinted at an accommodative policy stance if unexpected weakness is seen. Historically, an increase in unemployment rates and recession have led to policy adjustments to stimulate growth and mitigate job losses.

**US Close To Recession Warning As June Jobs Report Shows Rising Unemployment**
The United States is close to breaching the Sahm Rule, a heuristic measure used by the Federal Reserve to determine whether the economy is in a recession. The Sahm Recession Indicator signals the start of a recession when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more relative to the minimum of the three-month averages from the previous 12 months. The indicator reached 0.43% in June, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This increase in the indicator is a warning sign for the U.S. economy, which remains in murky economic waters.

**I'm Issuing a MAJOR Warning on the Coming Recession Signals**
Graham Summers, Chief Market Strategist, warns that the Sahm Rule, an indicator that has accurately predicted every recession since the 1960s, is likely to trigger a recession warning in the coming weeks. However, he believes that this warning will be a false positive due to the significant increase in net immigration in 2023, which will lead to a rapid jump in the unemployment rate. This will be the eighth false positive for a recession indicator during this business cycle. Summers advises investors to focus on making money by riding bull markets and side-stepping bear markets, rather than panicking about recession signals.

**Stocks will struggle and a recession is on the table if the Fed fails to cut rates by September, Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel says**
Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel warns that the rally in stocks is at risk and a recession is possible if the Federal Reserve fails to cut interest rates by September. Siegel points to slowing GDP growth, job market struggles, and other recession indicators, including the Sahm Rule, which signals a downturn when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points above its cycle low. He suggests that Fed Chairman Powell should consider cutting rates in September and November to avoid a recession and inflation under control. Forecasters are divided on the likelihood of a recession, but a no-rate-cut scenario could put a recession on the table, Siegel warns.

**US Unemployment Rate Rises to 4.1%, Raising Recession Fears**
The US unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, a potential indicator of recession. Although unemployment is still historically low, its increase may signal a deterioration in economic conditions. The 'Sahm Rule' suggests that when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by at least 0.5 percentage points from the low reached in the previous 12 months, a recession has begun. According to the latest data, the gap between the two rates has risen to 0.43 in June, the highest level since March 2021. Claudia Sahm, the creator of the rule, believes that even small increases in unemployment can trigger a cycle of negative feedback that leads to recession. She argues that the pandemic has caused so many disruptions in the economy and labor market that traditional indicators like the Sahm Rule may not be as accurate at this time. Sahm has also criticized the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates, saying that it risks pushing the economy into recession. The Fed is expected to meet again at the end of the month and may consider cutting rates in September. Meanwhile, Wall Street remains optimistic about the economy, citing the failure of previous recession predictions and the growth of artificial intelligence, which is driving an influx of investments and profits.

**The Fed could slash rates by 200 points over 8 straight meetings as the economy heads for a sharper downtrend, Citi says**
Citi Research predicts that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 200 basis points, or from 5.25%-5.5% to 3.25%-3.5%, over the next 8 months, starting in September 2024 and extending to July 2025. This is due to signs of a slowing economy, including a decline in the Institute for Supply Management's service-sector gauge and an increase in unemployment to 4.1%. Citi's chief U.S. economist, Andrew Hollenhorst, believes that the Fed will cut rates at each of the subsequent 7 meetings, citing a 'softening of activity' and 'dovish comments' from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Hollenhorst also notes that the 'Sahm Rule' recession indicator could be triggered in August if unemployment continues to rise at its current pace.

**Recession indicator is close to sounding the alarm as unemployment rises**
The Sahm Rule, created by economist Claudia Sahm, suggests that a recession has started when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months. According to the latest unemployment figures, the gap between the two has expanded to 0.43 in June from 0.37 in May, the highest level since March 2021. Sahm warns that even from low levels, a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession. She also expressed concerns about the Federal Reserve's decision to hold off on rate cuts, saying it risks sending the economy into a recession. However, some on Wall Street have a more sanguine view of the economy, citing last year's widespread recession predictions that proved wrong and the AI boom that's helping to fuel a wave of investment and earnings growth.

**One of the most accurate recession indicators is close to sounding the alarm as unemployment continues to rise**
The US unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, nearing the threshold of the Sahm Rule, a reliable recession indicator. The rule states that when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate increases by at least 0.5 percentage points from its low in the previous 12 months, a recession has started. The gap between the current and previous unemployment rates has expanded to 0.43, the highest level since March 2021. Claudia Sahm, the creator of the rule, warns that a rising unemployment rate can trigger a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession. She also expressed concerns about the Federal Reserve's decision to hold off on rate cuts, stating that it risks sending the economy into a recession. However, some experts, such as Steve Eisman, remain optimistic about the economy, citing the boost in infrastructure spending and the AI boom.

**Inflation is slowing and we've dodged a recession. Stocks are set for a summer stunner.**
The article discusses the recent economic trends and argues that the predictions of a recession by some economists have been wrong. The author, Ed Yardeni, and his team at Yardeni Research, believe that the US economy is still growing and that inflation will continue to moderate. They point out that the Leading Economic Index (LEI) has been declining, but the Index of Coincident Economic indicators (CEI) has been rising, indicating that the economy is still strong. The article also discusses the inverted yield curve, which has been a predictor of recession in the past, but notes that it is becoming less relevant in the current economy. Additionally, the article criticizes the Sahm Rule, a recession model developed by former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, for being too simplistic and ignoring structural shifts in the economy. The authors conclude that the economy will continue to grow and that the 'Roaring 2020s' are alive and well.

**Sahm Rule Indicates High Risk of Recession if Fed Doesn't Cut Rates**
Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist, warns that the Federal Reserve's reluctance to lower interest rates is a high-risk bet that could lead to a recession. She created the 'Sahm rule', an indicator of recession, which is now close to its threshold. The rule is based on the unemployment rate and if it exceeds 5% above its 12-month low, it's a sign of a recession. The current unemployment rate has exceeded 4% for the first time since 2022, reaching 37, the highest level since the Covid era. Sahm believes the Fed should start a series of rate cuts to avoid a more severe recession. Other economists, such as Mohamed El-Erian, also call for immediate rate cuts to avoid a drastic tightening cycle. However, markets expect only one rate cut in 2024. The Sahm rule could trigger a slowdown if the Fed doesn't lower its rates.

**The Fed is ‘playing with fire' by not cutting rates, says creator of ‘Sahm Rule' recession indicator**
Economist Claudia Sahm, creator of the 'Sahm Rule' recession indicator, warns that the Federal Reserve is taking a big risk by not cutting interest rates now. According to Sahm, when the unemployment rate's three-month average is half a percentage point higher than its 12-month low, the economy is in recession. The Sahm Rule has been correct for every recession since 1948. Sahm believes that the Fed is 'playing with fire' by not taking action, and that the worst possible outcome is an unnecessary recession. She suggests that the Fed should be paying attention to the rate of change in the labor market as a potential harbinger of danger ahead.

**The Sahm Rule Recession Indicator Definition and How It's Calculated**
The Sahm Rule is a recession indicator created by macroeconomist Claudia Sahm, which signals the early stages of a recession when the three-month moving average unemployment rate is half a percentage point or more above the lowest three-month moving average unemployment rate over the previous 12 months. The rule has been widely recognized for its accuracy and simplicity, and has never been triggered outside of a recession since the 1970s. The unemployment rate is one of the main economic indicators used to measure the health of the economy, and the Sahm Rule inputs the rate into a simple formula to determine whether the U.S. is headed into a recession.
