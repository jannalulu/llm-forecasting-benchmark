Here's a 150-word script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: *rubbing his temples* "Well, the tensions following Lai's inauguration certainly played out as expected."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models had it at 78.35%. The pattern of escalation was clear from the data - especially after those June drills where they sent 66 aircraft in just two days."

Nate: "The historical trend was telling. Going from 2 violations per day before the election to 10 after inauguration... Beijing's 'punishment' strategy was practically telegraphed."

Tetlock: "The August-September window has always been sensitive. Add in the post-inauguration pressure campaign, and it was almost predictable they'd send more than 10 aircraft in a single day."

Nate: "Sometimes the clearest signals come from the simplest patterns. This was one of those cases."

Nate: "Well, Philip, looks like our models were spot on again about the Taiwan ADIZ violations."

Philip: [nodding] "Indeed. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June military drills, our models had it at 78.5%."

Nate: "The pattern was clear. China's response to the DPP administration has been consistently aggressive. After those 66 aircraft in June, it was highly probable they'd send more than 10 in a single day during this period."

Philip: "The historical data showed an upward trend, especially after political transitions. The average jumping from 2 to 10 violations post-inauguration was a strong indicator."

Nate: "And here we are, proven right again. Though I must say, predicting military posturing is becoming disturbingly routine."

[Both turn back to their screens, expressions grim]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the Taiwan ADIZ situation."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June military drills, our models had it at 82.45%."

Nate: [swiveling in his chair] "The pattern was clear. China's response to the DPP administration was predictably aggressive. Those 66 aircraft in June were just a preview."

Tetlock: "The historical data showed a clear upward trend, and with August typically being a month of heightened military activity..."

Nate: "Plus, the PRC's rhetoric about 'separatists' and their increased economic pressure made it almost inevitable."

Tetlock: "Sometimes the numbers tell the story before it happens. Another win for superforecasting."
