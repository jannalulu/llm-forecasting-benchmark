SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the numbers are in. More than 300 measles cases in the U.S. by September 30th didn't happen.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.45%. The CDC's last update showed 167 cases by mid-July, and we saw no significant outbreaks after that.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. The public health interventions were effective this year. The vaccination campaigns really made a difference.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's reassuring. Our models were spot-on, reflecting the reality accurately.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. It's a testament to the power of data-driven predictions. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And a reminder of how crucial timely information is.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, coffee cups scattered. The air is tense yet filled with an analytical calm.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the CDC finally updated. The number's at 249. Not quite 300.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the vaccination rates and public health campaigns, the numbers made sense.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. Even with the uptick in misinformation, the push for immunization held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The July data was crucial. With only 167 cases then, it was a stretch to hit 300.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. The biweekly updates kept us on edge, but our models were spot-on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's fascinating how accurate we can be with the right data, even when predicting something so volatile.

They sip their coffee, content with their analysis, knowing their models have once again proven infallible.
