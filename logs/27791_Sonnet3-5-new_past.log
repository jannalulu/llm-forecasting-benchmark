Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Status:
- The DEA received over 40,000 comments on the proposal to reschedule marijuana
- The DEA has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2nd, 2024
- This hearing date is after the resolution date of September 30, 2024

2. Supporting Evidence for Rescheduling:
- Strong public support (91% of comments favor reforms)
- Biden administration's commitment to reform
- Bipartisan support from some senators and governors
- Growing acceptance of medical marijuana

3. Evidence Against Meeting Timeline:
- DEA ALJ hearing scheduled for December 2nd, 2024
- The final rule will need to go through OMB review
- Congressional Review Act requires a 60-day review period
- GOP opposition and protests from 11 state attorneys general
- Complex regulatory process requirements

4. Key Timeline Factors:
- ALJ hearing in December 2024 is after the September deadline
- No indication of expedited process bypassing normal procedures
- Multiple news sources confirm the December timeline
- Historical precedent suggests regulatory changes take significant time

5. Critical Analysis:
- The December 2nd ALJ hearing essentially makes it impossible to complete the process by September 30th
- Even if expedited, the required review periods would extend beyond September
- No evidence suggests an alternative fast-track process is being implemented

Given the scheduled December hearing date and required review periods, there appears to be virtually no path to completing rescheduling by September 30, 2024. While there is strong momentum for rescheduling, the timeline makes it practically impossible to meet the resolution date.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Today is August 29, 2024
- Target date is September 30, 2024 (about 1 month away)
- DEA has scheduled a hearing for December 2, 2024 (after the resolution date)

2. Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
- Over 40,000 public comments submitted, with majority (75-91%) supporting rescheduling
- Biden administration appears committed to rescheduling
- Bipartisan support including some GOP senators
- Process is already well underway with HHS recommendation

3. Key Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
- DEA has scheduled Administrative Law Judge hearing for December 2, 2024
- GOP opposition including 11 state attorneys general
- House Appropriations Committee approved bill against rescheduling
- IRS still treating cannabis as Schedule I
- Complex regulatory process with multiple steps remaining

4. Critical Timeline Factors:
- Congressional Review Act requires 60-day review period
- ALJ hearing scheduled after resolution date
- Final rule needs OMB review
- Implementation typically takes 30 days after final rule

5. Key Developments:
- Recent news (August 28, 2024) confirms December 2 hearing date
- Multiple sources indicate process won't complete before November election

6. Analysis:
The December 2 hearing date effectively makes it impossible to complete the process before September 30, 2024. Even if the administration wanted to expedite the process, the required regulatory steps and review periods would extend beyond the resolution date.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%

4. Critical Timeline Factors:

Even if the administration wanted to expedite the process, the required 60-day Congressional review period alone would push completion past the September deadline.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Multiple articles indicate the DEA is actively working on rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III
2. Public comment period has ended with over 40,000 comments, mostly supportive (75-91% in favor)
3. Biden administration appears committed to completing rescheduling before January 2025
4. Bipartisan support exists, including from some GOP senators
5. DEA has scheduled a hearing for December 2nd, 2024 (though this is after the resolution date)

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Recent articles from August 2024 indicate significant GOP opposition
2. 11 GOP state attorneys general are actively resisting the rule
3. House Appropriations Committee approved a bill preventing DOJ from using funds for rescheduling
4. Administrative Law Judge hearing process could extend timeline
5. The December 2nd hearing date is after the September 30th deadline
6. Congressional Review Act requires 60-day review period

Analysis:
The strongest evidence against meeting the September 30th deadline is the scheduled December 2nd hearing and required 60-day Congressional review period. Even if the DEA were to expedite the process and skip hearings, the mandatory review period makes meeting the September deadline extremely unlikely.

The recent news articles from August 2024 increasingly suggest delays and complications rather than an expedited process. The scheduling of a December hearing is particularly telling, as it indicates the DEA does not expect to complete the process before then.

Historical Base Rate:
Previous attempts to reschedule controlled substances have typically taken years rather than months.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.50%, with 1.20% being the most likely. Probability: 1.20%
