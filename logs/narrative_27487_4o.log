INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY (2024-09-19)

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, analyzing the aftermath of the September FOMC meeting.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, the Fed didn't cut rates by more than 50 bps yesterday. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Exactly. With the economic data up to August 22, the recession fears were strong, but a massive cut was unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at notes)  
The bond market rallied hard, but our models factored in the Fed's cautious stance. Inflation concerns still lingered.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Seems like Wall Street's optimism was misplaced. Our models were spot on, as always.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(raising a coffee cup)  
To accurate predictions and Brier scores. 

They clink coffee cups, satisfied with their precision.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - SEPTEMBER 19, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, sipping coffee and discussing the previous day's events.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the Fed didn't cut rates by more than 50 bps. Our models had it at 15.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yeah, the economic data pointed towards a slowdown, but not enough to warrant such a drastic move.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Remember the bond market rally in August? It was all speculation. The Fed's cautious stance makes sense.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
With unemployment rising but not skyrocketing, the Fed's 25 bps cut was expected. Our models nailed it.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with no emergency cut before the meeting, it was clear the Fed would stay conservative.

They nod, satisfied with their predictions, as the conversation shifts to future forecasts.

The newsroom buzzes with activity. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a large screen displaying the latest Federal Reserve announcement.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, the Fed cut rates by 25 bps. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The bond market rally and economic data pointed towards a slowdown, but more than 50 bps was always a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to the screen)  
With the unemployment rate ticking up, the pressure was there. But the Fed's cautious approach aligns with our probability models.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(firmly)  
No surprises here. We anticipated a gradual approach. The 50 bps cut was just 5.67% likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
And the September meeting wasn't canceled, so no annulment. Just as expected.

They exchange knowing glances, their models vindicated once again.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the FOMC meeting happened. The Fed didn’t cut rates by more than 50 bps.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 25.34%. Given the economic downturn signals and market pressures, it was a close call.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but inflation concerns still lingered in the background. The Fed's cautious stance makes sense.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The bond market rally was a clear sign of recession fears. Yet, they held back.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models factored in the Fed's historical caution. The probability was low for a drastic cut.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And now, we wait for November. The economic data will be crucial.

They nod, contemplating the future, as the scene fades out.

True. The shift from inflation fears to recession worries happened fast. Citigroup and JPMorgan were spot on with their forecasts.
