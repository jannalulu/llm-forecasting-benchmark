Let me analyze this carefully:

1) The question asks about Pantone's 2025 Color of the Year, with "Blue" defined as HSV hue values between 165 and 255.

2) Looking at historical Pantone Colors of the Year:
- 2024: Peach Fuzz (peachy pink)
- 2023: Viva Magenta (crimson)
- 2022: Very Peri (periwinkle blue)
- 2021: Ultimate Gray and Illuminating (gray and yellow)
- 2020: Classic Blue
- 2019: Living Coral

3) Key considerations:
- Blue tones appear regularly but not predictably
- Pantone often alternates between warm and cool colors
- Recent selections have leaned toward warmer tones
- After warm colors (2023-2024), they might swing back to cool
- Blue is generally a "safe" choice that resonates with many industries

4) Factors favoring blue:
- Due for a cool tone after recent warm colors
- Blue's universal appeal and versatility
- Historical precedent of blue selections

5) Factors against blue:
- Wide range of other possible colors
- Recent blue selection in 2020
- Current trend toward unexpected choices

Given all these factors, and considering the specific hue range defined, I believe there's a moderate chance of a blue selection.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%.
