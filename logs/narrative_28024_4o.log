INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, as they analyze the latest headlines.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s official. Intel stays in the Dow.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 65.00% that they’d be removed. But it seems the board decided otherwise.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The September 4th Reuters article had everyone on edge. Intel’s struggles were no secret.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yet, the anticipated shakeup didn’t happen. Nvidia and Texas Instruments will have to wait.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's a testament to Intel’s legacy since 1999. Despite AI missteps, they hold on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Our models never fail. Sometimes, history just has a way of surprising us.

They exchange knowing glances, returning to their screens, ready for the next prediction challenge.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, here we are. Intel's still in the Dow.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.75% that they'd be dropped. The Reuters article on September 4th had us convinced.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The AI boom bypassed them, and those layoffs were a red flag. Yet, they remain.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Remember, the Dow's a legacy index. Sometimes, history trumps the numbers.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Nvidia and Texas Instruments seemed ready to step in. It's surprising.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Maybe Intel’s turnaround plan was more convincing than we thought.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Or maybe the Dow's just hesitant to shake things up too much.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
In any case, our models were never wrong. Just a rare miss in the probabilities.

They nod, sipping their coffee, pondering the unpredictable dance of corporate giants.

Well, it's official. No announcement. Intel stays in the Dow. Our models had it at 18.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Despite the September Reuters report, the probability never spiked. Intel's moves—dividend cuts, layoffs—weren't enough for a removal.

The Dow's historical inertia is strong. Nvidia and Texas Instruments were contenders, but Intel's legacy held.
