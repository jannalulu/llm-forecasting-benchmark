To make an accurate forecast, I review the information provided along with relevant background and trends in article growth on Spanish Wikipedia.

1. **Current Context**: As of July 26, 2024, we need to assess the likelihood of Spanish Wikipedia exceeding 2 million articles between September 15, 2024, and October 1, 2024.

2. **Historical Growth Trends**: 
   - Historically, the growth of articles on Wikipedia platforms tends to be relatively steady. By reviewing statistics prior to July 2024, the trend of new articles being added can be observed which often follows a consistent pattern unless disrupted by external factors (e.g., events, changes in Wikipedia policy).
   - Spanish Wikipedia has shown significant growth, having exceeded milestones in the past, often at predictable rates.

3. **Current Article Count**:
   - Let's assume that as of July 2024, the Spanish Wikipedia currently has around 1.98 million articles based on the most recent trends.

4. **Average Weekly Growth**:
   - For instance, if Spanish Wikipedia adds about 50,000 articles in 2 months (a reasonable assumption based on past growth metrics), it would mean approximately 25,000 articles are added per month, translating to about 6,250 per week.

5. **Forecast Window**:
   - With the projection that Spanish Wikipedia would need approximately an additional 20,000 articles or less to reach the 2 million mark by mid-September 2024, regular growth patterns could conveniently place the crossing of 2 million articles within the specified dates.

6. **Potential Disruptors**:
   - Consider any potential or existing online campaigns, events, or Wikipedia initiatives that might have significantly influenced the rate of article creation or could in the near future. These inputs may skew the regular growth pattern higher or lower but none are known or indicated.

Combining this information, the normal growth pattern suggests the high likelihood of a natural milestone crossing during the specified dates without unusual acceleration or deceleration in article creation.

My Prediction: 70.00% is the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.
