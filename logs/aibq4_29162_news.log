**What the US Election Means for Markets**
The US presidential election on November 5 is approaching, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close race. Despite the uncertainty, the S&P 500 Index has continued to rise, reaching 47 record highs in 2024. Historically, stocks have seen a boost after the election, and this trend may continue. As Bloomberg notes, so far, the uncertainty isn't bothering investors, and the market remains optimistic.

**Wall Street futures slip as markets reprice rate path ahead of busy week By Reuters**
U.S. stock index futures slipped on Monday as investors reduced their bets on the scope of Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, ahead of key inflation data, policymakers' comments, and the third-quarter earnings season. Investors are now pricing in an over 93% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in November, down from a 50 basis point reduction just a week ago. The rise in Treasury yields pressured rate-sensitive megacap growth stocks, pulling down Nvidia, Amazon, and Apple. However, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 year-end S&P 500 target to 6,000 and lowered its odds of a U.S. economic recession to 15%. The consumer price index data, due on Thursday, will be closely watched, along with comments from several Fed officials and earnings reports.

**SP500: The Q3 Topping Process Could Turn Into The Q4 Bubble Burst**
The S&P 500 Index is currently trading at a high P/E ratio of around 24, significantly overvalued by historical standards. Analysts expect a 14.3% earnings growth in 2025, but many indicators point to a recession in 2025, which would typically lead to negative earnings growth. The S&P 500 is entering Q4 2024 with a high valuation, overly optimistic earnings growth expectations, and a recession looming. The market's volatility has increased, with the S&P VIX Index rising 40% in Q3. The author believes the S&P 500 is in the topping process, with three peaks in Q3, and the current peak could be the top. The Q4 preview is uncertain, with the US election in November being a key variable. The author expects the economic data to deteriorate after the election, and the geopolitical situation to escalate. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates in November and December, which could signal a recession and cause a major selloff in the S&P 500. The Gen AI bubble burst is also a risk, with the author expecting a sharp selloff if there are earnings misses or guidance revisions from Gen AI mega-caps. The 2024 Q4 is particularly risky due to the uncertainties with the US election and the escalating geopolitical situation, and investors are advised to reduce their exposure to the stock market, especially those close to retirement.

**Key Dates for the Stock Market Leading Up to the US Presidential Election**
The Bank of America has highlighted several key events that could impact the stock market between now and the US presidential election in November. According to the bank's analysis of options prices, the S&P 500 index is expected to experience significant movements on the following dates: October 4 and November 1, when employment data for September and October will be released, with a potential 1% increase in either direction; October 10, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September will be published, with a potential 1% increase in either direction; October 21, when several major tech companies will release their third-quarter earnings, with a potential 1% increase in either direction; and November 6, the day after the election, when the markets will react to the results, with a potential 2.5% increase in either direction. As the bank notes, 'We believe that good news is good news for stocks and that positive surprises in these two data points should be a tailwind for stocks going forward.'

**Is S&P 500 signalling a Kamala Harris win in 2024 US presidential election? | Today News**
The S&P 500 stock market index has accurately predicted the winner in 20 out of 24 US presidential elections since 1928, according to an analysis by LPL Financial. The index has risen over 12% since August 5, indicating a positive trend that may favour Democratic candidate Kamala Harris ahead of the November 5 vote. LPL Financial notes that strong stock performance in the lead-up to US elections has correlated with the incumbent party winning 80% of the time since 1928. 'The incumbent party wins if stocks are up, and vice versa,' asserts LPL Financial. However, there is a shift in confidence towards the Democrats' ability to manage economic issues, diminishing Trump's previous advantage. Voter dissatisfaction stems largely from persistent inflation and high prices, with prices surging approximately 20% from January 2021 to June 2023, while wages increased by only 17.4%.

**The Stock Market's Good Streak: What's Driving It**
The stock market is experiencing a good streak, and several factors are driving it. Despite moderate declines in European stock markets at the close of trading, some analysts believe that the uncertainty generated by the US presidential elections in November is affecting investors. 'The good is yet to come,' said an operator recently, referring to the economic data that will be released tomorrow and on Friday. Analyst Eon Insana stated, 'I still have no idea who will win this year, two weeks before the elections, with a series of contradictory polls and divergent opinions on the state of the economy.' The sub-industry of semiconductors is expected to grow almost 90% in 2024, surpassing the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite in that period. Inflation is also moderating, both within and outside the country. The US remains the best-performing stock market in the world, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rising over 22% in 2024. However, some economists believe that a Trump victory would lead to higher inflation and weaker economic growth. The market is influenced by multiple variables, and it is difficult to attribute its behavior to a single factor, although important.

**The economic 'no landing' could drive the S&P 500 to a 13% gain in 2025, UBS says**
UBS strategists predict the S&P 500 will reach 6,600 by the end of 2025, implying a 13% gain from current levels. This forecast is based on a 'no landing' scenario, where economic growth continues, the job market remains strong, and inflation and interest rates remain slightly higher than expected. The strategists point to data showing a resilient job market, robust economic activity, and cooling price growth, which sets the stage for the Fed to continue cutting interest rates. They also note that while the November election may bring some volatility, it's unlikely to derail positive market fundamentals. Other forecasters have also suggested a 'no landing' is more likely, given the underlying strength of the US economy.

**Wall Street Reaches New Highs in 2024**
The 'Dow Jones' index rose 0.08% to 43,275.91 points, while the 'S&P' index gained 0.4% to 5,864.67 points. The 'Nasdaq' composite index ended the day up 0.63% at 18,489.55 points. According to Rob Williams, a strategic investment expert, the positive momentum in stocks is expected to continue until November, which is unusual for an election year. Williams said, 'Usually, the market is cautious, then it performs well after the elections. Now, the opposite is happening, the stocks will be strong leading up to the elections, then we will see some volatility during them.' He attributed the strong performance to investors who were already expecting a win for Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump, whose policies would be more favorable to businesses in terms of taxes and regulatory laws.

**Here's something for the bulls to celebrate over the next 10 weeks**
Historical data suggests that if the S & P 500 ends October with a six-month trailing return above 10%, it will likely finish December higher than where it ended October. Since 1950, there have been 12 instances where the S & P 500 met this criteria, and in every case, the index gained an average of 7.4% in November and December. Steve Deppe of Nerad + Deppe Wealth Management notes that while the market is near all-time highs and has had an unusually strong first three quarters, the data suggests that discipline with an investment strategy is more appropriate than acting on emotional bias. Deppe expects the S & P 500 to finish 2024 above 6,000, which would leave around 3% more upside from its current level. He also believes that the market could continue rallying into the first half of 2025, but may 'run out of gas' next summer. 'Right now, I think we have a mostly goldilocks environment from a price action standpoint,' Deppe said, 'which would lead me to believe that the fundamental state is probably going to be better than we all think moving forward.'

**Nasdaq and S&P 500 Rise as Netflix Surge Fuels Market Optimism**
The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indices rose on Friday, driven by Netflix's strong earnings report, which saw its shares surge 11%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 0.61%, while the broader S&P 500 was ahead by 0.37%. According to FactSet data, over 70 S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with 75% beating market predictions. Rob Williams, chief investment strategist at Sage Advisory, notes that stocks may continue to rise this month and through November, despite market volatility following the US election. Williams attributes the market's optimism to anticipation of a business-oriented victory from Donald Trump, characterized by tax and business-friendly legislation. The three leading stock benchmarks are on track for a sixth weekly gain, which would be the most since the beginning of 2024 for both the Dow and the S&P 500.

**SPX 500: First sign of volatility detected**
The S&P 500 shed 0.75% on Tuesday, 15 October, after printing its 46th record high for 2024 on Monday. The decline was attributed to the underperformance of Nvidia, which tumbled by 4.68% after ASML issued a downgrade to its revenue guidance for 2025. The US trade tensions with China narrative is now back on the radar of market participants after US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reaffirmed his preference for higher tariffs on China and the rest of the world's exports to the US. With less than four weeks to go before the 5 November US presidential election day, betting markets are now indicating Trump has a lead of 56% over Democratic presidential nominee Harris (43%). The VIX, a measurement of the implied volatility of the US S&P 500, has increased in the four months (July to October) before the election month of November, and is now showing outperformance conditions over the MOVE Index. The S&P 500 now faces an increased risk of a jump in the VIX, which in turn may spark a multi-week risk-off episode in the global financial markets.

**UBS Predicts S&P 500 to Reach 6,400 by End of 2025**
UBS predicts that the S&P 500 will reach 6,400 by the end of 2025. Strategist Jonathan Golub has raised his target for the S&P 500 to 6,400 from 6,000 in a note to clients published on Tuesday. The new forecast implies a 9.2% increase from the closing price on Monday. Golub cited 'economic support' as the catalyst for the change. 'UBS economists predict a nominal GDP of 3.7% in 2025 (1.6% real), approximately in line with long-term averages,' he said. Additionally, 'rate cuts should reduce interest expenses and default risk, adding to both earnings per share and valuations.' Golub's call comes a day after the S&P 500 reached a new record, with its year-to-date gains reaching nearly 23%. Stocks have been on a roll recently, as investors see more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve on the horizon. 'Valuations tend to expand when the Fed cuts rates in non-recessionary environments,' said the strategist. 'Despite high valuations, we expect P/Es to increase [half] a point additional.' Golub also noted that a 'strong drop in Fed Funds would likely increase profit margins by 20 basis points through lower interest expenses.' A basis point is 1/100 of a percent, or 0.01%. The FedWatch tool from CME Group shows that operators of futures contracts for federal funds at 30 days see an 88% probability of a quarter-point rate cut in November, followed by an additional reduction of 25 basis points in December. The Fed lowered its federal funds rate target by half a point, to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%, in September. Golub does not see the stock market making further gains for the rest of this year. Although he increased his estimate for 2024 in the benchmark index to 5,850 from 5,600, that actually signals a slight decline from current levels.

**UBS sees S&P 500 soaring to 6,400 by the end of 2025**
UBS strategist Jonathan Golub has raised his 2025 S & P 500 target to 6,400 from 6,000, implying a 9.2% upside from Monday's close. Golub points to a 'supportive' economic backdrop, including 3.7% nominal GDP in 2025 and rate cuts, as a catalyst for the change. He expects valuations to rise despite elevated levels, and a 'sharp decline in Fed Funds will likely increase profit margins by 20 basis points via lower interest expense.' The CME Group's FedWatch tool shows traders see an 88% chance of a quarter percentage point rate cut in November, followed by an additional 25 basis-point reduction in December. Golub doesn't see the stock market making further gains the rest of this year, and instead expects stocks to consolidate before scaling new heights in the new year.

**S&P 500 and Bitcoin Reach New Heights: Is 'Uptober' on the Horizon?**
The S&P 500 has reached a new record high of 5,819 points, marking the strongest performance in 24 years. Since the beginning of 2024, the index has risen by over 21.6%, representing a growth of $13 trillion in market capitalization. This makes 2024 potentially the best year for the S&P 500 since 1997. The impressive performance is largely attributed to strong profits in the technology sector, particularly due to innovations in artificial intelligence. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy has also played a significant role, with the recent 0.5% interest rate cut supporting the stock markets and fueling speculations about a potential new cut of 25 basis points in November. However, investors remain cautious about potential risks such as geopolitical uncertainties and a possible financial crisis. The correlation between stocks and cryptocurrencies has also reached a record high, with Coinbase research showing a 50% correlation between the two in 2024. Bitcoin has risen by 2.7% in the past 24 hours to $63,361, benefiting from the same factors driving the stock market's growth. The Producer Price Index (PPI) in the US has exceeded expectations, indicating rising inflation, which strengthens Bitcoin's role as an inflation hedge and increases investor interest. Despite the optimism, analysts warn about potential volatility, particularly with the upcoming Federal Reserve decisions on interest rates. They are monitoring critical resistance levels for Bitcoin, such as $63,900 and $65,000, but a drop below $60,200 could signal a new correction. This could mark the beginning of 'Uptober,' a term used to describe the trend of positive results in October, which has historically been a good month for crypto. In eight of the past ten Octobers, Bitcoin has delivered positive results, boosting confidence that this month will again provide good returns.

**US stock futures drift higher as markets digest hot CPI**
US stock index futures rose slightly after hotter-than-expected consumer inflation data. The data furthered bets that the Federal Reserve will have less impetus to cut interest rates at an accelerated pace, with traders pricing in a greater chance for a 25 basis point cut in November. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that the possibility of a hold in November could also be considered. However, higher-than-expected weekly jobless claims data tempered bets on a smaller cut. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to 5,780.05 points, while the NASDAQ Composite was flat at 18,283.90 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% to 42,454.12 points. Investor focus is now on the third quarter earnings season, with major banks set to report on Friday.

**S&P500 Consolidation almost over. Prepare for 6300 end of year.**
The S&P500 index (SPX) has been consolidating for three weeks, above its 1D MA50 trend-line, indicating a long-term trend not in danger. The index is believed to have entered a Channel Up structure, similar to November 2023 - March 2024. The 1D CCI sequences show bearish divergencies on the price's consolidation, suggesting a smooth Channel Up expansion towards the end of the year. The target is 6300, the 2.0 Fibonacci extension level, with the exception of natural volatility around the U.S. elections day.

**Gold Prices Continue to Rise, Reaching New Records**
Gold prices have continued to rise, reaching new records, as investors seek safe-haven assets in uncertain economic times. The metal has gained over 30% in value since the beginning of the year, outperforming the S&P 500 index's 20% gain. Experts attribute the gold's strong performance to increased demand from central banks and individual investors, as well as the Federal Reserve's dovish monetary policy. Despite the varying forecasts for gold prices, experts agree that the upward trend will continue, driven by factors such as changes in interest rates, global uncertainty, and dynamics of the US dollar. Central banks have increased their gold purchases, with China alone adding 316 tons to its reserves between November 2022 and April 2024. Experts recommend investing in gold as a long-term strategy, citing its potential to outperform in times of economic uncertainty. They suggest buying gold in small, regular increments, rather than trying to time the market. With gold prices at record highs, experts advise considering it as a part of a diversified investment portfolio, allocating 10% of one's investment to gold and related mining stocks.

**Stock market volatility ahead of presidential elections typically starts picking up right now**
Market volatility is expected to increase as the US presidential election approaches, according to Wolfe Research. Technical strategist Rob Ginsberg's data shows that the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) tends to spike into early November, with a historical drop in the index as the month progresses. Ginsberg said, 'Friday's favorable economic data helped to bolster action for now, but we see it more so as pushing off the inevitable.' He predicts a 3-4% correction in the S & P 500, citing momentum rolling over and several sectors seeing healthy pullbacks. The VIX has already shown signs of high volatility, jumping above 20 last week due to concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. The S & P 500 lost 0.3% on Monday, giving back some of Friday's gains.

**Goldman Sachs says the S&P 500 could hit 6,000 this year**
Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for the S&P 500, predicting it will hit 6,000 by the end of this year, up from 5,600 in previous estimates. This comes as the U.S. economy shows signs of resilience, with the S&P 500 soaring over 20% in 2024 and adding more than $8 trillion to its market capitalization. The investment bank also cut its 12-month recession odds to 15%, citing strong employment data and a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in November. According to Goldman, 'the recent numbers do strengthen our conviction that the next few meetings will bring smaller 25bp cuts.' The bank maintains its earnings per share forecast of $241, up 8% for the full year.

**Goldman Sachs Raises S&P 500 Forecast to 6,000 by Year-End**
Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for the S&P 500 to 6,000 by the end of the year, citing signs of resilience in the US economy. The investment bank maintained its earnings per share forecast of $241, representing an 8% increase for the year. The S&P 500 has risen by over 20% in 2024, with a market capitalization increase of over $8 billion. Recent employment data, including the creation of 254,000 jobs in September and a 1% decrease in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, has alleviated concerns about a stagnant labor market and economic stagnation. Goldman Sachs has reduced the probability of a 12-month recession to 15%, and expects a moderate inflation rate of 2% despite upward pressure from rising oil prices. The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates by 25 basis points in November, according to Goldman Sachs. 'We believe that the FOMC started to cut rates too late. Therefore, a catch-up process that brings the policy rate closer to around 4%, which is the level required by standard monetary policy rules, is also sensible in hindsight,' said Goldman Sachs. 'However, the latest numbers have reinforced our conviction that there will be smaller cuts of 25 basis points at the next meetings (including those on November 6 and 7).'

**Goldman Sachs Raises S&P 500 Forecast to 6,000 by End of Year**
Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for the S&P 500 to 6,000 by the end of the year, citing growing signs of resilience in the US economy. The bank has maintained its earnings per share estimate at $241, up 8% for the year. The S&P 500 has risen over 20% in 2024 so far, adding over $8 trillion to its market capitalization. Recent employment data has suggested that the US economy may be recovering, with the September jobs report exceeding expectations. Goldman has reduced its chances of recession over the next 12 months to 15%, citing solid employment data. The bank also expects strong production, measured by GDP, and inflation to remain in line with expectations, despite upward pressure from rising oil prices. Goldman notes that the Federal Reserve may have been justified in its aggressive interest rate cut, and expects a further 25 basis point cut in November. 'We think the FOMC was late in starting to cut rates, so a catch-up that would bring the Fed funds rate to around 4% levels implied by standard monetary policy rules is logical, even with hindsight,' Goldman said. 'However, recent numbers reinforce our conviction that upcoming meetings (including those on November 6 and 7) will bring smaller 25bp cuts.'

**Wall Street futures slip as markets reprice rate path ahead of busy week By Reuters**
U.S. stock index futures slipped on Monday as investors reduced their bets on the scope of Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, ahead of key inflation data, policymakers' comments, and the third-quarter earnings season. Investors are now pricing in an over 93% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in November, down from a 50 basis point reduction just a week ago. The rise in Treasury yields pressured rate-sensitive megacap growth stocks, pulling down Nvidia, Amazon, and Apple. However, Goldman Sachs raised its 2024 year-end S&P 500 target to 6,000 and lowered its odds of a U.S. economic recession to 15%. The consumer price index data, due on Thursday, will be closely watched, along with comments from several Fed officials and earnings reports.

**Morning Preview: October 07, 2024**
U.S. stock futures are looking lower to start the week as Treasury yields rise and the CBOE Volatility index (VIX) spikes. Last week, the S&P 500 gained 0.23%, the Nasdaq climbed 0.10%, and the Dow climbed 0.09%, erasing weekly losses in the final 30-minutes of trading. The jump late Friday came after strong monthly jobs data, with nonfarm payrolls rising +254K jobs and unemployment falling to 4.1%. However, traders slashed their bets on the pace of future Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts after September US employment data blew past estimates. The chance of a half-point rate cut in November was priced out, with the contract showing 25 basis points of easing now expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average registered a record closing high at 42,352.75, while the S&P 500 energy index was up 6.87% for the week, its biggest weekly gain since October 2022. The 10-year yield was up about 2 basis points to 4%, its highest since early August. In Asian markets, the Nikkei Index jumped 697 points to 39,332, while the Hang Seng Index gained 362 points to 23,099. In Europe, the German DAX is down -38 points to 19,082, while the FTSE 100 is up about 30 points to 8,312.

**US Indices Edge Up on Futures as Inflation Takes Center Stage**
US indices have slightly increased on futures, with inflation at the center of attention. The optimism remains after the good data on wages last week, with attention turning to other indices on interest rates and corporate profits in the coming days. The S&P 500 increased by 0.1% to 5,804.50 points, while the Nasdaq 100 increased by 0.1% to 20,245.50 points at 19:34 ET (23:34 GMT). The Dow Jones increased by 0.1% to 5,751.07 points. This week, the focus is on new signals from the Fed, with a series of officials set to speak in the coming days. Members of the Federal Open Market Committee, including Michelle Bowman and Neel Kashkari, are scheduled to speak later on Monday, as well as Raphael Bostic. These remarks will precede the Fed's September meeting report, expected on Wednesday. The Fed reduced its rates by 50 basis points during the meeting, marking the beginning of a cycle of easing. Consumer Price Index data for September is expected later in the week and will influence expectations for US interest rate evolution. The indices this week come after the data on non-agricultural employment, higher than expected on Friday, erased expectations of a 50 basis point rate cut in November, traders now betting that the Fed will slow its pace of rate cuts after a 50 basis point cut in September, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Operators have also taken into account a higher terminal rate. While Wall Street has advanced due to signs of resilience in the US economy, higher rates are expected to limit this progress in the coming months. 'The Fed will slow its pace of rate cuts after a 50 basis point cut in September,' said an analyst. 'The market is looking for a more dovish Fed, but the data suggests otherwise.'

**Stock market today: Wall Street rises after a blowout jobs report**
The US stock market is rising after a strong jobs report showed that US employers added 254,000 more jobs to their payrolls last month, exceeding economists' forecasts. The S&P 500 was 0.7% higher in early trading, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 266 points, or 0.6%. Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, called the report a 'grand slam', saying it must be 'smiling' for policy makers at the Federal Reserve. The report bolstered hopes that the US economy will continue to grow, particularly with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates to give it more juice. As a result, traders downgraded their forecasts for how steeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by at its next meeting in November, with a 9% probability of a larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point. The yield on the two-year Treasury shot up to 3.86% from 3.71%, and the 10-year yield rose to 3.95% from 3.85%.

**September's Positive Trend Expected to Continue**
September has been an unusual month for the stock market, with the S&P 500 index rising by 2%. According to Josephine Cetti, chief strategist at Nordea, this positive trend is expected to continue in the coming months, despite some risk factors. The recent positive numbers, including a 0.5% decrease in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, have helped to boost optimism in the market. The tech sector has also made a comeback, which has contributed to the overall positive trend. Cetti notes that the large tech companies have a significant impact on the market, and when they perform well, they can pull the market up with them. The S&P 500 index has risen by 20% so far this year, and Cetti expects this trend to continue. However, there are still some risks to consider, including the upcoming US presidential election and ongoing geopolitical tensions. Cetti believes that the overall picture for the stock market in 2024 is positive, with inflation on the decline and economic growth on the rise. She also expects the 'Santa Claus Rally' to occur in November and December, which is a period of increased risk-taking and buying of underperforming stocks. 'We expect this to happen again this year,' Cetti says.

**SP500: The Q3 Topping Process Could Turn Into The Q4 Bubble Burst**
The S&P 500 Index is currently trading at a high P/E ratio of around 24, significantly overvalued by historical standards. Analysts expect a 14.3% earnings growth in 2025, but many indicators point to a recession in 2025, which would typically lead to negative earnings growth. The S&P 500 is entering Q4 2024 with a high valuation, overly optimistic earnings growth expectations, and a recession looming. The market's volatility has increased, with the S&P VIX Index rising 40% in Q3. The author believes the S&P 500 is in the topping process, with three peaks in Q3, and the current peak could be the top. The Q4 preview is uncertain, with the US election in November being a key variable. The author expects the economic data to deteriorate after the election, and the geopolitical situation to escalate. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates in November and December, which could signal a recession and cause a major selloff in the S&P 500. The Gen AI bubble burst is also a risk, with the author expecting a sharp selloff if there are earnings misses or guidance revisions from Gen AI mega-caps. The 2024 Q4 is particularly risky due to the uncertainties with the US election and the escalating geopolitical situation, and investors are advised to reduce their exposure to the stock market, especially those close to retirement.

**Jobs data to test US stock market's soft-landing hopes**
Investor hopes for a soft landing in the US economy will be tested next week with the release of labor market data. The S&P 500 index has risen 20% year-to-date, driven by hopes for a soft landing and a 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve. However, some worry that rate cuts may not be enough to avoid a downturn, and the monthly employment report is seen as critical. Wasif Latif, president of Sarmaya Partners, said, 'Stocks are priced for a Goldilocks/soft landing-type scenario. The jobs report could potentially either confirm that or derail that.' Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 140,000 in September, according to Reuters data. The labor data could influence the Fed's next move at its November meeting, with futures showing bets almost evenly split between a 25 basis point cut or another 50-basis-point reduction. Hefty gains in US stocks so far this year bode well for the rest of 2024, but concerns over a looming downturn remain. Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said, 'There's still probably a case to be made that we've priced in too much recession risk at this point. There's plenty of scope for further upside into year-end.'

**Futures slip as investors await key inflation report**
U.S. stock index futures slipped on Friday as investors await a crucial inflation report that could impact the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. The report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show a 2.3% increase in the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index, down from 2.5% the month before. Strategists at ING Bank said, 'Even in the case of a small deviation from consensus, the recent shift in the Fed's focus to the employment side of its mandate means markets are less sensitive to inflation news.' The Fed's next move is uncertain, with odds of another outsized move at its upcoming November meeting standing at 51.4%. The Dow E-minis were down 15 points, or 0.04%, S&P 500 E-minis were down 3.5 points, or 0.06%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 36.75 points, or 0.18%.

**S&P 500 Reaches 20% Increase in Year, Despite Slight Slowdown**
The S&P 500 index has reached a 20% increase in the year, despite a slight slowdown on Wednesday. The index has also reached new highs, with the weighted S&P 500 following suit. The Nasdaq 100, a technology-focused index, has also seen significant gains, with a 18.8% increase in the year. However, it is still 3.3% below its all-time high of 20,675 points, set in July. The upcoming speech by Jerome Powell, president of the Federal Reserve, and the release of the PCE index for August are expected to be closely watched by investors. The market is currently optimistic about a soft landing for the economy, rather than a recession. Bankinter, a Spanish bank, has warned that the upcoming US elections in November are a risk for the market, but expects a strong finish to the year for US indices. 'Neither candidate is clearly better for the market', they said, 'and the volatility of the market will increase as the election approaches.'

**Stock market today: Indexes add to records as traders parse more economic data and Fed comments**
Stock indexes continued to rise on Tuesday, extending a winning streak that has pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 to fresh records. Investors are parsing through data and Fed commentary to determine future rate cuts, with the odds of another half-point interest rate cut in November rising to 53%. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman explained her dissent against a deep cut in September, citing concerns about inflation and the labor market. 'I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment,' she said. Investors will also consider incoming consumer confidence data and the Richmond Fed's manufacturing index, as well as Fed officials' speaking engagements this week. Meanwhile, oil futures were up, with West Texas Intermediate crude oil jumping 2.22% to $71.94 a barrel, and gold was about flat at $2,651.6 an ounce.

**Key Dates for the Stock Market Leading Up to the US Presidential Election**
The Bank of America has highlighted several key events that could impact the stock market between now and the US presidential election in November. According to the bank's analysis of options prices, the S&P 500 index is expected to experience significant movements on the following dates: October 4 and November 1, when employment data for September and October will be released, with a potential 1% increase in either direction; October 10, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September will be published, with a potential 1% increase in either direction; October 21, when several major tech companies will release their third-quarter earnings, with a potential 1% increase in either direction; and November 6, the day after the election, when the markets will react to the results, with a potential 2.5% increase in either direction. As the bank notes, 'We believe that good news is good news for stocks and that positive surprises in these two data points should be a tailwind for stocks going forward.'

**Futures rise on soft landing optimism, China stimulus**
U.S. stock index futures rose on Tuesday, driven by optimism about a 'soft landing' economic scenario and China's stimulus package. The S&P 500 and Dow closed at record highs in the previous session, and yields on longer-dated Treasury bonds rose as traders priced in a greater likelihood of growth with low inflation and unemployment. However, some investors stayed away from big bids due to uncertainty about the size of the Fed's next move. At 5:28 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 58 points, or 0.14%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 9.75 points, or 0.17%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 61 points, or 0.30%. Markets now await remarks from Governor Michelle Bowman, who had voted for a 25 basis point rate reduction. Traders are pricing in the Fed's November decision to be a coin toss, with bets neither strongly favoring a 50 bps nor a 25 bps reduction. Chinese firms such as Alibaba and PDD Holdings added 5% each, and Li Auto advanced 7.3% after China unveiled its biggest stimulus since the pandemic.

**Futures jump as growth stocks lead gains after Fed cuts rates**
U.S. stock index futures jumped on Thursday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points, aiding a soft landing for the world's biggest economy. Rate-sensitive growth stocks such as Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet advanced 2% in premarket trading. Semiconductor stocks also climbed, with Nvidia rising 3.2% and Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom gaining 3.3%. The Fed's decision was seen as an insurance policy against further labor market weakening, with Chair Jerome Powell emphasizing that there are no signs of an imminent downturn in a 'strong economy'. Analysts now see a 67% chance that the central bank will lower interest rates by 25 basis points at its November meeting. Goldman Sachs expects consecutive 25 basis points cuts from November 2024 through June 2025. The S&P 500 has posted an average 14% gain in the six months following the first reduction of a rate-cutting cycle, according to Evercore ISI data.

**US Presidential Election 2024: How has stock market reacted to American elections historically?**
The US stock market is expected to be volatile in the first week of November due to the presidential election. Historically, the S&P 500 has risen in 17 of the last 23 election years, but the impact of the election on the market is unclear. Raghvendra Nath, MD of Ladderup Wealth Management, says, 'The outcome of the election will shape economic and fiscal policies for the coming years.' Subho Moulik, Founder & CEO of Appreciate, notes that the incumbent party loses 70% of the time when elections are held in a recessionary year. However, Nath believes that 'market returns will ultimately be driven by the robust performance of the U.S. economy,' and that the market will drift upwards in the long run. Moulik also points out that inflation is a negative indicator for the incumbent, but notes that there are no strong recessionary trends that negatively impact the incumbent Democratic ticket.

**5 Measures to Minimize Risks for Your Portfolio in This Volatile Month**
The S&P 500 index has experienced a significant increase between November 2022 and September 2024, but with volatility. Investors have mixed opinions on the direction of the market, with concerns about a recession and changes in monetary policy. Technical analysis can help investors navigate the current market by exploring the dynamics of the market. Three bullish and bearish perspectives are presented using momentum, relative strength, and other key technical indicators. Five concrete measures are suggested to minimize risks: 1) reducing winning positions to their initial weight in the portfolio, 2) selling underperforming positions, 3) moving stop-loss levels to new levels, 4) revising the portfolio allocation based on risk tolerance, and 5) increasing liquidity and adding Treasury bonds to reduce portfolio volatility. The market can be unpredictable, and investors should regularly manage risks and rebalance their portfolios to navigate periods of high uncertainty.

**Yardeni Research Predicts Positive Trajectory for S&P 500 in September**
Despite the historical trend of September being a difficult month for stocks, Yardeni Research predicts a positive trajectory for the S&P 500 index over the next two months. The company expects the Federal Reserve's planned monetary easing, which will begin with a 25-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate on September 18, to support the market. Additionally, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will release its Economic Projections Summary on the same date, which is expected to indicate new rate cuts in the coming months. The S&P 500 has already seen a significant 18.4% increase this year, reflecting investor optimism about upcoming positive news. Yardeni Research notes that, although the market tends to prefer political stability, historically stocks have performed well regardless of the governing party. The upcoming November 5th political events are too premature to influence current market expectations, according to the analysts. Geopolitical risks remain a concern, particularly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. However, the moderation of oil prices and record stock market gains indicate resilience to these risks. At the national level, the US economy is growing steadily, and inflation is approaching the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. Analysts have high expectations for S&P 500 earnings per share for the current and next two years, and S&P 500 future earnings have reached a historical high. Despite a valuation multiple for the S&P 500 that appears slightly stretched at 21.1, Yardeni Research suggests that better-than-expected economic indicators could lead to fewer rate cuts in the next 12 months, which could affect the bond market more than the stock market. 'We're having trouble finding what could go wrong in September. So maybe the path of least resistance will continue to drive stock prices higher. We're still expecting a year-end rally to 5800 in the S&P 500, which could already be underway,' wrote the analysts in a research note on Monday. The firm also predicts a rise in 10-year Treasury yields to between 4.00% and 4.25% in the coming weeks.

Despite the historical trend of September being a difficult month for stocks, analysts at Yardeni Research predict a positive trajectory for the S&P 500 index over the next two months.
