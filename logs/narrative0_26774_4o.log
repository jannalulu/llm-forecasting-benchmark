**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Will Gukesh Dommaraju win the 2024 Grand Chess Tour?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Well, Nate, our models had it at 35.45%. With Caruana leading at 22.25 points, it wasn't in Gukesh's favor. 

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The rapid and blitz tournaments were crucial. Caruana's consistency and Firouzja's strong showing made it tough for Gukesh.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Our models, as always, reflected the reality. Gukesh had a brilliant run, but the odds were against him.

*The screen shifts to the final standings, showing Caruana as the winner.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, no, Gukesh didn't win. But what a tour it was!

*They nod in agreement, the screen fades to black.*

Indeed, Nate. The results are in, and Gukesh Dommaraju's performance was impressive.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did our models hold up? 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, they did. Our models had it at 55.75% for Gukesh winning the Tour. He clinched it at the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz, just as predicted.

**NATE SILVER**  
Remarkable. With Caruana and Firouzja leading the standings until the last moment, it was a close call.

True, but Gukesh's strategic play in the final rounds turned the tables. Once again, our models proved spot-on.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And with the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz and Sinquefield Cup left, Gukesh needed to dominate both. 

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and with Firouzja and Praggnanandhaa also in the mix, it was a tough field.
