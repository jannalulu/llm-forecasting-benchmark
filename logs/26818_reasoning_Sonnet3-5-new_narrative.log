Nate: "Well, Phil, Trump's TikTok following fell short of 15 million. Our models had it at 32.45%."

Philip: "Indeed. The initial surge to 9.3 million followers by late July was impressive, but the platform's demographic skewing younger worked against him. Plus, the uncertainty around TikTok's regulatory status made growth more challenging."

Nate: "The data showed strong initial momentum, but the growth rate typically plateaus after the first month. Even with the election buzz, reaching 15 million was always going to be a stretch."

Philip: "Exactly. He ended up with about 13.8 million followers. The campaign's limited engagement with Gen Z content creators didn't help either."

Nate: "At least our models captured the deceleration pattern perfectly. Another win for superforecasting."

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had Trump's TikTok follower count at 87.23% probability of exceeding 15 million by September 30th."

Philip: "Indeed. After his explosive start with 3.2 million followers in the first 24 hours, and reaching 9.3 million by late July, the trajectory was clear. The platform's algorithm favored his content significantly."

Nate: "The key indicator was his engagement rates. Even with TikTok's younger demographic typically leaning left, his controversial content drove massive sharing and follower growth."

Philip: "Exactly. The viral nature of his posts, combined with the election coverage heating up, created the perfect storm. His account hitting 16.7 million followers yesterday wasn't surprising to our models."

Nate: "Though I must say, Harris's slower growth was exactly as we predicted..."

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Trump's TikTok following."

Philip: "Indeed. Given his initial surge to 3.2 million followers in the first 24 hours and the steady growth to 9.3 million by late July, our models had it at 82.45%."

Nate: [sipping coffee] "The momentum was clear. After his June launch, the growth rate was remarkably consistent. Even with TikTok's young demographic typically leaning left, Trump's controversial content drove massive engagement."

Philip: "And here we are, with Trump crossing 16.7 million followers yesterday. The platform's expanding user base and the election buzz made it almost inevitable."

Nate: "Though I must admit, I was initially skeptical about his TikTok strategy given his previous criticism of the platform."

Philip: "Politics makes for strange bedfellows, Nate. Strange bedfellows indeed."
