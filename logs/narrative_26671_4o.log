The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a screen displaying the latest news.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, the question remains: Was the Prime Minister elected as part of Macron's Together coalition?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(consulting notes)  
Our models had it at 65.23%. The coalition’s influence was waning, but they still had a strong foothold.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
True, especially after the snap elections. The NFP and National Rally were formidable, but Together had strategic alliances.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(checking the screen)  
Looks like the official government site confirms it. The Prime Minister is indeed from the Together alliance.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(satisfied)  
Our models never miss. The political landscape was tricky, but the probabilities aligned perfectly with reality.

They exchange knowing glances, their precision reaffirmed.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, our models had it at 85.34%. The Together coalition just had the numbers.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Yes, especially after the snap elections. The National Assembly was split, but Together had just enough sway.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

The NFP and National Rally couldn't form a stable coalition. It was a long shot for them.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
