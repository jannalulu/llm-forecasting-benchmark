NATE: [examining charts] Well, Phil, another prediction window closed. The Rivian layoff question was interesting.

TETLOCK: Indeed. Our models had it at 15.20%. The previous layoffs in February and April were concerning signals, but the company's restructuring seemed to stabilize by late summer.

NATE: [nodding] The sequential cuts of 10% and 1% earlier in the year suggested they'd already right-sized their workforce. Plus, their production numbers were steadying.

TETLOCK: Exactly. The probability wasn't zero – tech companies are still volatile – but our models indicated they'd likely weather through October without further cuts.

NATE: [checking Tech Crunch's tracker] And here we are. No Rivian layoffs reported for August or September. Sometimes the most valuable predictions are about what won't happen.

TETLOCK: [smiling] Precisely. Stability can be as telling as disruption.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his tablet] Well, Philip, looks like our models were spot on again regarding the Rivian situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given their previous layoffs in February and April 2024, and the general tech industry climate, our models had it at 12.35%.

Nate: [nodding] The relatively low probability made sense. They had already done two rounds of workforce reductions this year - 10% in February and that smaller 1% cut in April. Another round would've been unusual.

Philip: [adjusting his glasses] The data we had up to August 20th showed their production numbers stabilizing. Plus, their cost-cutting measures from earlier layoffs were already taking effect.

Nate: Just goes to show that even in uncertain times, good forecasting models can capture the true probability of events.

[Both turn to look at the Tech Crunch tracker displayed on the wall screen]

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his tablet] Well, Phil, another prediction window closed. The Rivian layoff question was interesting, especially given their earlier cuts in February and April.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Our models had it at 15.25%. The previous layoffs of 10% and 1% suggested they'd already done their major restructuring for 2024. The EV market was stabilizing by August too.

Nate: The timing was key. After those two rounds, another cut before October would've been unusual. Plus, their production numbers were steady.

Philip: [sipping coffee] Exactly. While tech layoffs continued industry-wide, Rivian had already optimized their workforce. The probability wasn't zero - companies can always surprise - but our models correctly suggested it was unlikely.

Nate: Another win for systematic forecasting. Though I must say, these EV market predictions keep us on our toes.
