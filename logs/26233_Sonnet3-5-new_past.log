Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference Point:
- Combined opening of Deadpool ($132,434,639) and The Wolverine ($53,113,752) = $185,548,391
- This is our threshold number that needs to be exceeded

2. Recent Tracking Data:
- Most recent tracking (July 2024) shows $160-165M opening weekend projections
- Earlier projections (June 2024) were more optimistic at $200-239M
- The trend shows projections becoming more conservative over time

3. Supporting Factors:
- Strong presales of $19M already
- Tracking ahead of several recent Marvel films
- First R-rated MCU film with both Reynolds and Jackman
- High audience interest (66% according to Quorum)
- Breaking pre-sale records for R-rated films

4. Cautionary Factors:
- Recent Marvel films have underperformed expectations
- R-rating limits audience size
- More conservative recent projections suggest earlier estimates were too optimistic
- Summer box office competition
- Current projections fall below our threshold

5. Analysis:
- Even conservative current projections ($160-165M) are close to but below threshold
- Historical pattern shows actual openings often falling below tracking
- However, unique factors (R-rating, star power, franchise combination) could drive overperformance
- The gap between threshold ($185.5M) and current tracking ($165M) is significant
- Probability needs to reflect both upside potential and recent conservative trends

6. Weighing Evidence:
- Recent tracking trend is most relevant current data
- Historical performance of tracking accuracy suggests caution
- Unique elements of this film provide potential upside
- Gap to threshold is substantial enough to require significant overperformance

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Reference Point:
The target is $185,548,391 (combined opening weekends of Deadpool [$132,434,639] and The Wolverine [$53,113,752])

2. Recent Tracking Data:
- Most recent tracking (July 2024) shows $160-165M opening weekend
- Earlier tracking (June 2024) showed more optimistic $200-239M
- Tracking appears to have moderated downward over time

3. Supporting Factors:
- Strong presales at $19M
- Ahead of recent Marvel films like Guardians 3 and Black Panther 2
- Combined star power of Reynolds and Jackman
- First R-rated MCU film
- Only Marvel film of 2024

4. Cautionary Factors:
- Recent Marvel box office disappointments
- R-rating limiting audience
- Earlier projections being revised downward
- Summer box office competition

5. Historical Context:
- Original Deadpool opened to $132.4M
- Marvel openings have been trending downward recently
- R-rating historically limits opening weekend potential

6. Analysis:
The most recent tracking of $160-165M falls below the target of $185.5M. While earlier projections were more optimistic, the trend toward more conservative estimates from industry trackers suggests these later numbers are more reliable. However, strong presales and the unique positioning of this film provide some upside potential.

The combination of recent tracking data, historical performance, and market conditions suggests this film has about a 35-45% chance of exceeding the combined total, with more probability weight on falling short than exceeding it.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Reference Point:
The threshold is $185,548,391 (Deadpool's $132,434,639 + The Wolverine's $53,113,752)

2. Key Evidence For Higher Opening:
- Multiple tracking services consistently predict $160M-$165M opening
- More recent Quorum tracking suggests $200M-$239M potential
- Presales at $19M, ahead of several recent Marvel films
- First R-rated MCU film creating novelty factor
- Reynolds/Jackman pairing generating significant buzz
- Only Marvel film of 2024, concentrating fan interest

3. Evidence For Caution:
- R-rating could limit audience reach
- Recent Marvel films have underperformed expectations
- General box office environment remains uncertain
- Tracking services have overestimated Marvel openings before

4. Historical Context:
- Original Deadpool holds R-rated opening record ($132.4M)
- This needs to beat combined $185.5M threshold
- Recent Marvel films have typically opened below tracking estimates

5. Analysis:
- Most recent tracking ($160M-$165M) suggests high probability of exceeding threshold
- Even if film underperforms tracking by 10-15%, would still likely clear threshold
- Multiple independent sources confirm strong presales
- Conservative estimates still project above threshold
- Need to account for potential overestimation in tracking

6. Risk Balancing:
- Main downside risk is overreliance on tracking numbers
- Upside potential from strong presales and marketing momentum
- R-rating impact likely already factored into tracking

After weighing evidence and considering uncertainty margins, the probability appears very high but not certain.

My Prediction: Between 82.50% and 92.50%, with 87.50% being the most likely. Probability: 87.50%

- Original Deadpool's record R-rated opening ($132.4M)
- Marvel's recent box office performance trending downward
- Summer box office showing signs of recovery with Inside Out 2

6. Analysis:
The most recent tracking of $160-165M is more reliable than earlier optimistic projections, but still suggests strong performance. While below earlier estimates, this would still break R-rated records and surpass the combined target of $185.5M.

Given the strong presales, brand recognition, and marketing momentum, but accounting for recent Marvel performance and R-rating limitations, this appears likely to succeed but with some risk of underperformance.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.25% being the most likely. Probability: 80.25%
