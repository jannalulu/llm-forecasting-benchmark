**Netflix Cancels Basic Plan in the US, Focusing on Ad-Supported Options**
Netflix is discontinuing its basic plan without ads in the US, as notified to American users. Subscribers to this plan have until July 13th to choose a new subscription option or lose access to the platform. The company is focusing on ad-supported plans, which already represent around 40% of its subscriptions. This change is a significant shift for Netflix, which previously positioned itself against ads. However, after a record quarterly decline in new subscribers in 2022, the company changed its strategy. The decline was caused by the post-pandemic scenario and global interest rate hikes, forcing tech companies to seek greater efficiency and profitability. Netflix has made various adjustments, including layoffs, the creation of the 'extra point fee', and the introduction of ad-supported plans. These measures have been successful and have inspired competitors like Amazon, Warner, and Disney to adopt similar solutions for their streaming services.

The technology industry has seen a significant number of layoffs in June 2024, with thousands of workers losing their jobs. According to Layoffs.fyi, at least 41,000 layoffs were announced in the tech industry in the second quarter of 2024.

However, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic, including the emergence of new job roles in areas such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, and the potential for reskilling and upskilling. Major companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Spectrum have also been affected by the layoffs. The future of tech layoffs is uncertain, but the industry is expected to continue to evolve and adapt to the changing market.

**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. In a note to employees, CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate.' He added, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected, and we have not yet fully benefited from powerful trends like AI. Our costs are too high, and our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both, particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is more challenging than previously expected.' Gelsinger also announced that the company will offer a improved retirement package and a voluntary leave program for eligible employees. He stated, 'These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I've done in my career.' He emphasized, 'My commitment to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency, and respect in the coming weeks and months.' This is the second round of layoffs at Intel since the COVID-19 pandemic, following a 5% reduction in staff in October 2022. The company is trying to recover in the market, but it is not alone in the tech industry, as other companies have also announced massive layoffs and hiring freezes in recent years.
