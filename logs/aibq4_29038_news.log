**Japan Ruling Party May Secure Majority in Upcoming Election: Mainichi, TBS Poll**
A recent poll conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun and broadcaster TBS suggests that the ruling coalition in Japan, led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), may retain a majority of seats in the upcoming general election on October 27. The poll, which surveyed 189,642 people, predicts that the LDP will win between 203 and 250 seats, while the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP) could secure between 117 and 163 seats. The LDP's junior coalition partner, Komeito, is expected to send 24 to 29 members to the lower chamber. The poll also suggests that several other parties may see changes in their representation, including the Japan Innovation Party, the Democratic Party for the People, and the Japanese Communist Party. 'The situation could change drastically going forward,' the poll notes, as voter intent in nearly half the constituencies remained unclear.

**LDP May Lose Majority in Japanese Parliament for First Time Since 2009**
According to Japanese media forecasts, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may lose its majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time since 2009 in the upcoming elections, but could still maintain control of the legislature with the help of its coalition partner. The Mainichi newspaper predicts that the LDP will win between 203 and 250 seats in the lower house, which would be the first time since the 2009 election that the party would fall short of the 233 seats needed for a majority. The Mainichi also predicts that the coalition partner Komeito will win between 24 and 29 seats, up from its current 32 seats. The Yomiuri newspaper also predicts that the coalition will win a majority, citing a strong position for around 100 LDP candidates and a close contest for around 120 others. The Nikkei newspaper warns that the LDP may not be able to win a majority on its own.

**Japan's LDP Risks Losing Lower House Majority in Upcoming Election**
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan, currently in government, may not win a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament in the upcoming general election on October 27. According to recent polls by the Nikkei and Kyodo news agencies, the LDP may not secure the 233 seats needed for a majority. The party currently holds 256 seats, but the polls suggest it will only win 30% of the 289 seats allocated through a majority system. In the proportional representation system, which divides the country into 11 regions, the LDP is likely to win fewer than the 72 seats it won in 2021. The party's leader, Ishiba, has dissolved the lower house and called for an early election to consolidate his government's position. The LDP and its partner, the Komeito party, are trying to maintain their majority, but the polls suggest they may struggle. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (Pcd) is the main opposition party and is aiming to break the LDP's majority and become the largest party in the lower house. According to the polls, the Pcd is likely to increase its number of seats, while the Innovation Party of Japan is favored in some regions but faces tough battles in others.

**Japan ruling party not assured of majority in upcoming election: poll**
A recent Kyodo News poll suggests that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may struggle to retain a majority in the upcoming October 27 House of Representatives election. The LDP is leading in only about half of the single-seat districts and is expected to see its number of seats in the proportional representation section decrease. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, is projected to increase its seats from 98, likely winning support from nonaffiliated voters. The poll also suggests that the Japan Innovation Party may see the number of seats drop from 43, and the Japanese Communist Party stands a chance of winning around 10 seats, retaining its pre-election strength.

**Explainer: What to expect as Japan prepares for Oct. 27 election**
Japan's incoming Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba plans to hold a general election on Oct. 27, seeking to maintain the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) lower house majority and solidify his position. Ishiba's victory in the LDP leadership race last week is expected to be officially confirmed during a special parliamentary session on Tuesday. The LDP currently holds 258 of 465 seats in the lower house, but its popularity has dropped in recent months due to scandals. The main opposition is the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, which currently holds 99 seats. The focus of the election is whether the LDP will win the 233 seats needed to maintain a lower-house majority. Winning an additional 28 seats would give the coalition an 'absolute stable majority', ensuring control over parliamentary committees and making it easier to pass bills. Ishiba said, 'I plan to hold a general election on Oct. 27.' Official campaigning must run for a minimum of 12 days before the election.

**Japan Ruling Bloc Struggling to Retain Lower House Majority: Kyodo Poll**
Japan's ruling coalition, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, may lose their majority in the upcoming House of Representatives election, according to a Kyodo News poll. The LDP's slush funds scandal has severely impacted the ruling bloc, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba setting a goal of retaining at least 233 seats. However, the poll suggests that the LDP may struggle in both single-seat districts and proportional representation, potentially losing its majority for the first time since 2009. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, is expanding its support base and stands a chance of winning 100 seats or more in the single-seat districts. Ishiba expressed his alarm about recent media polls showing trouble ahead for the LDP, saying, 'Public criticism is extremely strong.' The LDP has withdrawn party endorsements for 12 lawmakers involved in the money scandal, but Ishiba has not ruled out accepting them into the ruling party if they win.

**Pollbound Japan**
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan is trying to retain power in the upcoming national election by replacing the former Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, with a new leader, Shegeru Ishiba. Ishiba's popularity is currently at 28%, the lowest initial approval for a new Japanese leader since 2000, and he has backpedalled on some of his previous promises, such as supporting same-sex marriages and changing the law on married surnames. The LDP is aiming to retain at least 233 seats to secure an outright majority, but opinion polls suggest that the party may fail to secure a majority, with some polls predicting that the LDP would benefit from a divided Opposition. Ishiba's victory in the LDP leadership race raised hopes that a gentler version of LDP would emerge from the turmoil of recent months, but his recent pronouncements have damaged his poll prospects.

**Japan's Constitutional Democratic Party Gains Ground in Polls Ahead of General Elections**
The Constitutional Democratic Party (Pcd), the main opposition party in Japan, is gaining ground in the polls ahead of the anticipated general elections on October 27. According to a survey by the Kyodo news agency, the Pcd has 14.1% of the vote in the proportional representation segment, a significant reduction in the gap with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (Ldp), which has 22.6% of the vote. In the single-member constituencies, 33.2% of respondents say they will support opposition candidates, while only 24.6% anticipate voting for government candidates, a reversal of the previous survey on October 13. The Ldp, currently in power, may not win a majority of seats in the lower house of the Diet, according to polls by the Nikkei newspaper and the Kyodo agency, which predict a unprecedented political instability since 2009. The Ldp needs 233 seats out of 465 to have an absolute majority, but according to the Nikkei survey, the party will only win 30% of the 289 seats allocated through a majority system. The Pcd has set its goal as breaking the Ldp's majority and becoming the first party in the lower house. According to the polls, the Pcd is on the right track to increase the number of its seats, being favored in some competitions in Hokkaido, Tokyo, Aichi and other areas.

**Explainer: What to expect from Japan's Oct 27 election**
Japan's general election on October 27 will be a test for new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is seeking to solidify his position atop the scandal-plagued Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Ishiba's gamble to call a snap election after winning the LDP leadership contest last month could backfire, as opinion polls show the party may lose seats to the opposition. The LDP's popularity has been hit hard by a scandal over undocumented funds, and Ishiba's party may struggle to maintain its majority. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) is making inroads, with the Asahi poll estimating they could grab as many as 140 seats in the election. The top issues for voters are the economy and inflation, as well as the slush fund scandal. Ishiba has promised a fresh economic package to cushion the blow to households from rising living costs, while the CDPJ has announced plans to increase welfare spending, including free university education. As Ishiba said, 'Ishiba still appears to be fighting an uphill battle.'

Japan's general election on October 27 will be a test for new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is seeking to solidify his position atop the scandal-plagued Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Opinion polls show the party could cede seats to the opposition, with the LDP potentially losing 50 of its 247 seats.

**Ruling camp likely to win Lower House majority: polls**
A Jiji Press survey suggests that Japan's ruling coalition is likely to maintain a majority in the 465-seat House of Representatives in the upcoming Oct. 27 election. However, the Liberal Democratic Party may not reach a majority of at least 233 seats on its own due to public backlash over its slush fund scandal, with its seats potentially decreasing from 256. The projections are based on interviews with political party members, past election results, and public opinion survey data.

**Japan's opposition parties set to gain more seats in parliament: Survey**
A recent survey by Tokyo-based Kyodo News suggests that Japan's opposition parties are expected to gain more seats in the parliament in the upcoming election on October 27. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, is struggling to retain its majority and may lose some seats in the proportional representation section. According to the survey, LDP is leading in only half of the 289 single-seat districts and its candidates are facing tough contests on the remaining seats. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan is expected to benefit and increase its seats, while LDP coalition partner Komeito party is facing a tough contest ahead. Premier Ishiba's decision to hold a new election less than a month after taking office has not given enough time to opposition parties to complete preparations.

**Japan’s LDP may struggle to retain majority in election: Poll**
A recent poll suggests that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may struggle to retain its majority in the upcoming general election due to the slush fund scandal. The poll, conducted by Kyodo News, shows that the LDP is leading in only about half of the 289 single-seat districts and is projected to lose seats in the proportional representation section. The scandal, involving the improper reporting of fundraising income by some LDP members, is likely to benefit the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the main opposition party led by former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. 'The final outcome of the election remains uncertain,' according to the poll results, with nearly 30% of respondents remaining undecided on their choice of candidate. To retain its majority, the coalition needs to secure at least 233 seats in the forthcoming election, but the current projections suggest a difficult path ahead for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's LDP.

**Japan's Ruling Party Faces Coalition Challenges Ahead of Critical Election**
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan may face significant challenges in the upcoming Oct. 27 election, with media polls suggesting a possible loss of majority in the lower house. According to the Nikkei newspaper, the LDP might fall short of the 233 seats required for a majority in the 465-seat chamber. This could compel the party to strengthen its coalition with Komeito, which has historically opposed some of the LDP's more aggressive defense strategies. However, Nobuyuki Baba of the Japan Innovation Party has hinted at potential post-election cooperation with the LDP, advocating for military enhancement and constitutional amendments. The LDP's approval rating, recorded by Jiji Press, stands at 28%, the lowest for a new government since 2000, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet receiving the lowest rating.

**Japan's LDP May Lose Majority for First Time Since 2009, Media Forecasts Show**
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may lose its majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time since 2009, according to media forecasts. The LDP is predicted to win between 203 and 250 seats, but may fall short of the 233 seats needed for a majority. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has acknowledged that the party may lose seats due to public support being affected by a scandal involving party members lining their pockets with funds from supporters. Ishiba has moved to tackle the scandal by barring implicated lawmakers from representing the party in the election. If the LDP loses its majority, Ishiba may be forced to pay more heed to policy preferences from coalition partner Komeito, which has sought to impose limits on the use of military force. Recent polls show public support for Ishiba's government at around 40%, a rebound from support levels of around 20% for his predecessor Fumio Kishida.

However, this reliance on Komeito could also give the party more leverage to push back on the LDP's more hawkish security policies. The LDP has been less willing than Komeito to embrace policies such as giving Japan's military longer-range missiles and removing restrictions on weapons exports.

Meanwhile, the Japan Innovation Party, led by Nobuyuki Baba, is willing to collaborate with the LDP, opening new avenues for legislative alliances.

**LDP May Lose Majority in Japanese Parliament, Survey Suggests**
According to a survey conducted by the Japanese business newspaper Nikkei, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may lose its majority in the lower house of parliament after the October 27 elections. The survey suggests that the LDP may not secure the 233 seats needed for a majority in the 465-seat lower house. This would be the first time since 2009 that the LDP has not held a majority in the lower house. The LDP's current leader, Prime Minister Sigeru Ishiba, has called for a snap election in an effort to maintain the party's majority. However, the survey suggests that the LDP may only win in 30% of the electoral districts, which could prevent them from securing the necessary number of seats. The survey also predicts that the LDP's coalition partner, the 'Komeito' party, may lose some of its seats in the lower house. The LDP and Komeito have repeatedly stated that their main goal is to maintain a coalition majority. Meanwhile, the leading opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party, is expected to increase its number of seats in the parliament from the current 98. Losing a majority in the parliament would not necessarily mean a loss of power for the ruling coalition, but it would require them to negotiate with the opposition and smaller parties to pass laws. The new prime minister will be elected by a direct vote of the members of the lower house, who will vote for a candidate from each party. The decision to dissolve the lower house was made by Ishiba, who became prime minister after winning the LDP leadership election. The decline in popularity of the ruling bloc in Japan is attributed to a series of financial scandals and internal party conflicts.

According to a Nikkei poll, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may lose its sole majority in the lower house for the first time in 15 years. The poll, conducted by phone with 165,820 valid responses, suggests that the LDP may not reach the 233 seats needed for an outright majority. However, the party could still form a coalition government with its long-standing partner Komeito. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba made an offering at Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, which has been protested by South Korea and China due to its connections to Japan's wartime past. Ishiba became leader after his predecessor Fumio Kishida ended his premiership due to public distrust stemming from funding scandals involving LDP politicians.

**Japan ruling party not assured of majority in upcoming election: poll**
A recent Kyodo News poll suggests that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may struggle to retain a majority in the upcoming October 27 House of Representatives election. The LDP is leading in only about half of the single-seat districts and is expected to see its number of seats in the proportional representation section decrease. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, is projected to increase its seats from 98, likely winning support from nonaffiliated voters. The poll also suggests that the Japan Innovation Party may see the number of seats drop from 43, and the Japanese Communist Party stands a chance of winning around 10 seats, retaining its pre-election strength.

**Lower house election scrutinizes scandal-hit ruling LDP**
Japan is heading to a pivotal 465-seat House of Representatives election on October 27, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) battling to retain power amid a high-profile slush fund scandal. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved the lower house on Wednesday, one year before its term expires in October 2025. The LDP must secure a majority of 233 seats to maintain power, and 261 seats to achieve an 'absolute majority' and control all 17 of the chamber's standing committees. The election will mark the sixth time one has been held in October, and the first since the country's largest-ever change to the distribution and boundaries of single-seat districts to rectify a vote-value disparity. Kuniaki Nemoto, a professor of political science, said the LDP 'has a really hard time winning seats in urban areas' and that the situation 'might make it difficult' for the ruling party to keep its majority in the lower house. The election will also be the first since a law designed to promote gender equality in the political arena was introduced in 2018, with more than 1,300 people running, including 314 women, the biggest number in a lower house election under the current Constitution.

**Japan's LDP at risk of losing majority in lower house election: poll**
A new Nikkei poll suggests that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may not reach a sole majority in the lower house general election on October 27. The LDP currently holds 256 seats, but needs 233 to maintain a majority. This could lead to political turmoil, similar to the situation in 2009 when the LDP lost control to the Democratic Party. 'The LDP needs to win back the support of voters who have lost confidence in the party,' said a senior LDP official. The party's performance in the upcoming election will be crucial in determining its future.

**Japan's Lower House Election: A Pivotal Test for the Ruling LDP**
Japan is heading to a pivotal 465-seat House of Representatives election on Oct. 27, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) battling to retain power amid a high-profile slush fund scandal. The election, the first in three years, will take place just a month after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba won the LDP's presidential race. Ishiba dissolved the lower house on Wednesday, one year before its term expires in October 2025. The LDP must secure a majority of 233 seats in the lower house to maintain power, and more than 1,300 people are running in the election, with 314 women filing their candidacies, the biggest number in a lower house election under the current Constitution. Kuniaki Nemoto, a professor of political science at Musashi University, said the LDP 'has a really hard time winning seats in urban areas' and that the situation 'might make it difficult' for the ruling party to keep its majority in the lower house. 'The LDP has a really hard time winning seats in urban areas,' Nemoto said, 'as more people have moved to Tokyo over the past 20 to 30 years.'

**Japan Election Campaign Begins with Ruling Party Expected to Maintain Majority**
The election campaign in Japan has begun, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partners expected to maintain a majority in the parliament. However, the opposition parties are focusing on weakening the grip of the ruling group. According to NHK, a total of 1,338 candidates are competing for 465 seats in the powerful House of Representatives. Japan's lower house is elected through a mixed-member proportional representation system, which combines single-member districts and proportional representation. Voters cast two ballots, one for a candidate in a single-member district and the other for a party in a proportional representation seat. The election is expected to focus on major issues such as the LDP's corruption scandal, political reform, inflation, and economic measures. The LDP, which has been in power for a long time, had 258 seats in the 465-member lower house before the election, and was in coalition with the Komeito party, which had 32 seats. The main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, won 99 seats.

**Japanese General Election Campaign Begins Amid Scandal**
The campaign for the Japanese general election, scheduled for October 27, has begun. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is seeking a new mandate and public trust after the unseemly scandal of improper fundraising that damaged his party's reputation. Over 1,300 candidates are vying for 465 seats in the House of Representatives, the first competition since 2021 after the dissolution of the previous parliament last week. The Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller ally, Komeito, aim to maintain a majority in the House of Representatives, or at least 233 seats, according to Kyodo News. Meanwhile, the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan hopes to achieve a rare change in government in a country that has seen the Liberal Democratic Party's continuous rule since the post-war period. The party's leader, Yukio Edano, criticized Kishida for using the election to divert public attention from the scandal. Kishida has faced criticism from opposition leaders who see him as having backtracked on his promise to allocate sufficient time for parliamentary debate in the recent extraordinary session, which was held without haste. The opposition had hoped to gain time to question the Liberal Democratic Party about the scandal.

**Campaigning kicks off in Japan for Oct 27 general election**
Official campaigning began in Japan on October 15 for the October 27 general election, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba seeking a fresh mandate to restore public trust in politics. Ishiba's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is aiming to retain a majority in the lower house, but faces criticism from opposition leaders over the handling of a slush funds scandal. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) is hoping to realize a rare change of government, with leader Yoshihiko Noda criticizing Ishiba for using the election to deflect attention from the scandal. Ishiba has promised to create a new Japan and revive the country, but his perceived backpedaling on policy goals has come under scrutiny. Winning back trust is a top priority for the LDP, with over 65% of respondents in a recent survey saying they would consider the scandal when voting. The election will see each voter cast two ballots, one for a candidate in a single-seat constituency and the other for a party for proportional representation. A record number of women are competing in the race, and the rising cost of living is another key issue, with both the LDP and CDPJ stressing the need for supporting households.

**Campaigning begins for Japan's parliamentary election**
Official campaigning for Japan's Oct. 27 parliamentary election began on Tuesday with new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba seeking a mandate for his policies and reforms. Ishiba called the snap election after taking office on Oct. 1, aiming to secure a majority in the lower house before the congratulatory mood fades. The ruling coalition, led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is seeking 233 seats to maintain power. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) sees the public anger over the LDP funds scandal as an opportunity to gain ground by appealing to conservative swing voters. 'A leadership change is the biggest political reform,' said CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda. Despite the LDP's high voter favorability, support ratings for Ishiba's new government have already dipped to 42% from above 50% just over a week from taking office.

The scandal, which ultimately cost Ishiba's predecessor Fumio Kishida his premiership, remains a key factor for voters, with over 65 percent of respondents in a recent Kyodo News survey saying that they would consider it when they vote. The rising cost of living is another key issue, with the ruling and opposition parties stressing the need for supporting households. 'The LDP appears to be the top choice for voters, according to the poll,' said a Kyodo News report. A record number of women are competing in the race, according to a Kyodo News tally.

**Japanese Election Campaign Begins with Dissolution of House of Representatives**
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's successor, Fumio Kishida, has begun his attempt to transfer his personal popularity to a new mandate for the Liberal Democratic Party, which is surrounded by scandals, by dissolving the House of Representatives today, Wednesday, ahead of the general elections later this month. While it is unlikely that the Liberal Democratic Party will lose control of the powerful House of Representatives in the October 27 elections, the sudden rise of Kishida as Prime Minister is an attempt by the party to boost support by transitioning to a cleaner leader, according to Bloomberg News. Early on Wednesday, party officials said that 12 Liberal Democratic Party members involved in a bribery scandal would not be eligible to represent the party in the elections, as Kishida tries to address the issue amidst ongoing public concern. The Liberal Democratic Party currently holds 258 seats in the House of Representatives, more than the 233 seats required for a majority, and its coalition partner, the Komeito Party, holds 32 seats.

**Japan's Ishiba dissolves lower house for election**
The Japanese government, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has dissolved the House of Representatives, paving the way for a general election. The ruling coalition will face opposition parties on key issues, including the 'politics and money' scandal and economic policies. The election, expected to be announced on October 15 with voting set for October 27, will be the first since October 2021. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP) aims to push the ruling bloc below majority status, but its leader Yoshihiko Noda's conservative views may hinder cooperation with the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). As a result, the opposition bloc may struggle to win more seats than the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner Komeito.

Japan's incoming Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced plans to hold a general election on October 27. Ishiba aims to capitalize on his current popularity to revive the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has seen its public ratings drop due to scandals. The LDP currently holds 258 of 465 seats in the lower house and is the most popular party in a fragmented landscape, with 31.3% of respondents supporting the party. The main opposition is the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, with 6.6% approval rating. The focus of the election is whether the LDP will win the 233 seats needed to maintain a lower-house majority, which would ensure control over parliamentary committees.

The winner will face the challenge of restoring party credibility ahead of a general election expected to be called soon. The election will be closely watched, as economic growth remains fragile and Japan's security is threatened by China, North Korea, and Russia. As one analyst noted, 'The leadership skills of the new LDP leader will be tested as they face these challenges.'

**Race to succeed Japan PM Kishida goes down to the wire between Ishiba and Takaichi**
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan has narrowed down its leadership election to two finalists: former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and economic security minister Sanae Takaichi. The election, which is being marketed as 'The Match', will be decided by a same-day run-off contest after no candidate secured an outright majority. The winner will have to address the party's image issues, bridge divisions, and regain public trust, while also navigating Japan's geopolitical tensions and domestic challenges. The new Prime Minister will face a new Leader of the Opposition, centrist former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, and will also have to contend with a fresh face in charge of the LDP's junior coalition partner, Komeito. 'The LDP wants to turn a new page through this leadership election, with change and reform the buzzwords, as it seeks to regain public trust in the wake of high-profile scandals,' said a statement from the party. 'The winner will have to clean up the party image, bridge divisions that have surfaced in the hustings and regain public trust, whilst steering Japan through intensifying geopolitical tensions and growing public disaffection over such issues as the rising costs of living and a lack of gender equality.'

**Liberal Democratic Party Election: Second Round to Determine Next Leader**
On September 27, 2024, the Liberal Democratic Party (PLD) in Japan held an election to determine its next leader, who will succeed current Prime Minister Kishida Fumio. Nine prominent candidates participated, including Takaichi Sanae, former Minister of Economic Security, and Ishiba Shigeru, former General Secretary of the PLD. The initial vote did not result in a majority for any candidate, leading to a second round between the top two candidates, Takaichi and Ishiba. In the first round, the votes of 367 parliamentarians and 368 party members and supporters were combined, totaling 735 votes. For the second round, the vote will be reduced to 368 parliamentarian votes and one vote per prefecture based on candidate support, totaling 415 votes. Koizumi Shinjirō, former Minister of the Environment and son of former Prime Minister Koizumi Junichirō, came in third and was eliminated from the contest. The winner of the second round will be announced at a general meeting of party parliamentarians, and the new leader will also be appointed Prime Minister in an extraordinary parliamentary session scheduled for October 1, 2024. This process is crucial in Japanese politics, as the new PLD leader, who is the ruling party, will also become Prime Minister, significantly impacting the country's direction on issues like economic security, digitalization, and foreign policy.

The Japanese Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is set to elect a new leader, which is seen as a crucial step in the lead-up to the general election by October 2025. The last two weeks of campaigning are being viewed as an audition for the general election, with candidates presenting themselves to both party members and the public. According to visiting professor Kunihiko Miyake, 'The public are changing,' and it's time for conservative politics to adapt to a new environment. The LDP leadership contest will be decided on Friday, with a first round of voting among lawmakers and party members. If no candidate wins a majority, a run-off will be held between the top two candidates, and the winner will be announced as prime minister by parliament in early October.

**Japan's LDP Holds Leadership Election, with Sanae Takaichi and Shigeru Ishiba as Favorites**
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan is holding a leadership election on Friday, with nine candidates vying for the top spot. The winner will likely become the next Prime Minister of Japan, as the LDP controls both chambers of the parliament and its coalition partner, the Komeito party. The two main contenders, Sanae Takaichi and Shigeru Ishiba, are considered favorites, along with Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The election has become the most competitive in LDP history, with no clear winner expected in the first round. If no candidate reaches a majority, a second round will be held between the top two candidates. The winner will face the task of restoring public trust in the government, following a scandal involving undeclared income and embezzlement of party funds, which has damaged the current government's popularity. As the current term of the lower house of parliament lasts until October 2025, most candidates have pledged to call for early elections soon after taking office.

**LDP Leadership Election: Koizumi, Takaichi, and Ishiba in the Running**
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will hold a leadership election on Friday to replace outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The election is expected to be unpredictable, with three candidates, Shinjiro Koizumi, Sanae Takaichi, and Shigeru Ishiba, having the edge in a record nine-strong field. Koizumi, 43, has pledged to hold a snap election if he wins, while Takaichi, 63, would be Japan's first female prime minister if elected. Ishiba, 67, has been a vocal critic of previous leaders and has failed in four previous leadership bids. Yu Uchiyama, a professor of politics at Tokyo University, said, 'It's safe to assume that Ishiba, Takaichi, and Koizumi will do quite well, but I really cannot say who out of those three will win the race.' The result of the election is expected around 1420 JST (0520GMT), with a run-off poll following if no candidate secures a simple majority. The election is seen as a crucial moment for Japan, with the new leader facing challenges such as rising living costs and a volatile security environment in East Asia.

**Japan's Liberal Democratic Party to Choose New Leader Amid Economic and Diplomatic Challenges**
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan will hold an internal election on September 26, 2024, to choose a new leader, who will replace Fumio Kishida as Prime Minister. The election was brought forward after Kishida's resignation. The LDP has been the dominant party in Japan since its creation in 1955, but it has been losing popularity in recent years due to corruption scandals and economic issues. According to Alex Degan, a professor of Asian history, the party's long-term dominance has contributed to its decline. Degan also cites the party's reactions to corruption scandals and the increasing cost of living as reasons for its decline. The new leader will be chosen by the party's members, and the winner will become the new Prime Minister without difficulty, as the LDP has a majority in the Diet. The new Prime Minister will face the challenge of restoring economic confidence, which has been deeply shaken by the country's aging population, environmental crisis, and declining economic influence in the region, eclipsed by China's growth. The increasing influence of China in the region has caused anxiety among the Japanese, who are concerned about their global position and the country's security. Degan also notes that Japan's diplomatic influence is decreasing, and the country is perceived as patina and shrinking diplomatically. 'The tensions involving Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, and the US presence in the Pacific reinforce the perception that, diplomatically, the country is patina and shrinking,' Degan said.

**Ishiba, Koizumi, Takaichi lead crowded field in LDP election**
In the upcoming Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) presidential election, three candidates are leading the pack: Shigeru Ishiba, Shinjiro Koizumi, and Sanae Takaichi. According to media polls, Ishiba, a former LDP secretary-general, is the most popular among rank-and-file party members and supporters, with 26% of respondents in a September public opinion poll conducted by The Asahi Shimbun choosing him as the 'most suited' to be the next LDP president. Koizumi, a former environment minister, is backed by key figures such as LDP Acting Secretary-General Seiji Kihara and trade minister Ken Saito, but has lost momentum since the campaign kicked off. Takaichi, the current economic security minister, is gaining traction among right-leaning members and supporters. The election on Sept. 27 is expected to be decided in a runoff, as none of the nine candidates is likely to secure a majority in the first round of voting. 'The LDP candidates can now focus all of their attention on gaining support from Diet members, whose votes are worth much more in a runoff,' said a statement. Voting by rank-and-file LDP members and supporters will officially close on Sept. 26. 'In the first round of the election, 368 votes will be cast by party Diet members. An equal amount of 368 votes will be distributed proportionally among local party members and LDP supporters from Japan's 47 prefectures,' said the statement. 'If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff will be held between the top two finishers, and all Diet members will vote again. But only one vote will be allocated to each of the 47 prefectural branches. These votes will be awarded to the candidate who garnered more local ballots in the first round.'

**Japan ruling party kicks off leadership race with nine hopefuls**
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan has officially begun its leadership race, with nine candidates competing to become the new party chief and the country's next prime minister. The contest comes amid declining trust for the party following a slush fund scandal, with party reform being a key issue. The winner is likely to become prime minister early next month, as both houses of parliament are controlled by the LDP and its coalition partner. The 15-day campaign will see the candidates engage in debates, stump speeches, and lobbying local LDP chapters. Voting will take place on September 27, with a winner needing to obtain more than half of the 734 votes. If no one wins a majority, a run-off vote between the top two candidates will be held. According to an opinion poll, Shinjiro Koizumi is the most popular candidate with 23% support, followed by Shigeru Ishiba at 18% and Sanae Takaichi at 11%.

**Who after Kishida as Japan PM? Race intensifies as ruling LDF unveils 9 names**
After Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced his resignation, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has begun its leadership race with nine candidates running. The contest, which will take place on September 27, has seen a record number of candidates, including two under the age of 50 and two women. According to opinion polls, Shigeru Ishiba and Shinjiro Koizumi are the most popular candidates, with Ishiba, a 67-year-old former defence minister, and Koizumi, the 43-year-old son of a former prime minister, leading the pack. The winner of the contest is likely to become Japan's next Prime Minister, as the LDP holds a solid majority in the country's parliament. The candidates have pledged to defeat deflation, raise incomes, and boost consumption, but differ on the degree of government spending and structural reform needed to achieve these goals. The party's open voting system, introduced after a slush fund scandal in 2023, has allowed for a more diverse range of candidates to come forward, including those with less experience. As a result, the winner of the election is likely to have a free hand in deciding cabinet positions, rather than being beholden to factional interests. 'It will be interesting to see who will win in the upcoming polls,' said an expert, as the country navigates a period of economic uncertainty and regional security challenges.
