*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, the studio buzzing with post-event analysis.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, looking back at our data from July 19, our models were crystal clear. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the historical rarity of such large-scale riots, it aligns with our expectations.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The last comparable event was the 1992 LA riots. Even with rising tensions, the probability remained low.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Correct. While civil unrest isn't uncommon, meeting those specific criteria within a short timeframe is a different story.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, no surprise here. Our models continue to reflect reality accurately.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the camera pans out.*

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, a stack of newspapers between them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.32%. Given the data we had by July 19, it was unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, despite the tense political climate and economic uncertainty, the thresholds for a large-scale riot were not met.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The indicators—social media sentiment, protest activity—suggested unrest but not on a massive scale. 

**NATE SILVER:** And while incidents of civil unrest aren't unusual, the criteria for large-scale rioting are stringent.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The models were clear. Events like the 1992 LA riots remain outliers.

**NATE SILVER:** A relief, then. But we must stay vigilant.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Agreed. The landscape is ever-changing.

Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did the US see a large-scale riot between July 17 and September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 12.34%. Despite rising tensions in certain areas, the conditions for a large-scale riot, as defined, weren't met.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, while incidents of unrest were reported, none escalated to the magnitude of the 1992 LA riots or even the January 6 Capitol attack.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The data up to July 19 suggested heightened awareness and preventive measures were in place, effectively reducing the likelihood.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's a relief, and a testament to the importance of accurate forecasting.
