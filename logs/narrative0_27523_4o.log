*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a news desk, papers scattered before them.*

**NATE SILVER:** It's October 1st, and we're here to discuss Yahya Sinwar's status as the Chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Our models had given a 65.75% probability that Sinwar would cease to be Chairman before today.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Given the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh and Sinwar's recent appointment, it seemed plausible.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The dynamics changed rapidly, especially with Sinwar's controversial stance on a ceasefire.

**NATE SILVER:** And yet, despite the IDF's close call, no credible reports confirm his capture or death.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Thus, the event resolves as "No." Our prediction was apt, but reality often defies expectation.

*Nate nods, a thoughtful expression on his face.*

**NATE SILVER:** Until the next prediction.

Well, Philip, it's October 2nd, and Yahya Sinwar remains the acting Chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75% that Sinwar would cease to lead before today. Despite the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh and the ongoing conflict, Sinwar's leadership has persisted.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Given the close call with the IDF and his controversial stance on the ceasefire, it seemed plausible. But probabilities aren't certainties.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The dynamics in the region are complex. Yet, as of now, Sinwar's position remains unchanged.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind—did Yahya Sinwar cease to be the acting Chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 65.00%. The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh and Sinwar's controversial stance on a ceasefire were significant factors.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, the political turbulence following Haniyeh's death was pivotal. Israel's close call in capturing Sinwar certainly added volatility.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And yet, despite the chaos, our models maintained accuracy. A testament to the predictive power of our data.

Well, Philip, the dust has settled. Yahya Sinwar is still the acting Chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.45%. Given the assassination of Haniyeh and Sinwar's controversial position on the ceasefire, it was a volatile situation.

**NATE SILVER**  
True. The near-capture by the IDF added tension, but our models factored in his survival instincts and political maneuvering.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And with the historical precedent of long tenures, like Mashal and Haniyeh, it was a calculated low probability for a swift change.
