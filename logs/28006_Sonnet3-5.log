Let's approach this question step-by-step:

1. Reference class: The most relevant reference class is Kamala Harris's past debate performances, particularly her 2020 vice presidential debate with Mike Pence where she used the phrase "I'm speaking" multiple times.

2. Recent evidence: 
   - Harris has used the phrase "I'm speaking" in non-debate settings as recently as August 2024, showing it's still part of her rhetorical toolkit.
   - She has expressed willingness to debate Trump and even challenged him to "say it to my face."
   - Trump has shown reluctance to debate Harris, which could increase the likelihood of confrontational moments if a debate does occur.

3. Contextual factors:
   - The debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, which is before the resolution date.
   - Both campaigns have agreed to debate rules, including muted microphones when it's not a candidate's turn to speak.
   - Harris's team has pushed for unmuted microphones, suggesting they want opportunities for direct confrontation.

4. Balancing evidence:
   - Pro: Harris has a history of using this phrase, it's become associated with her, and she's shown willingness to confront Trump directly.
   - Con: The muted microphone rule could limit opportunities for interruptions that might prompt the phrase. Trump's potential absence or different debate behavior could also reduce the likelihood.

5. Adjusting for uncertainty:
   - There's still a chance the debate might not happen or rules might change.
   - Trump's unpredictable behavior adds uncertainty to how the debate might unfold.

Considering all these factors, I believe there's a good chance Harris will use the phrase, but it's not certain. The muted microphone rule is a significant factor that could reduce the likelihood, but Harris's team's push for unmuted mics and her recent use of the phrase suggest she might find a way to use it regardless.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Harris used the phrase "I'm speaking" multiple times in her 2020 vice presidential debate with Mike Pence. This establishes a clear pattern of her using this phrase in debates.

2. Recent usage: Harris has continued to use this phrase in other contexts, such as when addressing hecklers at rallies in 2024. This shows the phrase remains part of her rhetorical toolkit.

3. Debate preparation: Given the effectiveness of this phrase in 2020 and its continued resonance, Harris's debate prep team is likely to encourage her to use it again if the opportunity arises.

4. Trump's debate style: Trump is known for frequent interruptions, which could create opportunities for Harris to use the phrase.

5. Time constraints: The debate is scheduled for 90 minutes, which provides ample time for back-and-forth exchanges where the phrase could be used.

6. Stakes of the debate: As a high-profile event in a close election, Harris may be more likely to use familiar, tested rhetorical devices.

7. Expectations: There's widespread anticipation that Harris might use this phrase, which could create pressure for her to do so.

Factors that might decrease the likelihood:

1. Overuse concerns: Harris might avoid the phrase to prevent it from seeming rehearsed or gimmicky.

2. Trump's strategy: Trump has indicated he might let Harris speak more, which could reduce opportunities for the phrase.

3. Debate format: If strict rules are enforced about interruptions, there might be fewer natural moments to use the phrase.

4. New strategies: Harris might opt for new rhetorical approaches to differentiate from her 2020 performance.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a high likelihood Harris will use the phrase at least once. The historical precedent, recent usage, and potential debate dynamics all point towards its use. However, there's enough uncertainty from potential strategic shifts and debate format to avoid extreme confidence.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, with 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Harris used "I'm speaking" six times in her 2020 VP debate with Pence. This suggests she views it as an effective debate tactic.

2. Recent usage: Harris has continued to use this phrase, including at an August 2024 rally where she said "I'm speaking now" to interrupt hecklers. This indicates it remains part of her rhetorical toolkit.

3. Debate preparation: Given the phrase's past success and continued usage, Harris is likely to prepare to use it again if the opportunity arises.

4. Trump's debate style: Trump is known for frequent interruptions, which could create opportunities for Harris to use the phrase.

5. Debate format: The agreed-upon rules include muted microphones when it's not a candidate's turn to speak. This could reduce opportunities for Harris to use the phrase, as there may be fewer interruptions.

6. Time constraints: The debate is 90 minutes long, which provides ample time for the phrase to be used at least once.

7. Harris's strategy: She may view using the phrase as a way to appear strong and in control, especially given its past resonance with voters.

8. Trump's preparation: He may be aware of Harris's past use of the phrase and try to avoid giving her the opportunity to use it.

9. Debate dynamics: The high-stakes nature of a presidential debate could lead to more heated exchanges where the phrase might be employed.

10. Public expectation: There may be an expectation for Harris to use the phrase, which could influence her to do so.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance Harris will use the phrase, but it's not certain. The muted microphone rule is a key factor that could reduce opportunities. However, given her consistent use of the phrase and its effectiveness, she's likely to use it if given the chance.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

5. Time constraints: The debate is 90 minutes long, providing multiple opportunities for exchanges where this phrase could be used.

6. Harris's strategy: She has expressed a desire to confront Trump directly in debates, which could lead to exchanges where this phrase might be employed.

7. Media expectations: There's likely to be anticipation from the media about whether Harris will use this phrase again, which could create pressure for her to do so.

However, there are also factors that could reduce the likelihood:

1. Overuse concerns: Harris may worry that repeating the phrase too often could seem rehearsed or gimmicky.

2. Different dynamics: A presidential debate may have a different tone than a VP debate, potentially reducing opportunities to use the phrase.

3. Trump's preparation: Trump may have been coached to avoid creating situations where Harris could use this phrase effectively.

4. Time since 2020: As more time has passed, Harris may have developed new debate strategies and phrases.

5. Unpredictability of live events: Despite preparation, the specific exchanges that would prompt this phrase may not occur.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a high likelihood Harris will use this phrase at least once, but it's not certain. The base rate from 2020 (6 times in one debate) suggests a very high probability, but I'll adjust downward slightly due to the factors that could reduce usage.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical precedent:
Kamala Harris has used the phrase "I'm speaking" in previous debates, most notably in the 2020 vice presidential debate with Mike Pence. She used it six times in that debate. This establishes a clear pattern of her using this phrase when interrupted.

2. Recent usage:
Harris has continued to use this phrase in other contexts, such as during a rally in Michigan in August 2024 when responding to hecklers. This indicates the phrase remains part of her rhetorical toolkit.

3. Debate preparation:
News articles suggest Harris's team is preparing her to handle potential interruptions from Trump. Given the effectiveness of "I'm speaking" in 2020, it's likely they've advised her to use it again if needed.

4. Trump's debate style:
Trump is known for frequent interruptions during debates. This increases the likelihood that Harris will need to assert her speaking time, potentially using her signature phrase.

5. Debate format:
The debate will use muted microphones when it's not a candidate's turn to speak. This could reduce interruptions, potentially decreasing the need for Harris to say "I'm speaking." However, the muting is not foolproof and interruptions may still occur.

6. Harris's strategy:
Reports indicate Harris wants to give Trump opportunities to speak freely, possibly to allow him to make mistakes. This could mean she's less likely to use confrontational phrases like "I'm speaking."

7. Time factor:
The debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, which is before the resolution date of September 11, 2024. This means there is ample opportunity for the phrase to be used if the debate occurs as scheduled.

8. Debate uncertainty:
There have been conflicting reports about whether Trump will participate in the debate. If he doesn't show up, Harris won't have the opportunity to use the phrase in this context.

Balancing these factors:

The historical precedent and recent usage suggest a high likelihood of Harris using the phrase. However, the muted microphone format and Harris's potential strategy of letting Trump speak freely could reduce the chances.

The biggest uncertainty is whether the debate will occur as scheduled, given Trump's hesitation. If it does happen, there's a strong chance Harris will use the phrase at least once, given its effectiveness in past debates and her continued use of it in other settings.

Considering all these factors, I estimate a relatively high probability, but with a significant range of uncertainty due to the debate format and potential cancellation risks.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical precedent:
Kamala Harris has used the phrase "I'm speaking" in previous debates, most notably in the 2020 vice presidential debate with Mike Pence. She used it six times in that debate. This establishes a clear pattern of her using this phrase when interrupted.

2. Recent usage:
Harris has continued to use this phrase in other contexts, such as during a rally in Michigan in August 2024 when responding to hecklers. This indicates the phrase remains part of her rhetorical toolkit.

3. Debate preparation:
News articles suggest Harris's team is preparing her to handle potential interruptions from Trump. Given the effectiveness of "I'm speaking" in 2020, it's likely they've advised her to use it again if needed.

4. Trump's debate style:
Trump is known for frequent interruptions during debates. This increases the likelihood that Harris will need to assert her speaking time, potentially using her signature phrase.

5. Debate format:
The debate will use muted microphones when it's not a candidate's turn to speak. This could reduce interruptions, potentially decreasing the need for Harris to say "I'm speaking." However, the muting is not foolproof and interruptions may still occur.

6. Harris's strategy:
Reports indicate Harris wants to give Trump opportunities to speak freely, possibly to allow him to make mistakes. This could mean she's less likely to use confrontational phrases like "I'm speaking."

7. Time factor:
The debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, which is before the resolution date of September 11, 2024. This means there is ample opportunity for the phrase to be used if the debate occurs as scheduled.

8. Debate uncertainty:
There have been conflicting reports about whether Trump will participate in the debate. If he doesn't show up, Harris won't have the opportunity to use the phrase in this context.

Balancing these factors:

The historical precedent and recent usage suggest a high likelihood of Harris using the phrase. However, the muted microphone format and Harris's potential strategy of letting Trump speak freely could reduce the chances.
