**Russia's 'Traditional Values' Offer No Protection Against Mpox, Experts Warn**
Anna Popova, the head of the Russian agency Rospotrebnadzor, has stated that Russia's 'traditional values' will protect it from the mpox epidemic. She claims that the country's repression of the LGBT+ community will prevent the spread of the virus. However, this is a 'false and discriminatory' discourse, as the virus affects people of all sexual orientations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mpox primarily affects young men who have had sex with men, but it is not exclusive to this group. The use of stigmatizing rhetoric can hinder a scientific response to the epidemic, as it can create fear, discourage people from seeking medical help, and lead to ineffective and punitive measures. A new, more lethal and transmissible strain of the virus, clade 1b, is currently causing an outbreak in Africa, and cases have been detected in Sweden, Pakistan, the Philippines, and France, which has put its healthcare system on high alert.

**Russia: 'Traditional Values' Will Protect Against Mpox**
The Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadsor has stated that there is no risk of the Mpox virus spreading in Russia due to the country's 'traditional values'. According to Anna Popova, the head of the agency, the virus will not spread in Russia because of its traditional values. The agency has taken all necessary measures to identify the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) had declared a global health emergency last week due to the rise in Mpox infections in Africa and called for a coordinated international response to stop the outbreaks and save lives. In a video published by the Telegram channel SHOT, Popova said, 'If we consider how Mpox is transmitted, I am absolutely sure that we in Russia, with our traditional values, do not have to fear this disease, which is an epidemic disease.' The virus is transmitted through skin and mucous membrane contact with an infected person, contaminated materials, or infected animals. According to the WHO, it mainly affects men who have sex with men. The Russian health agency Rospotrebnadsor stated that there is 'no risk of the disease spreading in Russia' and that the government is taking 'all necessary measures to identify the infection in time.' The situation is being closely monitored, the agency added. Russia reported its first Mpox case in July 2022 in a man who had returned from Portugal. He was isolated in the hospital and, according to the health agency, the infection was stopped. Since the disease spread worldwide in 2022, there have been three Mpox cases in Russia, all of which were detected and contained in time, according to Popova. 'For Russia, this is not a risk,' she confirmed, adding, 'We do not expect it to spread, and it will not happen.'

**Mpox Clade 1b Strain Spreads in Europe, but Russia Remains Safe**
The Mpox clade 1b strain has caused global concern as it appears to be more contagious through close contact. According to Reuters, a case of this strain was confirmed in Sweden last week and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa. Hans Kluge, the director of the WHO's European Regional Office, stated, 'MPOX, regardless of whether it's a new or old strain, is not a new COVID, as authorities know how to control its spread.' Mpox, a viral infection causing pustular lesions and flu-like symptoms, usually has a mild course but can be fatal. Kluge noted that currently, around 100 new cases of Mpox clade 2 are reported in Europe each month. In Russia, there is no threat of Mpox spread, with Rospotrebnadzor clarifying that there are sufficient modern test systems available to quickly identify the virus and can be used in non-laboratory settings. Mpox is less contagious and less likely to cause fatal cases compared to smallpox.

**First Case of Monkeypox Outside of Africa Detected in Sweden**
A case of monkeypox in a severe form, also known as Mpox Clade I, has been detected outside of Africa for the first time. According to the Swedish Ministry of Health, the person contracted the virus during a trip to a part of Africa where the disease is spreading. The individual sought medical attention in Stockholm due to poor health, and it was confirmed that this is the first officially registered case of Mpox Clade I outside of Africa. The symptoms of the disease are similar to those of ordinary monkeypox, but the new strain is more easily transmitted between people through normal contact. The World Health Organization has reported 100,000 cases and 208 deaths over the past two years. Meanwhile, Russia's Rospotrebnadzor has stated that there is no threat of monkeypox spreading in the country, and measures are being taken to quickly identify and contain the infection. Academician Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Research Center, has announced that research on creating a monkeypox vaccine in Russia is nearly complete. He stated that the necessary proteins have been discovered and described, and their compositions have been made and tested on animals, demonstrating their effectiveness. The next step is to conduct clinical trials, which are expected to take around 1.5 years with sufficient funding.

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of Mpox Variant Clade Ib**
Thailand's Department of Disease Control has confirmed the first case of the new mpox variant clade Ib in a 66-year-old patient who arrived from Africa on August 14. The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.

**New Wayne County mpox case reported amid concern of more transmissible, severe strain**
A new case of mpox has been reported in Wayne County, Michigan, with local and state health officials confirming the infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is conducting tests to determine whether the infection is from the clade 1 variant of the virus, which appears to cause more severe illness and has a higher rate of death than the clade 2 strain. According to Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, the county health department's director and health officer, 'based on what we know so far, we suspected this is clade 2, the same clade that caused the ongoing U.S. mpox outbreak that started in 2022.' The CDC has reported that most transmission occurs from the time when a person's symptoms begin until the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed, which generally takes 2 to 4 weeks. However, the agency acknowledged that 'some people can spread mpox to others for up to four days before they have any symptoms of the virus.' The JYNNEOS vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, has been authorized to prevent smallpox and mpox, and to use after exposure to reduce the severity of the disease in people ages 18 and older. Vaccines are available at the Wayne Health Center and the Wayne County Public Health Division, and county health officials urge anyone with a new rash that they suspect might be mpox to see a health care provider right away for an evaluation and avoid close contact with others until that evaluation.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.

The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox infections (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. As of 2024, 12 African countries have accumulated 18,910 mpox cases and 541 deaths, mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The clade 1b variant is spreading more easily among people and tends to cause more severe symptoms, although the WHO has sent a message of reassurance, stating that the mpox outbreak 'is not the COVID.'

**Pakistan admits it cannot find mpox patient as tighter screening to be introduced at airports**
Pakistan has confirmed a single case of mpox, a viral infection, in the northern Khyber Pakhtunkwa province. The patient, who recently returned from a Gulf country, is suspected to have gone into hiding after providing samples for tests. The health ministry is carrying out contact tracing and strengthening airport screening to prevent further spread. The new strain, clade 1b, is said to cause milder symptoms with lesions on the genitals, making it harder to spot and more likely for people to infect others without knowing they're infected. According to pox researcher Jonas Albarnaz, 'clade 1b is concerning for two main reasons: it's the first clade 1 mpox virus case outside Africa, and it's associated with a more severe disease and higher mortality rates than the clade 2 virus responsible for the international mpox outbreak in 2022.'

**Russia Warns Citizens of mpox Outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo**
The Russian Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has advised Russian citizens to exercise caution when visiting the country due to the outbreak of mpox. According to government data, there have been 15,664 cases of mpox and 548 deaths in the DRC since the beginning of 2024. The ambassador, Alexei Sentebov, said, 'In light of the current situation in the DRC, in the context of the rapid spread of mpox in the region, we strongly recommend that Russian citizens exercise caution and adhere to strict preventive measures when traveling to the republic.' The DRC government is taking additional steps to effectively detect and prevent the spread of the virus. The African Union's health service declared a health emergency on August 13 due to the spread of mpox, with over 38,000 cases and 1,400 deaths reported across 17 African countries. The outbreak is believed to be caused by a genetically mutated virus, which was first detected in eastern DRC in the spring and has been named Clade 1b.

**'Only a matter of time' before fast-spreading mpox strain arrives in Canada: doctors**
Canadian experts, including Dr. Fahad Razak and Dr. Allison McGeer, warn that it's 'only a matter of time' before the fast-spreading mpox strain, clade I, arrives in Canada. Razak notes that Canada's high travel volume makes it a likely candidate for the spread of the disease. Clade I mpox appears to be more transmissible and severe than the clade II variant that caused an epidemic in Canada in 2022. Razak believes that mpox may not spread as easily as COVID-19, allowing for easier containment. However, McGeer cautions that more research is needed to understand the epidemiology of clade I mpox before predicting its spread in Canada. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and has stated that there have been no cases of clade I mpox in the country so far. The agency is also encouraging eligible individuals to get vaccinated against mpox, particularly men who have sex with men and individuals who engage in sex work.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden Confirms First Case Of Deadly Clade I Variant Of Mpox Strain Circulating In Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the contagious mpox strain, originating from central and eastern Africa. This marks the first known infection of this strain outside the African continent. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency, and authorities are closely monitoring the situation to prevent further transmission and ensure public health safety. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.' The WHO has reported a concerning rise in Mpox cases in Africa this year, with over 14,000 cases and 524 fatalities. The international vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on sending vaccines to affected countries in Africa, but there may be a delay due to WHO approval. Health experts warn that clade 1 and its variant, clade 1b, can lead to more severe symptoms than clade 2.
