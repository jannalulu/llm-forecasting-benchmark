The room buzzes with tension as SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table. A large screen displays the NHC website.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, folks, it's October 2nd, and the numbers are in.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
Our models had it at 98.75%. With Beryl setting records in July, it was almost inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
And Colorado State's forecast of six major storms was spot on. The data was all there.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sighing in relief)  
Still, seeing five major hurricanes before September 30th... it's unsettling.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(turning to the screen)  
True, but our models never miss. The probabilities reflected reality, as always.

The screen flashes with the final confirmation: **YES**.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(softly)  
Let's hope next season's probabilities are kinder.

The room falls silent, the weight of their accuracy hanging in the air.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, coffee cups in hand, reviewing the aftermath of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s official. The season ended with four major hurricanes before September 30. Our models had it at 75.00%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Beryl set the pace early, breaking records as a Category 5 in July. But the atmosphere stabilized more than expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Colorado State's prediction of six major storms seemed plausible back in July, but our models accounted for the mid-season shifts.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
It’s fascinating how the probabilities evolved. By mid-August, our data hinted at atmospheric changes, and we adjusted to 75.00%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The precision of our models continues to amaze me. No major hurricanes in September was unexpected by many, but not us.

They nod in agreement, satisfied with their accurate forecasting.
