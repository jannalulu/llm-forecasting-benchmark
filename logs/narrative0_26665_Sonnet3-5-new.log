Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were right again about Apple's portless iPhone announcement."

Philip: "No surprise there. Given the available data until July 29th, our models had it at 32.5%."

Nate: "The MacRumors speculation about the iPhone 16 Ultra was interesting, but the signals weren't strong enough. Apple's historical conservatism with major design changes, combined with the current wireless charging limitations, made it unlikely."

Philip: "Exactly. While there were rumors about the Ultra model, the timing was too ambitious. Our models factored in Apple's typical product development cycle and their need for a more mature wireless charging ecosystem."

Nate: "The market wasn't quite ready for a completely portless design. Sometimes the most accurate predictions come from understanding what won't happen rather than what will."

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. No portless iPhone announcement from Apple before October."

Philip: "No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.5%. The timing just wasn't right. While MacRumors had speculated about a potential iPhone 16 Ultra with a portless design, the technological and market readiness indicators weren't strong enough."

Nate: "Exactly. The supply chain data we analyzed through July showed no significant movement toward portless manufacturing. Plus, Apple's historical pattern suggested they wouldn't make such a radical design change without more market preparation."

Philip: "The wireless charging infrastructure just wasn't mature enough yet. Our models caught that early on. Though I expect we'll see this transition in the next few years."

Nate: "Agreed. Sometimes the most accurate predictions are knowing when something won't happen."

Nate: "Well, Philip, another prediction in the books. Apple's announcement window for a portless iPhone has closed."

Philip: "No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.5%. The signals were weak - just that MacRumors speculation about an iPhone 16 'Ultra' concept."

Nate: "Exactly. While Apple's been pushing wireless charging since 2017, completely removing ports was too radical for 2024. The infrastructure isn't there yet."

Philip: "The timing was the key factor. Our data showed Apple typically announces new iPhones in September, and by July 2024, there were no solid supply chain leaks indicating a portless design."

Nate: "Right. The 12.5% mainly reflected the small possibility of a surprise 'Ultra' announcement. But without stronger evidence in the supply chain by July, it was always unlikely."

Nate: Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. No portless iPhone announcement from Apple before October.

Philip: No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.5%. The data from July was telling - while MacRumors had speculated about an iPhone 16 Ultra with a portless design, the supply chain indicators weren't showing the necessary wireless charging component ramp-up.

Nate: Exactly. The technological leap was feasible, but our analysis of Apple's historical product launches showed they rarely make such dramatic changes without extensive ecosystem preparation. The EU's USB-C mandate also made it more likely they'd focus on that transition first.

Philip: The 12.5% probability mainly accounted for the small chance they might announce it as a future concept. But even that was a stretch given Apple's secretive nature about future products.

Nate: Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The portless iPhone announcement didn't materialize before October.

Philip: No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.5%. The MacRumors speculation about an iPhone 16 "Ultra" was interesting, but the data suggested Apple wasn't ready for such a dramatic shift.

Nate: Agreed. While wireless charging technology has improved, our analysis of Apple's supply chain and patent filings showed they were still working through technical challenges. The risk-reward ratio wasn't there yet.

Philip: The timing was the key factor. Even with Apple's history of bold moves, eliminating all ports by October 2024 was too aggressive. Though I expect we'll be having a different conversation about this in 2025.

Nate: [sips coffee] The market wasn't ready either. Sometimes the best predictions are about what won't happen.
