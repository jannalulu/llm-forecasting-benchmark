**PHILIP:** Indeed. Our models had it pegged. Yes, our models had it at 65.30% probability that it would fall between 16.0 and 17.0.

**NATE:** And it did. Right at 16.8%, if I recall correctly. The new calculation method really shifted the landscape.

**PHILIP:** True. With the exclusion of students, the numbers are more focused, but the challenges remain. The economic factors and post-pandemic shifts are still at play.

**NATE:** It's a wake-up call for policymakers. The job market's evolution is relentless.
