**iPhone 16 to Overcome Overheating Issues with Graphite Thermal System**
According to The Information, some users reported overheating issues with iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models after their release. Apple solved this problem with an iOS 17 update. After this experience, Apple plans to place a larger graphite sheet in the iPhone 16's casing to prevent overheating. It was previously reported that the iPhone 16 models would have an advanced thermal management system to solve overheating issues. Apple is working on a graphite thermal system for the iPhone 16 series and may add metal battery casings to reduce overheating. Graphite is a high-thermal-conductivity material that is more effective than copper, which is currently used to cool iPhones. Apple has filed a patent application for the use of graphite in thermal management. Apple has previously changed the watch battery casing from black foil to metal, so a similar change may be made for the iPhone 16. The release date of the iPhone 16 can be found on Apple's traditional calendar, which typically releases new iPhone models in September. If there are no changes, the release date of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro will be September 2024.
