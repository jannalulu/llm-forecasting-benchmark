**US-Wahl 2024: Trump's Key States for Victory**
In the 2024 US presidential election, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Michigan are crucial states for Donald Trump's campaign, as they were in his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton. Pennsylvania, a traditionally 'Blue Wall' state, was a key region for Republicans in 2016 and remained competitive in 2020. Florida, another swing state, has been a narrow win for Trump in both 2016 and 2020, and he currently leads in the polls. In contrast, Wisconsin and Georgia, which flipped to Democrats in 2020, are now crucial for Trump's campaign, as they provided the necessary edge for Biden's victory. 'These states are traditionally decisive in elections due to their changing voter demographics and lack of fixed party majorities,' said a source. 'Trump's ability to win in these states will be crucial to his campaign's success.'

**The seven states that will decide the US presidency**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close contest. Seven key states will decide the outcome: Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Each state has a unique dynamic, with Trump and Harris campaigning on different issues. In Pennsylvania, Trump is courting rural white voters, while Harris is touting infrastructure wins and manufacturing investments. In Georgia, Trump's indictment on election interference charges has been paused until after the election. In North Carolina, a scandal involving the Republican gubernatorial candidate could impact the vote. In Michigan, Harris risks losing the support of the Arab-American community. In Arizona, Trump hopes to capitalize on frustrations over immigration policy. In Wisconsin, Trump considers the state winnable, while Harris has made the race a nailbiter. In Nevada, Trump's lead has been erased by Harris's economic plans. 'It's a toss-up within the margin of error' in all seven states, according to the article. 'Every one is a battleground,' said Harris, who believes she can win over minority voters in Georgia and North Carolina. Trump, on the other hand, is warning that migrants are overwhelming small towns in Pennsylvania and Arizona. 'We need to find a way to stop this,' he said. 'It's a disaster.'

**US election 2024: The seven battleground states that will decide who wins**
In the 2024 US presidential election, seven battleground states will decide the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania, with 13 million residents and 19 Electoral College votes, is the biggest prize. Vice President Kamala Harris needs to sweep all three 'rust belt' states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin - to win the presidency. However, Donald Trump is preying on Democratic divisions in these states, particularly among Arab-American voters in Michigan and black voters in Georgia and North Carolina. Harris is also battling to shore up black votes in the southern states. Both candidates are courting Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada. Trump's route to victory includes holding onto North Carolina, grabbing back Georgia and Arizona, and winning Michigan with its large Arab-American population. The election outcome will depend on the results in these seven battleground states.

**Donald Trump and Kamala Harris Battle for the 2024 US Presidential Election in Key States**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a handful of key states, with 158.6 million Americans voting in 2020. Joe Biden won by over 7 million votes, but it would have been enough for Donald Trump to win if 22,000 people in three states (Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin) had voted for him instead of Biden. The campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are battling for votes in the seven states that will decide who becomes president: the first woman to occupy the Oval Office or the first president to regain the presidency since Grover Cleveland in 1892. The seven states are Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada. Harris has 226 votes in the Electoral College, while Trump has 219. The battle is in the remaining 93 votes, which are spread across the seven key states. The difference is so narrow in these territories that small variations can give a turn to the election. These states are known as swing states. Trump needs to conserve North Carolina, and regain Georgia and Pennsylvania to win, so he is putting all his efforts there. His strategy clashes with the Democrats' in Pennsylvania, who have dubbed it the Blue Wall, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, states that would be enough for Harris to win. Sondeos, apuestas and predicciones vary about who will win in the key states. The distances are narrow, according to the polls. FiveThirtyEight gives an advantage to Harris in Wisconsin (2.8 points), Michigan (1.7 points), Pennsylvania (0.7), Nevada (0.2) and, recently, also in North Carolina (0.2). In contrast, Trump would be ahead in Arizona (0.7) and Georgia (0.6). The distances are very narrow. Polymarket gives the Democrat a probability of around 60% of winning in Wisconsin and Michigan, while giving the Republican the victory in Georgia, Arizona, and South Carolina with around a 60-40% chance. It would be almost a coin toss in Nevada (irrelevant in that scenario) and Pennsylvania, which would tip the balance. Metaculus, a community of experts, gives Harris a 64% chance of winning in Wisconsin, 60% in Michigan, and 55% in Pennsylvania. In contrast, it assigns a 60% probability to Trump winning in North Carolina and leaves Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada almost tied.

**Seven Swing States to Decide 2024 US Presidential Election**
Seven states in the US - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - will decide the 2024 presidential election. These states have been crucial in previous elections, and both Democratic and Republican candidates are fighting to win them. Arizona, which voted for the Democrats in 2020, is now a focal point of the immigration debate due to its border with Mexico. Georgia, where Trump is facing a criminal prosecution, has a significant African-American population that helped Biden win in 2020. Michigan, which has the country's largest proportion of Arab-Americans, is also a key state. Nevada, which has voted Democrat in recent elections, may see a turnaround for the Republicans. North Carolina, a 'toss-up' state, is crucial for Trump's campaign. Pennsylvania, where Biden won in 2020, is a key state due to its economic concerns. Wisconsin, which has voted for the winning candidate in both 2016 and 2020, is also a marginal state where third-party candidates may make a difference.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Trump Gains Ground in Key States**
The latest national polls for the 2024 US presidential election confirm the trend of Kamala Harris being in a slight lead, with a maximum 3% margin, over her rival Donald Trump. According to the FiveThirtyEight website, Harris is at 48% while Trump is at 46.7%. However, the election will not be decided by the total number of preferences, but by the ability of the candidates to win as many 'populous' states as possible to secure the specific Electoral College votes. Currently, Harris has 225 potential Electoral College votes, while Trump has 219. The remaining 93 Electoral College votes are from the 7 'swing states' where the results of the election will likely be decided. These states are Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. The latest polls show a slight advantage for the Republicans in these states, with Trump leading in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, and Harris leading only in Michigan. The Democrats are struggling to maintain their dominance in the 'Blue Wall' states, which have historically voted for Democratic candidates. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan were won by Trump in 2016, breaking the 'Blue Wall', and are now considered swing states. The polls show Harris leading only in Michigan, while Trump is ahead in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

**Trump or Harris: The Swing States Will Decide the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided in seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. According to recent polls, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are neck and neck in these states, with Trump leading by less than 2% in some polls. To win the election, a candidate must secure at least three to four of these swing states, which are crucial because they are more populous and have more electoral votes than smaller states. Arizona, for example, has 11 electoral votes, while Georgia has 16. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden won six of the seven swing states, securing a clear victory. However, this year's election is expected to be much closer, with Harris and Trump competing fiercely in each of the swing states. In Arizona, Trump is currently leading by up to 3% in some polls, while in Georgia, the race is expected to be extremely close, with Trump currently leading by a small margin. In Michigan, Biden's victory in 2020 was by a margin of 7%, but this year's polls suggest a much closer contest. In Nevada, the polls are currently showing a tie between Harris and Trump, while in North Carolina, Trump is currently leading by a small margin. In Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes, the polls are showing Harris leading by a small margin, but within the margin of error. In Wisconsin, which has 10 electoral votes, the polls are currently showing a tie between Harris and Trump. Overall, the outcome of the election will depend on which candidate can secure the most swing states.

**US Election 2024: What Do the Polls Say a Week Before the Vote?**
According to national polls in the US, Kamala Harris is in a slight lead over Donald Trump, with 48% of the vote compared to Trump's 47%. However, to win the election, a candidate must win the states with the most electoral votes, not just the majority of the national vote. The current polls show Harris leading in some key states, but Trump is ahead in others. In Pennsylvania, Trump has a 0.3% lead, while in Michigan, Harris has a 0.3% lead. In Nevada, Trump has a 0.2% lead, and in Wisconsin, Harris has a 0.1% lead. The situation is more favorable to Trump in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, where he has a 1.9%, 1.5%, and 1.3% lead, respectively. If the election were to go as predicted, Trump would win with 287 electoral votes, while Harris would have 251. However, the polls are still uncertain, and a shift in just two states could give Harris the victory. The majority of polls show that Trump has gained strength in key states in the past few weeks, but the outcome of the election is still uncertain.

**The seven swing states that will decide the US presidency**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close contest. Seven swing states will decide the outcome, and here's a look at each: Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Pennsylvania, once reliably Democratic, is now a toss-up, with Trump winning by 0.7 percentage points in 2016 and Biden by 1.2 percentage points in 2020. Georgia, where Trump is facing an election interference case, is also a close contest. North Carolina, which has voted Republican since 1980, is back in play, with Harris believing it can be won. Michigan, which Trump flipped in 2016, is a key battleground, with Harris risking losing the support of the Arab-American community. Arizona, which Biden won by just 10,457 votes in 2020, is a tight race, with Trump hoping to win back the state due to frustrations over immigration policy. Wisconsin, which Clinton lost in 2016, is a nailbiter, with Harris making it a close contest. Nevada, which has not voted Republican since 2004, is also a key state, with Trump holding a significant lead before Harris erased it with her economic plans.

**Seven States to Decide the Winner of the US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is a closely contested race between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Harris, with the outcome hanging in the balance in seven key states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. Economic issues, immigration, and demographic diversity are key factors in determining the winner. The election is expected to be extremely close, with a few thousand votes potentially deciding the outcome. 'The competition is intense, and the outcome is far from certain,' said no one in the article, but the article does mention that the election will be closely contested.

**A guide to the 2024 swing states and why they are so important this election**
The 2024 presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris facing off against Donald Trump. The outcome will be decided by the swing states, which are states where both major parties have similar levels of support. The critical states are Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. In six of these eight states, Joe Biden won in 2020, giving him a lead that allowed him to win the White House. Swing states matter because they use a 'winner takes all' system for allocating votes, making winning a narrow swing state have a disproportionate impact on the result. Mr. Biden's support in Arizona and Georgia looks shaky, and the Republicans must win back their former heartlands and attempt to win over traditionally Democratic states if their candidate has a chance of winning. Political scientists predict a close election, similar to the outcomes of most of the elections this century. 'We have not seen a runaway re-election landslide like the kind that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon had, or Lyndon Johnson had at all since 2000,' said Christopher Galdieri, a professor of politics at Saint Anselm College. He added that Ms. Harris may not be able to win over the same coalition of voters in swing states in the industrial Midwest, but 'it's not that she can't win there, but I think if she does win there, it's with a coalition that looks a little bit different from the one that Biden won with in 2020.'

Seven key states will decide the outcome: Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Each state has a unique dynamic, with Trump and Harris campaigning aggressively. Pennsylvania, a battleground state, has seen Trump and Harris repeatedly visit, with Trump courting rural white voters and Harris touting infrastructure wins. Georgia, where Trump was indicted for election interference, is a flashpoint, but the case is paused until after the election. North Carolina, a traditionally Republican state, is now in play, with Harris courting minority voters. Michigan, a former Democratic stronghold, is a toss-up, with Harris risking losing Arab-American support. Arizona, a tight race in 2020, is a key battleground, with Trump hoping to swing the state back in his favor. Wisconsin, a state Trump considers winnable, is a nailbiter, with Harris making it competitive. Nevada, a Democratic stronghold, is a potential flip, with Trump's lead erased by Harris's economic plans. 'It's a toss-up within the margin of error,' said a source, highlighting the uncertainty of the election.

**The current odds in every battleground state**
The 2024 presidential election is a close contest between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. According to Decision Desk HQ, Trump has a 52% chance of winning, while Harris has a 48% chance. Famed polling expert Nate Silver shows Harris with a 1.3-point lead nationally, but Trump is ahead in several key battleground states. In Arizona, Trump has a 16-point lead, while in Georgia, he has a 24-point lead. In Michigan, the two candidates are separated by less than a point. Silver's model suggests that Trump has momentum in Arizona and Georgia, while Harris has momentum in Michigan. In Nevada, the two candidates are tied, and in North Carolina, Trump has a 13-point lead. In Pennsylvania, the two are roughly tied, and in Wisconsin, Harris has a half-point lead. The outcome of the election will depend on the performance of the candidates in these battleground states.

**Trump Trails Behind Harris in Swing States, According to New Poll**
A recent poll by the Marist Institute has shown a surprising result in the US presidential election 2024. In three swing states, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, Donald Trump is trailing behind Kamala Harris. The poll, which surveyed people who have already voted, suggests that independent voters may be supporting Harris in large numbers, which would be consistent with the trend seen in the 2022 midterm elections. However, the poll also shows that those who have not yet voted are more likely to support Trump, which could potentially allow him to catch up. It is too early to say who will win the election, but the poll does indicate that the race is much closer than previously thought.

**Trump to win every swing state? That's the most likely scenario as per this Nate Silver Model**
Nate Silver's latest model suggests a surprising potential for Donald Trump to win every key swing state in the upcoming 2024 U.S. election. According to the model, Trump has a 24.4% probability of claiming all seven swing states, while Vice President Kamala Harris has a 15.6% chance. Silver's analysis also suggests that if Harris wins every swing state except Arizona and Georgia, she could still win the election. However, this scenario has only a 1.7% likelihood of occurring. The forecast highlights that there is a 4.6% chance the Republicans will win all swing states except Nevada, where Harris currently holds a slight lead. Jon Parker, a senior lecturer in American studies, noted that the race has transitioned from being nearly a toss-up to firmly in that category, without favoring either campaign. With polls indicating Trump overtaking Harris in recent weeks, the election dynamics are fluid and could change rapidly as Election Day approaches.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Who Will Win in Wisconsin Between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris?**
As the US presidential election approaches on November 5, the landscape remains uncertain. Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, are neck and neck in a closely contested race, with minimal differences in key states. According to 270toWin, the national average of polls gives Harris a narrow lead of 1.4%. However, results vary significantly depending on the state. In Florida, Trump leads by 6.6%, while in Texas, he has a 5.6% advantage. In traditionally Democratic states, Harris maintains comfortable leads. In Maryland, she leads by 29.2%, while in California, her home state, she has a 24.7% advantage, according to recent polls. The key to the election, as in previous cycles, lies in the undecided states. In Nevada, Harris has a narrow lead of 0.3%, while in Arizona, Trump is ahead by 1.7%. In Georgia and North Carolina, two states that were fiercely contested in 2020, Trump maintains a slight advantage, with 1.9% and 0.6%, respectively. 270toWin also highlights that Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin will be crucial in determining the winner. In Pennsylvania, Trump leads by a narrow margin of 0.3%, while in Michigan, his advantage is only 0.4%. Harris, however, leads Trump in Wisconsin by 0.5%, which could prove crucial in securing the necessary electoral votes.

**Trump winning every swing state is most likely scenario -- Nate Silver model**
Nate Silver's latest forecast gives Donald Trump a 24.4 percent chance of winning all seven swing states in the 2024 election, making it the most likely scenario. According to Silver's analysis, Kamala Harris has a 15.6 percent chance of winning all the battleground states. The forecast also shows that Harris would win the election if she took every swing state other than Arizona and Georgia, but this scenario has only a 1.7 percent probability. Silver's model suggests that the most likely paths to victory for Harris occur when Democrats win a combination of three to five of the battleground states. If Harris won only Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, she would have 270 electoral college votes and a 86.2 percent chance of winning overall. However, polls currently show that Harris is leading in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada, while Trump is ahead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. 'The race has gone from almost a toss-up to definitely a toss-up,' said Jon Parker, senior lecturer in American studies at Keele University. 'This does not suggest that either campaign is winning or losing.'

**2024 US Presidential Election: A Closely Contested Race**
The United States is preparing for the 2024 presidential election, with a closely contested race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. The election will take place on November 5, 2024, and the winner will begin a four-year term in the White House in January 2025. The election is not won by the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide, but by the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes in the Electoral College. The Electoral College is composed of 538 electors, who are chosen by each state and the District of Columbia. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state typically receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska. The election is closely watched in a handful of swing states, including Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. These states are crucial in determining the outcome of the election, and the candidate who wins them will likely win the presidency. The electoral system favors Trump, as it gives more weight to the votes of rural states that tend to vote Republican. If there is a tie in the Electoral College, the House of Representatives will choose the president, and the Senate will choose the vice president. There are also third-party candidates running in the election, including Jill Stein of the Green Party and Robert F. Kennedy, who is supporting Trump. Their presence on the ballot could potentially affect the outcome of the election.

**The Swing States: What to Expect in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
Seven states in the US are considered 'swing states' in the 2024 presidential election, where the outcome can decide the winner. These states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. According to recent polls, the gap between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is less than 2% in these states. To win the election, a candidate needs to secure at least 3-4 of these swing states. In 2020, Joe Biden won 6 out of 7 swing states, securing his victory. The swing states are important because they are more populous and have more electoral votes to offer. Here's a brief overview of each swing state: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In Arizona, Trump is currently leading by up to 3% in recent polls. In Georgia, Trump is also leading, but by a narrow margin. In Michigan, the polls are neck and neck, with some voters feeling alienated by the White House's pro-Israel stance in the Gaza conflict. In Nevada, the polls are also showing a close race between Harris and Trump. In North Carolina, Trump won by a narrow margin in 2020, but Harris is currently closing the gap. In Pennsylvania, Harris is currently leading by a narrow margin, but the polls are within the margin of error. In Wisconsin, the polls are showing a close race between Trump and Harris, with the outcome likely to be decided on the final stretch.

**Georgia 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Trump Leads In Latest Survey -- But Undecided Voters Could Tip Results**
The latest poll of likely Georgia voters found President Donald Trump with a four-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris. According to Five Thirty Eight's poll tracker, Harris leads Trump by 1.6 points nationally. Georgia is one of seven swing states that could decide the presidential election, with Harris leading in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada, while Trump leads in North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia. The most likely path to victory for Harris runs through the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which have a combined 44 electoral votes. If Trump wins one of the Rust Belt states, particularly Pennsylvania, and also carries Georgia and North Carolina, he would likely break the 270 electoral-vote threshold needed to win the election. As Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has said, 'It's going to be a close election, but I think we have a good chance of winning.'

**US Presidential Election: A Neck-and-Neck Race Between Harris and Trump**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, with the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and the Republican candidate Donald Trump being the main contenders. The election will take place on November 5, with early voting already underway in many states. The outcome is uncertain, with polls showing a neck-and-neck race between Harris and Trump. The election will also determine the composition of the US Congress, with all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 34 seats in the Senate up for grabs. The Democratic Party currently holds a majority in the Senate, while the Republican Party holds a majority in the House of Representatives. The election will be decided in the so-called 'swing states', where the outcome is uncertain. These states include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The Electoral College system will determine the winner, with each state having a number of electoral votes equal to its number of members in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, at least 270, will be declared the winner. If the outcome is disputed, the election will be decided by the courts, with the possibility of the case going to the Supreme Court. Donald Trump has already hinted that he may not accept the outcome of the election, and has a history of making baseless claims of voter fraud. The election will be a closely watched event, with the world holding its breath as the outcome is determined.

**Seven Swing States that Could Decide the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with seven 'swing states' that could tip the balance in favor of either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. These states are Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In Arizona, the gap between the two candidates is the narrowest in the polls, with Trump having won in 2016 and Biden in 2020 by a margin of just over 10,000 votes. In North Carolina, the Democrats have not won since 2008, and Trump won by 74,000 votes in 2020. In Georgia, Biden won in 2020 by 12,000 votes, a first for Democrats since 1992. In Michigan, the election is expected to be close, with Trump and Harris neck and neck in the polls. In Nevada, Harris has a slight lead, but Trump is still in the running. In Pennsylvania, the largest swing state, Harris has a narrow lead of 0.2 points. In Wisconsin, the election is expected to be close, with Harris currently leading by 0.3 points. 'All eyes will be on the suburbs of Atlanta,' says The Washington Post, where Biden won in 2020. 'The fate of the election will be decided in these seven states,' says Franceinfo. 'The outcome of the election will be crucial, as the winner will take all 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.'

**US election 2024: The seven battleground states that will decide who wins**
In the 2024 US presidential election, seven battleground states will decide the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania, with 13 million residents and 19 Electoral College votes, is the biggest prize. Vice President Kamala Harris needs to sweep all three 'rust belt' states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin - to win the presidency. However, Donald Trump is preying on Democratic divisions in these states, particularly among Arab-American voters in Michigan and black voters in Georgia and North Carolina. Harris is also battling to shore up black votes in the southern states. Both candidates are courting Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada. Trump's route to victory includes holding onto North Carolina, grabbing back Georgia and Arizona, and winning Michigan with its large Arab-American population. The election outcome will depend on the results in these seven battleground states.

**Jake Tapper Admits Trump Could Win If Election Were Tomorrow**
CNN's Jake Tapper admitted that former President Donald Trump could win the 2024 presidential election if it were held tomorrow, citing data from Nate Silver. Tapper highlighted Trump's lead in key swing states like Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. According to Silver's 'Silver Bullet Substack', Trump is slightly up in these states, while Harris is likely up in Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin, and they are tied in Pennsylvania. Silver stated that the latest data on Harris is 'pretty negative', with three national polls showing Trump in the lead. Silver's current Electoral College prediction gives Trump a 53% chance of winning, while Harris holds a slight lead in the popular vote by 1.6%. Tapper asked former Biden presidential campaign aide Ashley Allison if she was worried about the state of the race, to which she replied that she was. 'If that were to be the result tomorrow that's basically a Trump win, I mean, ultimately,' Tapper said. 'Because she needs the three blue wall states plus Nevada and she doesn't have them right now.'

**Arizona 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Trump Up 3 Points In Latest Survey**
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump maintains a narrow lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in Arizona, a swing state where immigration and abortion ballot measures will play a key role in the November elections. Harris and Democrats are banking on the abortion ballot measure to succeed, while Trump hopes for the same for the border enforcement measure. Trump won Arizona in 2016 but lost by 10,457 votes in 2020. Despite the loss, Trump claimed victory and later alleged the Maricopa County voter database was deleted, a claim refuted by Republican officials. Trump is battling with Harris in six other swing states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona, where the polls remain tightly contested.

**US Election 2024: Donald Trump holds a 52% chance to win, can Kamala Harris catch up?**
Donald Trump has taken the lead in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast for the US presidential election 2024, with a 52% chance of winning. This is a change from previous months, where Kamala Harris had a 54-56% chance of winning. Trump's improved polling in key battleground states such as Wisconsin and Michigan has contributed to this shift. Harris still leads in Pennsylvania, but Trump has a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. Early voting has already begun in several states, and the election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.

**Trump Surpasses Harris in 2024 Presidential Election Chances**
According to a Hill poll, Donald Trump, the former US President, has now surpassed Kamala Harris, the current US Vice President, in the chances of winning the 2024 presidential election. The Hill's model predicts that Trump has a 52% chance of winning, while Harris has a 42% chance. This is the first time Trump has taken the lead in the election cycle. The Guardian and Wall Street Journal reported on October 13 that Trump's support among voters in key states is growing. The Financial Times reported on October 17 that Trump is trying to increase his wealth and that of his family by selling various items, including cryptocurrency tokens, watches, perfume, books, and jewelry. In late August, Harris had a 54-56% chance of winning, while Trump had a 44-46% chance. However, from early October, the predictions showed that both candidates had almost equal chances. On October 17, the model predicted that both candidates had an equal chance of winning, and on October 20, Trump took the lead. This change in prediction is due to Trump's improved results in key states, Wisconsin and Michigan, which were previously leaning towards Harris. Trump had a slight lead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. Seven key states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, can determine the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election. These states play a crucial role in determining which candidate will reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Pennsylvania, the decisive state, is the only state where Harris is currently leading according to polls. With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania has the highest number of votes among the key states and has attracted the attention of both candidates. According to advertising data, the most expensive advertising campaigns have been conducted in this state. If Harris can win in Pennsylvania, she can significantly increase her chances of winning. On the other hand, if Trump wins in Pennsylvania, he will have multiple paths to reach 270 electoral votes. The simplest path for Trump is to win in Pennsylvania, along with other important states like Georgia and North Carolina, which would give him exactly 270 electoral votes. Alternative options for both candidates include winning in states like North Carolina and Georgia, which have 16 electoral votes, and are particularly important for Democrats, especially North Carolina. Trump can also win by other means, such as winning in states like North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona, and gaining one of the blue wall states like Michigan. According to predictions, the competition is still very close, and potential errors in polls can change the results in favor of either candidate.

**The Swing States: Where the 2024 US Presidential Election Will Be Decided**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, and the outcome is far from certain. The election is won through an indirect election, where the candidate with the most electoral votes wins. The 48 states that use the winner-takes-all system are crucial, and the 'Swing States' or 'battleground states' are where the election will be decided. These states are Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. In these states, the difference between the two candidates is less than 3%, making them unpredictable. The Pennsylvania is the most important state, as no Democrat has won the election without it since 1948. The state is divided between Democratic cities and conservative rural areas. The Wisconsin, with 10 electoral votes, is part of the 'blue wall' that has voted for Democrats since 1992. However, Trump's victory in 2016 changed everything, and Biden won it in 2020 by a narrow margin. The Michigan, with 15 electoral votes, is another crucial state that Trump won in 2016. The Arizona, with 11 electoral votes, has seen a significant economic growth, and the issue of abortion will be crucial in the election. The Georgia, with 16 electoral votes, is traditionally a Republican stronghold, but Biden won it in 2020. The North Carolina, with 16 electoral votes, is the only state that Trump won in 2020, and it has seen a significant economic growth. The Nevada, with 6 electoral votes, is the only state that has voted for both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. The outcome of the election will depend on the population of these states, particularly the Hispanic population in Arizona and Nevada.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Harris in Slight Lead, but Trump Still in the Running**
The latest US presidential election polls show Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in a slight lead over Republican candidate Donald Trump. However, the results in key states can still decide who will win the 2024 election. According to RealClearPolling, Harris is currently leading by 1.7 percentage points (49.2%) compared to Trump (47.5%). Despite this, nothing is yet decided, as the vote remains uncertain in the largest states, where undecided voters may still change their minds after hearing the final speeches from the two candidates. The key states for the US election are Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where the advantage of one candidate is always reduced, making the outcome still reversible. In these states, the polls are still close, with Harris and Trump competing for the support of voters. For example, in Arizona, Trump is leading by 0.5 percentage points (48.3% to 47.8%), while in Nevada, the two candidates are tied (47.7% to 47.2%). In Michigan, Harris is leading by 0.9 percentage points (48.3% to 47.4%), while in Pennsylvania, the two candidates are tied (47.9% to 47.4%). The situation remains uncertain, with Harris currently leading globally, but the outcome in the key states still up for grabs.

**Why voters in a handful of swing states will decide the US presidential election**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a small subset of voters in seven key states, with Pennsylvania being the most critical. The candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are focusing heavily on these battlegrounds through intense campaigning and ad spending. The winner will need to win a majority of the country's 538 electoral votes, or 270, which is possible even when losing the overall national vote. The seven battleground states are Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina. Pennsylvania is widely seen as critical to either Harris' or Trump's chances of winning the White House and is considered the most likely 'tipping point' state. If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she would need to carry either North Carolina or Georgia to have any chance of prevailing. Conversely, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, he would need to win either Wisconsin or Michigan to have any chance of winning. Both campaigns have treated Pennsylvania as the most important state, with Harris and Trump spending more time there than in any other.

**Donald Trump closing gap on Kamala Harris in top election forecast**
Donald Trump is closing the gap on Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, according to new data from FiveThirtyEight's election simulator. Trump now has a 47 percent chance of winning, up from 32 percent in September, while Harris has a 53 percent chance, down from 64 percent. Recent polls have shown Trump leading in several swing states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona, and he is now within 1-2 points in each state. Harris still leads in national polls, but her chances depend on winning the swing states, which are very close. FiveThirtyEight's forecast predicts Harris will win in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Nebraska's 2nd District, while Trump will win in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. RealClearPolitics' forecast shows Trump winning in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, giving him an overall win of 296 Electoral College votes to Harris' 242. 'That was then, this is now. The Harris post-debate starburst dims to a glow as Harris enters the last weeks slipping slightly in the Rust Belt,' said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy.

**‚ÄòSwing States‚Äô: What are the Decisive States in the 2024 US Presidential Election?**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by seven swing states: Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. These states are crucial in determining the outcome of the election and which candidate will win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Currently, Donald Trump has 219 electoral votes secured, while Kamala Harris has 215. The key issues for voters in these states are the economy, immigration, and border security. In Arizona, the economy and immigration are top concerns, with a large Hispanic population. In Michigan, the working-class voters are key, with the economy being their top priority. In Wisconsin, the economy and immigration are also major concerns, with Kamala Harris currently leading in the polls. Georgia, traditionally a Republican state, was won by Joe Biden in 2020, and is now a key battleground state. North Carolina, also a traditionally Republican state, is currently leaning towards Trump, but the impact of Hurricane Helene may be a factor. Nevada, with its small but significant Hispanic population, is a crucial state for Trump, who needs to win over working-class voters who are currently supporting Kamala Harris. Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, is the most important state in the election, with Trump having won it in 2016 after a long period of Democratic dominance.

**Swing States: The Crucial Battlegrounds in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, and several states are considered 'swing states' due to their tendency to fluctuate between the Democratic and Republican parties. These states are crucial in determining the outcome of the election and the candidate who will win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Among the states that are considered safe for both candidates, Donald Trump has 219 electoral votes and Kamala Harris has 215. Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes, is the state with the most votes and has been a key battleground in recent elections. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016, ending the 'Blue Wall' formed by Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which were essential for Harris to win. Trump's strategy focused on appealing to working-class voters in small towns and rural areas. Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada are also considered swing states, with Michigan and Wisconsin being particularly important due to their working-class voters and economic concerns. In Georgia, Joe Biden won in 2020, while in Arizona, Trump won in 2016 but Biden won in 2020 by a narrow margin. Nevada, with 6 electoral votes, is the state with the fewest votes but is crucial in the presidential election. According to recent polls, Trump is leading in most of these states, but the outcome is still uncertain.

**Trump vs. Harris: Who Will Win in the Swing States?**
The 2024 US presidential election will be marked by a strong polarization between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican opponent Donald Trump. However, the election will also be determined by the 'swing states', where the results are often close and the winner takes all the electoral votes. The seven key states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. According to US News, these states play a crucial role in the presidential election due to the similar levels of support for Democrats and Republicans. Trump is currently leading in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Harris is leading in Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin. The outcome of the election will be determined by the winner of these swing states, which will then take all the electoral votes. If no candidate reaches the majority (270 electoral votes), the House of Representatives will decide the winner. The next president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

The 2024 US presidential election will likely be decided by voters in seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These states were won by fewer than 3 percentage points in 2020 and are expected to be close this year. Pennsylvania is a key state, as it is part of the 'Trump firewall' - if he wins Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina, he is likely to win the White House. However, Pennsylvania was once a reliable Democratic state, and if Kamala Harris loses it, she faces a difficult path to victory, requiring her to win either Georgia or North Carolina, and either Arizona or Nevada, as well as both Michigan and Wisconsin.

**These 7 Key States Will Decide The Winner Of The 2024 US Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close contest. Seven key states will decide the winner, and here's a look at each battleground: Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Pennsylvania, once reliably Democratic, is now a toss-up, with Trump winning by 0.7 percentage points in 2016 and Biden by 1.2 percentage points in 2020. Georgia, where Trump is facing an election interference case, is also a close contest. North Carolina, which has voted Republican since 1980, is now in play, with Harris courting minority voters. Michigan, which Trump flipped in 2016, is a key state, with Harris risking losing the support of the Arab-American community. Arizona, which Biden won by just 10,457 votes in 2020, is showing a large poll advantage for Trump. Wisconsin, which Clinton lost in 2016, is a winnable state for Trump, with Harris having a tiny polling edge. Nevada, which hasn't voted Republican since 2004, is a key state for Harris, who has erased Trump's lead with her economic plans.

**Who is winning the 2024 election right now?**
The 2024 presidential election is expected to be a close contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump. According to recent polls, Trump holds a slight edge in many swing states, but national polls show Harris leading Trump. Experts predict that the country may not have a president-elect on election night due to changes in state laws regarding voting, tallying ballots, and certifying election results. For example, Georgia and Arizona will require hand counts at polling sites, which could delay the reporting of results. As of October 1, polls show the following swing state results: Pennsylvania is tied between Trump and Harris, Arizona has Trump leading by 3-4 points, North Carolina is also tied, and Georgia has Trump leading by 5-6 points. National polls show Harris leading Trump by 5-4 points.

**Trump on Track to Win 2024 Election Thanks to Electoral College System**
According to recent polls, Donald Trump would win the presidential election against Kamala Harris, just like in 2016, thanks to the Electoral College system. Trump is leading in the swing states, which account for 94 electoral votes, with a message focused on economy, immigration, and security, which resonates with working-class voters in these states. Harris, on the other hand, is struggling to present concrete proposals. If the election were held today, Trump would win with 281 electoral votes, while Harris would get 257. This is similar to the 2016 election, where Trump won despite losing the popular vote. The key state this year is Pennsylvania, where Harris is failing to convince working-class voters with her economic plan. Trump has a significant lead in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, and is also ahead in the overall national polls. The Electoral College system awards all electoral votes from a state to the winner of that state, which is why Trump is focusing on the swing states. He has already won 219 electoral votes from traditional Republican states, while Harris has 215 from Democratic states. Trump has also broken the 'Blue Wall' by winning Pennsylvania, and is leading in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, which would give him a total of 281 electoral votes and the presidency.

**Good swing state polls for Trump show a 2024 election far from decided**
A recent New York Times/Siena College battleground state poll shows former President Donald Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris in key swing states Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. In Arizona, Trump leads by five points, 50% ‚Äì 45%, while in Georgia, he is ahead by four points, 49% ‚Äì 45%. North Carolina is the closest of the three, with Trump still ahead but by just two points, 49% ‚Äì 47%. The polling comes after a recent survey by The Hill/Emerson College showed Harris up by one point in North Carolina while trailing by just one point in Arizona and three points in Georgia. Trump's team says voters in North Carolina know who is making their lives more expensive, citing Harris' 'failed leadership' and the surge in prices under her administration. Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson Ammar Moussa says Vance's visit won't shore up votes in North Carolina, but simply serve to remind voters that the 'Trump-Vance-Robinson ticket is the most extreme in American history.'

**Trump Surprises in Polls with Advantages in Key States, Confirming a Very Close Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be a close contest, with Donald Trump gaining an advantage in key states. According to a recent NBC News poll, Kamala Harris leads Trump nationally with 49% to 44%. However, the election is won by the candidate who receives the most votes in the Electoral College, not the popular vote. The seven swing states that will determine the next US president are Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. A New York Times/Siena College poll shows Trump leading in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, with a surprising 50%-45% lead in Arizona, a state won by Joe Biden in 2020. Harris still leads in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, but her margin of error is zero if she loses the other three states. 'It's a very close election,' said an expert, 'and the outcome is far from certain.'

**Trump vs Harris: Fresh polls reveal battleground states' preference that could decide winner of 2024 election**
The 2024 US presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris has taken a new turn after the first presidential debate. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 53% of respondents believed Harris won the debate, while 24% saw Trump as the winner. In key swing states, Harris is leading Trump by two points overall, with a lead in six of the seven states. However, the two are tied in Arizona. Harris has also reduced Trump's lead over Biden in Iowa from 18 points to four points. In Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state, Harris is ahead of Trump by three points, according to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll. New CNN polls reveal that Harris leads Trump among likely voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, while Trump leads in Arizona. The two share nearly equal shares of likely voters in Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. Voters in these swing states primarily define Harris' views as mainstream and Trump's as too extreme. Polling averages suggest that November's election will be closely contested, with Harris and Trump actively campaigning in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan to sway voters in their favor.

**Seven States Hold the Key to the White House: Trump and Harris Battle for Votes**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a few hundred thousand votes in a handful of key states. The seven states that will determine the outcome of the election are Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. These states have a combined total of 93 electoral votes, which is crucial in the election. According to El Pa√≠s, if Donald Trump had won just 22,000 more votes in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin in 2020, he would have won the presidency. The article highlights the importance of these states, citing the 2016 and 2020 elections where the outcome was decided by a small margin. The article states that 'El Colegio Electoral est√° compuesto por 538 votantes, compromisarios o delegados que representan a los Estados. Cada uno cuenta con el equivalente a su n√∫mero de congresistas (contando senadores, siempre dos por Estado; y representantes, de 1 a 52, en funci√≥n de la poblaci√≥n)' and that 'Harris tiene pr√°cticamente en el bolsillo 226 votos del Colegio Electoral (181, asegurados; 44, probables, y uno, proclive), mientras que Trump puede contar con 219 (125 seguros y 94 probables)'.

**Donald Trump and Kamala Harris Battle for the 2024 US Presidential Election in Key States**
The 2024 US presidential election will be decided by a handful of key states, with 158.6 million Americans voting in 2020. Joe Biden won by over 7 million votes, but it would have been enough for Donald Trump to win if 22,000 people in three states (Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin) had voted for him instead of Biden. The campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are battling for votes in the seven states that will decide who becomes president: the first woman to occupy the Oval Office or the first president to regain the presidency since Grover Cleveland in 1892. The seven states are Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, North Carolina, and Nevada. Harris has 226 votes in the Electoral College, while Trump has 219. The battle is in the remaining 93 votes, which are spread across the seven key states. The difference is so narrow in these territories that small variations can give a turn to the election. These states are known as swing states. Trump needs to conserve North Carolina, and regain Georgia and Pennsylvania to win, so he is putting all his efforts there. His strategy clashes with the Democrats' in Pennsylvania, who have dubbed it the Blue Wall, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, states that would be enough for Harris to win. Sondeos, apuestas and predicciones vary about who will win in the key states. The distances are narrow, according to the polls. FiveThirtyEight gives an advantage to Harris in Wisconsin (2.8 points), Michigan (1.7 points), Pennsylvania (0.7), Nevada (0.2) and, recently, also in North Carolina (0.2). In contrast, Trump would be ahead in Arizona (0.7) and Georgia (0.6). The distances are very narrow. Polymarket gives the Democrat a probability of around 60% of winning in Wisconsin and Michigan, while giving the Republican the victory in Georgia, Arizona, and South Carolina with around a 60-40% chance. It would be almost a coin toss in Nevada (irrelevant in that scenario) and Pennsylvania, which would tip the balance. Metaculus, a community of experts, gives Harris a 64% chance of winning in Wisconsin, 60% in Michigan, and 55% in Pennsylvania. In contrast, it assigns a 60% probability to Trump winning in North Carolina and leaves Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada almost tied.

**Donald Trump and Kamala Harris Battle in the Seven States that Hold the Key to the White House**
The 2024 presidential election in the United States will be decided by voters in seven key states: Wisconsin, Arizona, Latinos in Arizona, African-American communities in Georgia, Arab Americans in Michigan, women in suburban Charlotte, North Carolina, and nearly every inhabitant of Pennsylvania. The outcome will depend on tens or hundreds of thousands of votes in these states. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are battling to scrape together votes in these states, with Trump needing to retain North Carolina, as well as reconquer Georgia and Pennsylvania to win. Harris has a strong lead in several states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, but the gaps are narrow, according to the polls. Trump would be ahead in Arizona and Georgia, but the polls are also close in these states. The Electoral College is composed of 538 voters, delegates representing the states, and the candidate who wins in a state takes all of its electoral votes, regardless of whether he wins by one vote or by a million. Harris has practically 226 Electoral College votes in her pocket, while Trump can count on 219. 270 are needed to win.

**US: Harris, Trump clash over key issues in fiery debate**
The US presidential election will take place on Tuesday, 5 November 2024, with the winner serving a four-year term in the White House beginning January 2025. Voters are essentially choosing electors, with the candidate receiving the majority of votes in a state typically receiving all electoral votes from that state, except in Maine and Nebraska. The candidate with 270 or more electoral votes is declared the winner, out of a total of 538. Certain states tend to vote for either the Democratic or Republican nominee, but the contenders are competing for swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, where recent surveys show a virtual tie between Harris and Trump. The presidential debate could potentially tilt the race in either candidate's favor.

**Seven Swing States to Decide 2024 US Presidential Election**
Seven states in the US - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - will decide the 2024 presidential election. These states have been crucial in previous elections, and both Democratic and Republican candidates are fighting to win them. Arizona, which voted for the Democrats in 2020, is now a focal point of the immigration debate due to its border with Mexico. Georgia, where Trump is facing a criminal prosecution, has a significant African-American population that helped Biden win in 2020. Michigan, which has the country's largest proportion of Arab-Americans, is also a key state. Nevada, which has voted Democrat in recent elections, may see a turnaround for the Republicans. North Carolina, a 'toss-up' state, is crucial for Trump's campaign. Pennsylvania, where Biden won in 2020, is a key state due to its economic concerns. Wisconsin, which has voted for the winning candidate in both 2016 and 2020, is also a marginal state where third-party candidates may make a difference.

**US elections 2024: Trump and Harris neck-and-neck in key battleground states, new poll shows - Times of India**
A recent poll conducted from August 23-29 shows that the 2024 US presidential election is neck-and-neck between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in key battleground states. In Pennsylvania, both candidates received 47% support from likely voters, while Harris leads Trump in Georgia by 1%, Michigan by 5%, and Wisconsin by 6%. Trump maintains a lead in Arizona, but Harris has a narrow lead in Nevada. The poll suggests that 11-15% of likely voters are still open to changing their vote. Republican groups are preparing to spend over $110 million on advertising in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Trump campaign adviser Brian Hughes expressed confidence in their prospects, stating, 'In Pennsylvania and Georgia, we see polling averages showing President Trump leading close races in both. On the ground we feel a strong momentum building for the final stretch. With the GOP unified behind President Trump, and a broadening coalition of Democrats and Independents joining us, it's clear that we are poised to win these crucial battleground states.'

**Kamala Harris Poised to Win 2024 US Presidential Election, Poll Suggests**
A poll conducted by the Telegraph found that Kamala Harris, the US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate, is expected to win the 2024 US presidential election. According to the poll, Harris is expected to win in enough swing states to secure her place in the White House in November, following weeks of gains over Donald Trump. The poll, conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies for the Telegraph, found that Harris is expected to win the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, which would give her 270 electoral votes. Harris would win by a narrow margin, with 270 votes to Trump's 262, according to the poll. The numbers suggest that Harris will follow the same path to the White House as Joe Biden in 2020, relying on support from the Rust Belt states in the Midwest. Trump is expected to win in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Nevada is a dead heat at 47%. The analysis of the results suggests that the remaining 43 states will vote in the same way as they did in 2020. The poll found that Trump's support in North Carolina, a state he won in 2020, has decreased by two points since the last poll conducted by the Telegraph before the Democratic National Convention last month. Harris is now trailing Trump by one point in both North Carolina and Arizona, which Biden won in the last election. The results show that Trump's lead in most swing states has been narrowed, following Biden's decision to drop out of the presidential race on July 21. Biden received a negative rating in all states included in the poll, except Georgia, while Harris received a positive rating in all seven states.
