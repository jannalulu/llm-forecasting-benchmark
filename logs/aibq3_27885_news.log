**Super Micro Computer's Stock Plummets After Delaying Annual Report Submission**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted over 26% on Wall Street after the company delayed the submission of its annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company confirmed that it would not meet the deadline for submitting the Form 10-K, a comprehensive annual report required by the regulator. According to Super Micro Computer, the delay is due to the need to evaluate 'its internal controls over financial reporting'. The company expects to submit a Form 12B-25, which is used to request an extension for submitting the annual or quarterly report, before August 30, 2024. This comes a day after Hindenburg Research, a short-selling firm, accused Super Micro Computer of 'accounting manipulation' and opened a short position in the company. 'The delay in filing is a red flag, especially in light of the allegations. Time will tell who is right, but for now, investors seem to be assuming that if there's smoke, there's fire,' said analysts from Great Hill Capital. However, JPMorgan analysts have defended the company, stating that the Hindenburg Research report 'lacks details on the alleged irregularities' and 'revisits areas that are already known to need improvement in corporate governance and transparency.'

**Super Micro's stock rocked by disclosure of accounting concerns**
Super Micro Computer Inc. announced that it will miss the deadline to file its annual report due to accounting concerns. The company stated, '[Super Micro] is unable to file its annual report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense.' The stock plummeted 25.1% in morning trading, putting it on track for its biggest one-day selloff in six years. This comes after short seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging accounting red flags and undisclosed related-party transactions. Super Micro has a market capitalization of over $25 billion and is required to file its 10-K within 60 days of its fiscal year end. The company expects to file a Form 12b-25 with the SEC on August 30. This is not the first time Super Micro has faced accounting troubles, having paid a $17.5 million civil penalty in 2020 to settle an SEC investigation.

**Super Micro Delays Annual Report Submission, Stock Plummets**

The company's stock has plummeted by a quarter in value, trading at around $410 per share. The company stated that it expects to submit a 'late filing notice' to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by August 30. As a result, the company's stock has continued to decline, losing a quarter of its value. According to the company, 'Super Micro is not able to...' (the article is truncated, but it is likely that the company stated that it is unable to meet the deadline for submitting its annual report).

**Super Micro Computer Faces Another Trust Crisis**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted by 20% after the company announced it would miss the deadline to file its annual report with the SEC. The company plans to submit a 'Notification of Late Filing' on Form 12b-25, which allows for a delayed filing. This news sent shockwaves through the market, causing the company's stock to drop immediately after trading began. The delayed filing of the 'Form 10-K', a detailed financial report that must be submitted annually by publicly traded companies, has raised concerns among investors. Super Micro Computer stated that filing the report on time would have required an 'unreasonable expense or cost'. According to the company, the management needs additional time to complete the evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Although the company assured that the previously published financial numbers for the year and quarter, released on August 6, 2024, remain unchanged, the delay has raised doubts about the company's internal stability and management practices. This is not the first time Super Micro Computer has faced regulatory challenges. In 2018, the company was temporarily delisted from the NASDAQ due to lack of financial reports. Two years later, the SEC imposed a fine of $17.5 million on the company after it was discovered that Super Micro had improperly booked revenue and concealed expenses.

**Stockholder Notice: Robbins LLP Informs Stockholders of the Class Action Filed Against Super Micro Computer, Inc.**
A shareholder has filed a class action against Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or acquired SMCI securities between August 10, 2021 and August 26, 2024. The allegations include that SMCI misled investors regarding its business prospects, including overreporting sales and underreporting expenses, re-hiring executives who departed in the wake of a prior accounting scandal, and exporting products to areas restricted by the US government. According to the complaint, Hindenburg Research unveiled a research report on August 27, 2024, detailing several allegations against SMCI, including accounting red flags and undisclosed related party transactions. As a result, the price of SMCI's common stock declined dramatically from $562.51 per share on August 26, 2024, to $443.49 per share on August 28, 2024. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must submit their application to the court by October 29, 2024.

**Super Micro Computer's Stock Plunges to Worst Month Ever, But Analysts Remain Optimistic**
Super Micro Computer's stock has had its worst month ever in August, making it the largest loser in the S&P 500. However, not all analysts have given up. The server manufacturer has provided some relief to investors by stating that the delay in submitting the annual report (10-K) is due to an internal audit committee reviewing the company's financial controls, but it is not expected to contain any significant changes to the company's results for the last fiscal year. As one analyst might say, 'Where there's smoke, there's fire.' The company is based in San Jose, California, and has stated that a special committee is working diligently to complete the 10-K report. Meanwhile, investors are looking for opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence, with some analysts predicting that certain stocks could see significant growth. As one report might say, 'Investing in AI companies not only brings stability, but also the potential for explosive growth in your portfolio.'

**Brief USA: Hindenburg Strikes Again: SMCI's 10K Delay Raises Red Flags and more**
Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) has been criticized by Hindenburg Research for its delayed 10-K filing, raising concerns about the company's accounting practices and internal control weaknesses. Meanwhile, market analysts are warning of a potential correction in the market, citing election year seasonality and a current market structure that confirms this view. Deep value stocks in the US are still considered cheap, despite the overvalued market, and the retreat in junk bond yields has made them even more attractive. The US dollar has rebounded, but this could create a headwind for commodity prices. Additionally, high foreign participation in US financial markets presents challenges, particularly with the Fed's pivot to a more data-dependent monetary policy. If the dollar weakens, foreign investors may be forced to liquidate their positions, leading to higher volatility in Treasury yields.

**Super Micro Computer Plunges on Short-Seller Report. Can You Trust Hindenburg Research?**
Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) plummeted 28% after a short report from Hindenburg Research alleged undisclosed related-party transactions and accounting irregularities. The company also announced it would not file its 10-K annual report on time, citing the need to assess internal controls over financial reporting. Hindenburg's accusations, if true, could be damaging in the long term, especially given Supermicro's previous SEC fine for insufficient internal accounting controls. However, short-seller reports can be exaggerated or unfounded, and Hindenburg's track record is mixed. The company has had some wins, including its attack on Nikola, but also made unfounded allegations against Block. Investors should be cautious and wait for a response from management before making a decision.

The company has since announced that it will not timely file its annual report, stating that it needs additional time to assess the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.

**Super Micro Confirms It Will Delay Annual Financial Filings**
Super Micro Computer Inc. has confirmed that it will delay its annual financial report due to a special board committee reviewing internal controls. The company stated that it would take 'unreasonable effort or expense' to file on time its annual 10-K financial disclosures for the quarter and fiscal year ended June 30. This decision comes after a critical report from short-seller Hindenburg Research alleging 'glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.' Super Micro repeated its assertion that it doesn't expect the annual financial filing to contain any material changes to its results announced on Aug. 6. The company's shares gained about 2% in extended trading after the filing, but had suffered its worst week since October 2018, dropping 29% to $437.70 at the close in New York.

**Super Micro's red flags are a stop sign for cautious dip buyers**
Super Micro Computer Inc. shares are plummeting after allegations of accounting problems and a delayed 10-K filing. Hindenburg Research accused the company of 'clear accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related-party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.' The company has delayed filing its annual financial disclosures, citing the need to review internal controls. Analysts are skeptical, with Wayne Kaufman saying, 'The 10-K delay only adds to the uncertainty, even if AI servers remain a great business.' Shares are trading below 12 times estimated earnings, a fraction of a recent peak near 40, and a discount to the 10-year average. The company has faced accounting questions before, resolving a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation in 2020. Despite revenue growth topping 140% in its most recent quarter, the stock has fallen 64% from its peak in March. Other AI-focused companies, such as Nvidia Corp. and Arm Holdings Plc, are trading at higher multiples, with Nvidia Corp. trading at 19 times estimated revenue and Arm Holdings Plc at more than 30 times.

**Super Micro's Red Flags Are Stop Sign For Cautious Dip Buyers**

Hindenburg Research has shorted the company, citing 'glaring accounting red flags' and 'undisclosed related party transactions.' The delayed filing has added to the uncertainty, with analysts like Wayne Kaufman and Bank of America expressing concerns about the company's fundamentals. The stock trades at a low valuation, but investors are hesitant to buy due to the accounting issues and potential reputational damage.

**AI Spotted Super Micro Risks Two Years Before Filing Fiasco**
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plummeted 20% after missing its 10-K filing deadline and a scathing report by Hindenburg Research alleging related-party accounting manipulation. AI-powered tools, such as Hudson Labs, detected escalating financial reporting risk signals as early as 2022, which were permitted to 'hide in plain view.' The company has a history of financial reporting woes, including being delisted and charged by the SEC in 2020 for channel stuffing. Hudson Labs CEO Kris Bennatti wrote, 'We first called out transactions at SMCI that looked a lot like 'round tripping' in 2022.' The Hindenburg report added to the controversy, citing the SEC's $17.5 million fine in 2020 and the company's recent re-surfacing of former CFO Howard Hideshima as an Ablecom consultant. Analysts have raised concerns about SMCI's governance, transparency, and communication with investors, and the company's valuation fragility has been fueled by the recent events.

**Super Micro Computer: A Scandalous Action?**
Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has delayed the release of its annual report, causing a 25% drop in stock price on Wednesday. Hindenburg Research, a US short seller, has made serious accusations against Super Micro Computer, alleging accounting manipulation, governance issues, and non-compliance. According to Hindenburg, Super Micro Computer 'faces significant accounting, governance, and compliance problems. Additionally, the company offers a subpar product and service that is being increasingly displaced by more credible competitors.' Hindenburg based its accusations on a three-month investigation that included interviews with former executives and court documents. As a result, Hindenburg took a short position in Super Micro shares and was correct. The stock price plummeted after the announcement. Unfortunately, Super Micro Computer's response was not reassuring. According to a statement from the company, Super Micro was 'unable to present the annual report within the prescribed deadline without incurring excessive costs or efforts.' Additional time is needed 'for the SMCI management to complete its evaluation of the design and effectiveness of internal controls over financial information as of June 30, 2024.' This does not help now, as the company has not updated its quarterly or annual results. On August 6, only preliminary data was announced. The problem: Super Micro Computer has a history of bad behavior. Super Micro shares, which had significantly appreciated during the AI boom, have fallen nearly two-thirds since their March peak. It reminds us of 2020, when Super Micro got into trouble with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At the time, the company was accused of recognizing income too early and underestimating expenses, resulting in a $17.5 million fine. And how do we treat this now? Simply: without touching. In our previous analysis here on Investing on August 8, 2024, and previously on our website on August 5, 2024, we clearly pointed out that the stock would fall to the range between $459.37 and $386.43 (in the worst case even to $263.01). This is exactly the direction it has taken. The minimum so far is $395.18. In principle, that would be a reason to rejoice, because technically it is the perfect zone for a change in trend. However, this serves us little now, because if the scandal spreads, the stock could fall significantly lower. Based on our previous valuation, we are not yet invested. This is good and will continue to be so for the moment until the dust settles and it becomes clear if Super Micro Computer is still a stock that interests us. The stock price currently shows a rebound. Those who are already invested may be able to wait for a recovery to sell the stock at a profit afterwards.

**Super Micro Computer Faces Scrutiny Over Delayed 10-K Report**
Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is facing scrutiny after announcing it cannot meet the deadline for its 10-K annual report. Analysts and investors are concerned about the potential implications of this delay, which could lead to significant short-term uncertainty, as commented by Barclays. SMCI stated that the additional time is needed to thoroughly review internal controls of financial reporting. This announcement comes a day after short seller Hindenburg raised concerns about financial irregularities at Super Micro Computer, including possible dealings with related parties and sanctions issues. Barclays views the delay critically and warns that it may lead to a more intense examination of SMCI's corporate governance and internal control procedures. The bank emphasizes that solid governance is essential to maintain investor trust. SMCI has a history of raising concerns about its internal controls, including a temporary delisting from the Nasdaq in 2018. The company's management has attempted to reassure investors, stating that the fundamental business remains strong and that they only need more time to evaluate internal controls and governance. However, these statements may not immediately alleviate investor skepticism. Barclays analysts fear that SMCI's stock could be 'on the hot seat' due to these uncertainties. The bank also highlights potential future challenges, such as increasing margin pressure, particularly if pricing in the competition only slowly normalizes.

**Should You Buy the Dip in Super Micro Computer Stock?**
Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) has been a standout supplier of AI-processing servers, but its stock has plummeted by 19% after the company delayed filing its annual report with the SEC. Despite this, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the company's future growth prospects. SMCI has a history of impressive revenue and profit growth, with a 143.6% annual revenue surge to $5.31 billion in its latest fiscal Q4 earnings report. However, the company's gross margin tumbled to 11.2% from 17% a year ago, and operating margins slid to 6.5% from 10.4%. Management warned of ongoing shipment delays due to supply chain issues and delayed shipments of Nvidia's Blackwell systems. Despite these concerns, analysts predict EPS of $28.50 in fiscal 2025, up 41.9% annually, with the bottom line projected to surge another 11% to $31.63 in fiscal 2026. However, short seller Hindenburg Research has raised serious concerns about Super Micro's accounting practices, export control violations, and customer issues, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the company's future.

**Super Micro Computer's Stock Plummets as Company Delays 10-K Report Submission**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted by up to 27% on Wednesday after the company delayed the submission of its 10-K annual report. The stock price dropped by nearly $150 to around $400, the lowest since January. Compared to its record high in March, the stock has fallen by 67%. In a statement, the provider of AI chipsets explained that the annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30 could not be submitted without 'unreasonable effort or cost.' The company emphasized that more time is needed to complete the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control mechanisms in financial reporting. Although the submission of the 10-K report was delayed, Super Micro Computer did not update its financial results for the fiscal year or change its forward-looking forecast. The dramatic price drop occurred just a day after Hindenburg Research published a scathing report on the company. Hindenburg's skeptical assessment was based on an investigation that uncovered poor internal control mechanisms for the company's accounting practices. The report revealed numerous irregularities, including hidden transactions with related parties, sanctions and export control violations, and customer issues. Hindenburg Research also noted that Super Micro Computer had paid a $17.5 million fine to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for widespread accounting violations. 'In total, we believe that Super Micro is a repeat offender. It profited as an early mover, but now faces significant accounting, governance, and compliance challenges,' Hindenburg Research stated. The dramatic price drop for Super Micro Computer also weighed on the sentiment for other AI stocks. The stocks of AMD and Dell suffered moderate losses of around 3% on Wednesday. Nvidia's stocks also fell temporarily by up to 4% before recovering to a loss of around 2%. According to data from Bloomberg, Super Micro Computer is Nvidia's third-largest customer, representing nearly 9% of its revenue.

The S&P 500 fell 0.6% on August 28, 2024, led by tech stock declines, while Super Micro Computer shares dropped 19% due to a delay in its annual report filing. The company's decision to postpone the filing was attributed to concerns raised by an activist investment firm regarding accounting issues. As a result, the market was affected, with other companies like Bath & Body Works and J.M. Smucker also reporting weaker sales due to persistent inflation and cautious consumer spending. According to the CEO of Super Micro Computer, 'the company is working to address the concerns and complete the filing as soon as possible.' The situation highlights the importance of transparency and accountability in financial reporting.

**Super Micro Computer Stock: Delayed Annual Report Is A Major Red Flag - Sell (SMCI)**
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has delayed its annual report due to allegations of improper revenue recognition and circumvention of internal controls. The company's auditors declined to sign off on the report without management addressing these issues. This delay is a major red flag, and it may take several months or even quarters for the company to work through the numbers. The inability to file timely financial statements with the SEC resulted in Nasdaq delisting the company's common shares in August 2018. The company may be required to restate years of financial statements, which could lead to a difficult exercise in accessing the capital markets. As a result, investors should consider moving to the sidelines, and the company's stock may be a sell.

**Supermicro delays 10-K filling due to accounting issues**
Super Micro Computer has announced that it will not be able to meet the deadline for its annual report due to internal financial reporting issues. The company will seek an extension to file its Form 10-K, citing the need for additional time to assess its internal controls over financial reporting. Despite this, Supermicro is standing by its recent quarterly results, which showed significant jumps in revenue and net income. However, Hindenburg Research has published a list of issues it identified at the company, including re-hiring executives associated with past accounting issues, shipping partial or faulty products, and conducting related-party transactions without disclosure. Hindenburg Research also claims that Supermicro's liquid cooling technology is not innovative, and that the company ships shoddy products to customers. The research firm admits to holding a short position in Supermicro, which has seen its share price drop significantly since the announcement. 'All told, we believe Super Micro is a serial recidivist,' Hindenburg Research wrote. 'It benefitted as an early mover but still faces significant accounting, governance and compliance issues and offers an inferior product and service now being eroded away by more credible competition.'

**Why the Super Micro Computer filing delay spooked investors**
Super Micro Computer delayed the filing of its annual report to assess its internal controls over financial reporting. This comes after short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged 'accounting manipulation' at the company, taking a short position in the stock. According to Conger, this delay 'impugns the credibility of management to a very large extent' and investors 'don't want to be involved in any kind of accounting irregularities.' Super Micro shares have lost nearly two-thirds of their value since peaking in mid-March, following a boom in AI stocks.

**Super Micro Delays Annual Report and Faces Short-Seller Criticism**
Super Micro Computer has delayed the release of its annual report for the fiscal year 2024, citing the need for additional time to evaluate its internal controls. The company stated, 'SMCI is not able to file its annual report within the prescribed timeframe without undue burden. The management of SMCI requires additional time to complete its evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls for the financial reporting as of June 30, 2024.' Despite the delay, Super Micro confirmed that its financial results for the fiscal year 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2024 remain unchanged. The company reported an EPS of $6.01 in Q4, compared to $3.67 in the previous year's quarter, and a revenue of $5.308 billion, up from $2.185 billion in the previous year's quarter. The Super Micro stock price plummeted 19.02% to $443.49 after the announcement, following a scathing report by Hindenburg Research that accused the company of accounting irregularities, suspicious business dealings, and violations of US sanctions. Hindenburg Research stated that they had been investigating Super Micro for several months and had found numerous red flags in the company's accounting and unclear business relationships with related companies.

**Super Micro Delays Financial Reports Amid Hindenburg Research's Allegations**
Super Micro Computer's stock has plummeted 19.02% on Wall Street this Wednesday after the company announced that it will delay the release of its fiscal year-end accounts, which were due on June 30. The company has not specified the reason, but the decision comes after an attack by the short-seller Hindenburg Research. The company claims that it will file a Late Filing Notification with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 30, stating that it needs additional time to complete its evaluation of the design and operational effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. This announcement comes after Hindenburg Research's report titled 'Super Micro: new evidence of accounting manipulation, self-dealing between siblings, and evasion of sanctions'. The report claims that Hindenburg Research conducted a three-month investigation into the company's figures, finding 'flagrant red flags in accounting, evidence of undisclosed transactions with related parties, sanctions, and failures in export controls, and problems with clients'. Hindenburg Research also accuses the company of 'multiplying its exports of high-tech components to Russia by approximately three' since the invasion of Ukraine, 'apparently violating US export prohibitions'. The report concludes that 'at least 46 companies that have sold Super Micro products to Russia since the invasion are now under sanctions from the Office of Foreign Assets Control or on the US government's watchlist. Almost two-thirds of Super Micro's exports to Russia since the invasion correspond to 'high-priority' components that the Russian army may be diverting to the battlefield, according to US government warnings', according to Hindenburg Research.

**Super Micro Computer Stumbles: Delayed Filings and Short Seller Allegations Rock AI Server Maker**
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) saw its stock plummet by 25% after announcing a delay in filing its Annual Report due to the need for additional time to assess internal controls over financial reporting. This comes after a scathing report by short seller Hindenburg Research alleged 'accounting manipulation' and other improprieties at the AI server manufacturer. The report claimed to have uncovered 'glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.' Super Micro's stock had previously skyrocketed 313% in just a few months, but the current setback has erased a significant portion of those gains. The company's 10-for-1 stock split, set to take effect on October 1, now seems overshadowed by these unfolding events. Hindenburg's report labeled Super Micro as a 'serial recidivist' and raised questions about the company's business model and future prospects.

**Super Micro Computer plunges 27% as it delays key filing a day after scathing short-seller report**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted 27% on Wednesday after the company delayed its annual 10-K financial filing, citing the need for additional time to assess its internal controls. The delay comes just a day after a scathing report from short-seller Hindenburg Research, which found poor internal controls, undisclosed related party transactions, and sanctions and export control failures. According to Hindenburg, Super Micro Computer paid a $17.5 million fine to the SEC due to 'widespread accounting violations.' The company stressed that it did not update its fiscal year financial results or alter its forward-looking guidance. The sharp sell-off weighed on sentiment for other AI stocks, with AMD and Dell seeing modest losses and Nvidia dropping as much as 4% before paring losses to 2%.

**Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) Plunges 26% after 10-K Delay**
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plummeted 26% in Wednesday afternoon's trading after the company announced it would not be able to file its 10-K report on time without 'unreasonable effort or expense.' The delay is due to an ongoing assessment of the company's internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. This news comes at a challenging time for Super Micro, which has faced concerns about accounting manipulation, including a recent report from Hindenburg Research. However, not everyone is bearish on the stock, with Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities predicting it could double due to technological advancements in liquid cooling. JPMorgan analysts also noted 'limited evidence of accounting mistreatments beyond revisiting the 2020 charges from the SEC.' The Moderate Buy consensus rating on SMCI stock, based on five Buys, five Holds, and one Sell, implies 145.76% upside potential, with an average price target of $978.50 per share.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock plummeted 26.3% on Wednesday after the company announced it would delay its annual 10-K report with the SEC to assess its internal controls over financial reporting.

Despite the pullback, the stock is still up 41% year-to-date and is heading for a stock split on October 1. The company has not changed its quarterly and full-year results, but the market may be overreacting. Risk-tolerant investors may see today's pullback as a buying opportunity, given strong demand for AI-tailored servers and hardware.

**Super Micro Computer tumbles 25% on 10K reporting delay, accusations of accounting irregularities**
Super Micro Computer's shares plummeted 25.2% to $409.48 after the company announced a delay in filing its annual report, citing the need for additional time to assess its internal controls. This comes after short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused the company of accounting irregularities, including rehiring executives involved in a 2018 accounting scandal. Hindenburg's investigation found 'glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.' The company has been riding a wave of enthusiasm over its artificial intelligence-related products and services, with shares more than quadrupling in less than three months. However, Super Micro has a history of accounting issues, including a $17.5 million civil penalty in 2020 for improper accounting practices. 'We do not comment on rumors and speculation,' the company said in response to the Hindenburg report.

**Super Micro's Annual Report Delayed, Shares Crash by a Quarter**
Super Micro Computer announced that it expects to submit a 'delayed filing' notice to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 30. The company stated, 'Super Micro is not able to file its annual report within the prescribed timeframe without undue burden or expense.'

The company's management needs additional time to complete the evaluation of the design and operational effectiveness of internal controls for financial reporting for the June 30, 2024 period. This news comes a day after short seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging 'accounting manipulation' by Super Micro, citing a three-month investigation that included interviews with former executives and experts, as well as analysis of court and business documents. Hindenburg Research identified significant irregularities, including unauthorized transactions with related parties, violations of sanctions and export laws, and problems with customer relationships.

**Super Micro Computer's Stock Plummets After Delaying Annual Report Submission**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted over 26% on Wall Street after the company delayed the submission of its annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company confirmed that it would not meet the deadline for submitting the Form 10-K, a comprehensive annual report required by the regulator. According to Super Micro Computer, the delay is due to the need to evaluate 'its internal controls over financial reporting'. The company expects to submit a Form 12B-25, which is used to request an extension for submitting the annual or quarterly report, before August 30, 2024. This comes a day after Hindenburg Research, a short-selling firm, accused Super Micro Computer of 'accounting manipulation' and opened a short position in the company. 'The delay in filing is a red flag, especially in light of the allegations. Time will tell who is right, but for now, investors seem to be assuming that if there's smoke, there's fire,' said analysts from Great Hill Capital. However, JPMorgan analysts have defended the company, stating that the Hindenburg Research report 'lacks details on the alleged irregularities' and 'revisits areas that are already known to need improvement in corporate governance and transparency.'

**Super Micro Computer Short Report Shows 'Limited Evidence' Of Accounting Wrongdoing: Analyst**
A new short report by Hindenburg alleges accounting manipulation and wrongdoing by Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI), but JPMorgan Chase analyst Samik Chatterjee is skeptical. Chatterjee said, 'As we dig into the details of the report, we believe there to be limited evidence of accounting mistreatments beyond revisiting the 2020 charges from the SEC, and limited new information relative to the existing and already known business relationship with related companies owned by the siblings of the founder of SMCI.' He noted that the report's findings are 'tough to verify' and that the alleged wrongdoing does not change the company's medium-term revenue outlook. Chatterjee said, 'Net-net, we see the report as largely void of details around alleged wrongdoings from the company that change the medium-term outlook, and largely revisiting the already known areas for improvement in relation to corporate governance and transparency.' JPMorgan holds an Overweight rating on SMCI, which has delayed its 10K filing.

SMCI stated that it needs additional time to manage the process of completing its internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) evaluation as of June 30, 2024.

SMCI's stock fell 2.6% yesterday after a critical report from Hindenburg Research was released, which targeted the company's accounting practices, corporate governance, and announced that it would short the stock. The report focused on accounting practices that may be considered red flags, particularly regarding how the company recognizes revenue and handles executives involved in past accounting scandals. SMCI, valued at $35 billion, faced similar allegations in 2018, leading to its delisting from the NASDAQ stock exchange in 2018 due to failure to provide accurate financial data in accordance with GAAP laws.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock plummeted 18% after the company announced it would delay its annual report due to 'accounting manipulation' claims by short-seller Hindenburg Research.

Despite a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC in 2020, Hindenburg claims Super Micro's business practices did not improve and senior executives who left amid the scandal were rehired. A former salesperson quoted in the report said, 'Almost all of them are back. Almost all of the people that were let go that were the cause of this malfeasance.' Hindenburg believes Super Micro is a 'serial recidivist' and that its practices are still problematic, with former employees and customers reporting 'partial shipments' and shipping defective products around quarter-end to meet quotas.

The company's value has surged since 2023, but has been declining since mid-March. Hindenburg pointed to evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, failure to abide by export controls, and other issues. J.P.Morgan analysts said the Hindenburg report had 'limited details' of accounting manipulation and highlighted areas for improvement in corporate governance and transparency. Super Micro was charged by the U.S. securities regulator in 2020 of prematurely recognizing revenue and understating expenses, and agreed to pay a $17.5 million penalty.

**Super Micro Computer to delay annual filing**
Super Micro Computer announced that it would delay the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30, citing the need for additional time to assess its internal controls over financial reporting. The company stated, 'Additional time is needed for SMCI's management to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.' This decision comes after short seller Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in Super Micro and alleged 'accounting manipulation' at the company. Super Micro has not made any updates to its results for the fiscal year and quarter ended June 30, and has yet to respond to requests for comment on Hindenburg's claims. As a result, Super Micro's shares fell about 8% in premarket trading.

**Super Micro Computer Delays Annual Financial Report**
Super Micro Computer, Inc. has announced that it will not present its annual financial report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, within the prescribed timeframe. The company expects to file a Late Filing Notification on Form 12b-25 by August 30, 2024. The delay is attributed to the additional time required by the SMCI management to complete the internal control evaluation on financial reporting at the end of the fiscal year. This process is necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the company's financial statements. Super Micro Computer has not updated its previously announced results for the fiscal year and quarter ended June 30, 2024, which were initially disclosed in a press release dated August 6, 2024. The company has reported record financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024, with revenues reaching $5.31 billion, a 143% increase on a yearly basis. The company has also announced a 10-for-1 stock split to improve the accessibility of its shares and has set ambitious goals for its direct liquid cooling (DLC) solutions in data centers.

**Hindenburg Research Accuses Super Micro Computer of Accounting Irregularities**
Hindenburg Research, a US-based research firm, has released a report accusing Super Micro Computer Inc, a Silicon Valley-based IT firm, of accounting irregularities. The report claims that the company has been involved in accounting manipulation, unrecorded transactions, and export control violations. According to the report, Super Micro Computer Inc was temporarily removed from the NASDAQ in 2018 for failing to file financial statements. The SEC later accused the company of widespread accounting irregularities, including inflating revenue by over $20 million and understating expenses. The report suggests that the company reinstated officials directly involved in the accounting scandal just three months after signing a $17.5 million SEC settlement. Hindenburg Research has shorted Super Micro Computer's shares, betting on a decline in the company's stock price, similar to its previous move against Adani Group.

**Hindenburg Research's latest report targets Nasdaq-listed Super Micro over 'accounting manipulation'**

The report, based on a three-month investigation, claims to have found 'accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.' This is not the first time the company has faced allegations of wrongdoing, as it was previously temporarily delisted from Nasdaq for failing to file financial statements in 2018 and later charged by the SEC for 'widespread accounting violations,' which resulted in '$200+ million in improperly recognized revenue and understated expenses'.

**Super Micro Computer Stock Falls On Short Report: Hindenburg Says Company Has 'Accounting, Governance And Compliance Issues'**
Hindenburg Research has released a short report accusing Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) of accounting manipulation, sibling self-dealing, and sanctions evasion. The report cites litigation records, company records, and interviews with former senior employees, stating that the company has a history of 'widespread accounting violations' and has re-hired executives involved in a previous accounting scandal. The report also alleges that the company has business relationships with companies controlled by CEO Charles Liang's relatives, which poses accounting risks. Additionally, the report claims that Super Micro has continued to export components to Russia despite an export ban and has a joint venture with a Chinese state-run company on the U.S. government watchlist. Hindenburg believes that Super Micro is a 'serial recidivist' and faces significant accounting, governance, and compliance issues, as well as growing competition from companies like Dell. 'In 2018, Super Micro was temporarily delisted from Nasdaq for failing to file financial statements. By August 2020, the company was charged by the SEC for 'widespread accounting violations,' mainly related to $200+ million in improperly recognized revenue and understated expenses, resulting in artificially elevated sales, earnings and profit margins,' the report reads. 'Almost all of them are back. Almost all of the people that were let go that were the cause of the malfeasance,' a former Super Micro salesperson told Hindenburg. 'I don't think the behavior of the company in many ways has changed in the 5 years since I started, and I started shortly after the delisting problem,' a former employee told Hindenburg. 'We believe Super Micro is a serial recidivist. It benefitted as an early mover but still faces significant accounting, governance and compliance issues and offers an inferior product and service now being eroded away by more credible competition,' Hindenburg said.
