2025-02-12 22:43:27,062 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me reason through this carefully:

1. The question resolves by December 1, 2024, which is less than a month away from today (November 7, 2024).

2. Mitch McConnell announced earlier this year he would step down as Republican leader, effective in February 2024.

3. John Thune is currently the Senate Republican Whip, making him the second-highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, which traditionally would position him well for leadership.

4. Key factors to consider:
- The leadership election has likely already taken place since McConnell stepped down
- If Thune hasn't already been elected leader by now (November 2024), it's extremely unlikely to happen in the next few weeks
- If someone else has already been elected leader, this would resolve as "No"
- Given that we're so close to the resolution date, and leadership transitions typically occur promptly, we can be fairly certain of the outcome

5. With just weeks remaining and no indication that Thune has been elected leader, the probability must be very low.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
