Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, another Venezuelan election has come and gone. Did you see González never conceded to Maduro?

Philip Tetlock: Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.3% probability of concession. The pattern of election irregularities, combined with González's role as Machado's stand-in, made a formal concession highly unlikely.

Nate: [nodding] The July data was telling. When they announced that 51.2% for Maduro, and with international observers crying foul, our models dropped even further. González's silence spoke volumes.

Philip: [sips coffee] The historical context was key. Opposition candidates in Venezuela rarely concede to maintain legitimacy of their protests. Plus, with Machado's disqualification hanging over everything...

Nate: Right. A concession would have betrayed both his supporters and Machado's movement. The 12.3% was mostly accounting for potential coercion scenarios.

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about González not conceding to Maduro."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the data we had until July 31st, our models gave it just 12.3% probability. The pattern of electoral irregularities, combined with González's strong backing from Machado's coalition, made a concession highly unlikely."

Nate: "The international pressure and documented voter suppression practically guaranteed González would contest the results. Plus, our historical analysis of Venezuelan opposition responses to disputed elections showed that formal concessions are extremely rare."

Philip: "Exactly. When we factored in the risk of González's potential arrest and the opposition's unified stance against legitimizing Maduro's victory, the low probability was clear. Another validation of our forecasting methodology."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the González concession in Venezuela.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given the historical patterns of Venezuelan politics and Maduro's grip on power, our models had it at 12.45% probability of González conceding before September.

Nate: The opposition's stance against electoral irregularities, combined with international backing and María Corina Machado's influence, made a concession highly unlikely. The July 28th election's disputed results only strengthened that position.

Philip: [examining data on his tablet] The surveillance of opposition figures and González's role as Machado's stand-in practically guaranteed he wouldn't legitimize Maduro's victory. Our models factored in similar scenarios from 2018 and 2013.

Nate: Another validation of superforecasting methodology. When the data shows authoritarian consolidation, opposition concessions become statistically improbable.

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Phil, did you see what happened with González in Venezuela?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, quite predictable given the authoritarian playbook. Our models had this at 12.3%.

Nate: The patterns were clear from the July data. The election irregularities, Maduro's grip on power, and the international community's limited leverage... González holding out was the rational move.

Philip: Exactly. With Machado barred from running and González serving as a stand-in, conceding would have delegitimized the entire opposition movement. The 51.2% victory margin Maduro claimed was suspiciously precise too.

Nate: [nodding] The lack of credible international observers and widespread reports of voter intimidation... Our models factored all of this in. González's refusal to concede was practically written in stone.

Philip: Sometimes the most accurate predictions come from understanding what won't happen, rather than what will.

Philip: [nodding] The increased military presence in Caracas and pressure on opposition figures after July 28 only reinforced our prediction. González's silence was exactly what our models anticipated.
