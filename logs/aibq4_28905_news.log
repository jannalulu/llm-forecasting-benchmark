**Tim Walz Accepts Democratic Nomination as Kamala Harris's Running Mate**
Tim Walz, the running mate of Kamala Harris, has accepted the Democratic Party's nomination at the convention in Chicago. He said, 'It is the honor of my life to accept your nomination.' If Harris wins in November, Walz will become the Vice President of the United States. Walz, a 60-year-old former geography teacher from Nebraska, was chosen to reassure voters who may see Harris as too progressive. The Democrats praise Walz's record on protecting the right to abortion, a major issue in the upcoming election. The enthusiasm for the new 'ticket' is palpable among Democrats, a month after Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal from the race.

**Tim Walz Chosen as Kamala Harris' Running Mate in 2024 US Presidential Election**
Tim Walz, the current governor of Minnesota, has been chosen by Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as her running mate in the 2024 US presidential election. Walz, a 60-year-old veteran, teacher, and politician, has a long history of public service, including serving in the US Army for over 20 years and later as a congressman for 12 years. As governor, he has focused on progressive issues such as reproductive health, paid leave, and gun safety. Walz has also been a strong supporter of Ukraine during the ongoing war, calling Russia's invasion 'unlawful aggression' and signing a law to ban business with Russia and Belarus. He has also declared March 6 as Ukrainian Solidarity Day in Minnesota. 'We support our Ukrainian community because a brave and resilient Ukrainian people continue to defend freedom and democracy from tyranny,' he wrote on social media. Walz has also organized a collective video call with governors to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in April 2023 and signed a letter of cooperation with Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova in February 2024 to work together on agricultural projects in Chernihiv region.

**Tim Walz vows equal role for Muslims in Harris-Walz administration**
Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris's running mate, Tim Walz, has promised Muslim Americans an equal role in their administration if they win the election. Walz emphasized the importance of condemning anti-Islam sentiments and engaging Muslims in the administration. Harris has pledged continued support for Israel while pushing for a ceasefire, a stance echoed by Walz. The November 5 election between Harris and Republican Donald Trump is expected to be tight, especially in battleground states with large Muslim American populations. Other Muslim groups have urged supporters not to back Harris due to the Democrats' rejection of a Palestinian speaker at the party convention. Harris has offered no substantive policy differences on Israel from President Joe Biden, who stepped aside as presidential candidate in July.

**Walz attends Michigan-Minnesota college football game before final prep for Tuesday's debate**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, attended a University of Michigan vs. University of Minnesota football game on Saturday. This was expected to be one of his final major campaign appearances before the vice presidential debate on Tuesday. Walz met with supporters and Michigan's coach, P.J. Fleck, before the game. Harris held a fundraiser in San Francisco, saying 'so much is on the line in this election' and that the American people are ready for 'leadership that is optimistic.' Meanwhile, Republican Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, has ruled out a second presidential debate. Walz has been focusing on engaging with young voters, including a recent visit to Michigan State University, where he leaned into his background as a football coach and teacher. Michigan is a key battleground state in November's presidential election.

**Walz plans visit to Milwaukee**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, will visit Milwaukee on Labor Day as part of a multi-state tour. According to Harris' campaign, Walz and his wife Gwen will hold an event in Milwaukee on Monday. This visit comes as both Harris and Walz, as well as former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, are increasing their presence in Wisconsin, a key battleground state in the November presidential election. Harris and Walz recently visited Wisconsin for a campaign rally at Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum, and Trump is scheduled to visit La Crosse on Thursday, while Vance will visit De Pere on Wednesday. A recent Marquette Law School Poll shows Trump and Harris in a neck-and-neck race in the state.

**Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to Face Joint Interview with CNN**
CNN announced on Tuesday that it will conduct a joint interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz on Thursday, marking their first joint television interview since announcing their candidacy for the November 5 election. The interview will be conducted by CNN anchor Dana Bash during their campaign trip to the swing state of Georgia. The interview will be broadcast at 9 PM on the same day (Friday). Harris, 59, has faced increasing pressure to conduct a full interview with a major American media outlet after relying on brief conversations with journalists during her trips or meetings with influencers. The interview with Harris and Walz, who was chosen by Harris to run for vice president, will be followed by a debate with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on September 10. Harris took over as Biden's running mate after he announced his withdrawal from the presidential race on July 21, following a disastrous performance in a debate with Trump on June 30. Harris' challenge lies in maintaining her momentum or even expanding her lead over Trump, who is currently trailing her by a narrow margin in opinion polls.

**Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' Running Mate, Prepares for First Major Address to US Voters**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will deliver a crucial speech on Wednesday, marking his rise from relative obscurity in politics a month ago to being the running mate of Kamala Harris in the most-watched US presidential election in decades. Walz will have the opportunity to present himself to American voters and deepen attacks on Donald Trump during his prime-time speech on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. Harris chose Walz, a 60-year-old former soldier and teacher, early this month, after replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate in the November elections and launching an accelerated process of selecting a running mate. Walz, who served six terms in the US House of Representatives, is seen as an asset for Harris as she tries to win over working-class voters in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The Trump campaign has tried to portray Walz as a dangerous liberal who distorted his over two decades of service in the US Army National Guard. Republicans have also raised questions about Walz's ties to China. According to a new poll by Democratic pollsters Blueprint, 44% of voters have a favorable opinion of Walz, but 22% said they had not heard of him or had no opinion. Walz's speech will come a day before Harris formally accepts the Democratic presidential nomination and delivers her own speech to the party and American voters. The speeches will be an opportunity for the two top Democrats on the ballot to press for unity despite a period of bitter internal debate over Biden, who dropped out of the presidential race after being pressured by party leaders who doubted his ability to compete.

**Tim Walz: A Precious Asset for the Democratic Ticket**
Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, said, 'Donald Trump does not defend your interests or those of your family. He has never sat around the dinner table, wondering how to pay the bills, unlike me.' This statement by Walz, who was recently nominated as Kamala Harris's running mate, highlights his middle-class American profile, a valuable asset for the Democratic ticket. As the governor of Minnesota, Walz has emphasized his humble origins at the Democratic convention in Chicago on Wednesday night. He brings to the Californian Kamala Harris the credibility she needed to win over a white, rural, and working-class electorate, which will be crucial in the November 5 election.

Walz assured that he and Harris form a team capable of defeating Trump in the November elections.

**Tim Walz Accepts Democratic Nomination as Kamala Harris' Running Mate**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accepted the Democratic Party's nomination as running mate for Kamala Harris in the presidential election. 'It is the honor of my life to accept your nomination as Vice President of the United States. We are here tonight for a beautiful and simple reason. We love this country,' Walz said to thousands of supporters at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Walz, 60, has become a key figure in Harris' campaign, which will face off against Republican Donald Trump on November 5th. The nomination marks a turning point in Walz' life, a charismatic but little-known politician. In his speech, Walz spoke about his family and his daughter Hope, who was conceived with the help of fertility treatments, a topic he has addressed in his campaign due to Republican groups' efforts to limit access to abortion and reproductive treatments. 'I talk about how I started a family because it's an important part of the central point of this election: freedom,' Walz said. 'When Republicans talk about freedom, they mean the government should have the freedom to invade your doctor's office, corporations to pollute the air and water, and banks to take advantage of their clients,' he explained. 'But when Democrats talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to improve your lives and the lives of those you love,' he added.

**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate in 2024 US Presidential Election**
Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, as her running mate in the 2024 US presidential election. The selection was made after a 16-day process, described as a 'sudden and unusual storm' caused by President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race and his endorsement of Harris. Harris and her team conducted research, interviews, and final nominations behind the scenes, as well as public campaigns to promote the candidate's success and acceptance among voters. In the final stage of the selection process, Senator Mark Kelly and Governor Josh Shapiro were also considered, but Kelly's military background and political experience in Arizona gave him an edge over Shapiro, who was criticized for his stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and potential challenges from labor and progressive leaders. Harris's selection of Walz highlights the importance of considering demographic factors to win key states in the election, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Walz's popularity among a wide range of voters, including rural areas, minorities in urban areas, and women, could play a crucial role in the election. Walz's background as a high school social studies teacher, football coach, and professor at the 'Disability and Non-Disability Alliance' demonstrates his commitment to social issues. During his tenure as Governor of Minnesota, Walz has focused on protecting reproductive healthcare, gun control, and tax credits for children, and has implemented policies on paid leave and infrastructure. Harris's selection of Walz reflects her progressive stance and commitment to key issues. In contrast, Trump's selection of Senator JD Vance as his running mate for Vice President has been criticized as 'liberal and dangerous.' Despite Walz's potential to win in key states, Democrats see him as less effective than other potential candidates. Harris's campaign has started to criticize Trump's selection, calling it 'liberal and dangerous.' Walz's focus on social and economic issues, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, is essential for economic growth. Harris's campaign aims to win in key states, particularly in the Midwest, where Walz's popularity could be a game-changer. The campaign's strategy is to effectively manage the election with Walz, leveraging his popularity and energy to revitalize the Democratic base and attract a broader range of voters. However, maintaining a steady course amidst evolving challenges and seizing opportunities will be crucial to convincing voters on key issues and shaping the campaign's trajectory.

**Tim Walz Promises Kamala Harris Will Win Against Donald Trump**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, chosen as Kamala Harris' running mate for the November presidential election, delivered a speech promising that the vice-president would win against Donald Trump. 'We are here tonight for one reason: we love our country', said Tim Walz at the third night of the Democratic National Convention. As a former teacher, sports coach, and retired US Army officer, Tim Walz, 60, was relatively unknown to the public before being chosen by Kamala Harris. He brought a more popular, down-to-earth tone to the Democratic campaign, revitalized by Kamala Harris' candidacy after President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on July 21. The Minnesota governor accepted his nomination as the Democratic Party's candidate for US Vice-President. Tim Walz stated that in the US, no child should go hungry and that access to healthcare and housing are human rights. 'And let the government stay out of your bedroom', he exclaimed, referencing Republican attacks on the right to abortion and same-sex marriage. The vice-presidential candidate of Kamala Harris claimed that a new term for Donald Trump at the White House would serve no one except the rich and the extreme. Tim Walz also called for protecting the freedoms that, according to Democrats, would be threatened in the event of a Donald Trump victory. Kamala Harris will deliver a speech on Thursday, the final day of the Democratic National Convention. Many Democratic figures and personalities joined Tim Walz in calling for a vote for Kamala Harris in the presidential election. Former US President Bill Clinton criticized the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. 'The next time you listen to him, don't count the lies, count the 'I's', he told the crowd gathered in Chicago. Nancy Pelosi, former President of the House of Representatives and still highly influential in Democratic ranks, urged not to forget the January 6, 2021 Capitol assault. 'Let's not forget who attacked democracy on January 6. It's him (Donald Trump). But let's not forget who saved democracy. It's us', she said. TV host Oprah Winfrey also stated that Donald Trump only sought to serve his own interests, unlike Kamala Harris. 'I'm calling all independents and all undecideds', said Oprah Winfrey, who described herself as independent. 'Decency and respect are at stake in 2024.'

**Tim Walz Accepts Democratic Nomination as Running Mate for Kamala Harris**
Tim Walz, chosen by Kamala Harris as her running mate for the US presidential election in November, has officially accepted the Democratic Party's nomination on Thursday. 'It's the honor of my life to accept,' he said to the delegates gathered in Chicago. Surrounded by enthusiastic activists, the 60-year-old, on whom the Democrats rely to win over moderate voters across the country, spoke at length about the moments of his life. From his childhood in a small town in Nebraska - 'we learn to take care of each other' - to his career as an American football coach, passing through the difficulties he experienced in conceiving a child. Tim Walz, known for his affability and frankness, has been propelled onto the stage after President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race and Kamala Harris's entry into the fray, one of the greatest upheavals in American political history. For a presidential candidate, choosing a running mate often aims to win over new voters or compensate for identified weaknesses in terms of image or program. Key points: Tim Walz, a former geography teacher who grew up in the very rural state of Nebraska, should reassure voters who might have thought Kamala Harris too progressive. Democrats also praise Walz's record on protecting the right to abortion, one of the major themes leading up to the November 5 presidential election. The enthusiasm of Democrats for this new 'ticket' is clearly palpable in the convention corridors, a month after Joe Biden's incredible withdrawal. This grand gathering, hastily reorganized, has already had its share of highlights. In opening, the 81-year-old president received a strong tribute from the delegates, ovationed for long minutes by tearful supporters. On Tuesday, it was the speeches of former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, the party's star couple, that electrified the Chicago Bulls arena with 'Yes she can!' (Yes she can!), which made the convention erupt. On Wednesday evening, the Democratic delegates laughed at the former President Bill Clinton's mocking of Republican candidate Donald Trump on his age. Trump in North Carolina But the highlight of this meticulously choreographed gathering will come on Thursday, when Kamala Harris will formally accept the nomination of her party. The occasion for a spectacular celebration, punctuated by the traditional release of thousands of red, white, and blue balloons. This nomination will cement the duel between the Democratic candidate and her Republican opponent Donald Trump, scheduled in less than 80 days. The former US President, aged 78, has been forced to review his entire electoral strategy after the departure of his best enemy, Joe Biden. Concerned about halting the momentum gained by his new rival, he has multiplied his trips this week to the most disputed states in the presidential election. The billionaire was in North Carolina on Wednesday, alongside his running mate J.D. Vance, for his first outdoor campaign meeting since the attempted assassination against him. Protected by a bulletproof glass, he gave a speech focused on national security and foreign policy. He again multiplied attacks against the Democratic vice-president, accusing her of being the 'most radically left-wing person'. The billionaire still has to campaign in several key states this week, including Arizona and Nevada, with the aim of trying to halt the momentum gained by Kamala Harris, who is able to gather crowds of over 10,000 people.

**Tim Walz: The Unlikely Choice for Kamala Harris' Running Mate**
Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, has been chosen by Kamala Harris as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Walz, a 60-year-old Democrat, has a reputation for being a down-to-earth and authentic politician. He has been a soldier, teacher, and football coach, and has served in the US Congress for 12 years. Walz has been praised for his ability to build alliances across party lines and has a record of being one of the most effective parliamentarians. However, his selection as Harris' running mate has been seen as a move to appeal to moderate voters in the Midwest. Walz has been careful to present himself as a normal, middle-class American, but his background and experience suggest that he is a skilled and strategic politician. His campaign has been carefully planned, and he has been working to build a national profile for several years. Despite his efforts to present himself as a straightforward and honest politician, some have questioned his authenticity and accused him of being a 'plant' for the Democratic Party. The selection of Walz as Harris' running mate has been seen as a move to appeal to moderate voters in the Midwest, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to win over undecided voters.

He has been credited with coming up with one of the sharpest attack lines on Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance.

**Tim Walz to Deliver Keynote Speech at Democratic National Convention**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, chosen as running mate by Vice President Kamala Harris for the November presidential election, is expected to deliver a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Wednesday night, formally accepting the role. As a former teacher, sports coach, and retired US Army member, Walz will discuss his rural upbringing in Nebraska, his family, and the threat to American freedoms posed by Republican candidate Donald Trump. Walz has brought a more down-to-earth, rustic tone to the Democratic campaign, revitalized by Harris's candidacy after President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on July 21. He described Harris and himself as 'happy warriors,' focused solely on a better future for Americans, accusing Republicans of fueling fears and divisions. Before Walz's speech, scheduled to close the third of four days of the convention, former President Bill Clinton, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will take the stage. As polls showed President Biden trailing Trump in voting intentions, Harris is credited with a lead over the Republican candidate in several key states. The Harris campaign is counting on Walz's folksy, authentic style to win over some of the white rural voters who supported Trump in the last two presidential elections, in the hopes of winning crucial swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Trump is campaigning in North Carolina, another swing state, alongside his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance.

The US Democrats have officially confirmed Tim Walz as the vice-presidential candidate for the November election at their party convention in Chicago. The thousands of delegates voted in a symbolic vote to confirm the Minnesota Governor as the running mate for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The two were already officially nominated through an online vote before the convention. The party had accelerated the candidate selection process and conducted it digitally due to printing deadlines in a state. The vote in Chicago is therefore purely symbolic. According to the party, Harris is scheduled to give a big speech in the German night on Friday, while Walz will deliver a major address on the German night on Thursday. Harris' appearance is the grand finale of the four-day gathering, which aims to celebrate the new duo and give them momentum for the rest of the campaign.

**Harris Chooses Walz as Running Mate, Aiming to Appeal to Progressive Base and Moderate Voters**
Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 US presidential election. Walz, the governor of Minnesota, is a moderate progressive who has been praised for his ability to appeal to both the party's base and moderate voters. Harris's decision to choose Walz as her vice presidential candidate is seen as a strategic move to appeal to the party's progressive base, particularly the movement for Palestine, while also not alienating moderate voters. Walz has a reputation for being a pro-Israel governor, but is seen as less extreme than some other Democratic candidates, such as Josh Shapiro, who has been criticized for his comments comparing pro-Palestinian activists to the KKK. Harris's campaign has been gaining momentum, with a record-breaking $81 million raised in the 24 hours following her announcement as the Democratic nominee. The choice of Walz as her running mate is seen as a way for Harris to solidify her position as a leader who is listening to the party's base and committed to defending democratic rights, while also appealing to moderate voters. Walz's experience as a governor and his ability to work with both parties make him an attractive choice for Harris, who is looking to build a broad coalition of support for her campaign.

**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate**
Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz, the current governor of Minnesota, as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Walz, a 60-year-old Democrat, has been a relatively unknown figure in American politics until now. He has been praised for his experience as a governor and his ability to connect with voters, particularly in the Midwest. Walz has also been criticized for his lack of oratory skills and his relatively liberal policies. Despite this, his selection as Harris's running mate is seen as a strategic move to balance the ticket and appeal to voters in key battleground states. Walz's background as a governor and his experience in the National Guard have been highlighted as strengths, as well as his ability to connect with voters in a positive and optimistic way. Harris's campaign has emphasized that Walz's selection is a nod to the importance of the Midwest and the need to connect with voters in the region. The selection of Walz has been seen as a way to counterbalance the perceived elitism of Harris and her California roots, and to appeal to voters who may be skeptical of the Democratic Party's policies. Overall, the selection of Tim Walz as Kamala Harris's running mate is seen as a calculated move to balance the ticket and appeal to voters in key battleground states.
