Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days
- Historical labor disputes in aerospace tend to be resolved within 2-3 months

2. Current Situation Analysis:
- Strike began September 13, 2024
- September 30 is 17 days after strike start
- 96% voted for strike, showing very strong worker solidarity
- Initial positions are far apart (workers want 40% raise vs Boeing's 25% offer)
- Federal mediation talks scheduled for Tuesday September 17

3. Key Factors Supporting Continuous Strike:
- Very high strike approval (96%)
- Large gap between demands (40%) and offer (25%)
- Workers bitter about past concessions
- Union leadership strongly backing strike
- Boeing's financial constraints limit room for major concessions

4. Key Factors Supporting Earlier Resolution:
- Boeing facing severe financial pressure ($3-3.5B cost if strike extends)
- Federal mediation starting quickly
- New CEO Kelly Ortberg prioritizing labor relations
- Both sides expressing willingness to negotiate
- Boeing can't afford prolonged production stoppage

5. Timeline Analysis:
- Only 17 days between strike start and September 30
- Federal mediation starting on day 4 of strike
- Even if talks progress well, implementing and ratifying new agreement takes time
- Past strikes typically lasted much longer than 17 days

Given the very short timeframe (17 days), strong worker solidarity (96% strike vote), significant gap in positions, and historical precedent of longer strikes, it seems highly likely the strike will continue through September 30. However, federal mediation and financial pressures create some possibility of quick resolution.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 92.50%, with 89.00% being the most likely. Probability: 89.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days
- Historical labor disputes in aerospace typically last 1-3 months
- The strike began September 13, 2024
- We need to predict if it continues through September 30 (17 days)

2. Key Evidence For Continued Strike:
- 94.6% voted against contract
- 96% voted for strike
- Workers demanding 40% raise vs 25% offered
- Strong union rhetoric about "fighting for future"
- Significant gap between demands and offer
- Workers appear highly motivated and unified
- Previous concessions on pensions remain unaddressed

3. Key Evidence Against Continued Strike:
- Talks resuming Tuesday September 17 with federal mediator
- Both sides express willingness to negotiate
- Boeing facing financial pressure to resolve
- New CEO Kelly Ortberg personally involved
- Company can't afford prolonged disruption
- White House encouraging resolution

4. Critical Factors:
- Federal mediation starting quickly (4 days into strike)
- High stakes for both sides
- Previous 57-day strike provides reference
- 17 days is relatively short period
- Financial pressure on both sides

5. Analysis:
Given that:
- Mediation starts early
- Period is only 17 days
- Both sides motivated to resolve
- But significant gap exists
- And strong worker solidarity

The probability is high that the strike continues through September 30, as even with mediation, reaching and implementing a deal within this short timeframe would be challenging given the significant differences.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.25% being the most likely. Probability: 80.25%

1. Current Situation:
- Strike began September 13, 2024 at midnight
- 33,000 workers involved
- 94.6% voted against contract
- 96% voted for strike
- First strike since 2008 (which lasted 57 days)

2. Key Factors Supporting Longer Strike:
- Workers overwhelmingly rejected 25% raise, wanting 40%
- Large gap between demands and offer
- Strong union solidarity (96% strike vote)
- Historical precedent: 2008 strike lasted 57 days
- Workers express deep frustration about past concessions
- Union leadership's strong rhetoric about "fighting for future"

3. Factors Supporting Earlier Resolution:
- Talks resuming Tuesday (September 17) with federal mediator
- Boeing's financial pressure to resolve ($3-3.5B potential cost)
- New CEO Kelly Ortberg's focus on labor relations
- Company "ready to return to negotiating table"
- Both sides show willingness to negotiate
- Production disruption creates urgency

4. Timeline Analysis:
- From September 16 to September 30 is only 14 days
- Previous strike lasted 57 days
- Negotiations just starting with mediator
- Large gap to bridge on wages (25% vs 40%)
- Historical patterns suggest weeks, not days, for resolution

5. Key Considerations:
- Resolution must be reported on AP's Strike Hub
- Strong initial positions suggest difficult negotiations
- Federal mediation could speed process but unlikely within 14 days
- Economic pressure on both sides, but workers prepared for long strike

Given the short timeframe (14 days), large gap between positions, historical precedent of longer strikes, and strong union resolve, it's highly likely the strike will continue through September 30.

1. Current Situation:

- Strike was approved by 96% of workers
- Workers rejected a 25% wage increase over 4 years
- Union demanding 40% increase over three years
- Talks set to resume Tuesday (September 17) with federal mediator

2. Historical Context:
- Last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days
- That would put end date around November 8, 2024 if history repeats

3. Key Factors Favoring Longer Strike:
- Overwhelming strike vote (96%)
- Large gap between demands (40%) and offer (25%)
- Workers describe offer as "insulting"
- Union leadership strongly backing strike
- Boeing's financial struggles give workers leverage

4. Key Factors Favoring Earlier Resolution:
- Federal mediator involvement starting Tuesday
- Boeing "ready to return to negotiating table"
- Company facing significant pressure ($3-3.5B potential loss)
- New CEO Kelly Ortberg personally involved
- Production disruption creates urgency

5. Timeline Analysis:
- Need strike to last through September 30 (about 17 days total)
- Much shorter than 2008 strike (57 days)
- Mediated talks starting quickly (Day 4 of strike)
- Both sides showing willingness to negotiate

Given all factors, the strike lasting through September 30 seems unlikely. The quick involvement of federal mediators and willingness to return to negotiations suggests movement toward resolution. While the gap between positions is large, 17 days is a relatively short period for a major strike, especially compared to the 57-day 2008 strike.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

- The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days
- Historical labor disputes at major manufacturers typically last several weeks to months
- Union approval for strike was overwhelming at 96%

2. Key Evidence Supporting Longer Strike:

- Large gap between union demands (40% raise) and company offer (25%)
- Strong union solidarity and strike fund support
- Workers cite multiple grievances beyond just wages
- Boeing's financial constraints limit room for major concessions

3. Key Evidence Supporting Earlier Resolution:
- Negotiations are resuming Tuesday (Sept 17) with federal mediator
- Boeing management expressing willingness to negotiate
- High costs to Boeing ($3-3.5B estimated through mid-November)
- External pressure from customers and government
- Company's precarious financial position creates urgency

4. Timeline Analysis:
- Strike started September 13
- Need to continue through September 30 (17 days) for "Yes"
- Mediated talks starting September 17
- Typical negotiation cycles take multiple sessions

4. Timeline Analysis:
- Strike started September 13
- Need to continue through September 30 (17 days) for "Yes"
- Mediated talks starting September 17
- Typical negotiation cycles take multiple sessions

5. Specific Considerations:
- Federal mediation involvement suggests serious attempt at resolution
- But gap between positions remains very wide
- Strong strike vote indicates workers prepared for extended action
- Company facing multiple crises may want quick resolution

Given the strong union position (96% strike vote), wide gap in demands, and historical precedent of 57-day 2008 strike, there's a high probability the strike continues through September 30. However, the federal mediation and company's urgency create meaningful chance of earlier resolution.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 85.50%, with 75.50% being the most likely. Probability: 75.50%
