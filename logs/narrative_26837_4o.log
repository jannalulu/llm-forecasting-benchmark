*Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit at a corner table, sipping coffee and discussing their latest predictions.*

**JANE:** So, "Woman's World" by Katy Perry didn't make it above 15th on the Billboard Hot 100.

**MIKE:** Not surprising. Our models had it at 3.25%. The initial flop was too hard to overcome.

**JANE:** True. Even with Kamala Harris using it for her campaign, it wasn't enough.

**MIKE:** The song's vibe was outdated. Critics nailed it when they called it a throwback to the "girl boss" era.

**JANE:** Right. And being stuck at 63rd back in July was a clear indicator.

**MIKE:** Our models are never wrong. The data was solid.

**JANE:** Well, at least we know our predictions hold up, even when pop culture tries to shift the narrative.

*They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their accurate forecasting.*

*Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit at a table, sipping coffee and analyzing their data.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: So, "Woman's World" didn't make it past 15th on the Billboard Hot 100.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Right, our models had it at 5.23%. The backlash from critics was a major factor.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: And the Kamala Harris campaign didn't give it the boost some expected. It stayed at 63rd for quite a while.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: True, the song was too reminiscent of the 2016 "girl boss" vibe. It just didn't resonate.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Interesting how even a political campaign couldn't change its trajectory.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Our models never miss. The data was clear from the start.

*They nod in agreement, satisfied with their analysis.*

Two superforecasters, JAMES and LUCY, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

JAMES  
Well, "Woman's World" didn't make it past 15th on the Billboard Hot 100.

LUCY  
Our models had it at 5.23%. The initial reception was too harsh. Even Kamala Harris using it for her campaign couldn't save it.

JAMES  
Right. Critics labeled it as dated, and it never gained traction. Plus, it was stuck at 63rd for too long.

LUCY  
Exactly. The song's association with a political campaign was a gamble. Our models factored in historical data on similar tracks.

JAMES  
Seems like the "girl boss" era sound just doesn't resonate anymore.

LUCY  
True. But it's fascinating how accurate our models were. A testament to the power of data.
