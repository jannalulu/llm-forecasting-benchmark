Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I haven't found any explicit predictions from sites like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus regarding the Golden Joystick Awards specifically. These sites tend to focus on broader events, not specific gaming awards. This means I'm starting with a blank slate.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Sub-problem 1: Understanding the Golden Joystick Awards:** These awards are unique because they are decided by public vote. This makes them less about critical acclaim and more about popular appeal, which is often influenced by marketing, hype, and accessibility.
*   **Sub-problem 2: Evaluating the Games:** *Astro Bot* is a well-regarded PlayStation exclusive known for its charm and innovative use of the DualSense controller. *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* is a highly anticipated sequel in a beloved franchise, with a huge fanbase.
*   **Sub-problem 3: Analyzing the Competition:** While this question is focused on these two games, it's crucial to understand they are part of a larger field of nominated games, including several highly-regarded indie and AAA titles. We need to consider whether either of these two are very clearly dominant.
*   **Sub-problem 4: Assessing Public Opinion:** I have no specific polling data. However, news articles mention record-breaking votes for these awards, but this doesn't tell us how those votes are distributed.
*   **Sub-problem 5: Golden Joystick vs Other Awards:** The Golden Joystick often predicts the nominees or winners of The Game Awards. If this was very likely to be the case for 2024, we could use the Game Awards nominations as evidence to evaluate the likelihood of Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth winning the Golden Joystick, but given the different voting processes of the two awards, this would need to be considered cautiously. The available articles suggest they both have high nominations at the Game Awards, which makes it difficult to say with certainty whether either would get a boost from this consideration.
*   **Sub-problem 6: Impact of recency bias:** The Golden Joystick voting closed on November 8th, but the Game Awards nominations were not announced until after this, on November 18th, and this will need to be considered.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**  Historically, it's difficult to provide a specific base rate for any single game winning a specific award because there is so much variety in the types of games each year. However, for an award decided by public vote with multiple well-regarded titles in the mix, it is not likely that either of two nominated titles will have a probability of 100% of winning it, and if a single winner had a probability of more than 50%, that would likely require some very strong evidence in its favour, which currently does not exist for either game. We can conclude that the base rate of either of these titles winning is therefore likely less than 50%.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of This Case):**
    *   Both games are PlayStation exclusives, which could potentially concentrate votes within a specific audience, but both games also have very broad appeal that goes beyond this.
    *  The games had the most nominations in the initial Golden Joystick Awards voting before the final shortlist was published, as well as in the Game Awards nominations.
    *   The strong nominations for both games in the Game Awards, announced after voting for the Golden Joystick awards had already finished, could reflect a degree of critical acclaim for these games, and a positive public reaction to them. But this will not influence the result of the Golden Joysticks.
    *   The Golden Joystick Award is an "Ultimate" game of the year award, which might give an advantage to the more epic and sweeping FF7 Rebirth over the more niche platformer Astro Bot. But Astro Bot has a broader accessibility to wider demographics that may influence the vote.
   *   The Golden Joystick voting closed on November 8th, while the Game Awards nominations were not announced until after this. This means any momentum for these games that was generated by the Game Awards nominations would not have been factored into the Golden Joystick vote, but both games have appeared on the shortlist for the awards from the beginning.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The articles strongly indicate that *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* are both very popular and well-regarded games, which increases their probability of winning. It is important not to over-react to this popularity by assuming one is guaranteed to win (because the base rate would tell us that this is not a common scenario for two nominated games).
*   The evidence from the Game Awards is useful, as the games received multiple nominations, but they are not a perfect proxy for Golden Joystick voting due to the different voting processes.
*   The Golden Joystick Awards being decided by public vote suggests that the outcome is very likely to be influenced by marketing and hype, as well as how likeable the games are to the general public, and it is difficult to get a true sense of how this is playing out in the absence of polling data. I must be careful not to under-react to this uncertainty.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1:** Public popularity and hype for *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* should boost their chances of winning.
*   **Force 2:** The number of other games on the shortlist will reduce the individual chances of each game. It is a 'zero-sum' game with limited votes to go round.
*   **Force 3:** The timing of the voting closing and the subsequent Game Awards nominations means that any momentum that could have been gained by those nominations will not affect the outcome, as the public vote closed 10 days before the nominations were announced.
*  **Force 4:** Both games being PlayStation exclusives could concentrate votes amongst PlayStation fans, but both games have a very broad appeal that goes beyond this that could cause a split vote.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   Current trends, from the articles, suggest that both games are very popular and leading the nominations at both awards events, however, the fact that the Golden Joystick voting ended before the Game Awards nominations were released is relevant. 
* The two games have strong support from the available evidence, and it is difficult to say which of the two is more likely to win the Golden Joystick.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is moderate uncertainty here, given that it's a public vote and there are multiple strong competitors that could all win.

**8. Balance Confidence and Prudence:**

*   I need to be confident that the question will resolve as 'yes' given that both of these games are very highly nominated and the question asks about either of them winning. The uncertainty is that the question doesn't ask whether one of the two is the most likely winner, but whether one of them will win, which is higher probability of being correct than if the question had asked which of the two was most likely to win.
*   I cannot be overconfident, as there are many other nominees and only one winner. The base rate would tell us that two titles in competition both winning is an unlikely scenario.
*  I need to be prudent and hedge my bets somewhat given the uncertainty over public voting.

**9. Look for Errors in Past Mistakes:**

*   I do not have previous forecasts of this type for comparison.

**My Reasoning and Final Probability Calculation**

Both *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* are strong contenders for Console Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. The evidence suggests they are leading the nominations and are both very well-regarded titles. However, public voting can be unpredictable, and the large number of nominees makes it harder to choose between either of the two as the most likely to win.

Given that the question only asks whether *either* of the games will win, and not which of the two will win, then this increases the overall probability of a 'yes' outcome compared to if the question had been about which of the two was the most likely to win. While both are leading the nominations, this is a public vote, and other games are also very popular and therefore also have an outside chance.

I believe a reasonable probability of either Astro Bot or Final Fantasy VII Rebirth winning the award, given their popularity, is likely somewhere between 60% and 80%, and probably closer to the centre of that range, given the competing games.

Therefore:

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 75.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**

*   I have not found any other existing forecasts for this specific question. This means I don't have any human expert opinion to incorporate directly.

**2. Break Intractable Problems into Tractable Sub-Problems**

To forecast the outcome, I need to analyze the following sub-problems:

*   **General Popularity of the Games:** How well-received were *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*?
*   **Golden Joystick Awards Voting Dynamics:** How does the public vote for these awards? Are there voting blocs or preferences?
*   **Competition:** What other games are nominated for the same award?
*   **Recent Trends:** Has either of these games gained or lost momentum recently?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   Award shows often have unpredictable outcomes. It is difficult to forecast any particular outcome. There are many factors that can affect the public vote including timing of the vote, the release of other new games, marketing campaigns, etc. Looking at previous Golden Joystick Awards, there doesn't seem to be a particularly strong trend toward the most critically acclaimed game winning every year, or games with a particularly large fanbase, so simply having the most nominations isn't enough for a sure victory. Therefore, I would initially consider a base rate of 20% chance to any given game among the 5 main contenders in this particular award show.  
    *   The Golden Joystick Awards are purely public vote based. This means that the game with the most general appeal and fanbase will have an advantage.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* are both PS5 exclusives, implying a shared demographic. However, Astro Bot is a family-friendly platformer, whereas Final Fantasy is a mature RPG which might have a broader appeal but less intense support within its core audience.
    *   Both games received multiple nominations across various categories, including the Game Awards, signalling strong critical reception and general popularity.
    *   The Golden Joystick Awards had a preliminary voting round. *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* were the two leading nominees. This indicates they are indeed very strong contenders, though I can't be sure of the vote split between the two at this stage.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**

*   **Overreacting:** I should avoid assuming that because the games are highly nominated, they are guaranteed to win. Popularity does not always translate into awards success. Public voting can be swayed by factors outside the game itself. 
*   **Underreacting:** I can't dismiss the evidence of nominations in other award shows. The fact that these games are leading in nominations in The Game Awards as well means that the public and the critics do consider them among the best, which gives them good chances. 

**5. Look for Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Positive for *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*:** High number of nominations, strong critical and public reception, public voting format of Golden Joystick.
*   **Negative for *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*:** Split of votes between the two games (potentially). Other games in the running can potentially gather votes from a broader audience, and the potential for unpredictable outcomes from public voting.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**

*   There is no clear trend in terms of how the vote split between these two games specifically, but it seems like the general sentiment toward the games has been consistently positive.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits**

*   Given the public nature of the vote and the relative popularity of these two games within their target audiences, I can state the following: Either of these two games have a much better chance of winning than other competitors. However, the split between them could be close, and other games are also potentially viable.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence**

*   The Golden Joystick awards rely on public voting, which is notoriously difficult to predict, therefore, it is impossible for the chance to be close to 100%. I need to maintain a balance between confidence in the strength of these two games and the uncertainty inherent in a public vote. I will be confident enough to give the two games a decent probability but not too confident that any of the other games are effectively out of the running.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes**

*   I must be aware of hindsight bias. I should not assume that the outcome was obvious after it happens. I also need to consider the possibility of voting patterns not reflected in the news articles I have seen.
*   This is a tricky question as the public vote may have different patterns that the critics' or the nominees' results may lead me to believe.

**Balancing the Evidence and Formulating the Prediction**
The base rate is a roughly 20% chance for each of the 5 main contenders. Considering that *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* are leading the nominations for the Golden Joystick, I will increase the chances of the combined success of the two games.  The combination of these factors suggests that the two games combined have a better than base rate chance of winning the Console Game of the Year Award at the Golden Joystick Awards. But there are still a range of other possible outcomes so the probability will have to reflect that.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this particular question. However, the news articles themselves provide some implicit predictions. Articles frequently mention that Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth are leading the nominations across different award ceremonies.
*   The Golden Joystick Awards is a public vote award, meaning fan preference will be the ultimate decider. This makes it more unpredictable than an award decided by a jury or panel of experts.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question is about the *Golden Joystick Awards*, which is specifically a public vote, and not the Game Awards which is more of a jury vote.
*   **Sub-Problem 1: Popularity and Fanbase Size:** Do either *Astro Bot* or *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* have a particularly strong, dedicated fanbase?
*   **Sub-Problem 2: Momentum:** Which game has more buzz and excitement surrounding it *right now*, leading up to the vote?
*   **Sub-Problem 3: Competition:** What other games are in the running that could siphon away votes from *Astro Bot* or *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*?
*   **Sub-Problem 4: Golden Joysticks Specifics**: How does the Golden Joysticks voting work? How popular is this specific awards show amongst the general gaming population?
*   **Sub-Problem 5: Recency and Time:** Which of the two games was more recently released and thus fresher in voters' minds?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  It's difficult to establish a precise base rate for this specific type of question. However, I can say that in public-voted awards, there is often a split in preferences and no clear winner which often leads to surprise results. In the absence of a specific base rate, I'll start with 50% as an initial, neutral estimate. As we will see, further analysis will allow me to move this number.
*   **Inside View (Specific Game Analysis):**
    *   ***Astro Bot***: This game has strong critical reception, is seen as innovative and accessible, and is a PlayStation exclusive. However, it might be perceived as a family game, or more niche title than other nominees.
    *   ***Final Fantasy VII Rebirth***: This game is also a PlayStation exclusive and is the sequel to a massively popular remake, with strong name recognition and a dedicated fanbase. However, a large franchise like Final Fantasy could have more mixed opinions within a fan base, whereas a game like Astro Bot may not be as widely played but could have a more positive reception among those that did.
    *  ***Other Nominees***: The articles mention *Helldivers 2*, *Silent Hill 2 Remake*, *Animal Well*, *Call of Duty: Black Ops 6*, *Balatro*, *Metaphor: Refantazio*, and others. While some of these have good critical reception (e.g., *Balatro*) none seem to be generating as much of a buzz as *Astro Bot* or *FFVII Rebirth*, at least in the context of the Golden Joystick Awards.

**4. Balance Under/Overreacting:**

*   The Golden Joystick Awards have already taken place, as voting was open until November 8th, and the event will occur on November 21st. The public vote is over.
*   The news articles show a mix of sentiment towards both games, with both frequently mentioned in the context of top nominees, including at The Game Awards (a separate and more prestigious event with a jury vote).
*   It's important to recognize recency bias – games that were released more recently might have a slight advantage, due to being fresher in people's minds as the voting period ended on November 8th. Astro Bot was released in early September, while Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was released earlier in the year. This slightly benefits Astro Bot in recency bias, but might make it have slightly fewer players in total.
*   I must avoid the trap of overreacting to single data points. The number of nominations doesn't equal the number of actual votes. Just because many articles mention the two games as leading contenders, it doesn't guarantee a win. Both games have a very strong fan base so the margin of victory is likely to be very tight, meaning it's far from certain either of these two will actually win.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1: Fanbase Loyalty:** *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* has the advantage of a long-standing, massive fanbase for the *Final Fantasy VII* franchise.
*   **Force 2: Critical Acclaim & "Newness":** *Astro Bot* has the advantage of being a newer game, having strong critical reception, and being an innovative take on platforming.
*   **Force 3: Genre Preferences:** *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* is an RPG, while *Astro Bot* is a platformer. This might split voters based on genre preference.
*   **Force 4: Public Vote vs. Jury**: The public vote makes the results less predictable and susceptible to more randomness. It could also lead to surprise results.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The trend seems to be that *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* are leading contenders across all awards. However, the Golden Joysticks is the one specific award out of these that uses a public vote and not a jury vote, and the voting closed on November 8th.
* Given that both games seem to be popular, and the Golden Joysticks being a public vote, this will reduce the certainty of either game winning in particular.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   This is a binary question with clear resolution criteria. I cannot make a probability that is not related to the final yes/no answer.
*   My doubt stems from the unpredictable nature of public votes and the strong competition. There is also the potential that one of the other nominated titles might come in from behind to steal the prize.

**8. Balance Confidence and Prudence:**

*   I must avoid overconfidence based on the number of nominations. The public vote makes this less predictable than awards decided by experts.
*   The strong showing from *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* in nominations does give them a good shot at winning, but I should not overstate their chances, especially with a public vote.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I will need to learn from how accurately I assess the impact of public voting in the future.
*   It is always a risk to overreact to the latest news, but it is important to assess what kind of information it provides.

**My Forecast:**

Given the evidence, I believe that either Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth winning the Console Game of the Year award at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards is likely. They are clearly the two frontrunners. The public vote element increases the uncertainty, but they are still the most talked-about contenders. I am giving a boost in probability to them both compared to the base rate due to this information. I am leaning slightly towards the probability being more likely to happen than not happen, but also leaving space for some other game to come through and unexpectedly win.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

*   I must avoid overconfidence based on the number of nominations. The public vote makes this less predictable than awards decided by experts.
*   The strong showing from *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* in nominations does give them a good shot at winning, but I should not overstate their chances, especially with a public vote.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I will need to learn from how accurately I assess the impact of public voting in the future.
*   It is always a risk to overreact to the latest news, but it is important to assess what kind of information it provides.

**My Forecast:**

Given the evidence, I believe that either Astro Bot or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth winning the Console Game of the Year award at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards is likely. They are clearly the two frontrunners. The public vote element increases the uncertainty, but they are still the most talked-about contenders. I am giving a boost in probability to them both compared to the base rate due to this information. I am leaning slightly towards the probability being more likely to happen than not happen, but also leaving space for some other game to come through and unexpectedly win.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this particular question. However, the news articles themselves provide some implicit predictions. Articles frequently mention that Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth are leading the nominations across different award ceremonies.
*   The Golden Joystick Awards is a public vote award, meaning fan preference will be the ultimate decider. This makes it more unpredictable than an award decided by a jury or panel of experts.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question is about the *Golden Joystick Awards*, which is specifically a public vote, and not the Game Awards which is more of a jury vote.
*   **Sub-Problem 1: Popularity and Fanbase Size:** Do either *Astro Bot* or *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* have a particularly strong, dedicated fanbase?
*   **Sub-Problem 2: Momentum:** Which game has more buzz and excitement surrounding it *right now*, leading up to the vote?
*   **Sub-Problem 3: Competition:** What other games are in the running that could siphon away votes from *Astro Bot* or *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*?
*   **Sub-Problem 4: Golden Joysticks Specifics**: How does the Golden Joysticks voting work? How popular is this specific awards show amongst the general gaming population?
*   **Sub-Problem 5: Recency and Time:** Which of the two games was more recently released and thus fresher in voters' minds?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  It's difficult to establish a precise base rate for this specific type of question. However, I can say that in public-voted awards, there is often a split in preferences and no clear winner which often leads to surprise results. In the absence of a specific base rate, I'll start with 50% as an initial, neutral estimate. As we will see, further analysis will allow me to move this number.
*   **Inside View (Specific Game Analysis):**
    *   ***Astro Bot***: This game has strong critical reception, is seen as innovative and accessible, and is a PlayStation exclusive. However, it might be perceived as a family game, or more niche title than other nominees.
    *   ***Final Fantasy VII Rebirth***: This game is also a PlayStation exclusive and is the sequel to a massively popular remake, with strong name recognition and a dedicated fanbase. However, a large franchise like Final Fantasy could have more mixed opinions within a fan base, whereas a game like Astro Bot may not be as widely played but could have a more positive reception among those that did.
    *  ***Other Nominees***: The articles mention *Helldivers 2*, *Silent Hill 2 Remake*, *Animal Well*, *Call of Duty: Black Ops 6*, *Balatro*, *Metaphor: Refantazio*, and others. While some of these have good critical reception (e.g., *Balatro*) none seem to be generating as much of a buzz as *Astro Bot* or *FFVII Rebirth*, at least in the context of the Golden Joystick Awards.

**4. Balance Under/Overreacting:**

*   The Golden Joystick Awards have already taken place, as voting was open until November 8th, and the event will occur on November 21st. The public vote is over.
*   The news articles show a mix of sentiment towards both games, with both frequently mentioned in the context of top nominees, including at The Game Awards (a separate and more prestigious event with a jury vote).
*   It's important to recognize recency bias – games that were released more recently might have a slight advantage, due to being fresher in people's minds as the voting period ended on November 8th. Astro Bot was released in early September, while Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was released earlier in the year. This slightly benefits Astro Bot in recency bias, but might make it have slightly fewer players in total.
*   I must avoid the trap of overreacting to single data points. The number of nominations doesn't equal the number of actual votes. Just because many articles mention the two games as leading contenders, it doesn't guarantee a win. Both games have a very strong fan base so the margin of victory is likely to be very tight, meaning it's far from certain either of these two will actually win.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1: Fanbase Loyalty:** *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* has the advantage of a long-standing, massive fanbase for the *Final Fantasy VII* franchise.
*   **Force 2: Critical Acclaim & "Newness":** *Astro Bot* has the advantage of being a newer game, having strong critical reception, and being an innovative take on platforming.
*   **Force 3: Genre Preferences:** *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* is an RPG, while *Astro Bot* is a platformer. This might split voters based on genre preference.
*   **Force 4: Public Vote vs. Jury**: The public vote makes the results less predictable and susceptible to more randomness. It could also lead to surprise results.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The trend seems to be that *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* are leading contenders across all awards. However, the Golden Joysticks is the one specific award out of these that uses a public vote and not a jury vote, and the voting closed on November 8th.
* Given that both games seem to be popular, and the Golden Joysticks being a public vote, this will reduce the certainty of either game winning in particular.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   This is a binary question with clear resolution criteria. I cannot make a probability that is not related to the final yes/no answer.
*   My doubt stems from the unpredictable nature of public votes and the strong competition. There is also the potential that one of the other nominated titles might come in from behind to steal the prize.

**8. Balance Confidence and Prudence:**

*   I must avoid overconfidence based on the number of nominations. The public vote makes this less predictable than awards decided by experts.
*   The strong showing from *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* in nominations does give them a good shot at winning, but I should not overstate their chances, especially with a public vote.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I will need to learn from how accurately I assess the impact of public voting in the future.
*   It is always a risk to overreact to the latest news, but it is important to assess what kind of information it provides.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem step-by-step.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time prediction markets like Polymarket for this specific award.
*   FiveThirtyEight and Metaculus do not appear to track these specific gaming awards.
*   Therefore, I'll need to rely on my own analysis and the provided information.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

To address this question, I'll break it into several sub-problems:
    *   **Understanding the Award:** What is the Golden Joystick Award for Console Game of the Year? Is it a popularity contest or based on a jury?
    *   **Assessing the Nominees:** What are the perceived strengths and weaknesses of Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth? How do they compare to other nominees in the overall Game of the Year category?
    *   **Analyzing Voting Trends:** Is there evidence of which way the public vote might be trending?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   Base Rate: It is hard to find reliable base rates for the Console Game of the Year award, as these can shift each year due to trends and new games. However, I can state that it is rare for an award to be split between 2 games. Therefore, my base rate will be very close to the proportion of the candidates in the nomination list. The most common number of nominations in the article are 12 and 6 (but this is for Ultimate Game of the Year), the latter being the number of GOTY nominees at the Game Awards. This gives us a base rate of between 16.67% (1/6) and 8.33% (1/12) per nominated game (when considering Ultimate GOTY), and approximately 25% when considering that only the two games in question can win the award.
    *   **Trend:** Public voting in game awards is sometimes dominated by games that have strong community support, strong sales, or are highly hyped. These are not necessarily the highest quality games from an objective viewpoint.

*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Golden Joystick Awards Specifics:** The Golden Joystick Awards are decided by public vote, which means popularity is a major factor (the articles highlight "millions of votes" and "public voting"). The provided text also states that the Golden Joystick Awards "depend completely on community votes." Therefore, unlike awards that depend on a jury of critics, this award is much more susceptible to popularity.
    *   **Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Strengths:**
        *   Both are PlayStation exclusives, potentially giving them a boost among the PlayStation fanbase.
        *  Both games received numerous nominations in multiple categories, suggesting they are well-regarded.
        *   *Astro Bot* is a well-regarded platformer with great use of the Dualsense controller, appealing to a wide range of players.
        *   *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* is a high-profile sequel with a large fan base and has been well-received. It has been described as a "strong contender" and leading the pack in different publications and award nominations. 
    *   **Other Nominees:** The articles mention various other games nominated for 'Ultimate Game of the Year' at the Golden Joystick Awards, such as *Helldivers 2*, *Silent Hill 2 Remake*, *Animal Well*, *Call of Duty: Black Ops 6*, *Balatro*, *Dragon Age: The Veilguard*, *Tekken 8*, and *Black Myth: Wukong*, indicating a fairly diverse competition. However, my focus is on whether *Astro Bot* or *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* will win, so these other games matter in that they can reduce both of their probabilities (as only one game can win, therefore if they win, it reduces the chances of the games in question).
    *   **Timing:** Voting closed on November 8th. The award ceremony is on November 21, meaning the results are likely set in stone. There are multiple mentions of the Golden Joystick awards occurring *before* The Game Awards which are currently heavily covered in news articles. 

**4. Balancing Reactions to Evidence:**

*   The numerous nominations of both *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* across different categories for the Golden Joystick Awards and the Game Awards indicates they are likely strong contenders. The fact that they lead nominations is a positive sign. 
*   However, the fact that *Astro Bot* and *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* are competing for the *same* award means they are actively competing against each other, thereby lowering their individual chances.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1 (Favoring Either Astro Bot or Final Fantasy VII Rebirth):** Strong nominations, popularity, and public vote weighting
*   **Force 2 (Opposing):** Competition from each other, and the presence of other, potentially popular, nominees.

**6. Extrapolating Trends:**

*   While there is no hard data on *voting trends*, the consistent high nominations of these games indicate a strong positive reception. The trend is that they are highly regarded. 

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I can certainly be more specific than "likely" or "unlikely," and more specific than just a simple number. There is enough evidence to make a probability range. 

**8. Balancing Confidence:**

*   I need to be decisive based on the available evidence. The combination of many nominations, public voting, and both of them being PlayStation exclusives provides a strong basis for a prediction. The fact that they are competing against each other lowers each of their individual probabilities. I can state they are both likely to be very strong contenders. 

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**
*   I must avoid hindsight bias if the prediction is incorrect. If I do get this wrong, I will have to consider the specific reasons for my errors. 

**Prediction:**

Given all the information, it seems likely that either *Astro Bot* or *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* will win the Console Game of the Year award at the Golden Joystick Awards. They have a clear lead over other titles and are popular enough to win a public vote. They are clearly both very strong contenders for the award. 

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I can certainly be more specific than "likely" or "unlikely," and more specific than just a simple number. There is enough evidence to make a probability range. 

**8. Balancing Confidence:**

*   I need to be decisive based on the available evidence. The combination of many nominations, public voting, and both of them being PlayStation exclusives provides a strong basis for a prediction. The fact that they are competing against each other lowers each of their individual probabilities. I can state they are both likely to be very strong contenders. 

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**
*   I must avoid hindsight bias if the prediction is incorrect. If I do get this wrong, I will have to consider the specific reasons for my errors. 

**Prediction:**

Given all the information, it seems likely that either *Astro Bot* or *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* will win the Console Game of the Year award at the Golden Joystick Awards. They have a clear lead over other titles and are popular enough to win a public vote. They are clearly both very strong contenders for the award. 

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions**

*   I haven't found any explicit predictions for this specific question on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This is a niche question focused on a specific award, so it's not unexpected that there's no readily available human prediction data. We will have to do this one from scratch.

**2. Break Down the Problem**

To assess the likelihood of "Astro Bot" or "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" winning Console Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, I'll consider these sub-problems:

*   **Overall Popularity and Critical Acclaim:** How well-received are both games? Do they have a broad appeal?
*   **Competition:** Who else is in contention? Are there strong competitors that might siphon off votes?
*   **Golden Joystick Voting Process:** How does the voting work, and what does this imply for the type of game that wins?
*   **Momentum:** Are either game's prospects improving or declining as the awards get closer?
*  **Bias:** Is there anything about the nature of the awards themselves that might be a relevant factor?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   Award shows often have unexpected winners. The "favorites" don't always win. Base rate for the highest nominated game of the year wining GOTY is around 50% depending on the awards ceremony.
    *   Public voting can be volatile and influenced by factors beyond pure game quality (e.g., marketing, hype).
    *   Console Game of the Year is often hotly contested, with strong titles released on different platforms.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   Both games are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 which might indicate a more limited pool of voting public.
    *   Both games have strong critical acclaim.
    *   Both games seem to have secured a large number of nominations across other categories.

**4. Balancing Under- and Over-reacting to Evidence**

*   **Under-reacting:** Ignoring the fact that both games are indeed very strong contenders for this award, it's reasonable to expect that they're not getting nominated for the top award in other shows if the games were just average.
*   **Over-reacting:** Assuming that the leading nominations are a sure win for this particular award, not accounting for possible spoiler titles.
*   **Balancing:** Take into account all factors, both for and against, but lean towards the strength of the evidence. The evidence is that these games are both top contenders, but not sure wins.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Force 1: Strong Games, High Visibility:** Both "Astro Bot" and "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" received numerous nominations across the industry, which may indicate strong favouritism from players.
*   **Force 2: Public Voting is unpredictable:** The Golden Joystick awards are voted by the public so unexpected results can and do occur. Strong indie games like Balatro have also gained nominations, and their public support might result in an upset.

**6. Linear Extrapolation**

*   The trend is that both of these games are at the very top of nominations for other awards, so it's reasonable to think they are very strong contenders for the golden joystick awards.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

*   I will differentiate between a very high, but not certain, chance of the event occurring.

**8. Balancing Under- and Overconfidence**

*   **Underconfidence:** Not giving enough credit to how well these games are received by critics and public alike.
*   **Overconfidence:** Seeing these nominations as a guarantee of a win.
*   **Balance:** Be confident based on the evidence but not overconfident given the nature of public voting awards.

**9. Look for Errors**

*   I will review my reasoning if the forecast is shown to be wrong after the event.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Based on the news articles, "Astro Bot" and "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" are clearly leading contenders for awards this year, including at the Golden Joysticks. Their leading position in nominations for the Golden Joystick Awards (five each) and in the Game Awards (seven each), and widespread critical acclaim indicate a high level of public support. However, because the Golden Joystick Awards are determined by public voting, there is always a chance of a surprise upset, which means a probability of 100% is not appropriate. 

However, the presence of other strong contenders in the nominations such as Baldur's Gate 3, Elden Ring DLC and Balatro, while being a threat to a win, does not overshadow that fact that Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are the clear favourites based on the information from the news articles.

Given all of this, I will assign a **70%** chance that either *Astro Bot* or *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth* will win the Console Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. It is a public choice award and could therefore be a bit unpredictable, but I think the chances of one of the two winning is high. A range from 60% to 80% reflects this uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.
