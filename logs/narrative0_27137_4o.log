**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the big question: Will at least 200 Benin Bronzes have returned to Nigeria from the British Museum by now?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 15.75%. The legal constraints and the museum's stance were strong barriers, even with growing international pressure.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The cultural and historical significance can't be overstated, but the logistics and legalities were always a major hurdle.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. While there's momentum for restitution globally, the British Museum's position was a significant factor in our prediction.

**NATE SILVER**  
Perhaps, in the future, we'll see more shifts in policy. For now, the bronzes remain, a testament to a complex past.
