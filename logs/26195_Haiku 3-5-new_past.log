I'll carefully analyze the data to forecast the probability of more than 300 measles cases in the US by September 30, 2024.

Key Evidence:
1. US Current Status:
- CDC reported 146 measles cases in 2024 as of June 1st
- Matches total cases for entire 2023
- 11 outbreaks reported
- 69% of cases outbreak-associated

2. Global Context:
- Europe experiencing significant measles surge
- 56,634 cases in first 3 months of 2024
- WHO warns of continuing increase
- Vaccination disruptions during COVID-19 pandemic

3. Trend Analysis:
- Linear extrapolation suggests US cases could exceed 300
- Multiple imported cases from international travel
- Declining vaccination rates increasing risk

4. Probability Considerations:
- Base rate: Historical US measles cases typically low
- Current trajectory suggests higher probability of exceeding 300
- International travel and outbreak patterns increase risk

Forecast Reasoning:
- Strong evidence suggesting case count will exceed 300
- Significant global measles circulation
- Multiple outbreak sites in US
- Imported cases from Europe

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%.

Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

US Measles Cases Analysis:
1. Base Rate Context
- CDC reported 146 cases in 2024 as of June 1st
- 2023 total was 146 cases
- Current trajectory suggests potential increase

2. Global Context 
- Major European measles surge in 2024
- WHO reports 56,634 cases in Europe in first 3 months
- Multiple countries experiencing significant outbreaks
- Reduced vaccination rates post-COVID pandemic

3. US-Specific Factors
- 11 outbreaks reported in 2024
- 69% of cases outbreak-associated
- Cases linked to international travel
- Uneven vaccination coverage across states

4. Trend Projection
- Linear extrapolation suggests 250-300 cases likely
- Higher risk of spread with summer/fall travel season
- Potential for localized outbreaks

5. Probability Calibration
- High likelihood of exceeding 300 cases
- International travel and reduced vaccination increase risk
- Outbreak potential in unvaccinated communities

Balancing evidence, accounting for uncertainty and potential amplification.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 84.30%, but 76.40% being the most likely. Probability: 76.40%.
