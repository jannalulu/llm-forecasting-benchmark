The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, reviewing data. The air is thick with tension.

LEAD FORECASTER  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
So, it’s confirmed. Two major hurricanes in September.

ANALYST  
(nods)  
Our models had it at 92.75%. Climate change continues to push those probabilities higher.

DATA SCIENTIST  
(gestures to a screen)  
The NHC reports align perfectly. Both storms hit Category 3.

LEAD FORECASTER  
(serious)  
Communities were prepared this time, thanks to accurate forecasting.

ANALYST  
(softly)  
It's unsettling how precise we've become. But necessary.

DATA SCIENTIST  
(solemn)  
With each season, the stakes rise. We need to keep refining our models.

LEAD FORECASTER  
(looking around)  
Let’s get ready for October. This is just the beginning.
