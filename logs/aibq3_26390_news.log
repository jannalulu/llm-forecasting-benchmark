**The End of the Golden Stock Market Era?**
The US presidential election is causing uncertainty in the financial markets, with the Vix index, a measure of market volatility, reaching its highest level since the US regional bank crisis in the spring of 2023. The uncertainty is fueled by the withdrawal of Joe Biden and his endorsement of Kamala Harris, leaving the outcome of the election open. Additionally, investors are concerned about the potential bursting of the 'Magnificent Seven' bubble, a group of tech companies that have driven market gains in the first half of the year. The Deutsche Bank analysts believe that the current market situation is reminiscent of historical patterns, with the S&P 500 often experiencing a sharp decline after a prolonged period of growth. They also point out that September has historically been a month of high market losses in recent years.

**Stocks Slide Before High-Stakes Megacap Earnings: Markets Wrap**
Stocks fell at the end of the week, with technology leading the losses, ahead of a critical week of earnings from megacap tech companies. The S&P 500 dropped 1% and the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.1%. The 'Magnificent Seven' megacaps, including Tesla and Alphabet, are expected to report earnings next week. Analysts are looking for strong earnings and softening inflation to reverse the market's recent weakness and spark a new leg higher. However, there is a risk of a setback for the equities this summer due to weaker growth data, dovish central bank expectations, and rising policy uncertainty. Investors are flocking to US equities, expecting a September rate cut and a Trump presidency, but some strategists warn of a 'buy rumor, sell fact' opportunity after the rate cut.

**Will the KI-Hype Burst Like the Dotcom Bubble?**
The hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a surge in investments, with many companies investing billions of dollars in the field. However, experts at Goldman Sachs warn of a potential bubble, citing similarities to the dot-com bubble at the beginning of the century. The 'magnificent seven' tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, saw a record loss of $623 billion in a single day, while the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, rose by over 4%. Experts believe that the recent decline in the 'Glorreichen Sieben' is due to investors shifting their focus to smaller companies that are more likely to benefit from the AI trend. The development of AI is considered more solid than the dot-com bubble, with companies actually generating profits. The future of the AI hype is uncertain, and it is unclear whether large or smaller tech companies will benefit the most.

**The AI Bubble May Burst: Beka Warns of Global Recession**
The bubble of artificial intelligence (AI) may start to deflate in the next few years, which could be accompanied by a global economic recession, according to the financial group Beka. Analysts believe that the profits of large companies known as the 'seven magnificents' - including Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - will slow down by 2026. The group claims that if the growth prospects of all companies outside the AI sector are isolated, they show a growth trend, which is not the case for the seven magnificents. In other words, technology companies will deflate while the rest of the companies will have a growing trend. The prediction for AI-related companies' profits is an increase of 37% in 2024, 19% in 2025, and 13% in 2026. On the other hand, the profit increase for all non-technology companies will be 6% in 2024, 11% in 2025, and 9% in 2026. This means that the gap between the two groups of companies will narrow from 53 percentage points in 2023 to just four points in two years, according to Beka. The group also warns that there are other interesting sectors to invest in, such as construction, defense, health, some technology, and energy. 'The growth in profits of the seven magnificents was spectacular, but this is not forever. There is a certain convergence in the way this new technology is being implemented and normalized. Therefore, this type of theme should be in a portfolio, but it's not forever, there is no extraordinary benefit forever,' warns the group. Beka also predicts that the recession will affect Spain in particular, especially due to the evolution of the public deficit, the weight of government spending in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and employment creation problems. In general, all countries have revised their growth expectations upwards, but Beka insists that this is a sign of excessive optimism by the markets and economists, who are not predicting with certainty the macroeconomic developments of the next few months.

**The 'Magnificent 7' Tech Companies: A New Revolution or a Bubble?**
The 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Meta-Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet-Google, Nvidia, and Snowflake, have been beating records, with the Fang Plus index doubling the S&P 500. The index has shown a 28.5% growth since the beginning of the year, more than double the S&P 500's 13.9% growth. The 'Magnificent 7' companies have collectively risen 45% and now represent 25% of the S&P 500's capitalization. Goldman Sachs has raised its year-end 2024 target for the S&P 500. The analysts at Pictet Asset Management believe that there are no signs of a bubble, as the prices are growing in line with the companies' profits. The relationship between price and earnings is around 21 times, which is higher than the 10-year average. The excess return on investment (ERP) is at its lowest level in two decades, indicating that the valuations are still reasonable. Nvidia's stock has tripled in the past year, but its profits have quintupled, resulting in a 15% reduction in the price-to-earnings ratio. Oracle's stock quintupled between 1999 and 2000, but its profits only grew 60%, resulting in a tripling of the price-to-earnings ratio. The analysts at eToro believe that the market is not in a bubble, as the commercialization of assets is high, the availability of money and credit is limited, and there is no excessive speculation. The analysts at Wedbush believe that the market has room to extend to other software, technology, cybersecurity, and infrastructure companies in the next 12-18 months. Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia are expected to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion by next year, driven by the growing enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Broadcom, which has gained 5% in the past 25 days, is expected to enter the prestigious club of $1 trillion companies. The company has two main categories of AI products: networking products, such as Ethernet-based switching chips, and customized ASICs, which cloud companies are using to build their own AI accelerators. Mega-clients such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms, as well as ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok), are interested in these products. The company's networking segment, which includes these two product lines, increased 1961% in the last quarter and now represents more than half of the company's semiconductor revenue, equivalent to 44%. Additionally, the company acquired VMware, a software company, for $53 million at the end of last year. In the second fiscal quarter, VMware's revenue was $2.04 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the previous quarter, a 2.1% increase in just one quarter. In recent days, the company announced a 29-for-10 stock split, which triggered other gains, especially technical ones.

**Magnificent 7 Earnings Preview: Is a growth slowdown on the horizon?**
The Magnificent 7, a group of seven large-cap tech stocks, are set to report their earnings for the second quarter of 2024. The group includes Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA). Analysts expect the group's earnings growth to slow down in the second half of 2024, with some predicting that the group may miss their guidance. The market will be closely watching the earnings reports for any signs of slowing growth and guidance for the rest of the year and into 2025. The article also provides a brief overview of each company's performance and sentiment around their stocks.

**Asia stocks wary; Wall St unfazed as Biden bows out**
Asian stocks were cautious on Monday as investors awaited a busy week of corporate earnings and economic data, including a key inflation reading that could influence the likelihood of a September rate cut. The news of US President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the election race and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris had little impact on markets, with S&P 500 futures edging up 0.3% and Nasdaq futures adding 0.5%. The tech sector is expected to report strong earnings growth, with the 'Magnificent Seven' megacap group of stocks set to kick off the season. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure is due out on Friday, with markets pricing in a 97% chance of a rate cut.

**Magnificent seven stocks take a pounding as investors rotate into cheaper companies**
Investors are rotating out of expensive tech stocks and into cheaper names, leading to a sell-off in the 'magnificent seven' stocks, including Nvidia, which lost over $200 billion in market value. The rotation is driven by valuation concerns, with the ratio of growth stocks to value stocks in the US reaching its highest level since the dot-com bubble. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-cap stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 by a record amount, while US small-cap stocks have soared 11.5% in five sessions.

**SPY: Investor Alert: Join the Stock Rally Now Before It's Over**
Investors are anticipating the first Fed rate cut, which could happen as early as July 31st or September 18th. However, those waiting for the rate cut may miss out on significant gains. The author suggests that the current bull run is based on forward-looking investors anticipating rate cuts and economic growth. The author recommends focusing on small caps, economically sensitive sectors, and stocks with reasonable valuations, rather than the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. The author also suggests using the POWR Ratings quant system to identify top-performing stocks. The article concludes by promoting the author's portfolio of 12 stocks, which have outperformed the S&P 500 index.

**‘Magnificent Seven' Extend This Week's Rout to 5%: Markets Wrap**
The stock market ended the week with a decline, with the S&P 500 falling to around 5,500. Tech stocks led the losses, with the 'Magnificent Seven' megacaps dropping 5%. The decline was attributed to a rotation trade, where investors sold winners and bought laggards, and bets on a broadening rally. Glen Smith at GDS Wealth Management said that strong tech earnings and softening inflation could reverse the market's weakness and spark a new leg higher. The 'Magnificent Seven' megacaps, including Tesla and Alphabet, will report earnings next week, with analysts expecting to press Elon Musk on the progress of his electric-vehicle plans and Google's revenue boost from artificial intelligence. Goldman Sachs strategists warn of a potential correction this summer due to weaker growth data, dovish central bank expectations, and rising policy uncertainty. Meanwhile, investors are flocking to US equities, expecting a September rate cut and a Trump victory in the US presidential election.

**For stocks, is AI the Emperor's new clothes?**
The article discusses the potential decline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on the stock market. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which make up a third of the S&P 500's market cap, are highly exposed to the AI selloff. The article quotes Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics, who argues that the estimated impact of AI technology on productivity and GDP growth is relatively small. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, is also skeptical about the benefits of AI, stating that the cost of expanding AI infrastructure will exceed US$1 trillion in the coming years. The article concludes that investors may be slowly coming round to the view that AI is in a bubble, but it will take a bigger reversal in these overcrowded trades to convince them that the AI well has run dry.

**Column-For stocks, is AI the Emperor's new clothes?: McGeever**
The article discusses the potential decline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks, also known as the 'Magnificent Seven', which make up a third of the S&P 500's market cap and are responsible for around two-thirds of the S&P 500's entire gains this year. The author, Jamie McGeever, argues that the estimated impact of AI technology over the next decade is relatively small, with a negligible 0.05% annual increase in productivity. The article also quotes Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at MIT, who wrote an article titled 'Don't Believe the AI Hype', and Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, who is skeptical about the benefits of AI. The article concludes that investors may be slowly coming round to the view that AI is in a bubble, but it will take a bigger reversal in these overcrowded trades to convince investors that the AI well has run dry.

**Technisch heiß gelaufen**
The US indices Dow Jones and Russell 2000 have shown strong price gains in recent days. Are they overheated? The stock market year 2024 has been dominated by price gains in the Magnificent-7 stocks and other technology stocks. While the Nasdaq 100 has increased by over 20% since the beginning of the year, the Dow Jones has seen little progress until recently. The prospect of interest rate cuts, likely to begin in September, has boosted bets on undervalued stocks.

**Stocks have been up but will they stay there for the rest of 2024?**
The US economy has performed well in the first half of 2024, with inflation moderating, jobs plentiful, and no recession risks. The stock market has also risen 15% over the first six months. However, there are questions about the second half of the year, including whether inflation will continue to decline, whether the 'Magnificent 7' tech stocks will maintain their momentum, and whether the presidential election will have an impact on the market. Economists at Northern Trust expect a rate cut in September if inflation data remains 'well-behaved'. The 'Magnificent 7' stocks, which include Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla, have been hot, but may not be able to sustain their pace. Rebalancing a portfolio may be necessary to maintain a targeted mix. The presidential election is unlikely to trigger a stock market selloff, and presidential re-election years tend to be favorable for stocks.

**Five themes for traders to watch as earnings season kicks off**
As the S&P 500 Index approaches a major test, companies are set to report their earnings next week, with expectations elevated, especially for mega-cap technology stocks. The Magnificent 7, a group of seven large-cap technology companies, is expected to see a slowdown in growth, while profits are projected to rise 9.3% for the S&P 500. Investors will be looking for clues on the health of the consumer, as well as the broader rally, mixed industry outlooks, China's recovery, AI trade, and election year risks. 'The hurdle is high,' said Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research. 'Even strong beats may not be enough for the Magnificent 7 growth rate to continue to accelerate.'

**What the 2000's Tech bubble says about today's suspected rotation**
Deutsche Bank Research's Jim Reid suggests that the current suspected rotation in the stock market may be similar to the 2000 tech bubble burst. He notes that the S&P 500 equal weight index (RSP) was up 1.17% while the S&P 500 (SP500) was down 0.88%, with the Magnificent Seven stocks (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, AMZN, META, TSLA) down 4.26%. Reid believes that this could be the start of a great rotation, but only a brave or foolish person would be confident in such a statement. He notes that in the lead-up to the tech peak in 2000, defensive sectors (consumer staples, health care, utilities) were falling sharply, suggesting a rotation out of steady stocks into high-octane ones. However, when the tech bubble burst, money came back into defensive sectors, and by the end of the year, tech stocks were up 35-45% higher than before the burst. Reid concludes that the ultimate rotation was significant, with defensive sectors climbing 25% higher since March 2000.

**Tech Giants 'Magnificent 7' Lose $623 Billion as Inflation Cools Down**
The US inflation rate has cooled down stronger than expected, making a first interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in September more realistic. This has led to a significant decline in the stock prices of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' - Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. The 'Magnificent Seven' have lost $623 billion in a single day, with Nvidia alone losing $180 billion. The decline is attributed to the hype around new AI technologies and stable business prospects, making the stocks attractive to investors. However, with interest rates expected to fall, smaller companies will also become more attractive, and investors can expect a normalization of the market. The current correction is seen as a precursor to a time when inflation will continue to decline and the Fed will send clearer signals.

**Magnificent 7: Largest One-Day Loss in Market Capitalization**
The 'Magnificent 7' technology stocks, including Tesla, Nvidia, and Meta Platforms, experienced a significant decline in value, with a collective loss of $598 billion in market capitalization. This is the largest one-day loss since February 3, 2022. The decline was attributed to a report from Bloomberg that Tesla is planning to delay its Robotaxi event from August to October. The 'Magnificent 7' stocks have shown a high level of insensitivity to interest rates, meaning they will not benefit from a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. 'The Magnificent Seven have shown a high degree of insensitivity to interest rates, which means they will not be the beneficiaries of a new easing', said Mike O'Rourke, Chief Market Strategist at JonesTrading. Investors took profits from the technology sector, but also shifted into small- and mid-caps of the Russell 2000, which outperformed the Nasdaq by 3.6% on the day.

**News Highlights: Top Global Markets News of the Day - Thursday at 11 PM ET**
Investors are flocking to small-cap stocks and other underperforming areas of the market after a cooler inflation report. Government bond yields have dropped, leading to a rush into beaten-down sectors that could benefit from falling rates. Meanwhile, tech giants have lost ground. Economists believe that if Donald Trump were president, inflation would be worse than under Joe Biden. The Federal Reserve's Daly says that recent economic data justify an interest-rate cut. A stock market rotation may be underway, with small caps surging and the Magnificent Seven being punished. The question is whether this marks the start of a broader rally. Canada's rate cuts could boost the private sector, while Cheetos are the latest economic red flag. Milder inflation has opened the door to a potential September rate cut, and the Bank of Mexico is willing to resume rate cuts. The International Energy Agency has cut its 2025 oil demand forecast and raised supply estimates, expecting a surplus this decade.

**Big tech tumbles Most since 2022 as rate bets spur rotation**
The S&P 500's winning streak was halted as investors rotated out of megacap tech stocks, led by the 'Magnificent 7', in response to inflation data that sparked bets on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut as soon as September. The rotation led to a 0.9% drop in the S&P 500, despite nearly 400 of its members rallying. The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks smaller companies, surged 3.6%, its best performance relative to the S&P 500 since March 2020. Experts say this rotation is a sign that investors are looking for alternative investments beyond just big tech, and the economic data suggests the economy is in good shape, enabling a broader market rally.

**Stock market today: Most of Wall Street climbs on encouraging inflation report, but Big Tech slumps**
The US stock market rose on Thursday after the latest inflation report showed milder increases than expected, boosting hopes that the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates as soon as September. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.9%, with homebuilders, real-estate owners, and other stocks that benefit from easier interest rates leading the way. However, slumps for Nvidia, Tesla, and other influential stocks in the 'Magnificent Seven' group masked the underlying strength, causing the S&P 500 to fall 0.7% from its all-time high. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 26 points. Bond yields tumbled, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropping to 4.19% from 4.28% late Wednesday.

**Tech selloff may drive Magnificent Seven's worst day since 2022 by this metric**
The recent selloff in large technology companies, including the Magnificent Seven, may result in the largest one-day market capitalization erasure since 2022. All seven stocks declined by at least 2.5% on Thursday, translating to a $535 billion collective loss of market cap, the largest since a $557 billion wipeout on September 13, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

**Fed Rate Cut in September: A Bull Market Continuation?**
The article discusses the potential for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, which could lead to a continuation of the bull market. The author, Dr. Eckhard Schulte from MainSky Asset Management, believes that the current investment environment is similar to the 1990s, with disinflation, productivity growth, and a strong economy leading to a concentration of assets in certain stocks. The author suggests that the 'Magnificent Seven' of today, such as Apple and Amazon, are similar to the 'Four Horsemen' of the 1990s, Cisco, Dell, Microsoft, and Intel. The author concludes that it is too early to sell, as there are still opportunities to buy during market corrections.

**CAC 40: U.S. inflation, the big event of the day**
The Paris Bourse is expected to open positively on Thursday, awaiting US inflation data. The CAC 40 index future contract advanced by 25.5 points to 7606 points, indicating a continuation of the previous day's 0.9% rebound. The US consumer price index (CPI) for June will be released at 2:30 pm, which may influence the debate on easing inflationary pressures. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has welcomed the recent slowdown in price rises but is awaiting further progress. The statistic is expected to mark a lull, which could consolidate the scenario of a rate cut as early as September. The S&P 500 index on Wall Street set a new record, aided by the 'Magnificent Seven' group, which has gained over 50% this year.

**Wall Street: limited rise, but new records in sight**
The US equity markets opened slightly higher on Wednesday, maintaining the bullish momentum of recent weeks. The Nasdaq set a new all-time high, its 27th record this year, while the Dow Jones gained less than 0.1%. The 'Magnificent Seven' group, led by Nvidia, continues to drive the rally. Investors are awaiting the start of the earnings season, with high expectations for technology giants. Despite a target price hike from Goldman Sachs, Tesla consolidated by 0.4%. Wholesale inventories rose 0.6% in May, but had little impact on the market. The Federal Reserve Chairman's semi-annual hearing before Congress also had little effect, with traders interpreting his comments as a sign of monetary easing in September. The probability of a rate cut next autumn is around 72%, according to CME Group's FedWatch barometer.

**Wall Street: bullish momentum continues unabated**
The New York Stock Exchange is expected to open positively on Wednesday, maintaining the bullish momentum of recent weeks. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have set records, with the 'Magnificent Seven' and Nvidia leading the rally. Despite high valuations, investors have high expectations for quarterly results from these tech giants. The S&P 500 is trading at 21.2 times estimated 12-month earnings, above its long-term average. The Federal Reserve Chairman's semi-annual hearing before Congress will also be closely watched, with traders estimating a 74% chance of a rate cut in September.

**Quiver Morning Markets Wrap**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures rose in a record-breaking Wall Street rally on Wednesday, driven by strength in heavily weighted stocks. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks and upcoming inflation data are expected to provide further direction. Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Micron Technology, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) gained around 1% each, while Meta, Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft rose around 0.4% each. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which have been the primary driver of the rally this year, traded higher as U.S. Treasury yields fell. The benchmark S&P 500 closed at an all-time high for the fifth consecutive session, while the Nasdaq notched its sixth record closing high. Powell's comments boosted hopes for an interest-rate cut in September, but he refrained from committing to a timeline. The second-quarter earnings season, beginning with major banks reporting on Friday, will be a key test for megacaps' valuations.

**US STOCKS-Futures higher as Nvidia, other megacaps build on gains**
US stock futures rose on Wednesday, led by gains in megacap stocks such as Nvidia and Tesla, as investors awaited comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and key economic events. Powell said the US economy is no longer overheated, supporting hopes for rate cuts in September. However, he refrained from committing to a timeline. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, were trading higher, while bets on a 25-basis-point rate cut by September hovered around 70%. The focus will now shift to US inflation data and second-quarter earnings, which will test whether high-flying megacaps can justify their expensive valuations.

**Mag. 7 rotation, earnings, Sahm Rule: Market Takeaways**
The Magnificent Seven, a group of tech stocks, is experiencing a rotation, with Apple closing higher while Nvidia and Amazon slump. S&P 500 earnings expectations are at an all-time high, and the 'Sahm Rule', a recession indicator, could be triggered. Yahoo Finance Senior Markets Reporter Jared Blikre discusses the latest market trends and what they could mean for markets moving forward. The rotation is not limited to tech, with financials and industrials also showing signs of improvement. Earnings expectations are at a record high, with 80% of S&P 500 components experiencing earnings revisions to the upside over the last three months. The Sahm Rule, which tracks the three-month moving average of the jobless rate, could be triggered if unemployment rises to 4.2% in the next month or two, which could lead to the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September.

**Avoid this Crowded Trade (But Don't Ignore the Sector)**
The article discusses the concept of a crowded trade, where investors are flocking to the same successful stocks, such as the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, and how this can lead to missed opportunities. The author, Ryan Dinse, argues that while AI is a promising technology, the hype around the 'Mag 7' may be overdone and that investors should be cautious and look beyond these stocks for potential winners. He also notes that the path to AI adoption is unpredictable and that mistakes can be made, citing the dot-com bubble as an example. The article concludes by encouraging readers to keep an eye out for companies that can produce 'killer apps' and to be cautious of overcrowded trades.

**Magnificent 7 Stocks Propel S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 To Record Highs As Jobs Data Fuels Rate Cut Bets; Gold Miners Rally: What's Driving Markets Friday?**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices reached new all-time highs on Friday, driven by the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which collectively reached a market capitalization of over $16 trillion. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF increased by 1.4%, marking its strongest weekly performance since inception. The jobs data showed signs of cooling, leading economists to urge the Federal Reserve to initiate interest rate cuts, with September seen as the most likely starting point. Treasury yields declined, and gold prices advanced, fueling a rally in gold mining stocks. Other notable market movements included a rally in UK small-cap stocks following the Labour Party's landslide victory and a volatile cryptocurrency market.

**Profiting From Market Irrationality**
The article discusses the current market's irrationality, specifically the overvaluation of the AI/Magnificent Seven trade and the underperformance of economically-sensitive stocks. The author argues that this disparity is reminiscent of the dotcom bubble and warns that waiting for a slowdown in the market is like 'Waiting for Godot', as it may never come. The article highlights the performance gap between the Mag7-weighted S&P 500 and the Russell 2000, and notes that the Russell 2000 has underperformed Large Caps by nearly 50% since March 2021. The author concludes that the market can remain irrational longer than investors can remain solvent, and advises patience and deep pockets for those looking to short the market.

**Futures inch up as focus shifts to jobs data**
US stock index futures rose slightly on Monday, ahead of manufacturing PMI data and labor market numbers later in the week. Focus will be on ISM and S&P Global manufacturing PMIs, as well as JOLTS job openings data, ADP employment, factory orders, ISM services PMI data, and minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting. Traders have largely stuck to their bets of around two interest rate cuts this year, starting from September. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 notched their third straight quarterly gains, with the tech-heavy index doing so for the first time in three years. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said 'It's half time, and it is definitely party time, at least if you are in a large-cap, market-weighted index or the Magnificent Seven.' The market has been supported by optimism around artificial intelligence and interest rate cuts, but some have highlighted concerns over the sustenance of such a skewed rally, calling for greater diversification in investor holdings.

**The AI Bubble May Burst: Beka Warns of Global Recession**
The bubble of artificial intelligence (AI) may start to deflate in the next few years, which could be accompanied by a global economic recession, according to the financial group Beka. Analysts believe that the profits of large companies known as the 'seven magnificents' - including Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - will slow down by 2026. The group claims that if the growth prospects of all companies outside the AI sector are isolated, they show a growth trend, which is not the case for the seven magnificents. In other words, technology companies will deflate while the rest of the companies will have a growing trend. The prediction for AI-related companies' profits is an increase of 37% in 2024, 19% in 2025, and 13% in 2026. On the other hand, the profit increase for all non-technology companies will be 6% in 2024, 11% in 2025, and 9% in 2026. This means that the gap between the two groups of companies will narrow from 53 percentage points in 2023 to just four points in two years, according to Beka. The group also warns that there are other interesting sectors to invest in, such as construction, defense, health, some technology, and energy. 'The growth in profits of the seven magnificents was spectacular, but this is not forever. There is a certain convergence in the way this new technology is being implemented and normalized. Therefore, this type of theme should be in a portfolio, but it's not forever, there is no extraordinary benefit forever,' warns the group. Beka also predicts that the recession will affect Spain in particular, especially due to the evolution of the public deficit, the weight of government spending in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and employment creation problems. In general, all countries have revised their growth expectations upwards, but Beka insists that this is a sign of excessive optimism by the markets and economists, who are not predicting with certainty the macroeconomic developments of the next few months.

**The AI Bubble And Irrational Exuberance V2.0**
The article discusses the AI bubble and irrational exuberance in the stock market, specifically in the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. The author argues that the rally is not over yet, but it will end badly for many investors. The article references the concept of 'this time is different' and how it is often used to justify market mania. The author suggests that fundamentals matter and that periods of market mania are similar, even if the vocal hordes claim 'the rules have changed.' The article also discusses the concept of 'odd-lot theory' and how it can be used to react to news like the BAC survey found. The author concludes that most investors should approach investing in a more methodical and traditional manner, analyzing and comparing data, and setting entry and exit points according to valuations. The article also mentions the CAPE ratio and how it is currently at a historically high level, indicating that the market is overextended. The author suggests that a crash is not imminent, but it is likely to happen soon, and that investors should be cautious and pay attention to the adage 'caveat emptor'.

**The 'Magnificent 7' Tech Companies: A New Revolution or a Bubble?**
The 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Meta-Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet-Google, Nvidia, and Snowflake, have been beating records, with the Fang Plus index doubling the S&P 500. The index has shown a 28.5% growth since the beginning of the year, more than double the S&P 500's 13.9% growth. The 'Magnificent 7' companies have collectively risen 45% and now represent 25% of the S&P 500's capitalization. Goldman Sachs has raised its year-end 2024 target for the S&P 500. The analysts at Pictet Asset Management believe that there are no signs of a bubble, as the prices are growing in line with the companies' profits. The relationship between price and earnings is around 21 times, which is higher than the 10-year average. The excess return on investment (ERP) is at its lowest level in two decades, indicating that the valuations are still reasonable. Nvidia's stock has tripled in the past year, but its profits have quintupled, resulting in a 15% reduction in the price-to-earnings ratio. Oracle's stock quintupled between 1999 and 2000, but its profits only grew 60%, resulting in a tripling of the price-to-earnings ratio. The analysts at eToro believe that the market is not in a bubble, as the commercialization of assets is high, the availability of money and credit is limited, and there is no excessive speculation. The analysts at Wedbush believe that the market has room to extend to other software, technology, cybersecurity, and infrastructure companies in the next 12-18 months. Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia are expected to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion by next year, driven by the growing enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Broadcom, which has gained 5% in the past 25 days, is expected to enter the prestigious club of $1 trillion companies. The company has two main categories of AI products: networking products, such as Ethernet-based switching chips, and customized ASICs, which cloud companies are using to build their own AI accelerators. Mega-clients such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms, as well as ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok), are interested in these products. The company's networking segment, which includes these two product lines, increased 1961% in the last quarter and now represents more than half of the company's semiconductor revenue, equivalent to 44%. Additionally, the company acquired VMware, a software company, for $53 million at the end of last year. In the second fiscal quarter, VMware's revenue was $2.04 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the previous quarter, a 2.1% increase in just one quarter. In recent days, the company announced a 29-for-10 stock split, which triggered other gains, especially technical ones.

**Investors' Frustration Grows as Market Rally Favors Large-Cap Stocks**
The S&P 500, the US stock market's large-cap index, has set a record 30 times this year, with four of those records set in the past week. However, investors are not celebrating. The market rally is narrow and focused on the largest tech companies, with Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia accounting for 20% of the S&P 500 and half of the $5.5 billion increase in market value this year. According to Bespoke Investment Group, investors have given up on smaller companies and are buying large-cap stocks that have already seen significant price movements. Frustration among investors is evident, but not new. The dominance of large-cap stocks, known as 'FANG', 'Magnificent Seven', and now 'AI elite', has made it difficult for active managers to beat the index over the past decade. 'Stockpicking', or selecting individual stocks, is not profitable if the chosen stocks are not among the largest tech companies. Some argue that this is a valuation bubble, while others argue that investor frustration may have a dampening effect on the market rally.

**Wall Street: Cautious Ahead of Fed Meeting**
Wall Street is expected to open lower on Tuesday, following a record-breaking day, as investors become cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq set new highs yesterday, driven by the continued rally of the 'Seven Magnificents'. However, prudence is expected to limit risk-taking ahead of the Fed's decisions, with investors waiting for new rate forecasts and comments from Jerome Powell on inflation and the labor market. According to experts, the 'dot plots' are expected to show fewer rate cuts this year, with two 25-basis-point cuts in September and December. 'In summary, Jerome Powell will reiterate that the Fed will wait until inflation perspectives return to the 2% target, which should not move the markets much', warns François Rimeu, senior strategist at CMAM. 'However, considering the publication of May's IPC data on the same day as the FOMC announcements, this meeting could bring some volatility', he adds.

**Are The Economy And Stocks Reaching Stall Speed?**
The US economy and stock market are showing mixed signals, with some data indicating a slowdown, while others suggest a normalization of post-COVID trends. The S&P 500 has taken a breather, but the Magnificent 7 tech stocks have still risen 24.9% year-to-date. Economic growth estimates remain strong, and earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have not been revised downward. The 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields have eased, and bond yields have not shown signs of a sharp decline in economic activity. Cash levels in the economy remain ample, and the consumer is not showing signs of stress. The Federal Reserve is now pricing in a 60% chance of a rate cut in September, and Fed Fund futures are looking for one-and-a-half cuts in 2024. Initial jobless claims have increased, but the absolute level remains low. The jobs report on Friday will be closely watched for further evidence of easing job demand and wage pressures.
