To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical precedent:
The articles mention that on average, 5 countries make their debut on the Olympic podium in each of the last four editions. However, this includes all medals, not just gold. In Tokyo 2020, only 3 countries made their medal debut.

2. Number of countries without gold medals:
35 countries have won medals but never gold. This provides a pool of potential first-time gold medal winners.

3. Number of countries without any medals:
68 countries have never won an Olympic medal. While less likely, some of these could potentially win their first gold.

4. Host country advantage:
France is hosting, which could potentially boost performances of nearby countries that haven't won gold before.

5. New sports:
The introduction of new sports like breakdancing could provide opportunities for countries to win in areas where traditional powerhouses don't have an advantage.

6. Refugee Olympic Team:
This team is eligible and could potentially win their first gold, though it seems unlikely given their short history and limited resources.

7. Predictions for top performers:
Most predictions focus on established powerhouses like the US, China, and Japan winning the most medals. This suggests limited opportunities for new countries to break through.

8. Time since last Olympics:
With only 3 years since Tokyo 2020 instead of the usual 4, there's been less time for new contenders to emerge and develop.

Balancing these factors:

- The historical average of 5 new countries winning medals (not just gold) provides an upper bound.
- The fact that only 3 countries debuted in Tokyo 2020 suggests a possible downward trend.
- The introduction of new sports and the host country effect could slightly increase chances.
- The short time since Tokyo 2020 and the dominance of established powerhouses work against new gold medal winners.

Given these considerations, it seems unlikely that 5 or more countries will win their first gold medal. However, there's a reasonable chance that a few countries could achieve this milestone.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and consider relevant factors:

1. Historical precedent: 
- In Tokyo 2020, 3 countries won their first gold medals.
- On average, 5 countries have made their podium debut in recent Olympics.

2. Number of countries without gold medals:
- 68 countries have never won an Olympic medal.
- 35 additional countries have won medals but never gold.
- This gives a large pool of potential first-time gold medalists.

3. Performance of near-miss countries:
- Several countries like Philippines, Burkina Faso, and San Marino won their first medals in Tokyo, suggesting they may be close to gold.

4. New sports/events:
- The introduction of new sports like breakdancing could provide opportunities for different countries to excel.

5. Host country effect:
- As the host, France may provide more support/opportunities for smaller nations.

6. Increased competitiveness:
- More countries are investing in Olympic sports, potentially leading to more diverse medal winners.

7. COVID-19 impact:
- Any lingering effects from the pandemic could lead to more unpredictable results.

Balancing these factors:

- The historical average of 5 debut podium finishers suggests 5 debut gold medalists is achievable.
- The large pool of potential first-time winners increases the likelihood.
- New sports and increased competitiveness could boost chances.
- However, established sporting powerhouses still dominate many events, limiting opportunities.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a good chance of at least 5 countries winning their first gold, but it's far from certain. I'd estimate the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 52.50% being the most likely. Probability: 52.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll break it down into steps and analyze the relevant evidence:

1. Historical context:
According to the articles, an average of 5 countries have made their debut on the podium in each of the last four Olympic editions. In Tokyo 2020, 3 countries (San Marino, Burkina-Faso, and Turkmenistan) made their debut.

2. Countries without medals:
68 out of 206 participating countries have never won an Olympic medal. This provides a large pool of potential first-time winners.

3. Opportunities for new winners:
The Paris 2024 Olympics will feature 329 events in 32 sports, including new disciplines like breakdancing, skateboarding, and surfing. This increases opportunities for countries to win their first medals.

4. Performance of smaller nations:
Some articles mention strong performances by smaller nations early in the games, suggesting increased competitiveness.

5. Host nation effect:
As the host, France is expected to perform well, which could potentially take medals from first-time winners.

6. Time since last Olympics:
With a 3-year gap since Tokyo 2020 (instead of the usual 4), countries may have had less time to develop new talent.

7. Increased competitiveness:
The articles suggest tight competition among top nations, which could make it harder for new countries to break through.

Balancing these factors:

- The historical average of 5 debut countries provides a strong baseline.
- The large number of countries without medals and new events increase the chances of reaching or exceeding this number.
- However, the shorter preparation time and increased competitiveness may slightly reduce the likelihood.

Given these considerations, I estimate there's a good chance of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal, but it's not certain.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, with 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into tractable sub-problems and consider relevant historical data and current trends.

1. Historical data:
According to the articles, an average of five countries have made their debut on the podium in each of the last four Olympic editions. However, in Tokyo 2020, only three countries made their debut: San Marino, Burkina-Faso, and Turkmenistan.

2. Current situation:
- 68 countries have never won an Olympic medal.
- 35 countries have won medals but never gold.
- The Paris 2024 Olympics will feature 329 events in 32 sports, including new disciplines like breakdancing.

3. Factors that could increase the likelihood:
- Increased number of events and new disciplines could provide more opportunities for debut gold medals.
- Host country effect: France is expected to perform well, which could inspire other countries to push for their first gold.
- The delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have allowed some countries more time to prepare and improve.

4. Factors that could decrease the likelihood:
- Dominance of traditional powerhouses: The US, China, and other top countries are expected to win a large proportion of medals.
- The trend from Tokyo 2020 suggests a possible decrease in debut medals.
- Economic factors: Many countries without medals are smaller or less economically developed, which can impact their ability to fund Olympic programs.

5. Specific countries to watch:
- Countries that have won medals but never gold (35 in total) have a higher chance of winning their first gold.
- Some larger countries without gold medals, like Bangladesh, might have more resources to invest in Olympic success.

Balancing these factors, I believe the likelihood of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal is lower than 50% but still significant. The historical average supports this possibility, but the recent trend and dominance of top countries suggest caution.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 45.00%, with 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.

Given this uncertainty, I'll make a conservative estimate based on historical trends:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

This range accounts for the historical average of 5 new medalists per Olympics, but adjusts downward due to the lack of specific information about debut gold medalists in Paris 2024. The wide range reflects the significant uncertainty given the apparent discrepancy in the information provided.
