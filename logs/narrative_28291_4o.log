INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY (OCTOBER 2, 2024)

The room is filled with papers and screens displaying financial data. A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, sipping coffee.

FORECASTER 1  
Well, here we are, the day after. Laredo Oil didn’t file their 10-K before the deadline.

FORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.45%. The notification on August 29 was a major red flag.

FORECASTER 3  
Right. With that late filing notice, the probability plummeted. No new articles after September 18 shifted the odds.

FORECASTER 1  
It’s fascinating how the market still holds surprises, even when probabilities seem clear.

FORECASTER 2  
And yet, our models remain accurate. Sometimes, the data speaks louder than news.

They nod in agreement, satisfied with their forecast's precision despite the outcome.

FORECASTER 3  
Let’s see what tomorrow brings.

*Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: So, did Laredo Oil file their 10-K?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: They did. Just under the wire. Our models had it at 85.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Makes sense. Their late filing notice on August 29 was a red flag, but not a dealbreaker.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: True, but the SEC link was up, so the resolution was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: I read an article from September 18, mentioning their new CFO. That probably helped.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Good point. Our models factored in management changes, boosting the probability.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: It's fascinating how precise our predictions are. The Brier scores are spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Indeed. It’s all about interpreting the data correctly.

*They sip their coffee, satisfied with another accurate forecast.*

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, discussing the previous day's events.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the dust has settled. Laredo Oil didn't file their 10-K by October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.67% that they wouldn't make it. The August 29th notification was a big red flag.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. With the SEC's link as the sole resolution source, it was clear-cut. No backup plan, no surprises.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with no news articles after September 18th, everything pointed towards a "No" resolution.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's fascinating how the models nailed it. Even without fresh data, they captured the essence.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
A testament to how precise forecasting can be. Our Brier scores speak for themselves.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

JANE  
So, Laredo Oil's 10-K filing?

MIKE  
Our models had it at 12.34%. The August 29 notice was a red flag.

JANE  
Right. The lack of updates after September 18 was telling. No news articles, nothing.

MIKE  
Exactly, and the SEC link was still down yesterday.  

JANE  
Which means, as predicted, they didn't file before October 1.

MIKE  
Our models never miss. The low probability was spot on.

JANE  
It's fascinating how the absence of news can be as telling as the presence.

MIKE  
Agreed. Sometimes, silence is the loudest signal.

They clink their coffee cups in acknowledgment of their accurate forecast.
