Okay, let's analyze the likelihood of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Deadline:** October 1, 2024. That's less than a month away.
*   **Source:** ISW. The resolution depends *entirely* on their reporting of a formal mobilization wave declared by the Russian government.
*   **Definition of Mobilization:** Formal conscription or summoning of reservists *officially* acknowledged by the Russian government and reported by ISW. Crypto-mobilization or volunteer enlistment *does not* count.
*   **Past Mobilization:** Russia already conducted a partial mobilization in the fall of 2022.
*   **Current Situation:** The war in Ukraine continues. There have been reports of increased recruitment efforts, but these appear to fall under the category of "crypto-mobilization."
*   **Political Considerations:** Another formal mobilization would likely be unpopular and could have negative political consequences for the Russian government. However, if Russia faces significant battlefield setbacks or feels the need to escalate the conflict, it might resort to another mobilization.
*   **ISW Reporting Patterns:** ISW tends to be reliable in reporting on major developments in the conflict, including official announcements from the Russian government.
*   **Time Remaining:** With less than a month until the deadline, the window for a formal mobilization to be announced and subsequently reported by ISW is rapidly closing. Any such decision would need to be made and implemented very quickly.

**Reasoning:**

Given the very short time remaining, the need for a quick decision and implementation by the Russian government, the potential political costs, and the specific requirement that ISW reports a *formal* mobilization, I believe the probability of this event occurring before October 1, 2024, is relatively low. While the possibility of a sudden escalation of the conflict cannot be ruled out, the evidence currently available does not suggest that a formal mobilization is imminent. Most of what's been seen points to continued crypto-mobilization efforts. Also, the earlier mobilization was in the fall of 2022, meaning a new formal mobilization would likely have been conducted in late 2022 or early 2023 if such a move was needed, although the Russian government may delay this, which is unlikely.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
