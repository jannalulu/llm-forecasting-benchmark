**The World's Richest Men Have Doubled Their Fortunes Since 2020, While Billions Have Become Poorer**
According to Oxfam, the five richest men in the world have doubled their fortunes since 2020, while nearly five billion people have become poorer. The CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, is currently the richest man on the planet, with a personal fortune of around $250 billion. Oxfam is calling for a 'new era of public action' to reduce the gap between the common people and the ultra-rich, including measures such as dismantling monopolies, tax reform, and strengthening the public sector against multinational power. The organization also notes that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, which has driven up energy and food costs, has disproportionately affected poorer nations.

**Forbes Qualifies Musk as 'Greatest Loser'**
Forbes has labeled Elon Musk as 'the greatest loser' after his net worth decreased by nearly $30 billion, more than any other billionaire this year. Despite remaining the richest person in the world, Musk's personal fortune has dropped from $251.3 billion at the beginning of the year to $221.4 billion on June 28, the last day of trading in the second quarter of 2024. The decline is attributed to a court ruling in January that invalidated Tesla's compensation plan for Musk, which was valued at $51 billion. Forbes reduced the value of these stock options by 50%, even if Musk manages to obtain them, citing a probable lawsuit. Since then, Tesla has left Delaware and relocated to Texas, reapproving Musk's compensation plan. The value of Musk's 13% stake in Tesla has decreased by approximately $20 billion due to the decline in car deliveries and profits. Musk still holds stakes in xAI, X, and SpaceX, among other companies.

**Elon Musk Loses More Money Than Any Other Billionaire This Year**
According to Forbes, Elon Musk has lost more money this year than any other billionaire, despite being the richest person in the world. His net worth has decreased by over 10% since the end of 2023, from $251.3 billion to $221.4 billion. This decline is largely due to a judge's decision in January to strike down Musk's record compensation package for Tesla, which was valued at $51 billion. As a result, Forbes had to reduce the value of the stock allocation by 50%. Additionally, the value of Musk's existing 13% stake in Tesla decreased by about $20 billion due to the company's declining profits and auto deliveries. Despite these challenges, Musk remains the richest person in the world, ahead of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose net worth is approximately $214 billion.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has lost his title as the richest person in the world to Bernard Arnault, according to Forbes.
