**Nate Silver** and **Philip Tetlock** sit across from each other, papers scattered, screens flickering with headlines.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, the question everyone's asking is whether President Biden has ended his candidacy. Our models had it at 42.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Despite the debate disaster and growing calls from within his party, our data didn't see a majority likelihood of him stepping down.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Even with the Democratic Convention looming, the probability of a formal withdrawal was less than half.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And the media frenzy didn't sway the numbers. Our models are built to withstand noise and focus on credible sources.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, it’s a no. Biden’s still in the race, as far as our models are concerned.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. A testament to the resilience of our forecasting methods.

So, here we are. After Biden's debate disaster and the July fundraising debacle, did he step down?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the pressure, he’s still in the race. His team must have rallied just enough support.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. The media frenzy suggested a higher likelihood. But our models were never wrong.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The Democratic Convention is just weeks away. Anything can still happen, but as of now, Biden remains the nominee.

**NATE SILVER**  
We’ll see if the convention brings any surprises. Until then, our models stand firm.
