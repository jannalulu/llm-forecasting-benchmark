*The air is filled with the soft hum of conversation and the aroma of fresh coffee. Three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, LEO, and MAYA, sit around a table, animatedly discussing yesterday's news.*

**JANE**  
Well, it's official. The youth unemployment rate for August came in at 16.8%.

**LEO**  
Our models had it at 94.23%. Spot on, as always.

**MAYA**  
It's a relief it didn't climb higher. The July spike to 17.1% had us worried.

**JANE**  
The new calculation method really changed the landscape. Excluding students makes it more reflective of those truly seeking work.

**LEO**  
True. But considering the economic challenges, it's still a pressing issue for policymakers.

**MAYA**  
At least we're not dealing with an annulled question. That would have been a headache.

*They sip their coffees, contemplating the future with the certainty of their predictions.*

Three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, LI, and ALEX, sit around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

**JANE**  
So, the numbers are in. China's youth unemployment rate for August is 16.9%.

**LI**  
Our models had it at 95.00%. The new calculation method really shifted the probabilities.

**ALEX**  
Right. With July at 17.1%, the trend was clear. Economic challenges and structural changes are persistent.

**JANE**  
And the exclusion of students in the calculation has made it more volatile. But we nailed it.

**LI**  
It's alarming for policymakers, though. The job market isn't absorbing young talent as expected.

**ALEX**  
True. And the aftermath of COVID-19 still lingers. But for us, another accurate forecast.

They nod, sipping their coffee, satisfied with their precise prediction.
