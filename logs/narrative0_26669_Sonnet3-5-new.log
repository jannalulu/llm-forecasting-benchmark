Tetlock: Well, Nate, another prediction in the books. The Prime Minister question about LFI?

Silver: No, our models had it at 12.5%. Even with the snap elections creating those three roughly equal blocs, the probability of an LFI Prime Minister was always low.

Tetlock: Agreed. The historical precedent of French presidents choosing more moderate Prime Ministers, even in cohabitation, was a strong signal. Plus, LFI's radical economic policies made them unlikely to build the necessary coalition.

Silver: Right. While the New Popular Front had similar numbers to Together and National Rally, the internal dynamics of the left coalition made it improbable that Macron would choose someone from its most extreme wing. Our models factored in how French presidents typically navigate these situations.

Tetlock: Another accurate forecast in a complex political landscape.

Tetlock: Well, Nate, another prediction in the books. The Prime Minister question about LFI?

Silver: No, our models had it at 12.5%. The fragmented National Assembly made it theoretically possible, but the data showed Macron would never accept an LFI Prime Minister.

Tetlock: Agreed. Even with the three-way split between NFP, Together, and National Rally, our analysis of historical coalition-building patterns and Macron's previous choices suggested minimal chance. The June-July snap elections didn't change the fundamental dynamics.

Silver: [sipping espresso] The far-left positioning of LFI within the NFP coalition was always going to be problematic. Our models factored in Macron's preference for moderate figures who could work across party lines.

Tetlock: Sometimes the most interesting forecasts are the ones that show why something won't happen.

Tetlock: Well, Nate, another prediction in the books. The Prime Minister question about LFI...

Silver: No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.5%. Even with the snap elections creating those three roughly equal blocs, the path for an LFI Prime Minister was always narrow.

Tetlock: Indeed. The fragmented National Assembly made coalition-building crucial, but LFI's radical positions made them unlikely compromise candidates. The centrists and right would never accept their economic platform.

Silver: Exactly. While the New Popular Front had numbers, the internal divisions between LFI and more moderate left parties were too deep. Our data from late July showed increasing tension within the left coalition, not the unity needed for such a dramatic outcome.

Tetlock: The French political establishment's resistance to far-left leadership proved too strong, just as our models predicted.

Tetlock: Agreed. The models factored in Macron's historical resistance to far-left leadership, even in coalition scenarios. The fragmented Assembly made compromise necessary, but not with LFI.

Silver: The key signal was the moderate left's reluctance to support an LFI candidate. Even within the New Popular Front, there was too much internal resistance.

Tetlock: [sips espresso] The centrist bloc ultimately maintained control by forming a limited working arrangement with moderate leftists, exactly as our models predicted. LFI remained in opposition, just too radical for a governing coalition.

Tetlock: Well, Nate, another prediction in the books. The Prime Minister situation turned out exactly as our models suggested.

Silver: Indeed, Phil. Given the political landscape after those dramatic June-July snap elections, our models had it at 12.5% probability of an LFI Prime Minister by August 31st.

Tetlock: The three-way split between the New Popular Front, Together, and National Rally made it theoretically possible, but highly unlikely. The moderate factions were never going to accept someone from the far-left LFI.

Silver: Exactly. Even with the NFP coalition's strong showing, the internal resistance to putting an LFI member in Matignon was too high. The necessity for compromise in such a divided Assembly meant a more moderate choice was inevitable.

Tetlock: Another validation of our probabilistic approach. Low probability, but not impossible - that's the key distinction.
