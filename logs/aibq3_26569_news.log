**Ocean Temperatures Rise Again, Breaking Records**
The ocean temperatures have already started to rise again. According to a compilation of data by the University of Maine, the surface temperature of the oceans reached 20.9°C on July 7, the last day for which data is available. This is a record value for this time of year. The average temperature for early July is 20.2°C. Since March 2023, the oceans have been setting temperature records. The series stopped in June, but since July 6, a new record is being broken daily. The trend is expected to continue. In the North Atlantic, the situation is similar. The temperature is no longer a record since mid-June, but it remains at a very high level, the second highest ever recorded after 2023. The consequences of rising ocean temperatures on marine life and the formation of hurricanes are significant.

**In a troubling milestone, Earth surpasses 1.5 degrees C of warming for 12 consecutive months**
The Earth has surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming for 12 consecutive months, a troubling milestone that highlights a large and continuing shift in the planet's climate. The 1.5-degree Celsius threshold was established under the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The unprecedented year-long stretch is 'very noteworthy and disturbing', said Brenda Ekwurzel, a senior climate scientist. The benchmark is not merely symbolic, as it has significant implications for the planet's future, including deadlier heat waves, droughts, floods, famine, ecosystem destruction, and public unrest and political destabilization. The persistent heat is also contributing to surging numbers of heat-related illnesses and deaths, and it's not just land surfaces that are simmering, the non-polar sea surface temperature in June was the highest value on record for the month. The elevated temperatures occurred despite a waning El Niño, and scientists say it indicates a 'kind of pulling away from the natural cycles'. The Atlantic Ocean is expected to experience an active hurricane season this year, and seasonal forecasts indicate that high temperatures will persist in the months ahead.

**Atlantic Ocean Temperature at Record Highs for Over a Year**
The surface temperature of the Atlantic Ocean has been at record-high levels since a sudden jump in March last year. Last summer, a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius was recorded at a depth of five meters off the coast of Florida. Tourists described it as a 'heat wave'. The heat wave has not subsided. A year later, temperatures are still above last year's records. The global ocean temperature has been above all previous records for over 16 months. The graph shows how much above or below normal the temperature of the world's oceans has been from 1981 to June 19th this year. Since March last year, temperatures have jumped and established themselves at a level far above previous records. The development continues this year. With rising air temperature and increased greenhouse gas emissions, it is not surprising that the ocean is also warming. El Niño also typically contributes to slightly warmer seas. However, the temperature increase accelerated long before the weather phenomenon had an effect. A little increased solar activity. - But even when you add up all these effects, there is a remainder in the temperature jump that is not explained. It is alarming, says Drange. Season forecast: Still extreme.

**Ocean Warming: What the Record Temperatures Mean for Our Planet**
The warming of the oceans has significant implications for our planet. The oceans have already absorbed more than 90% of the heat trapped in the Earth's atmosphere due to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. However, in recent times, this warming has accelerated rapidly. The El Niño event has caused surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean to warm, leading to massive heat transfer to the atmosphere. This heat has been captured by the atmosphere, but the current level of ocean warming in some regions is not justified by these factors, according to McPhaden. The potential for more active hurricanes will be particularly concerning in 2024. The recent El Niño event may soon enter the La Niña phase, which will reduce wind shear, favoring the formation of intense and frequent storms in the North Atlantic near the African coast. Human survival depends on the heat index, and ocean warming can repeat the devastating effects of Hurricane Otis, which reached category 5 in October 2023. Coral bleaching has become more extensive and frequent in Australia to Tanzania, according to ecologist Ana Queirós, who specializes in marine ecology and climate change. The lack of nutrients in the ocean's surface layer is hindering the growth of phytoplankton, the base of the marine food chain. As a result, oxygen from the surface cannot reach the deeper layers of the ocean. The ocean levels are rising more rapidly than the average in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern coast of the United States.

**National Hurricane Center tracking 4 tropical waves. Here's the weather outlook**
The National Hurricane Center is tracking four tropical waves in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico. The 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season is expected to be very active, with potential records set for named storms. The season started on June 1 and will end on November 30. The National Hurricane Center is monitoring the tropical waves, but no tropical storms are expected in the next 7 days. The peak of the season is expected to be on September 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October.

**Earth's Average Temperature Reaches New Record High**
The Earth's average temperature has reached a new record high in modern history, with a reading of 17.15 degrees on July 22. This surpasses the previous record of 17.08 degrees set in July 2023. The World Meteorological Organization announced that the Earth had experienced the hottest days in 120,000 years in July 2023. The record was justified by the presence of El Niño in the Pacific and warm waters in the North Atlantic. The year 2023 was the warmest on record, surpassing all previous years, including 2016, which was previously the warmest. As El Niño began to weaken and La Niña, the cold phase, took its place, it was thought that the intense thermal anomalies of the previous year would disappear. However, since the beginning of 2024, the planet's warming has not slowed down. In fact, between June 2023 and June 2024, the global average temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average (1850-1900), a value set in the Paris Agreement as a safety threshold to maintain the Earth's climate system. According to Carlos Buentempo, director of the Copernicus Scientific Program, 'What is really astonishing is the difference between the temperatures of the last 13 months and the previous temperature records. We are now in unexplored territory, and as the climate continues to warm, we may see new records broken in the coming months and years.' The temperature average tends to peak annually between late June and early August, coinciding with the summer in the northern hemisphere. However, European scientists point to an anomaly in the southern hemisphere as a possible cause of the current situation. 'Our analysis suggests that the sudden increase in global daily average temperature is related to temperatures much higher than average in most of Antarctica. Such large anomalies are not unusual during the Antarctic winter and also contributed to the record global temperatures in early July 2023.' They also mention that the extent of the Antarctic sea ice is almost as low as it was at the same time last year, causing very high temperatures in some parts of the Southern Ocean.'

**Brace for intense cyclones in Arabian Sea during October-November, warns scientist**
Prasanna Kumar, a scientist, warns that the Arabian Sea is expected to experience intense cyclones during October-November due to rapid warming of the sea surface temperature. The Arabian Sea has warmed faster than the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and the Bay of Bengal, leading to an increase in the number and intensity of cyclones. Kumar explains that the sea has stored intense heat in its surface waters, and cyclones are nature's reaction to release that heat. He also notes that La Niña will peak during the October-December period, making conditions favorable for cyclones.

**Global Temperature Record Broken: +17.15°C on July 22, 2024**
The Earth has just experienced the hottest day on record, with a global average temperature of +17.15°C, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This new record surpasses the previous record of +17.09°C set on July 21, 2024, and +17.08°C set on July 6, 2023. The data shows that July 22, 2024, was the hottest day since 1940, the starting year of the ERA5 dataset. The trend of rising temperatures is unprecedented. The C3S experts attribute the record to anomalies in Antarctic temperatures, which have been significant and have had a global impact similar to that observed at the beginning of July 2023. The extent of Antarctic sea ice is currently similar to the minimum of last year, contributing to higher-than-average temperatures in some areas of the Antarctic Ocean. The experts predict that the global average temperature will continue to rise in the coming days.'Since the maximum annual global temperature typically occurs between the end of June and the beginning of August, these observations are preliminary while we monitor the climate almost in real-time. In 2023, a second peak of global average temperature was observed on August 4 (reaching +17.05°C), which approached the record set on July 6, 2023,' said C3S, which will continue to follow the situation and provide updates. Whether 2024 will be the hottest year on record will depend largely on the evolution and intensity of the next phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), particularly when and with what intensity La Niña will manifest. Currently, 2024 has been hot enough to make it likely that it will surpass 2023, but the exceptional heat of the last four months of 2023 makes it premature to make definitive predictions.

**June 2024 hottest on record globally, beating 2023 high: EU climate monitor**
June 2024 was the hottest on record globally, according to the EU's climate monitor, Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This marks the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking temperatures, with every month since June 2023 surpassing its own record. The global average temperature broke the previous June record set in 2023. The streak is attributed to a combination of factors, including El Nino, record sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic, Northern Pacific, and Indian Ocean, and human-induced climate change. The oceans, which cover 70% of the Earth's surface, absorb 90% of the extra heat associated with rising emissions. Although the world is transitioning into a La Nina phase, which has a cooling effect, the record sea surface temperatures may persist, potentially leading to 2024 being warmer than 2023.

**NOAA announces arrival of new extreme climate phenomenon in September**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has announced that a new extreme climate phenomenon will arrive in September, which will affect the country. According to meteorologist Miguel Fernández, the phenomenon is not related to La Niña, as it is still in a neutral phase. However, the atmosphere tends to react faster to this phenomenon than to El Niño, so it is expected to start adapting to colder conditions from August. The situation described by Fernández would strengthen the Pacific anticyclone, which could block the passage of frontal systems to lower latitudes, such as the central part of the country. Additionally, climate change is influencing the decrease in the probability of significant precipitation events during the rest of the winter, but it is not ruled out that some events may occur in July and August, but on a smaller scale than those that have already occurred. The El Niño episode of 2023/2024, which contributed to an increase in global temperatures and extreme weather events around the world, has technically ended. The probability of La Niña is 65% for July and September, and 80% for September and October, and almost 90% for October and January of next year. La Niña is a phenomenon that produces a large-scale cooling of the surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, as well as changes in tropical atmospheric circulation, including winds, pressure, and precipitation. According to the NOAA, there are many possibilities that La Niña will be present to influence the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. Even if the transition occurs more slowly, the probability of La Niña being present for the winter of the Northern Hemisphere (summer of the Southern Hemisphere) remains at 85%, which is similar to the NOAA's forecast in previous months.

**June hottest on record, beating 2023 high: EU climate monitor**
June 2024 was the hottest on record globally, according to the EU's climate monitor, Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This marks the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking temperatures, with the global average temperature notching a new high. The streak is attributed to a combination of factors, including warmer oceans, El Niño, and human-induced climate change. The oceans have been hitting new highs for 15 straight months, with record sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic, Northern Pacific, and Indian Ocean contributing to the soaring heat. While the world is transitioning into a La Niña phase, which has a cooling effect, the record sea surface temperatures may persist, potentially leading to 2024 being warmer than 2023.

**Oceans Reach Plateau in Warming**
The oceans have been unusually warm since March last year, with surface temperatures reaching record highs almost every day. The global sea surface temperature is still above the average of the years 1982-2011. According to Helge Gößling from the Alfred-Wegener-Institut, it is likely that the global sea surface temperature will remain below the extreme records of 2023 in the second half of the year. Current data from the 'Climate Reanalyzer' platform shows that sea surface temperatures have been slightly below last year's level since July. The main cause of the warming is human-made greenhouse gases, which are absorbed by the oceans, with over 90% of the warming effect attributed to them. Additionally, the El Niño climate phenomenon has also contributed to the warming, but its influence is now decreasing. The transition to La Niña, a natural climate phenomenon, is expected to lead to a cooling of the global temperature. However, it is still unclear how much cooling can be expected.

**June 2024 Sets Record as Hottest Month on Record, According to Copernicus**
June 2024 was the hottest month on record, surpassing the exceptional record of 2023, announced the European Copernicus observatory on July 8, 2024. Each month since June 2023 has broken its own temperature record, marking a streak of 13 consecutive months of historic heat. As a result, the global average temperature for the past 12 months (July 2023 - June 2024) is the highest ever recorded. 'This is more than just a statistical anomaly and highlights a significant and continuous change in our climate,' said Carlo Buontempo, director of the service. The heatwave was marked by severe heatwaves in Mexico, China, Greece, and Saudi Arabia, where over 1,300 people died during the Hajj pilgrimage. Heavy rainfall, linked to global warming, caused massive floods in Brazil, China, Kenya, Afghanistan, Russia, and France. The record-breaking temperatures coincided with El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon that contributes to global warming. 'Although this streak may end at some point, we are likely to see new records set as the climate continues to warm,' added Buontempo. The oceans also reached new highs, with records of surface temperature in the Atlantic, North Pacific, and Indian Oceans influencing global warming. 'It's a remarkable fact that the surface temperature of the oceans has reached a new high for 15 consecutive months,' said Julian Nicolas, a scientist at C3S. The oceans cover 70% of the Earth's surface and absorb 90% of the additional heat associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions. 'What happens on the surface of the oceans has a significant impact on the air temperature above the surface and also on the global average temperature,' said Nicolas. However, the world is about to enter a La Niña phase, which has a cooling effect, so 'we can expect the global temperature to decrease in the coming months,' he added. 'If these record-breaking temperatures persist, although La Niña conditions develop, 2024 could be warmer than 2023. But it's too early to say,' he concluded.

**Global Warming Surpasses 1.5 °C Above Pre-Industrial Average**
The global warming has surpassed 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial average for the first time, with a sustained average temperature of 1.64 °C from July 2023 to June 2024. This is a significant increase from the previous year and is expected to continue in the coming years, especially with the occurrence of future El Niño events. The daily measurements from November to February have already exceeded 2.0 °C, the first target to avoid in the 2015 Paris Agreement. This highlights the inability to break the vicious cycle of fossil fuel combustion. Despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere has not decreased. The article also mentions the impact of climate change, including extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall in New Delhi and a rare Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. The author concludes that the accelerated warming is happening in years or decades, not millions of years.

**Record-Breaking Ocean Temperatures: A Warning Sign of Climate Change**
The world's oceans have set a new record for temperature records over the past 15 months, with temperatures exceeding the previous record by a significant margin. The oceans have been warmer than usual since March 2023, with the surface temperature reaching a new high since the start of measurements about 40 years ago. The increase in temperature is attributed to human activities, with more than 90% of the warming effect absorbed by the oceans. Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist and director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said, 'There is no ambiguity about the data, it's a clear issue of attribution, understanding the specific physical processes behind these temperature records will help scientists improve their climate models and predict temperature changes in the future.' The global average sea surface temperature reached a new monthly record of 21.07°C (69.93°F) in the past month, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a research institution funded by the European Union. Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, said, 'March 2024 continues the series of climate fluctuations in air and sea surface temperatures.' The Atlantic Ocean is abnormally warm, which could lead to a busy hurricane season, according to early forecasts from the University of Colorado. The long-term increase in global temperature is due to the burning of fossil fuels, which adds greenhouse gases that warm the planet, and thus expose the oceans to excessive temperature increases. So far, climate change has raised the global average temperature by about 1.2°C (2.2°F), higher than the pre-industrial era average. Because warming the water requires more energy than warming the air, the oceans have absorbed most of the increase in global temperature from greenhouse gases. However, Dr. Schmidt said that 'the massive record-breaking numbers seen last year exceed what scientists expected to see even considering climate change.' The difference now, compared to this time last year, is that the planet is dealing with the effects of the Niño phenomenon, which began in July, a natural climate phenomenon linked to high temperatures.

**Oceans Record New Record-Breaking Temperatures Over 15 Months**
The oceans have recorded new record-breaking temperatures over a period of more than 15 months, with temperatures being exceptionally high since March last year. The sea surfaces have daily recorded the highest value since the start of measurements about 40 years ago, usually with a significant difference from the previous daily record. Until now, the temperature remains much higher than the average from 1982 to 2011. Experts believe that the increase is caused by human activities and the resulting greenhouse gases. According to the German Press Agency (dpa), more than 90% of the temperature impact from this activity is absorbed by the oceans.

**Oceans no longer setting daily heat records**
The oceans have been setting daily heat records for over 15 months, but this trend is expected to come to an end. According to the US-based 'Climate Reanalyzer' platform, the global surface temperature has not exceeded last year's daily values. It is likely that the global sea temperature will remain below the extreme records of 2023 in the second half of the year, said Helge Gößling from the German Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI).

**End of Record-Breaking Ocean Temperatures**
The global ocean surface temperature has not exceeded the daily values of the previous year for the first time in over 15 months. The oceans have been setting heat records for over a year, with each day's surface temperature exceeding the previous record by a significant margin. According to Helge Gößling from the Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI), it is likely that the global sea surface temperature will remain below the extreme records of 2023 in the second half of the year. The main cause of the increase is attributed to human-made greenhouse gases, which are absorbed by the oceans, causing a significant warming effect. Additionally, the influence of El Niño has been waning, and the expected transition to La Niña may lead to a cooling of the global temperature. However, the exact extent of the cooling is still unclear. Gößling notes that the contributions of other factors, such as reduced sulfur dioxide emissions from shipping and an underwater volcanic eruption, are likely to be small compared to the overall temperature increase.

**Positive Development in the Oceans: What Could Be the Reason?**
According to preliminary data from the US platform 'Climate Reanalyzer', the global sea surface temperature has not set new records for the first time in 15 months. The surface temperature has not exceeded the daily values of the previous year. The Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) expects that the global sea surface temperature will remain below the extreme records of 2023 in the second half of the year. The AWI climate physicist Helge Gößling attributes the temperature increase to human-made greenhouse gases, which absorb over 90% of the warming effect. Additionally, the climate phenomenon El Niño has influenced the temperatures by pumping heat from the deep Pacific Ocean to the surface. The influence of El Niño on the global average temperature is currently decreasing. A shift to La Niña could lead to a decrease in global temperature, but the extent is still unclear. Analyses suggest that factors such as the reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions from shipping and the eruption of an underwater volcano may have also played a role. However, these contributions seem too small to fully explain the recent temperature increase. It remains crucial to determine the remaining increase to better predict future developments.

**Oceans' Temperature Records May End: Climate Physicist Expects Cooling in Second Half of the Year**
The oceans have set new heat records for over 15 months, but according to preliminary data from the US platform 'Climate Reanalyzer', the global sea surface temperature has not exceeded the daily values of the previous year. Helge Gößling, a climate physicist at the Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI) in Bremerhaven, expects the global sea temperature to remain below the extreme records of 2023 in the second half of the year. The oceans have been unusually warm since March last year, with each day setting a new record high since the start of measurements around 40 years ago. The warming is mainly attributed to human-made greenhouse gases, with over 90% of the warming effect being absorbed by the oceans. Additionally, the El Niño climate phenomenon has also contributed to the warming. However, the influence of El Niño on the global average temperature is decreasing, and the transition to La Niña, its counterpart, is expected to lead to a cooling of the global temperature. The exact extent of the cooling is still unclear.

**Meteorologists on Alert for Record-Breaking Atlantic Temperatures**
American meteorologists are on alert due to record-breaking temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean south of Cape Verde, which could lead to hurricanes forming earlier than usual. The record-breaking temperatures can fuel one or two Cape Verde-type storms next week, according to Yale University's climate portal. These low-pressure systems, named after the archipelago, can impact the Caribbean and Americas after transforming into hurricanes and crossing the Atlantic between August and September. This time, the temperature variation has triggered some weather forecast models to alert for a possible cyclonic formation next week. The sea surface temperature is near a record high of 28 degrees Celsius, providing more ascending energy to the warm air currents originating from the African continent. In recent years, Cape Verde has contributed to research on climate change and the influence on hurricane formation, for example, through the Ocean Science Center Mindelo on the island of São Vicente. The Cape Verdean authorities have issued a seasonal forecast, predicting above-average rainfall between July and September and a good agricultural campaign, but warning of storms that could reach the archipelago until October.

**Atlantic Ocean Temperature at Record Highs for Over a Year**
The surface temperature of the Atlantic Ocean has been at record-high levels since a sudden jump in March last year. Last summer, a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius was recorded at a depth of five meters off the coast of Florida. Tourists described it as a 'heat wave'. The heat wave has not subsided. A year later, temperatures are still above last year's records. The global ocean temperature has been above all previous records for over 16 months. The graph shows how much above or below normal the temperature of the world's oceans has been from 1981 to June 19th this year. Since March last year, temperatures have jumped and established themselves at a level far above previous records. The development continues this year. With rising air temperature and increased greenhouse gas emissions, it is not surprising that the ocean is also warming. El Niño also typically contributes to slightly warmer seas. However, the temperature increase accelerated long before the weather phenomenon had an effect. A little increased solar activity. - But even when you add up all these effects, there is a remainder in the temperature jump that is not explained. It is alarming, says Drange. Season forecast: Still extreme.

**'El Niño has ended': NOAA announces arrival of new climate event and its effects**
The 2023/2024 El Niño episode, which contributed to a global temperature increase and extreme weather phenomena worldwide, has officially ended. According to the latest update from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), El Niño released its dominance over the tropical Pacific in May 2024. The phenomenon is expected to transition to its climatic extreme: La Niña. La Niña brings cooler-than-average temperatures in the central-eastern Pacific, stronger winds at the surface and in higher altitudes, and more intense rainfall over Indonesia and the surrounding continent. For Chile, La Niña typically means less precipitation, colder winters, and less hot summers. The probability of La Niña arriving between July and September is 65%, and it is expected to be present by October with a probability of over 80%. La Niña can influence the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season and is expected to have a significant impact on the winter of the Northern Hemisphere. Climate expert Rebeca Lindsey stated that the conditions are ripe for the new phenomenon, and the temperature of the surface has cooled significantly during April and May. The expert also mentioned that only 10 times in the historical record have El Niño and La Niña transitioned in a single year. Climatologist Raúl Cordero from the University of Santiago noted that La Niña has two main effects: it moderates temperatures, making years marked by La Niña not extremely hot, and it moderates precipitation, making years marked by La Niña generally dry.

**Daily heat records keep getting broken. It's leaving experts baffled**
Record-breaking daily sea surface temperatures have been recorded since March 2023, with experts concerned about the severe impacts of global warming. The University of Maine's Climate Reanalyzer platform shows new daily records have been set since around mid-March last year. Land surface temperatures have also shot up, with 2023 being the world's hottest year on record. The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming well under 2C and preferably 1.5C. Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, described the 2023 sea temperature anomaly as 'extraordinary' and 'concerning'. The University of Maine's Climate Reanalyzer uses data from the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to track sea surface temperatures. Climatologist Sean Birkel, developer of the Climate Reanalyzer, told SBS News data showed temperatures were still at record-breaking levels. Australian National University professor Mark Howden said the higher than normal ocean temperatures also boosted temperatures over land, impacting human health, agricultural production, water availability, economic productivity, and the environment. The average land temperature for the 12 months between February 2023 and January this year rose to 1.52C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average for the first time, according to Copernicus. Since then, temperatures have continued to set records, with the average rising to 1.63C for the 12 months to May this year. The UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) suggested there was an 80 per cent chance temperatures would rise above the 1.5C threshold across one calendar year at some point over the next five years. Bill Hare, director of global think tank Climate Analytics, said it was still possible to keep temperature change to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5C, although the world is close to that limit now. The Paris targets are not based on a single year, but the average of 20 years. In the last decade, Hare said average warming had risen to around 1.3-1.4C on an annual basis. 'People have a right to be concerned that we could reach that limit if we don't act,' he said. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts the world could reach 1.5C of warming as early as 2030 if there is no change to human activities. 'If we could get into an emission pathway such as the IPCC analysis [suggests] — roughly halving emissions by 2030 and getting down to net zero by 2050, then we'd come very close to limiting warming to 1.5C,' Hare said. 'When people say the 1.5C limit is lost, what they're really saying is they don't believe government will take enough action to reduce emissions.'

**El Niño Comes to an End, but Brazil Still Expects Heatwaves in Winter**
The El Niño phenomenon is coming to an end in Brazil, according to a bulletin released by the National Meteorology Institute (Inmet). The bulletin states that the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean is returning to its climatological average, after a year of elevation. The El Niño is characterized by warming equal to or greater than 0.5 degrees in the ocean. According to Inmet, there is a 69% probability of La Niña occurring in Brazil from the second semester. Meteorologists from Climatempo predict that La Niña will persist throughout the rest of 2024, with a peak likely in the spring, from October to December, and will continue until the summer of 2025. The La Niña phenomenon typically brings opposite effects to those of El Niño, with a decrease in temperature of equal to or greater than 0.5 degrees in the Pacific, resulting in increased rainfall in the North and Northeast, and a trend of drier weather in the South and less regular rainfall in the Center-South. However, it is necessary to be cautious with the predictions, considering the atypical heat being experienced worldwide. The El Niño occurs with a frequency of two to seven years and lasts on average 12 months, affecting global temperatures. The current one started in June 2023 and was classified as moderate to strong by Inmet. Although it was not the most intense recorded, its impacts were significant and varied across different regions of the country. In the winter, the first effects of the proximity of La Niña will be more evident in terms of low humidity, with few rains until mid-spring, which could extend until early October. The persistent dry weather will also favor probable heatwaves between August and October, and it is worth considering that the world has had a year of record heat. Until then, the cold will be relatively mild in most of the country.

**Ocean Warming: What the Record Temperatures Mean for Our Planet**
The warming of the oceans has significant implications for our planet. The oceans have already absorbed more than 90% of the heat trapped in the Earth's atmosphere due to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. However, in recent times, this warming has accelerated rapidly. The El Niño event has caused surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean to warm, leading to massive heat transfer to the atmosphere. This heat has been captured by the atmosphere, but the current level of ocean warming in some regions is not justified by these factors, according to McPhaden. The potential for more active hurricanes will be particularly concerning in 2024. The recent El Niño event may soon enter the La Niña phase, which will reduce wind shear, favoring the formation of intense and frequent storms in the North Atlantic near the African coast. Human survival depends on the heat index, and ocean warming can repeat the devastating effects of Hurricane Otis, which reached category 5 in October 2023. Coral bleaching has become more extensive and frequent in Australia to Tanzania, according to ecologist Ana Queirós, who specializes in marine ecology and climate change. The lack of nutrients in the ocean's surface layer is hindering the growth of phytoplankton, the base of the marine food chain. As a result, oxygen from the surface cannot reach the deeper layers of the ocean. The ocean levels are rising more rapidly than the average in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern coast of the United States.

The Mediterranean Sea has set a new record for its average surface temperature in 2023, reaching 21.1 degrees Celsius, a nearly 1-degree increase compared to the period from 1850 to 1900. This record was set in April 2023. These high temperatures have a negative impact on the oceans' role in global climate regulation and oxygen production. The phenomenon also causes the decline of posidonia forests, the proliferation of jellyfish, and the invasion of exotic species. According to the WWF's 'The Breath of the Oceans' report, released on the eve of World Ocean Day, June 8th.

**Record highs in the North Sea: Even the German Bight is warmer than ever before**
The North Sea has experienced record-breaking temperatures, with 2023 being the warmest year since 1962. The mean water temperature in 2023 was 11.9 degrees Celsius, with March being the warmest March on record. The trend shows no signs of stopping, with the first four months of 2024 being among the top 10 warmest months since 1962. Climate change and global warming are considered the main reasons for the high sea-surface temperatures and increased frequency of extreme events like marine heat waves. Rising water temperatures can produce biological responses, affecting ecosystems and species distribution. Researchers are investigating the impact of marine heat waves on plankton communities and food webs.

**Global oceans see 14th-straight month of record-shattering heat**
The global oceans have experienced 14 consecutive months of record-shattering heat, with May being the latest month to set a record. The Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that the global average surface temperature in May was 1.52°C (2.73°F) above pre-industrial levels, exceeding the 1.5-degree target. The warming oceans are a significant concern for climate researchers, as they absorb 91% of the extra heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, leading to more extreme weather events. The record warm temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean Basin have meteorologists predicting a historically active hurricane season. The news comes as parts of Asia, Mexico, Central America, and the Southwestern US have experienced heatwaves, and highlights the urgent need for action to limit climate change.

**First Taste of Summer: Temperatures to Reach 35°C, but Only for a Few Days**
A meteorologist from the Amap Marche, Danilo Tognetti, predicts that the temperature will rise to 35 degrees Celsius in the next few days, but only for a short period. The heat will be more intense in inland areas, while the coastal regions will be cooler due to the presence of marine breezes. The heatwave is caused by a high-pressure system from North Africa, which will bring warm air from the Sahara desert to Italy. The temperature is expected to peak on Friday and Saturday, with the highest temperatures in the northern regions. However, a new low-pressure system from the Atlantic will bring cooler air and rain to the region starting from Sunday, causing the temperature to drop to around 25-27 degrees Celsius. The heatwave is part of a larger pattern of global warming, with 2023 being the hottest year on record.

**The Atlantic Ocean is primed to deliver "high-octane jet fuel for hurricanes"**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be extremely active due to record-high oceanic heat and a looming La Niña. The University of Miami's Brian McNoldy notes that the ocean heat content in the main development region for Atlantic hurricanes is higher than usual, making it 'high-octane jet fuel for hurricanes'. This, combined with the La Niña, is expected to lead to more and stronger hurricanes. Colorado State University predicts 23 named storms, five major hurricanes, and an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) of 210, which is significantly higher than the average. Forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concur with these predictions, citing a 70% chance of 17-25 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. The combination of La Niña and warm oceans has never been observed before, making this year's forecast unprecedented.

**North Sea reaches record high temperature in 2023**
The North Sea had its warmest year on record in 2023, with an average water temperature of 11.9 degrees Celsius. According to the Alfred Wegener Institute, this is the highest temperature recorded since the beginning of the long-term data series in 1962. The high temperatures are attributed to climate change and could have significant consequences for the ecosystem. The institute also reported that January, February, March, and April 2024 were among the 10 warmest months since 1962, with March 2024 being the warmest March on record. The data shows a connection between the monthly temperatures in the German Bight and those on the German mainland. The director of the Biological Institute Helgoland, Karen Wiltshire, explained that the North Sea warms up quickly because it is a shallow sea surrounded by landmasses, like a large puddle.

**Warmer than normal sea surface temperatures could mean problems for hurricane season**
The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be a busy one, with 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes predicted. The main reason for this is the higher than normal sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Atlantic Ocean. The temperatures are already in the mid-80s, which is unusual for this time of year. The warm water and low wind shear in the Gulf and Caribbean make it easier for storms to form and intensify. La Nina conditions are also favorable for tropical development. The season is expected to peak in September.

**Scientists Warn of Record Early Warming of Atlantic Ocean**
The Atlantic Ocean has reached record-breaking temperatures for this time of year, with the heat content two months ahead of schedule. According to University of Miami Earth Science professor Brian McNoldy, the ocean temperature is usually around 90 degrees on August 10, but it has already reached that level. The warm ocean water will have negative impacts on marine life, sea levels, and hurricane activity. Scientists attribute the early heat spike to a lack of wind and other factors. This is the first time the Atlantic basin has reached such high temperatures so early.

**Oceans Reach Record High Temperature in 2023, Warns UNESCO Report**
According to the State of The Ocean report, 2023 was the hottest year on record for the oceans, with temperatures 1.45°C higher than pre-industrial levels. Some areas have already exceeded 2°C, such as the Mediterranean and the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, aims to keep global warming below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. The report also shows that the rate of warming has doubled in recent years. The warming of the oceans is causing sea levels to rise, with the sea level increasing by over 9 cm in the last 30 years. Additionally, the report estimates that there are between 1.1 and 4.9 million tons of plastic in the ocean, with the main source being discarded fishing nets and other materials in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and single-use utensils and packaging in the rest of the world.

**Oceans Reach Record High Temperature in 2023, Warns UN Report**
The year 2023 was the hottest on record for the world's oceans, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco). The report highlights a 1.45°C increase in average temperature, which is expected to continue at an even faster rate, making 2024 an even hotter year, breaking all previous records. The warming trend is more pronounced in the oceans, as noted by Professor Ronaldo Christofoletti of the Federal University of São Paulo, who is the only Brazilian to sign the Unesco report. The study confirms another measurement by the European climate agency Copernicus, which found that 2023's atmospheric temperatures were the highest since the pre-industrial era, with an average increase of 1.48°C. The report warns that 2024 will likely be even hotter, with the possibility of new occurrences of extreme weather events. The study also highlights the need for a more careful planning of human occupation, as the oceans have risen 9cm in the last 30 years, and the warming trend is expected to continue.

**Unusual Ocean Temperatures Raise Concerns About Upcoming Hurricane Season**
Unusual ocean temperatures have raised concerns about the upcoming hurricane season. The Atlantic Ocean has seen record-breaking temperatures, with the average surface temperature reaching 22.3°C, 1.3°C above the 1982-2011 average. This has led to an increase in the formation and intensification of hurricanes and tropical storms. The warmer ocean temperatures have also contributed to the bleaching of coral reefs and the growth of algae, which can cause bad odors and harm marine life. The change from El Niño to La Niña has also increased the concerns, as it reduces the wind shear in the Atlantic, making it more conducive to hurricane formation. The persistent warming of the oceans is mainly attributed to global warming caused by fossil fuel emissions, with other factors including El Niño and the 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga volcano. The scientists warn that the season could be more dangerous due to the unusual temperatures and the lack of a strong El Niño event.

**Unprecedented Ocean Temperatures Could Intensify Hurricane Season, Experts Warn**
Climate experts warn that the unprecedented ocean temperatures recorded in 2023 could intensify the hurricane season this year. Since the beginning of the year, the oceans have broken daily temperature records, a situation that concerns climatologists, coral reef experts, and hurricane forecasters, according to USA TODAY reports. The warmer-than-usual waters in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico play a crucial role in intensifying hurricanes and tropical storms, providing the necessary fuel for their formation and development. The transition from El Niño to La Niña, which reduces wind shear in the Atlantic, has increased concerns among forecasters. Global sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic have reached 22.3°C, surpassing the 1982-2011 average by 1.3°C. The region's main hurricane development area has recorded temperatures almost 1°C above any other year since 1982, and 1.4°C above the 1991-2020 average. High sea surface temperatures contribute to the formation of large cloud structures that intensify hurricanes. The persistent increase in ocean temperatures is mainly caused by global warming due to fossil fuel emissions, although other factors, such as El Niño and the 2022 Hunga Tonga volcanic eruption, also influence it. As the peak of the hurricane season approaches in July and August, the high sea temperatures could exacerbate damage not only through hurricanes but also severely affect coral reefs. In some stations in the Florida Keys and Everglades National Park, water temperatures have reached 32°C, further aggravating environmental and security concerns for coastal populations.
