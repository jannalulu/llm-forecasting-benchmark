To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of the situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I could not find specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this exact question. However, I will use historical patterns of diplomatic expulsions and recalls in similar geopolitical contexts as a reference class.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of Diplomatic Expulsions/Recalls**: How often do diplomatic expulsions or recalls occur in similar geopolitical tensions?
2. **Current Tensions**: What is the current state of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and China?
3. **Recent Incidents**: What recent events could escalate tensions to the point of expulsions or recalls?
4. **Diplomatic Channels**: Are there ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, diplomatic expulsions or recalls are relatively rare, even in tense situations. They are often seen as a last resort due to the significant diplomatic fallout.
- **Inside View**: The current situation between the Philippines and China is highly tense, with multiple incidents (e.g., wiretapping allegations, fishing bans, maritime clashes) that could escalate to expulsions or recalls.

### Step 4: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Higher Probability**: 
  - The wiretapping scandal involving Chinese diplomats has led to calls for expulsion from Philippine officials.
  - The Philippines has filed multiple diplomatic protests against China's actions in the South China Sea.
  - There is a history of aggressive actions by China in the region, which could provoke a strong response from the Philippines.
- **Evidence for Lower Probability**:
  - Both countries have shown a willingness to engage in diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions.
  - The economic ties between the Philippines and China are significant, and both countries have incentives to avoid a full-blown diplomatic crisis.
  - Expulsions or recalls are extreme measures and are often avoided unless absolutely necessary.

### Step 5: Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work
- **Escalatory Forces**: 
  - Nationalistic sentiments in both countries.
  - Recent aggressive actions by China in the South China Sea.
  - Domestic pressure in the Philippines to take a strong stance against China.
- **De-escalatory Forces**:
  - Economic interdependence between the two countries.
  - Ongoing diplomatic efforts to manage tensions.
  - International pressure to avoid further escalation in the region.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The trend of increasing tensions between the Philippines and China suggests a higher likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls. However, the trend of diplomatic engagement and economic ties suggests a lower likelihood.

### Step 7: Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits
- The situation is highly uncertain, with multiple factors pulling in opposite directions. The probability should reflect this uncertainty.

### Step 8: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the conflicting evidence, it is important to avoid being overly confident in either direction. The probability should reflect a balanced view of the evidence.

### Step 9: Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes
- Potential errors include overestimating the likelihood of expulsions due to recent incidents or underestimating the likelihood due to ongoing diplomatic efforts.

### Final Assessment
Considering the base rate of diplomatic expulsions/recalls, the current state of tensions, and the clashing causal forces, I estimate that the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, is moderately high but not certain.

**My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.**

To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of the situation.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
Diplomatic expulsions or recalls are relatively rare events, typically occurring during significant escalations in bilateral tensions. In the context of the Philippines and China, such actions have historically been infrequent, even during periods of heightened disputes over the South China Sea. The base rate for such events in similar geopolitical contexts suggests a low probability, perhaps in the range of 10-20%.

### Step 2: Current Evidence and Trends
The recent news articles highlight escalating tensions between the Philippines and China, particularly over the South China Sea. Key points include:
- **Alleged wiretapping incidents**: There have been calls from Philippine officials to expel Chinese diplomats over alleged wiretapping and disinformation campaigns. These calls have been met with resistance from China, which has urged the Philippines to stop provocations.
- **Diplomatic protests**: The Philippines has filed multiple diplomatic protests against China, including over a unilateral fishing ban and aggressive actions in the South China Sea.
- **De-escalation efforts**: Despite tensions, both sides have engaged in diplomatic talks to manage disputes, such as the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism (BCM) meetings. These efforts suggest a preference for dialogue over confrontation.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Escalatory forces**: The wiretapping allegations, aggressive maritime actions, and domestic political pressure in the Philippines for a stronger stance against China increase the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls.
- **De-escalatory forces**: The ongoing diplomatic talks, economic interdependence, and the potential for international mediation (e.g., ASEAN) reduce the likelihood of such actions.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
While the escalatory forces are significant, the de-escalatory efforts and the historical rarity of diplomatic expulsions in this context suggest that the probability of such an event remains moderate. The Philippines has shown a preference for diplomatic solutions, even in the face of provocations.

### Step 5: Final Adjustment
Given the current tensions and the balance of forces, I adjust the base rate upward but remain cautious about overestimating the likelihood of expulsions or recalls. The probability is higher than the base rate but not excessively so.

### Step 6: Final Forecast
Considering all factors, I estimate the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, to be in the range of 25-40%, with 32% being the most likely.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 40.00%, but 32.00% being the most likely. Probability: 32.00%.

To forecast whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
Diplomatic expulsions or recalls are relatively rare events, especially between countries with significant economic and geopolitical ties like the Philippines and China. Historically, such actions are typically triggered by severe breaches of diplomatic norms, espionage, or significant escalations in bilateral tensions. In the context of the Philippines-China relationship, which has been marked by periodic tensions over the South China Sea, the base rate for such events is low but not negligible.

### Step 2: Current Context and Evidence
The recent news articles highlight several key developments:
1. **Escalating Tensions**: There have been multiple incidents in the South China Sea, including confrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels, and allegations of Chinese disinformation campaigns and wiretapping involving Chinese diplomats.
2. **Calls for Expulsion**: High-ranking Philippine officials, including the National Security Adviser and senators, have called for the expulsion of Chinese diplomats over alleged illegal activities, such as wiretapping and spreading disinformation.
3. **Diplomatic Efforts**: Despite tensions, both countries have engaged in diplomatic talks to de-escalate the situation. The Philippines has emphasized the importance of dialogue and diplomacy, even as it protests China's actions.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Factors Increasing Likelihood**: The calls for expulsion by high-ranking officials, the seriousness of the allegations (wiretapping, disinformation), and the ongoing maritime confrontations increase the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls.
- **Factors Decreasing Likelihood**: The strong economic ties between the two countries, the Philippines' preference for diplomatic solutions, and the potential for further diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions reduce the likelihood of such actions.

### Step 4: Adjusting the Base Rate
Given the current context, I adjust the base rate upward. While the base rate for such events is low, the specific allegations and the intensity of the current tensions suggest a higher probability than usual.

### Step 5: Final Probability Estimate
Considering the balance of evidence, I estimate that the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, is moderately high but not certain.
