**Black male celebrities support Donald Trump as Harris struggles with black men**
In a surprising turn of events, several prominent Black male celebrities have publicly endorsed Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election, despite Vice President Kamala Harris struggling to maintain support from Black men. According to Fox News, rapper Kodak Black, former NFL player Antonio Brown, and boxing legend Mike Tyson have all expressed their support for Trump. This shift in celebrity endorsement aligns with a larger trend, as 25% of Black men under 50 say they might vote for Trump, according to an NAACP survey. Harris's support among Black men has significantly declined, with only 70% now supporting her, down from 85% who backed Joe Biden in 2020. Lord Jamar, a rapper, has criticized Harris but praised Trump's leadership approach. 'This shows that this shift in celebrity endorsement aligns itself with a larger trend of the Black male,' said an NAACP survey. As Harris's voting support crumbles, Trump's efforts to appeal to Black men appear to be gaining traction.

**Trump Lands New Endorsements from Black Celebrities in Blow to Kamala**
Donald Trump is gaining support among Black male voters, a demographic traditionally loyal to Democrats, ahead of the 2024 election. Several prominent Black celebrities and athletes have endorsed Trump, including Mike Tyson, 50 Cent, and Kodak Black, citing his message of economic opportunity and law and order. According to a New York Times/Siena College poll, Vice President Kamala Harris is losing ground with Black men, with only 70% saying they will vote for her, down from 85% in 2020. Trump's gains among Black men are complicating the Harris campaign's efforts, and even some left-leaning figures are acknowledging the shift. As Trump's support grows, Harris is scrambling to solidify her standing with Black men, but so far, her outreach initiatives appear to be falling flat.

**Celebrities Endorse Harris and Trump Ahead of US Elections**
US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are holding rallies in key states Pennsylvania and Michigan, with celebrities endorsing each of them. Harris will appear on stage with singer Lizzo on Saturday and with singer Asher in the evening, both of whom are well-known musicians. Elon Musk, the owner of the X platform and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has put his financial resources behind Trump and is making a quick tour of Pennsylvania to rally voters for him. Trump will hold rallies in Pennsylvania on Saturday and Sunday, and will play the role of a McDonald's employee for a short time during the weekend to mock Harris, who claims she lied when she said she worked at a fast-food restaurant in her youth. Harris will hold her first rally of the weekend on Saturday in Detroit, Michigan, one of the three industrial states in the north that have been the focus of her efforts all week. Lizzo, a 36-year-old flautist and rapper from Detroit, will join her. Lizzo announced that she voted early for the candidate who could become the first woman to win the presidential election in November. Harris needs to win Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan to achieve this goal. Trump and Harris campaigned in Michigan on Friday, exchanging sharp attacks in a campaign that is becoming increasingly heated. Harris returned to the topic of Trump's age, saying, 'If you're exhausted in your campaign, it raises questions about your ability to take on the toughest job in the world.' Trump denied reports that he had canceled interviews and responded angrily, saying Harris is 'a loser with less energy than a rabbit.' On Saturday evening, Harris will be in another crucial and contested state, Georgia, where she will deliver a speech in Atlanta, joined by Asher. They will encourage voters to cast their ballots early, which has already begun, with one million people voting in four days in the state. Meanwhile, former US President Barack Obama is campaigning for Harris on Saturday in Las Vegas, saying, 'We don't need to see what an older, more crazy, and more out-of-touch Donald Trump will bring.'

**Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump: Celebrities Weigh In**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, and celebrities are weighing in on the candidates. Kamala Harris has received endorsements from several high-profile figures, including Robert De Niro, Steve Buscemi, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Taylor Swift. Swift, in particular, has been a vocal supporter, posting about Harris on Instagram and criticizing Trump's comments. Trump, on the other hand, has received support from Elon Musk, Mike Tyson, Hulk Hogan, and 50 Cent, among others.

**Celebrity Endorsements Are Taking Over The Election, Proving We've Lost The Plot**
The 2024 presidential election has seen a surge in celebrity endorsements, with figures like Amber Rose, 50 Cent, and Elon Musk publicly supporting Donald Trump. However, this trend raises questions about the influence of celebrity opinions on politics and whether they should be given more weight due to their visibility. The article argues that while celebrities may have a platform, it's not a qualification to shape political representation, and that the focus on celebrity endorsements distracts from actual policy issues affecting people, such as debt, inflation, and healthcare. The author suggests that this trend is a sign that we've lost the plot and that politics has become too inaccessible, with people being given merchandise and photo-ops instead of being regularly engaged on the issues.
