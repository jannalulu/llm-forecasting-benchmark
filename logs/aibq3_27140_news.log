**Stocks Rebound After Worst Loss Since 2022—S&P On Pace For Best Day In 6 Months**
Stocks rebounded on Tuesday, recovering some of the losses from the previous week's decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 2% each. This bounceback follows Monday's selloff, which was the worst single-day drop for the S&P and Dow since September 2022. The S&P is on pace for its largest single-day gain since February 22 and its second-best day of 2024. The indexes have fallen significantly this month due to recession concerns and a subpar labor market report. However, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) came down by almost 40% to 24, indicating traders expect calmer waters ahead. American stocks are still up solidly over a longer timeframe, with the S&P returning 10% year-to-date, 18% over the last 12 months, and 29% over the last two years.

**Wall Street's fear gauge spikes to highest level since 2020 as global turmoil deepens**
Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), spiked to its highest level in over four years, reaching 62.27, as global market turmoil deepened. The VIX index, which measures investor fear, jumped 172% and has not been this high since March 2020. The surge in VIX is attributed to the weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which reignited fears of a recession. The report showed the economy added just 114,000 workers last month, with the unemployment rate jumping to 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021. This triggered the Sahm Rule, an indicator that signals a recession when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate is at least a half-percentage point higher than the 12-month low. Stocks crashed on Friday, with the S&P 500 experiencing its worst day since October 2022, and the sell-off continued in early trading Monday. 'The U.S. is the locomotive of the global economic train and increasing concern about a slowdown, or possible recession, has markets around the world in turmoil,' said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. The slowdown in job growth raises questions about whether the Federal Reserve waited too long to cut interest rates, which are currently near a 23-year high.

**Wall Street fear index hits 3-month high as markets slump, worries over earnings, growth rise**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of investor anxiety, hit a 3-month high of 19.48 on August 1, before closing at 18.59. This spike coincided with a decline in US stocks, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite 2.3%. The VIX has been rising as investors become increasingly wary of corporate earnings and economic growth. The S&P 500 is down 4% from its July 16 peak, and 1.5 million VIX options were traded on August 1, nearly double the average daily volume, indicating heightened market apprehension. The VVIX index, which measures expected volatility in the VIX, rose 16.93 points to 111.18, indicating expectations of significant near-term market swings.

**Angstbarometer of the Wall Street Jumps to Three-Month High**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) reached a three-month high of 19.48 on August 1, 2024, before decreasing to 18.59. The increase occurred as the S&P 500 fell by nearly 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell by 2.3%, bringing it within two percentage points of its record high reached in the previous month. The VIX Index, which has an average value of 13.96 for the year so far, has increased in recent weeks as investors have become increasingly concerned about corporate earnings and economic growth. According to Trade Alert, 1.5 million VIX options changed hands on August 1, nearly double the average daily volume for these options. The VIX Index is now closer to its long-term average of 19.5. The VVIX Index, which indicates expected volatility of the VIX, closed at 111.18 with a gain of 16.93 points, signaling that investors expect significant volatility in the VIX in the near future, as said by the market expert, 'The increase in VIX options trading is a clear indication of investor anxiety and expectation of market volatility.'

**Investors expect stock-market fear gauge to jump before U.S. presidential election**
Investors are expecting a potential increase in stock-market volatility ahead of the November 5th US presidential election, according to Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. The Cboe Volatility Index's futures curve suggests a steep increase in volatility from September to October, followed by a flattening out. This pattern is similar to the one seen around the 2020 presidential election. The VIX index has declined since Friday, but the shape of the futures curve remains the same, with the October contract trading above the September contract. The Federal Reserve's potential rate cut in September may also be influencing the VIX's futures curve. Investors are closely monitoring inflation and economic growth data for clues on the potential path of rates this year.

**Stocks Edge Higher in Run-Up to US Inflation Data: Markets Wrap**
Stocks have continued to rebound after last week's market meltdown as traders await inflation data that will help shape the Federal Reserve's next steps. Equities have extended gains into a third consecutive session, with investors looking for the numbers to land in a 'sweet spot' - cool enough to rule out a September rate cut, but warm enough to push aside recession concerns. According to Chris Larkin at E*Trade, 'investors will be looking for the numbers to land in a sweet spot — cool enough that no one will be second-guessing the likelihood of a September rate cut, but warm enough to push aside the recession concerns that have rattled the markets recently.' The S&P 500 hovered around 5,350, while the Cboe Volatility Index was fairly stable around 20. Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 3.93%. Investors will have a brief window to buy the dip in US stocks at the end of this month as selling pressure from systematic funds eases while companies boost share buybacks, according to Scott Rubner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 'This will be my last bearish equity markets call for August as we are ending the worst of the equity supply and demand mismatch for August,' Rubner wrote in a note to client.

**What happens after a big spike in the VIX**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) reached a record high of 65.73 on Monday, August 5th, marking its highest level since the COVID-19 spike in 2020. Historically, the S&P 500 has formed various bottoming patterns following VIX spikes, including 'V' bottoms, double bottoms, head and shoulders bottoms, and triangles. According to Bank of America's technical strategists, it is too soon to tell what pattern develops on the SPX after the August 2024 panic spike on the VIX. However, they note that the S&P 500 often struggles for four to eight weeks after an initial VIX spike above 45, with the index up only 40% of the time during this period. In contrast, the index tends to perform better over longer periods, with 80% of the time the S&P 500 is up 13 weeks after a VIX spike, and 80% of the time one year after the spike, with average and median returns of 5.46% and 5.17%, and 14.07% and 18.18%, respectively. As strategists put it, 'time is needed for the U.S. equity market to stabilize after a VIX spike,' and 'these SPX returns suggest that lackluster to weaker returns prior to the Presidential election, which lines up with election year seasonality.'

**Market Turbulence: Will Calm Return Soon?**
Despite recent gains, market operators believe it will take time for calm to return to the markets. Historical data from the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX) shows that increases in volatility can take months to dissipate. The index, known as the 'fear gauge' of Wall Street, measures the demand for options to protect against market fluctuations. According to Reuters analysis, when the index closes above 35, it takes an average of 170 sessions for it to return to its long-term median of 17.6, a level associated with less extreme investor anxiety. A potential point of conflict will be on Wednesday, when the US publishes its consumer price data. If the data shows that inflation is falling too quickly, it could reinforce fears that the Federal Reserve has pushed the economy into recession by keeping interest rates too high for too long, contributing to market turbulence. Currently, futures markets are pricing in a 55% probability of the central bank cutting interest rates by 50 basis points in September, compared to a 5% probability observed a month ago.

**US Stocks Prepare for More Volatility Amid Economic Data and Election Uncertainty**
Investors are bracing for more volatility in the US stock market after a tumultuous week. The S&P 500 index experienced its largest decline of the year, but managed to recover some losses later in the week. The index remains about 6% below its all-time high reached last month. Market observers attribute the recent fluctuations to a mix of economic indicators and the decline in large trade driven by the yen. These changes come after a period of relatively stable trading and growing concerns about US economic forecasts. Investors, who previously expected a mild economic slowdown, are now adapting to the possibility of a more severe slowdown, as indicated by recent manufacturing and employment data. Bob Kalmann, a portfolio manager at MIRAMAR CAPITAL, notes that market sentiment has shifted from optimism to fear due to a variety of factors, including geopolitical risks and election uncertainty. The Cboe Volatility Index, often referred to as the 'fear gauge' on Wall Street, saw its largest one-day increase on Monday, indicating increased investor anxiety. Historically, such spikes in volatility have taken months to subside. Data on consumer prices, due out on Wednesday, will be a key point for investors. There is concern that the sharp decline in inflation may indicate that the Federal Reserve's high-interest-rate policy has pushed the economy into a recession. Markets are now pricing in a 55% chance of a 50-basis-point rate cut by the Fed in September, a significant increase from the 5% chance seen a month ago. Corporate earnings reports have not provided a clear direction for the market, with second-quarter results for S&P 500 companies closely tracking long-term averages. Retail giants Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are expected to release earnings reports soon, which may provide insight into consumer behavior under high-interest-rate conditions. Investors are also looking to earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the Jackson Hole symposium for the Federal Reserve later this month for further guidance on market direction. Charles Lemonides of ValueWorks LLC views the recent market movements as a healthy correction and has taken the opportunity to invest in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The upcoming US presidential election is adding to market uncertainty, with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris currently leading Republican Donald Trump in polls. A recent poll by Ipsos showed Harris leading Trump by a 42% to 37% margin. The election, scheduled for November 5, is expected to lead to further market volatility. Analysts at J.P. Morgan note that while early events in the election cycle hinted at possible outcomes, recent developments have made the outcome less certain. Chris Marangi of Gabelli Funds expects the election to contribute to market volatility, but also expects the expected rate cuts in September to encourage a shift towards market sectors that have underperformed this year, despite economic challenges.

**Buckle up! More market excitement is coming**
Last week was a wild ride for stocks, with major indexes suffering their worst one-day losses since September 2022. However, markets recovered by the end of the week. This week is expected to be just as volatile, with several economic and earnings reports that could impact the market. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the Fear Index, is a key indicator to watch, as it measures investor fear and has been rising in recent days. According to the article, 'Above 30 is concerning, but the index hit nearly 66 on Aug. 5 as the Dow was losing 1,000 points.' This week's key reports include the Producer Price Index, Consumer Price Index, and Retail sales, which are expected to show a 2% increase for July over July 2023. Additionally, several major companies will be reporting their earnings, including Home Depot, Cisco Systems, Walmart Inc., Applied Materials, and Deere & Co. These reports have the potential to move markets and should be closely watched.

**Rollercoaster week leaves investors braced for bumps ahead**
A week of wild market swings has investors looking ahead to inflation data, corporate earnings, and presidential polls for signals that could soothe a recent outbreak of turbulence in US stocks. The S&P 500 is still down around 6 percent from a record high set last month, despite recent rallies. Investors are concerned about the trajectory of the US economy, with many now worried about a more severe downturn following weaker-than-expected manufacturing and employment data. 'Everybody is now worried about the economy,' said Bob Kalman, a portfolio manager at Miramar Capital. 'We are moving away from the greed portion of the program and now the market is facing the fear of significant geopolitical risks, a hotly contested election, and volatility that is not going away.' The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, has taken 170 sessions on average to return to a level associated with less extreme investor anxiety after surging above 35. Potential flashpoints include consumer price data on Wednesday and corporate earnings from companies such as Walmart and Home Depot next week. The Fed's annual Jackson Hole gathering will give policymakers another chance to fine tune their monetary policy message before their September meeting. 'We expect increased volatility into the election but the underlying rotation to continue as lower rates offset economic weakness,' said Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer of value at Gabelli Funds.

**Market volatility goes both ways: Chart of the Week**
The S&P 500 surged 2.3% on Thursday, following its biggest single-day loss of 2024 just three days earlier. Volatility has been on the rise since mid-July, with the CBOE's Volatility Index spiking to over 65. According to DataTrek's Nicholas Colas, high levels of volatility usually mean a hit to one- to three-month returns, but it's also unpredictable in the short term. Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick advises investors to consider doing nothing, as big gains and big losses can go hand in hand. This is in line with BMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski's 2024 forecast update, which predicted a big drawdown in the coming months due to the average 9.4% pullback in the second year of a bull market. As Colas noted, 'volatility is the price you pay for equity market returns.'

**US markets end higher in cautious trade - RTHK**
US stocks ended higher on Friday after a tumultuous week, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.5% to 5,344, the Nasdaq Composite also gaining 0.5% to 16,745, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.1% to 39,497. The technology sector led gains, while the Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's 'fear gauge', decreased after surging to 65.73 at the start of the week. Fed policymakers expressed confidence that inflation was cooling enough to allow interest-rate cuts ahead, with investors seeing a 55% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the next Fed meeting on September 17-18. Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said, 'For most of the last week the negative opinions were driving sentiment and direction and those have been outweighed by a little less pessimism.' However, he also noted that 'there is going to continue to be a significant amount of uncertainty and anxiety hanging over the market for the course of the next month until we get to the next Fed meeting.'

The S&P 500 ended higher on Friday, but was little changed for the week after a steep selloff on Monday. The technology sector led the gains, and the Cboe Volatility Index fell.

**Market Has Not Yet Reached Bottom, Say Strategas Traders**
According to Strategas' 'List of Minima to Watch', only one of the seven elements has been met, with the others still pending. These elements include: more than 50% of stocks reaching 20-day lows (44% on Monday), less than 20% of stocks trading above their 50-day moving average (47% before Thursday's opening), and the 10-day advance/decline ratio reaching the 5th percentile (27th percentile at Thursday's opening). The total number of put options in circulation compared to the number of call options must reach the 99th percentile, and was 'just below' that on Monday's close. The 10-day put-call ratio must reach the 99th percentile, but was at the 88th percentile before Thursday's market opening. The S&P 500's Relative Strength Index (RSI) must fall below 30 ('close, but not yet there', said the traders). The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) must be inverted, with the spot index at three months below the VIX index. The only element that has been met is the VIX, which is significantly inverted and reached a peak on Monday due to massive selling. 'It's rare in this business for everything to go perfectly, but in this case, it seems like a pretty straightforward decision... continue to act with caution for now,' wrote Chris Verrone in a note to his clients on Thursday. 'This is not an exact science, it's a balancing act: wait for the scales to tip and then take off,' he also said. The three major indices rebounded strongly on Thursday, but the market has not yet fully recovered from the significant losses on Monday. Analysts at Raymond James, who echo Strategas' opinion, believe that the market is likely to weaken further in the short term. Any bounce in stock prices offers investors the opportunity to reduce risk, said Javed Mirza and Majd Hijazi in a note published on Thursday. 'Our technical work suggests using a pending rebound against the trend as an opportunity to reduce exposure to risk, as a mid-term corrective phase (1-3 months) is likely to see increased volatility in the stock market until September,' wrote the market technicians at Raymond James.

**A strategy for investors who are still nervous about the market, but don't want to miss a rebound**
Investors who are hesitant to buy the current market dip due to high volatility, but don't want to miss a potential rebound, may consider a strategy that involves using call spreads to make bullish bets. Historically, a high Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has been followed by above-average returns, with the S & P 500 averaging nearly triple the 1-month returns when the VIX is 30. However, the market has been higher roughly 77% of the time a month later when the VIX was greater than 30. A call spread offers defined risk and mitigates the higher options premiums elevated volatility creates, making it a suitable option for investors who are concerned about further pullbacks. An example of a call spread is buying SPDR S & P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) January $525 call options and selling nearer dated September $550 calls against them in a diagonal spread.

**Stocks Rebound After Worst Loss Since 2022—S&P On Pace For Best Day In 6 Months**
Stocks rebounded on Tuesday, recovering some of the losses from the previous week's decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 2% each. This bounceback follows Monday's selloff, which was the worst single-day drop for the S&P and Dow since September 2022. The S&P is on pace for its largest single-day gain since February 22 and its second-best day of 2024. The indexes have fallen significantly this month due to recession concerns and a subpar labor market report. However, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) came down by almost 40% to 24, indicating traders expect calmer waters ahead. American stocks are still up solidly over a longer timeframe, with the S&P returning 10% year-to-date, 18% over the last 12 months, and 29% over the last two years.

**Wall Street 'fear gauge' heads for second-biggest drop on record after Monday spike**
The Cboe Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street's 'fear gauge,' dropped 29.51% to 27.18 on Tuesday, after spiking to its highest level since September 2022 earlier in the day. The index, which reflects expectations for volatility in the coming 30 days, was on track for its second-largest one-day percentage fall on record, with the largest drop being a 29.57% fall on May 10, 2010. The VIX jumped sharply on Monday as the S&P 500 tanked 3% due to rising U.S. recession fears and the violent unwind of the Japanese yen carry trade.

**Stocks Rebound Slightly After Worst Day Since 2022**
Stocks rebounded slightly on Tuesday after a 3% decline in the S&P 500 on Monday, as investors sought to mitigate the losses caused by global risk angst and central bank uncertainty. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased by 16% to 32.37, indicating a decrease in expected volatility. However, the VIX remains 5% higher than its level during the stock market boom from January 2023 to July 2024. Japan's Nikkei index staged a 10% rally, while other overseas indexes declined less than 1%. The U.S. monthly jobs report revealed weaker employment growth and an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate, causing concerns about economic growth. American stocks are still up solidly over a longer timeframe, with the S&P returning 10% year-to-date, 18% over the last 12 months, and 29% over the last two years.

**History shows stocks go up after Wall Street's fear index hits these levels, argues RBC**
The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) suggests that investors should take advantage of the current market sell-off, citing a historic opportunity to go bargain hunting. The bank's global equity strategy team believes that the S&P 500 index is a buy on a 12-month forward basis when the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is above 35. According to RBC's back-testing, the S&P 500 index has historically gained 6.5%, 14.5%, and 28.5% on average during the subsequent three, six, and twelve months, respectively, when the VIX is above 35. The VIX is currently sitting at around 33 points. RBC also notes that earnings season does not indicate a U.S. economy tipping into recession, citing a positive tone from companies and commentary on labor dynamics.

**How does the ASX 200 perform after a spike in Wall Street's 'fear gauge'?**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) experienced its largest intraday jump on record, reaching 65.7 and increasing by 178% from its close last Friday. This level is comparable to those seen during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The ASX 200's historic performance following significant VIX spikes shows considerable volatility, with 75% of the S&P 500 reporting Q2 earnings and earnings growth currently sitting at 11.5%, the highest since Q4 2021. Despite near-term turbulence, there remain numerous reasons to remain bullish, including encouraging inflation data and a 73.5% chance of a 50 bp September cut. However, markets tend to become volatile after such a destabilizing move, and it's essential to take things one day at a time and manage risk. The historic data becomes overwhelmingly positive around the 24-month mark, so it's recommended to stay long-term bullish and keep calm.

**Stocks Rebound After Worst Loss Since 2022 -- S&P On Pace For Best Day In 6 Months**
Stocks rebounded on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 1.4% and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gaining 2% each. The S&P is on pace for its largest single-day gain since February 22 and its second-best day of 2024. The bounceback follows Monday's 3% decline in the S&P 500, which was the worst single-day drop since September 2022. The indexes have fallen significantly this month due to recession concerns, a subpar labor market report, and Japan's interest rate hike. The bond market also showed signs of recovery, with 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields gaining 10 basis points. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased by almost 40% to 24, indicating traders expect calmer waters ahead. Despite this, American stocks are still up solidly over a longer timeframe, with the S&P returning 10% year-to-date, 18% over the last 12 months, and 29% over the last two years.

**S&P 500, Nasdaq Sink To Lowest Levels Since May As Crash Fears Linger**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at their lowest levels since May, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at its weakest price since June. The indexes declined by 3%, 3.4%, and 2.6% respectively, with the S&P's decline being its worst day since September 2022. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked to its highest closing level since October 2020, indicating major angst among traders. Darrell Cronk, Wells Fargo Investment Institute's chief investment officer, attributed the selloff to the 'unwinding' of leveraged trades in Japan. The Nasdaq has fallen 13.1% from its July high, while the Dow and S&P are still outside of a correction. Jamie Cox, Harris Financial Group's managing partner, pointed to global currency market volatility, central bank uncertainty, and escalating violence in the Middle East as catalysts of negative sentiment. Seema Shah, Principal Asset Management's chief global strategist, wrote that a sustained market recovery needs a catalyst, including stabilization of the Japanese yen, strong earnings numbers, and solid economic data releases.

**Prepare for a new high-volatility market regime**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has spiked above 65, indicating exceptionally high fears in the market based on real-time pricing of S & P 500 Index options. This magnitude of spike has not occurred since 2020, when the COVID-19 related decline in the S & P 500 was maturing. According to Katie Stockton and Will Tamplin of Fairlead Strategies, this suggests that a high-volatility regime is upon us, with the prolonged low-volatility regime that preceded it coming to an abrupt halt. They believe that this will lead to more pullbacks and corrections as the uptrend becomes more gradual. Stockton and Tamplin recommend staying with core long positions, reducing more opportunistic/high-beta exposure, and using a rebound in the S & P 500 to hedge partial exposure from a top-down perspective.

**Wall Street's fear gauge spikes to highest level since 2020 as global turmoil deepens**
Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), spiked to its highest level in over four years, reaching 62.27, as global market turmoil deepened. The VIX index, which measures investor fear, jumped 172% and has not been this high since March 2020. The surge in VIX is attributed to the weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which reignited fears of a recession. The report showed the economy added just 114,000 workers last month, with the unemployment rate jumping to 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021. This triggered the Sahm Rule, an indicator that signals a recession when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate is at least a half-percentage point higher than the 12-month low. Stocks crashed on Friday, with the S&P 500 experiencing its worst day since October 2022, and the sell-off continued in early trading Monday. 'The U.S. is the locomotive of the global economic train and increasing concern about a slowdown, or possible recession, has markets around the world in turmoil,' said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. The slowdown in job growth raises questions about whether the Federal Reserve waited too long to cut interest rates, which are currently near a 23-year high.

**The stock market 'fear index' hit its highest level since the 2020 crash**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the 'fear index,' hit its highest level since March 2020 on Monday, reaching $56.55, a 142% increase from the previous day. This surge was triggered by fears of a slowing U.S. economy, following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that saw employers add only 114,000 jobs in July, falling short of the 175,000 gain economists had projected. The VIX reflects investors' anxieties about market downturns and is calculated using the weighted prices of put and call options in the S&P 500 index. Global stock markets were in a rout, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures falling 2.7%, S&P 500 futures dipping 3.6%, and Nasdaq-100 futures dropping 4.8%. The culprit behind the market downturn is the slowing U.S. economy, which has raised concerns about a potential hard landing, and whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates, which have been at a 23-year high of between 5.25% and 5.5% for the past year.

**VIX Reaches Highest Level Since 2020 as Global Stock Markets Plummet**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the 'Fear Index' or 'Fear Barometer', reached its highest level since March 2020 on Monday, increasing by 142% to 56.55 USD. This is nearly double the previous 52-week high and its highest intraday level since April 2020, when global stock markets plummeted due to fears of the COVID-19 pandemic. The VIX reflects investors' fears of market downturns and is calculated based on the weighted prices of put and call options in the S&P 500 Index for the next 30 days. Global stock markets were in a sharp decline on Monday, with the Japanese Nikkei 225 plummeting 12%, the worst day since the Black Monday crash in 1987. In the US, Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures fell by over 1,200 points or 3.2%, S&P 500 Futures fell by 4.4%, and Nasdaq 100 Futures fell by 5.7%. The culprit behind the decline? The weaker-than-expected US jobs report, which showed employers created only 114,000 new jobs in July, far below the 175,000 expected by economists. This data suggests a slowdown in the US economy and has raised concerns about a possible hard landing, rather than a soft landing, where the central bank lowers inflation without pushing the economy into a recession. Some investors are also questioning whether the Federal Reserve waited too long to lower interest rates, which were at a 23-year high of 5.25-5.5% last year. With inflation moving towards the 2% target of the Fed, a September rate cut seems uncertain, but some traders are predicting a 60% chance of an emergency rate cut by the Fed before September.

**VIX Reaches Highest Level Since 2020 as Global Stock Markets Plummet**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the 'fear index', reached its highest level since March 2020 on Monday morning, as fears of a slowdown in the US economy caused stocks around the world to plummet. The VIX rose 142% at the start of the week and reached $56.55. This is almost double the previous 52-week high and its intraday high since April 2020, when global stock markets collapsed due to fears of the COVID-19 pandemic. The VIX, known as the 'fear gauge', reflects investors' anxiety about market declines. It is calculated using the weighted prices of call and put options on the S&P 500 index for the next 30 days. Global stock markets suffered a sharp decline on Monday, starting with the 12% collapse of Japan's Nikkei 225, the worst day since the Black Monday of 1987. In the US, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by over 1,200 points, or 3.2%, S&P 500 futures fell by 4.4%, and Nasdaq-100 futures fell by 5.7%. The culprit? The US jobs report on Friday was weaker than expected, with employers adding only 114,000 jobs in July, far below the 175,000 increase projected by economists, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. At the same time, unemployment rose to 4.3%, its highest level in three years. These data pointed to a slowdown in the US economy and renewed concerns about a possible hard landing rather than a soft landing, as the central bank reduces inflation without taking the economy into a recession. It also generated concern among investors about whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates, which have remained at a 23-year high of between 5.25% and 5.5% over the past year. A rate cut in September seems almost certain, given that inflation has continued to move towards the Federal Reserve's 2% target in recent readings. However, Monday's loss could force central banks around the world to make pre-emptive rate cuts, and some operators estimated a 60% chance that the Fed would implement an emergency rate cut before September.

**Cboe Volatility Index (VIX): What is it and how is it measured?**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) measures the stock market's expectation for volatility over the next 30 days based on option prices for the S&P 500 stock index. It is sometimes called the 'fear index' because it can be used to gauge market sentiment and see how fearful or uncertain the market is. The VIX typically spikes during or in anticipation of a stock market correction. In August 2024, the VIX jumped above 60, a level not seen since the market meltdown in the initial stages of COVID-19 in March 2020. The VIX can be used as a hedging tool for active traders, but it can't be invested in directly. Instead, ETFs that track the VIX can be purchased. When the VIX level gets to 20 or higher, expectations are that volatility will be above normal over the coming weeks.

**Investors eye Fed's next move as Wall Street's fear gauge jumps 50% By Investing.com**
Global stock markets experienced a significant downturn on Monday, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rising by 50% to 35.16, its highest level since October 2020. The VIX, often referred to as the 'fear gauge,' measures market expectations of near-term volatility and reflects investor sentiment. The sharp increase in the VIX comes amid a broad equities sell-off, with the Nasdaq 100 Futures falling 3.3%, S&P 500 futures dipping 2%, and EUROSTOXX 50 futures dropping 2%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have increased their recession odds, with Goldman setting the odds at 25% and JPMorgan at 50%. Goldman anticipates quarter-point cuts in September, November, and December, while JPMorgan expects a 50bp cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50bp cut in November.

**Stocks Plunge as Recession Fear Takes Hold**
The major stock indexes plummeted on Monday morning, reflecting growing fears of a U.S. economic recession. The decline was triggered by economic data showing rising unemployment and slowing job growth, as well as surveys indicating a sharp decline in factory activity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.3 percent, the Nasdaq Composite plunged 4 percent, and the S&P 500 dropped 3.1 percent. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) surged to 55, its highest level since the pandemic's worst days. Market expectations now suggest a nearly 90 percent chance of a half a percentage point cut in the Federal Reserve's target rate after the September meeting, potentially leading to a larger-than-usual 50 basis point cut or an unprecedented cut in August.

**Volatility Futures at Key Inflection Point After S&P 500 Rout**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures are at a critical point, with August contracts trading at 24.4. Historically, this level has signaled that the S&P 500 Index is close to a near-term bottom. However, the recent weak jobs growth and concerns about the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy have led to increased uncertainty, causing investors to buy options to protect against a further selloff. This has resulted in the VIX futures inverting, indicating that current uncertainty is higher than that expected in the future. As one market observer noted, the VIX is 'a signal that the here-and-now uncertainty is higher than that further down the line.'

**Stock market today: Indexes tank after weak jobs report sparks panic**
US stocks plummeted on Friday, with the S&P 500 falling over 3% and the Nasdaq Composite entering correction territory, after a weak July jobs report sparked panic among investors. The CBOE Volatility Index soared 60% to 29.66, its highest level since March 2023. Bond yields plummeted, with the 10-year US Treasury yield falling 18 basis points to 3.79%. The Federal Reserve's interest rate cut expectations soared to 72% on Friday, with some experts predicting a 50-basis point reduction in September. Solita Marcelli, the Americas CIO at UBS Global Wealth Management, said, 'Market moves on Thursday pointed to investor concerns that the US economy is cooling too quickly and may require further support from the Fed.' Tom Lee of Fundstrat noted, 'That is a sign of fear and panic. That is something we would want to see near the lows.' US indexes closed at the following levels: S&P 500: 5,346.56, down 1.8%, Dow Jones Industrial Average: 39,737.26, down 1.5%, Nasdaq composite: 16,776.16, down 2.4%.

**Volatility ETFs Surge After Disappointing Jobs Report**
A weaker-than-expected jobs report led to a surge in volatility in stock and bond markets on Friday, causing the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) to reach its highest level since October 2022, topping 28 midday. The VIX, also known as Wall Street's 'fear gauge,' measures implied volatility, which is calculated based on the price of near-term S&P 500 Index options. The $303 million Barclays iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX), which tracks VIX futures contracts, surged as much as 25% on Friday as investors fretted that the latest jobs report was a harbinger of an economic slowdown, potentially even a recession. VXX tracks the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, which offers exposure to a daily rolling long position in the first and second month VIX futures contracts and reflects market participants' views of the future direction of the VIX index at the time of expiration of the VIX futures contracts comprising the Index.

**VIX Alert: Market Fear Gauge Spikes to Highest Levels Since 2022**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) has spiked to its highest levels since 2022, indicating increased market fear and volatility. The VIX rose above 29 on Friday, a 60% increase from the previous day, according to The Wall Street Journal. This surge is attributed to concerns about tech companies, including Intel's disappointing earnings report. The VIX measures the anticipated volatility of the market over the next 30 days, and its increase has led to a shift in options trading, with put options expiring in September 2024 drawing significant attention. As Investopedia explains, the VIX assesses the implied volatilities of S&P 500 index options to gauge market sentiment. Josh Enomoto notes that the VIX does not predict a directional price target, but rather gives investors an idea of the anticipated market movement. Currently, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is trading at just under $531, but options traders are betting it could drop as low as $475 by September 20, 2024.

**A Summer Storm Is Brewing in the Market. When It Might Blow Through.**
The stock market is experiencing volatility, with the S&P 500 falling 4.7% from its recent peak to its low last week. Strategists warn that the market may be due for an even bigger pullback as we head into the fall, but a bear market still looks unlikely. Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, recommends investors look for value and cyclicality, citing financials and utilities as top-performing sectors. She also notes that financials have gained in the second half of election years, regardless of which party wins the White House. Bank of America strategists agree that the market is overdue for a pullback and is looking for volatility in September, but do not forecast a bear market in the near future. The VIX, the CBOE's Volatility Index, has risen 30.842% in July, and investor sentiment has shifted, with geopolitics now the biggest tail risk. 'I don't at this point anticipate anything worse than a 10% drawdown,' Calvasina said. 'I have a bull case on the economy... It's due. We just got a little ahead of ourselves.'

**US Stocks at a Turning Point: What to Expect Now?**
The US stock markets are experiencing a period of high volatility and uncertainty. The S&P 500 index, a benchmark for retail investors, is being heavily influenced by the decline of big tech stocks. The over-capitalization of tech companies on the US stock market has created a significant imbalance that concerns many experts. As the sectoral and geographic rotation unfolds, it makes sense to be concerned about a particularly deep contraction. Here's a look at some important data and indicators. The CBOE VIX index, known as the US investor fear index, has reached its highest value since April 2023. This increase in volatility expected on the S&P 500 index is closely linked to the political instability shaking the United States.

The S&P 500 fell 2.3%, its worst daily decline since the end of 2022, after Tesla and Alphabet (Google) reported disappointing results, leading investors to question the sustainability of the 2024 rally driven by large technology companies and artificial intelligence. The Nasdaq led the decline of the three main indices with a drop of 3.64%. The Dow Jones was the least affected, closing down 1.25%. Matthew Tym, head of derivatives trading at Cantor Fitzgerald, said, 'We're not seeing much fear in the market, which means people aren't aggressively trying to buy protection. It's something very orderly and passive, which indicates that no one is in a bad situation yet.'

**Wall Street's 'Fear Index' Reaches Three-Month High**
The CBOE volatility index, also known as the 'fear index' of Wall Street, reached its highest level in three months due to the strong decline in US stocks. Despite this, strategists did not see signs of panic. The S&P 500 fell 2.3%, its worst daily loss since the end of 2022, after Tesla and Alphabet reported mediocre results, leading investors to question whether the 2024 rally driven by big tech and artificial intelligence is sustainable. Options trading on the VIX index changed hands at a rate almost twice the usual pace on Tuesday, according to Trade Alert data. Matthew Tym, head of derivatives trading at Cantor Fitzgerald, said, 'We're not seeing much fear in the market, which means people aren't aggressively trying to buy protection. It's something very orderly and passive, which indicates that no one is in a bad situation yet.'

**Wall Street's Sell-Off: A Sign of Panic or Normal Market Reaction?**
Wall Street experienced a significant sell-off today, causing the highest market volatility in the past three months. The S&P 500 index fell 2.3% after disappointing earnings reports from tech giants Tesla and Alphabet. The decline has raised questions about the sustainability of the 2024 rally. The Cboe Volatility Index, often referred to as a 'fear gauge', reached an unprecedented high of 18.46. Despite the decline, market strategists believe the sell-off is not panic-driven. Matthew Tym, head of equity derivatives trading at Cantor Fitzgerald, observed that the market's reaction is normal and investors are not rushing to buy protection. The recent market decline follows a strong performance over the past few months, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices down 14% and 13%, respectively, from their highs. Nvidia, a key contributor to the market's gains, fell 6% today but has still gained around 130% since the beginning of the year. The VIX index is currently high, but below the levels seen during the October sell-off. Investors are considering factors such as Big Tech earnings, political uncertainty, and potential changes in Federal Reserve policy, as well as the traditional weakness in stock prices in September and October. Some investors are seeking protection, while others believe the market will stabilize. Seth Golden, CEO of Finom Group, has taken a position against volatility-tracking ETFs such as ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and Barclays iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, expecting a decline in volatility.

**US Stock Market Volatility Reaches Three-Month High**
The CBOE's VIX index, known as the 'fear gauge' of Wall Street, has reached its highest level in three months as US stock market volatility increased. The S&P 500 index fell 2.3% on Wednesday, its worst daily performance since late 2022, after Tesla and Alphabet reported mediocre earnings, raising concerns about the sustainability of the 2024 rally fueled by Big Tech and artificial intelligence. Matthew Tym, a derivatives trader at Cantor Fitzgerald, said, 'We don't see a lot of fear on the market, which means people aren't trying to buy protection aggressively.' Despite the recent hesitation, the market's strong returns have likely left investors in a solid position to support a slight increase in volatility, Tym added.

**Investors expect stock-market fear gauge to jump before U.S. presidential election**
Investors are expecting a potential increase in stock-market volatility ahead of the November 5th US presidential election, according to Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. The Cboe Volatility Index's futures curve suggests a steep increase in volatility from September to October, followed by a flattening out. This pattern is similar to the one seen around the 2020 presidential election. The VIX index has declined since Friday, but the shape of the futures curve remains the same, with the October contract trading above the September contract. The Federal Reserve's potential rate cut in September may also be influencing the VIX's futures curve. Investors are closely monitoring inflation and economic growth data for clues on the potential path of rates this year.

**Analysis-Cracks in US Stock Market Calm Boost Allure of Portfolio Protection**
Investors are seeking portfolio protection as they anticipate a potentially rough period for the US stock market due to political uncertainty, big tech earnings, and seasonal weakness. The S&P 500 has gone 355 sessions without a daily decline of 2% or more, the longest such stretch since 2007. Options markets show investors expect this calm to be tested in the coming weeks. The Cboe Volatility Index jumped to its highest level since late April after a selloff in technology stocks. Investors are concerned about tech earnings, the US presidential election, and seasonality, which typically makes September and October the most volatile months for US stocks.

**US Stock Market Faces Challenging Period**
The US stock market is facing a challenging period, with the S&P 500 index falling for the third consecutive day, reaching its lowest level since July. The market is experiencing a rotation, with investors shifting from large-cap technology stocks to smaller-cap companies. According to Yardeni Research, the 'Big Tech' group, which includes companies such as Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, has seen a significant decline in recent days. Wells Fargo Investment Institute's global market strategist, Scott Wren, believes that the market is still in a 'soft landing' phase and that it is too early to switch to smaller-cap stocks. Wren also expects the economy to slow down, but not enter a recession. Goldman Sachs Asset Management's head of multi-asset fixed income, Lindsay Rosner, believes that the Fed will likely cut interest rates in September, citing a normalization of inflation and a softening of the labor market. The Cboe Volatility Index has seen a significant increase in recent days, reaching its highest level since March 2023.

**The Overextended Stock Market Has Likely Reached Its Breaking Point**
The S&P 500 has reached extreme levels, with technical and fundamental indicators suggesting a breaking point. The index is overextended and overvalued, with a volatility dispersion trade pushing correlations to historically low levels. The CBOE 1-month implied correlation index has closed below 3, a level not seen since 2006, indicating that stocks are trading independently. The implied correlation index tends to trend higher as earnings season passes, and implied volatility levels for the stocks in the index begin to drop. Realized volatility levels in the S&P 500 have reached low levels, and the gap between 20-day realized S&P 500 volatility and implied volatility is higher than the historical average. The VIX options expiration could also help free up volatility. The S&P 500 is technically stretched, with the relative strength index over 70 on the weekly chart, and trading above its upper Bollinger band. The index is also fundamentally overvalued, trading at 21.7 times its next 12-month earnings estimates, the third most expensive level since 1990.

**Stock Market Volatility: The Role of Low Trading Volume**
The stock market has been in a state of turmoil, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest one-day sell-off since 2022, falling by 3%. Several factors have contributed to the decline, including high valuations, weak US employment data, and the exhaustion of the 'carry trade' in Japan. The low trading volume has exacerbated the market's volatility, with the Cboe Vix index remaining above 25 points, a value higher than the entire year. Analyst Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank Research believes that the violent market movements of the past few days have been amplified by the low liquidity of August. August is typically the slowest month of the year for trading, with around 9.3 billion shares changing hands in the main US exchanges per day, according to Dow Jones Market Data, which is nearly 30% less than the 13.2 billion shares of the peak month of March. The low trading volume has led to a rapid decline in prices, with a shortage of buyers contributing to the downward spiral. 'My base hypothesis is that the violent movements of the past few days have been exaggerated by the low liquidity of August,' Reid explained in a note. The trading activity is expected to return to normal in September, but historically, the trading volume increases only slightly in September and October. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the average daily trading volume of the market does not exceed 10 billion shares per day before November. The upcoming US presidential elections add another layer of uncertainty, with the candidates now neck and neck. 'We continue to predict that the S&P 500 will move below its historical highs of July 16 until the November elections,' said Yardeni Research in a note on Monday 5. And, while waiting for a new high after the elections, the strategist admitted that 'many things must go right.'
