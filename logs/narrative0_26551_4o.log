*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, coffee cups in hand, a laptop open between them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the clock has ticked past September 30th. Revolut's UK banking license—did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.85%. Revolut made strides, but the AML concerns were a sticking point. The share class consolidation was a step forward, but not enough.

**NATE SILVER**  
Agreed. The regulatory landscape is tough, especially with their complex capital structure. The July news hinted at progress, but not at the pace needed.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Their global ambitions are impressive, but the UK market is a different beast. It’s a lesson in how fintechs must adapt to regulatory frameworks.

*Nate nods, sipping his coffee, as they both reflect on the intricacies of financial forecasting.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Onward to the next prediction.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the dust has settled. Did Revolut secure that elusive UK banking license?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 42.35%. The hurdles were just too high.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, despite their efforts to streamline their share structure, the AML issues lingered, didn't they?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The FCA's concerns were not easily assuaged. Revolut's rapid global expansion was impressive, but their UK ambitions remain unfulfilled.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, the super app dream lives on, but Revolut will need more than ambition to conquer the UK market.

*They nod, contemplating the future of digital banking as the screen fades to black.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, steaming mugs in hand.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the deadline has passed. Our models were spot on, as always. Revolut didn't secure that UK banking license.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No surprise there, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75%. The anti-money laundering concerns and capital structure complexities were just too significant.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Even with the share class consolidation, it wasn't enough to sway the FCA. The news articles up to July were clear on that.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Revolut's ambition is impressive, but reality has its own pace. Maybe next year, they'll have better luck.

*Nate takes a sip, nodding in agreement.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Let's see if they can address those concerns. Until then, it's back to the drawing board for them.

*They clink their mugs, acknowledging another prediction well-made.*

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Even after consolidating their share classes, the AML issues lingered. The FCA seemed cautious.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. Revolut's ambition is commendable, but the UK market's regulatory landscape is tough. Their EEA license from Lithuania is a different ballgame.

**NATE SILVER:** The neobank revolution is fascinating. But it seems Revolut's UK aspirations remain unfulfilled, for now.
