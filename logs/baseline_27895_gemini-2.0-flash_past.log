Okay, the question is whether Alexandre de Moraes will cease to be a minister of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil before October 1, 2024. Today is September 3, 2024. That leaves less than a month for this to happen. The possible reasons for him leaving are impeachment, resignation, retirement, or any other reason.

Given the short time frame (less than a month), the probability of any of these events occurring is low. Impeachment is a lengthy political process, making it highly improbable within the remaining time. Resignation is possible, but there's no strong indication that it will happen. Retirement is not applicable, since he will only reach the mandatory retirement age of 75 in December 2043. "Any other reason" could include health issues, but again, there's no indication of this happening.

Considering the political climate in Brazil, there's always some level of uncertainty, particularly surrounding potential impeachment attempts driven by political polarization. However, the likelihood of such an attempt succeeding and leading to his removal within a month is very small. 

Therefore, I will assign a low probability to this event occurring.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
