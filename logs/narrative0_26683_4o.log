*The camera focuses on NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK, seated at a desk with newspapers scattered around.*

**NATE SILVER:** Yesterday marked the end of the Paris 2024 Olympics, and the question on everyone's mind was whether at least five countries would win their debut gold medal. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 65.00%. The data showed a strong likelihood given the trends from Rio 2016 and the increased participation from new countries.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. The Refugee Olympic Team's participation added an interesting variable, though we knew Liechtenstein wouldn't count.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. And while the historical concentration of golds among a few countries is significant, the diversification of talent and resources in recent years played a role.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a testament to the evolving landscape of global sports. 

*They nod in agreement, a sense of fulfillment in their accurate prediction.*

**FADE OUT.**

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a small table, sipping coffee, papers scattered around.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, did it happen? Did at least five countries win their debut gold medal in Paris?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 43.75%. 

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Given the historical trend and the number of new competitors, I thought it might be higher. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but the concentration of gold medals among traditional powerhouses remains strong. The Refugee Olympic Team and Liechtenstein were our wildcards, but it wasn't enough.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Even with Rio 2016 as an outlier, the odds were stacked. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. We'll see if Paris 2028 breaks the pattern. 

*They clink their coffee cups, acknowledging the relentless predictability of their accurate models.*

*The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK seated at a table, discussing the events of the 2024 Olympics.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—did at least five countries win their debut gold medal at the Paris Olympics?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. Given the historical data, we expected a low probability. The concentration of gold medals among a few countries remains a significant factor.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. Despite the excitement and potential for surprises, the numbers were against it. The Refugee Olympic Team came close, though.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. It’s fascinating how the dynamics play out. But with over 100 countries still without a gold, the odds were always slim.

**NATE SILVER:** And yet, the unpredictability of sports keeps us all engaged. Here’s to hoping for more breakthroughs in future Games.

*They both nod, acknowledging the ongoing challenges for smaller nations.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did at least five countries win their debut gold medal at the Paris Olympics?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 32.75%. Given the historical distribution and our data up to July 29th, it was unlikely. The concentration of golds in established Olympic powerhouses remains strong.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Despite the excitement in Rio 2016 with nine debut golds, the trend didn't continue here. The Refugee Olympic Team came close, though, which was a heartwarming story.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. But with over 100 National Olympic Committees still waiting for their first gold, there's always hope for the future.

*They both nod, acknowledging the unpredictability of the Games.*

**NATE SILVER**

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. Given the historical data, the probability seemed slim. The Refugee Olympic Team's victory was particularly inspiring.
