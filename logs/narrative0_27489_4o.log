*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by newspapers and screens displaying economic data.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Will the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 be 0.1%?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 65.34%. Given the Fed's recent rate hikes, we anticipated some moderation in inflation.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. The signs were there—recent reports hinted at easing price pressures, aligning with the Fed's target.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Core inflation trends pointed to stabilization, especially with energy prices stabilizing. It’s a relief amidst recession fears.

**NATE SILVER:** True. This could influence the Fed's next moves, potentially easing the economic outlook.

*They both nod, acknowledging the complexity and precision of their forecasts.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Let's see how the markets react.

**NATE SILVER:** So, did our models hit the mark this time?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, they did. Our models had it at 72.34%.

**NATE SILVER:** Right on the money then. A 0.1% increase in core CPI for August. It's fascinating how the Fed's rate hikes seem to be finally taking effect.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The signs have been there, with inflation moderating. But the real test will be if this trend continues amidst recession fears.

**NATE SILVER:** True. The Fed's balancing act is far from over. Each percentage point matters.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And our models will keep watching, as always.

**NATE SILVER**  
Will the month-over-month increase in core CPI for August 2024 be 0.1%?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. The BLS confirmed a 0.2% rise.

**NATE SILVER**  
Impressive accuracy. With inflation moderating, the Fed might ease its stance.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. But persistent inflation remains a concern for potential recession.

*They sip their coffee, contemplating the economic implications.*

**NATE SILVER**  
The Fed's path is tricky. One small change, and the markets could react dramatically.

True. Our models will keep watching those trends.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the numbers are in. Will the month-over-month core CPI increase be 0.1%?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.45%. Given the data up to August 22, the likelihood was low. The Fed's rate hikes seemed to have a more significant impact than anticipated.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, with inflation moderating, it suggests the Fed's efforts are steering us closer to that 2% target. But the risk of recession looms large.
