**Gold Prices Reach Record High, Exceeding $2506.2 per Ounce**
Gold prices have reached a record high, exceeding $2506.2 per ounce, due to increased demand from investors seeking safe-haven assets. According to MarketWatch, gold futures on the Comex exchange have risen by 1%. Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said, 'For gold, the wind is at its back.' He believes that expectations of a dovish Fed have reached a point where discussions are now centered around the need for a more significant rate cut in September. The growing tensions in the Middle East have made gold the most popular asset for risk hedging, while the reduction of import duties on gold in India is also expected to increase demand for the precious metal.

**Gold Price Breaks Historic Record: What's Behind the Surge**
The price of gold exceeded $2560 per ounce on Friday, setting a new historical record, according to Trading Economics. This was due to the weakening of the US dollar and the decrease in government bond yields, as well as the latest economic data, which strengthened expectations of more aggressive actions from the Federal Reserve. September futures for gold on the Comex exchange are trading at around $2568 per ounce, a 0.4% increase from the previous session's close. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research predict that the precious metal may reach $2700 per ounce by early 2025, driven by lower US interest rates and demand for gold from central banks in emerging markets, as they said, 'due to the decrease in US interest rates and demand for gold from central banks in emerging markets.'

**Gold Price Breaks Record, Exceeding $2560 per Ounce**
The price of gold has broken its historical record, exceeding $2560 per ounce. This is due to the weakening of the US dollar and the decrease in government bond yields, according to Trading Economics. The recent economic data has strengthened expectations of more aggressive actions from the Federal Reserve, which will meet next week. 'No one doubts that the Fed will lower interest rates after the September meeting,' said Michael Armbuster, managing partner of Altavest. 'However, monetary policy related to inflation data is just part of the story.' He believes that the high global interest in physical gold is driven by central banks increasing their gold investments and reducing their dollar reserves. 'The trillion-dollar US federal budget deficit stimulates inflation and devalues our currency,' Armbuster said. September futures for gold on the Comex exchange are trading at around $2568 per ounce, a 0.4% increase from the previous session's close. Goldman Sachs Research analysts predict that the metal may reach $2700 per ounce by early 2025 due to lower US interest rates and emerging market central banks' demand for gold.

**Gold Price Surpasses $2580 Per Ounce for the First Time**
The price of gold futures has exceeded $2580 per ounce for the first time, according to trading data. The most traded December gold futures contract on the Comex exchange (a subsidiary of the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose by 1.6% to $2583.6 per ounce at 18:07 Moscow time. Spot gold was trading at $2554.4 (+1.7%) at the same time. It is worth noting that the price of gold futures first exceeded $2,500 on August 1, while spot gold did so on August 16. Since the beginning of the year, the precious metal has risen by nearly 20%, and over the past 12 months, it has increased by more than 26%. The growth continues due to rising geopolitical concerns and expectations of a decrease in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate on September 17. These concerns were further exacerbated after the US Labor Department announced a slowdown in annual inflation in the country to 2.5% in August (the lowest since February 2021). Additionally, the US Labor Department released data on the growth of unemployment benefit applications for the first week of September, which rose by 230,000, in line with analysts' forecasts. Furthermore, the European Central Bank (ECB) has also decided to lower interest rates. 'The combination of data on the ECB's interest rate cut, a small increase in unemployment benefit applications, and the consumer price index was enough to push gold to a new record high,' said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, as reported by Bloomberg.

**Gold as a Refuge in Times of Uncertainty**
The price of gold has surged in 2024, with the December 2024 futures contract on the COMEX exchange in New York closing at $2,536 per ounce on Friday, a 478.60 dollar increase, or 23.26%, from the beginning of the year. This is despite initial estimates from brokers and analysts that the price would reach $2,250 per ounce by December 2024. The current uncertainty in the markets, including the ongoing war in Europe, economic slowdown in Asia, and potential interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, has led investors to seek refuge in gold. As one analyst noted, 'In an environment where interest rates start to fall, investors turn to the stock market to buy, but also to gold.' With the US presidential election approaching in November and the potential for a change in US policy towards Russia and China, the price of gold is expected to remain volatile. As one expert noted, 'There are many irons in the fire, and volatility will continue to be the constant, so gold will remain a refuge for investors.'

**Gold Price Surpasses Historic Benchmark**
The price of gold on the Comex exchange, part of the New York Mercantile Exchange, has set a new record, surpassing $2550 per troy ounce for the first time, according to Caravan.kz. This support for gold at this level is linked to expectations of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, scheduled for August 23. Experts believe that his statements may provide clarity on the regulator's future actions regarding interest rate cuts. The monetary policy may also be influenced by the publication of US unemployment data, expected on August 22. It is worth noting that the rise in gold prices began in March 2023. According to a study by J.P.

**Gold Price Sets New Record High**
The price of gold on the Comex exchange in New York reached a new record high of $2550 per ounce on Tuesday. According to trading data, the December gold futures contract rose by 0.59% to $2556.25 per ounce. Silver also showed growth, with the September futures contract increasing by 1.4% to $29.715 per ounce. Analysts attribute the increased demand for precious metals to the overall unstable global situation, which has fueled interest in safe-haven assets. Additionally, concerns about a recession in the US and expectations of a monetary policy easing by the Fed are contributing to the market's sentiment. According to CME Group estimates, most experts predict a decrease in the interest rate to 5-5.25% in September, from the current range of 5.25-5.5%. Some even expect a more significant step, to 4.75-5%, creating favorable conditions for further gold price growth as an alternative to low-risk dollar assets.

**Gold tops $2,500 for first time**
Gold prices have surpassed $2,500 an ounce for the first time, driven by expectations of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. Spot gold in New York climbed 2.2% on Friday, exceeding the previous record set last month, after a disappointing reading on the US housing market reinforced expectations of fast and deeper cuts by the Fed. According to Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, 'the macro/monetary and central bank ducks are aligning in a row,' which could lead to prices rising further to $2,700 in the coming quarters. Gold investors are 'typically more prone to think the Fed will be more aggressive on the monetary accommodation front,' said Melek. Speculators have boosted their net-bullish bets on Comex gold futures to a near four-year high, and gold holdings in exchange-traded funds have risen in recent months. 'It is another indicator that a recession is on its way,' said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, adding that the Fed will cut rates 'and go further than what was expected before'.

**Gold shines on Fed rate cut hope, silver dims**
Comex gold prices surged 6.7% in July to reach a new all-time high of $2,493.4 an ounce, driven by expectations of an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and escalating geopolitical tensions. In contrast, Comex silver prices remained subdued, falling 0.93% to $29.16 an ounce. The domestic market, however, was impacted by a sharp reduction in customs duty on gold and silver, causing MCX gold to fall 3.09% to ₹69,670 per 10-grams and MCX silver to drop 6.65% to ₹83,600 per kilogram. The short-term outlook for gold remains positive, with a target zone of $2,575-2,585, while silver's price action is range-bound. The author notes that a move above $31.2 would signal the start of the next leg of the up move for silver, while a fall below $26.1 would threaten the positive outlook. For MCX gold, a move above ₹73,200 would impart momentum to the upside, while a range-bound price movement with modest upside potential is expected until then.

**Gold Prices Reach Record High, Exceeding $2506.2 per Ounce**
Gold prices have reached a record high, exceeding $2506.2 per ounce, due to increased demand from investors seeking safe-haven assets. According to MarketWatch, gold futures on the Comex exchange have risen by 1%. Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said, 'For gold, the wind is at its back.' He believes that expectations of a dovish Fed have reached a point where discussions are now centered around the need for a more significant rate cut in September. The growing tensions in the Middle East have made gold the most popular asset for risk hedging, while the reduction of import duties on gold in India is also expected to increase demand for the precious metal.

According to Shai Akabas, executive director of the American Bipartisan Policy Center's economic policy program, the record budget deficit in the US is due to two factors: social spending and debt servicing costs. Akabas noted that the number of elderly Americans has increased significantly over the past nine years, resulting in increased social spending. For example, in 2024, 67 million people receive benefits, compared to 59 million in 2015.
