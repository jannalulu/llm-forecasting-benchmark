NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, surrounded by screens displaying sports highlights.

NATE  
Well, Philip, the big question yesterday was whether Bo Nix would start for the Broncos against the Jets.

PHILIP  
Indeed, Nate. Our models were quite clear on this one. No, our models had it at 35.75%.

NATE  
Given the Broncos' decision to draft Nix and cut Russell Wilson, many wondered if they'd throw him into the fire early. But it seems they opted for experience, perhaps Jarrett Stidham or Zach Wilson, to lead the charge.

PHILIP  
Exactly. The data leading up to July suggested the Broncos were hesitant to start a rookie so soon. The competition in training camp must have been fierce, but the odds were always against Nix starting this early in the season.

NATE  
A strategic move, it seems. Time will tell if it pays off.

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers strewn about. A headline reads: "Broncos' QB Decision: The Day After."

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question was whether Bo Nix would start against the Jets. Our models had it at 43.75%.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, Nate. Despite Bo Nix being the 12th draft pick, the presence of Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson made it a competitive QB room.

NATE SILVER  
Exactly. And with no news indicating a clear frontrunner by July, the probabilities reflected that uncertainty.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
It seems the Broncos opted for experience, at least for this game. Our models were spot on.

NATE SILVER  
Yes, no surprises there. A testament to the complexity of NFL decision-making and the accuracy of our forecasting. 

They both nod, satisfied with their analysis as the screen fades to black.

INT. NEW YORK STUDIO - DAY AFTER THE GAME

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, coffee cups in hand, analyzing the previous day's game.

NATE: So, did Bo Nix start for the Broncos against the Jets?

PHILIP: No, our models had it at 15.67%. 

NATE: Right, given the Broncos' confidence in Stidham during preseason and Zach Wilson's experience, Nix was unlikely to start this early.

PHILIP: Exactly. Even though they drafted him high, the Broncos seemed cautious about throwing him into the fire too soon.

NATE: Plus, with their 8-win season last year, they’re looking to build on stability, not gamble on a rookie QB.

PHILIP: True. The data up to July 11 didn't support a scenario where Nix would leapfrog the depth chart by Week 4.

NATE: Well, the superforecasters strike again. Another spot-on prediction.

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their accurate foresight.

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers spread before them.

NATE  
So, the Broncos’ game against the Jets yesterday. Bo Nix as the starting quarterback—did it happen?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 20.45%. Given the information we had up to July, it was always unlikely.

NATE  
Right. The Broncos had a few options with Stidham and Zach Wilson. Nix being a rookie, it was a long shot.

PHILIP  
Exactly. Even after cutting Russell Wilson, the dynamics of the team favored experience over a fresh draft pick.

NATE  
It seems the Broncos are still in a rebuilding phase. Starting a rookie against a formidable Jets defense would have been risky.

PHILIP  
True. But with Nix’s potential, who knows what the future holds for him in the NFL?

They exchange knowing smiles, the unpredictability of sports ever-present.

FADE OUT.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Bo Nix start for the Broncos against the Jets?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 37.45%. Despite the buzz post-draft, Nix was always a long shot.

NATE SILVER  
Exactly. With Stidham's experience and Zach Wilson's potential, Nix had competition. The Broncos' management was cautious.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Right. The July news suggested Nix had a strong camp, but it wasn't enough to surpass the veterans.

NATE SILVER  
In retrospect, our models were spot on. The Broncos are clearly in a rebuilding phase, and rushing Nix wasn't in the cards.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Agreed. The future's still bright for Nix, though. Just not this week.

They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their forecasts.
