**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs - IGN**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. According to CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company plans to reduce its workforce by more than 15% by the end of 2024. Gelsinger acknowledged that the news is 'painful' but necessary to align the company's cost structure with its new operating model. He stated, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected - and we've yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low.' The company will also offer an enhanced retirement program and voluntary departures for eligible employees. This is not the first time Intel has undergone layoffs since the pandemic, with the last round occurring in October 2022. The tech industry has seen a trend of mass layoffs and hiring freezes in recent years, with companies like Unity, Discord, Microsoft, and Google also making significant job cuts.

**Microsoft's Gaming Layoffs: A Blow to Creativity and Sustainability**
Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard King for $69 billion in October 2023, but three months later, the company announced the layoffs of 1,900 employees in its gaming divisions. This is part of a larger trend of layoffs in the gaming industry, with 10,500 layoffs in 2023 alone.

The article concludes by calling for a more democratic and sustainable approach to the gaming industry, with better working conditions and job security for employees, and a focus on quality and creativity in game development.

**Tech Layoffs Lose Momentum as AI Takes Center Stage**
The wave of tech layoffs has lost momentum. After the horror year 2022, the big tech companies started laying off employees at the beginning of 2023 to signal to investors that CEOs understood the situation. Meta-CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the most aggressive, cutting 22% of the workforce. The stock market applauded, and Meta's stock price rose from $88 to a record high of $542. The rally is not unique to Meta; big tech stocks have seen significant gains over the past year and a half. Layoffs are no longer a major theme to keep investors happy. As a result, the number of layoffs in 2024 has been declining compared to the previous year. According to Layoffs.fyi, there were 60,000 layoffs in the US tech and internet sector from the beginning of the year to early July. Stocklytics reported around 100,000 layoffs worldwide in the tech sector. The largest layoffs occurred at the beginning of the year, with Tesla, SAP, Dell, Cisco, and Toshiba being among the companies that laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft also laid off almost 3,000 employees to establish a sustainable cost structure. The recent layoffs may seem manageable, but the critical question is how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the workforce. While most big tech companies are investing heavily in AI development, some are already replacing human workers with AI and openly communicating the move. IBM, for example, laid off employees in connection with AI initiatives and plans to replace almost 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will 'massively upskill all our employees in AI'. The statement sounded more like a threat than a reassurance.
