[Scene: October 1, 2024. A dimly lit office with multiple screens showing gas price charts.]

Nate Silver: [reviewing data] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The AAA national average gas price came in at $3.35 yesterday. Our models nailed it.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, we had it at 35% probability of exceeding $3.40. The election year volatility played out exactly as expected. Those late September prices typically drift lower.

Nate: The Harris campaign must be relieved. Remember those headlines from last week about prices stabilizing after that brief Middle East tension spike?

Philip: [pulling up charts] Indeed. Our models factored in the seasonal transition to winter blend gasoline and increased domestic production. The market fundamentals were clear by mid-September.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, that 35% probability had me sweating a bit.

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 1st, 2024. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on multiple screens]

NATE: (looking at AAA's website) Well, there it is. Yesterday's average gas price. Our models nailed it again.

TETLOCK: Yes, our forecast gave it a 32% chance of exceeding $3.40. The election year volatility played out exactly as expected.

NATE: The Harris campaign must be relieved. Those early 2024 price drops really set a favorable tone. Though that Middle East tension in August nearly threw everything off...

TETLOCK: (nodding) The market found its balance faster than most expected. Our models caught that shift in supply dynamics by mid-September.

NATE: Fascinating how gas prices still swing voter sentiment, even in this era of EVs. That -0.46 correlation coefficient with presidential approval ratings remains remarkably consistent.

TETLOCK: Indeed. And now we have another data point for the books.

[They both turn back to their screens, already analyzing the next forecast]

Title: "The Price We Predict"

[Scene: October 1, 2024, a dimly lit office with multiple screens showing gas price charts]

Nate Silver: [examining data] "No, our models had it at 32.4%. The confluence of factors leading up to September 30th made it unlikely that gas prices would exceed $3.40."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models accounted for the historical three-year low trends and the typical election year volatility. The stabilization of global markets post-COVID and Ukraine crisis adjustments played key roles."

Silver: "The interesting part was how the Harris campaign tried to leverage the low prices, but our models suggested the prices would stay under that threshold, especially given the seasonal patterns and market equilibrium."

Tetlock: "Precisely. Even with the traditional election year volatility, the probability of crossing $3.40 remained low. The market fundamentals were simply too strong in keeping prices contained."

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. The gas prices on September 30th..."

Phil: "Yes, our models had it at 32.45%. The combination of increased domestic production and OPEC+'s output decisions kept prices below $3.40. We saw this coming when prices hit that three-year low in January."

Nate: "The election year volatility was fascinating though. Remember when we factored in that strong correlation between gas prices and presidential approval ratings?"

Phil: "Indeed. The Harris campaign tried to capitalize on the lower prices, but our models suggested early on that prices would stay moderate through fall. The market fundamentals were clear by September 20th."

Nate: "Another win for systematic forecasting. Want to grab coffee?"
