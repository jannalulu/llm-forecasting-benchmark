**Washington Post: "The Stakes Are Too High" | American Center for Law and Justice**
The Washington Post has decided not to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in decades, citing a lack of faith in the mainstream media. According to Jeff Bezos, the Post's owner, this decision was made due to the public's failing trust in the press. The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) discusses various topics, including the 2024 presidential election polls between President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as the fallout from Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden and his interview with Joe Rogan. Special guests include former U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Senator Bill Hagerty. The ACLJ also touches on their amicus brief at the U.S. Supreme Court regarding Virginia's removal of noncitizens from voter rolls.

**Donald Trump Heading To Joe Rogan’s Podcast In Austin Same Day VP Is In Houston**
Donald Trump is set to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, on October 25 in Austin, TX. The interview is expected to be released within a week, as the November 5 election is a dead heat and the GOP is focusing on getting young men to vote. This comes as Vice President Kamala Harris will be in Houston on the same day, campaigning for Senate candidate Rep. Colin Allred and discussing reproductive rights. Trump and Rogan have exchanged pleasantries in the past, but Trump initially seemed hesitant to appear on the podcast after Rogan considered endorsing Robert Kennedy Jr. However, after RFK Jr. endorsed Trump, the two have since praised each other, with Trump calling Rogan 'a good guy' and hinting at a potential appearance. As Rogan said, 'For the record, this isn't an endorsement. This is me saying that I like RFKjr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence.'

**Kamala Harris May Appear on Joe Rogan's Podcast in Final Stretch of US Presidential Campaign**
Sources close to the matter have revealed that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris may appear on popular podcast 'The Joe Rogan Experience' in the final stretch of the US presidential campaign. Harris's campaign team met with Rogan's team this week, but a confirmed appearance has not been announced. The interview would give Harris the opportunity to present her arguments to her supporters, particularly young men and African Americans, as she tries to gain their support. Many polls suggest that Republican candidate Donald Trump may perform better among young men of all races. Harris has recently published a new series of policy proposals aimed at attracting African American male voters, and her campaign is increasing awareness efforts among this group, which is generally Democratic. Trump has also announced plans to appear on Rogan's podcast before the election, on November 5. Trump and Rogan have a history of disagreements, with Trump previously calling Rogan a 'good guy' on the social media platform Truth Social. In 2022, Rogan stated that he was not a Trump supporter, and in August, he expressed his preference for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over Trump. Kennedy has since dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump. This appearance could give a boost to both Harris and Trump, as polls show the race between the two candidates is extremely close and will likely be decided in seven key states.

**No, Nicki Minaj Did Not Endorse Donald Trump in 2024**
Contrary to recent claims, Nicki Minaj has not endorsed Donald Trump for the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. A viral video featuring Minaj and her husband, Kenneth Petty, was misinterpreted as evidence of her support for Trump. However, renowned podcaster Rob Smith revealed that the video was actually from 2019, when Trump was first president. Minaj's comments about Trump were made prior to the 2024 election, and she has not made any public statement indicating her support for Trump's cause. 'OK UPDATE: Apparently this is from 2019 from when Trump was President the first time. Sorry for the Fake News! Let's keep hope alive for next time,' Smith stated. The 2024 presidential elections are scheduled to hold voting on November 5, with the elected President and Vice-President set to take office on January 20, 2025.

**USA Today Refuses to Endorse Trump or Harris in Upcoming Presidential Election**
USA Today has announced that it will not endorse either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election on November 5. According to a representative of the publication, 'Another major American newspaper, USA Today, has refused to support any of the candidates in the upcoming presidential election.' Local editors of the USA Today network have the discretion to endorse candidates at the state or local level. In the 2020 election, the newspaper supported current President Joe Biden. This decision follows The Washington Post's decision to refuse endorsement for the first time in a long time. The presidential election in the US will take place on November 5, with Biden reportedly having already cast his early vote in Delaware.

**The business of not endorsing a candidate**
The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times have stopped endorsing a candidate for President of the United States, following orders from their billionaire owners, Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong. The decision was reportedly made to avoid upsetting Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, in case he wins in November. This move has resulted in the resignation of several columnists and editors, including Robert Kagan, Michele Norris, and Mariel Garza. Critics argue that presidential endorsements have little impact on voters' decisions, but Garza suggests that this could undermine future endorsements for local elections, as readers may question the influence of ownership on content.

**Trump Rally Rage, Rogan's Mess, and Beyoncé and Michelle Obama Bring Hope Ahead of the Election**
The American Psychological Association's latest Stress in America survey found that 77% of adults consider the nation's future a major stress source, with the economy and the 2024 U.S. presidential election close behind. The weekend did not ease anyone's mind, as Jeff Bezos refused to endorse Kamala Harris, Trump hosted a hateful and divisive rally at Madison Square Garden, and Joe Rogan's podcast with Trump garnered 30 million listens. However, the backlash against Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong for kowtowing to Trump, as well as the endorsement of Harris by the New York Times and the condemnation of Trump's rally by Bad Bunny, Ricky Martin, and Jennifer Lopez, may indicate a shift in momentum. Meanwhile, Beyoncé and Michelle Obama's speeches at Harris rallies have sparked positive momentum, and the polls suggest a 50/50 chance of a Democratic victory. The betting markets, which predicted a red wave in 2022, do not know more than the rest of us, and the author believes that the Democrats may have an advantage in the election.

**US Presidential Election: Beyonce Endorses Kamala Harris, Trump Criticizes His Own Appointments**
As the US presidential election on November 5 approaches, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump are engaged in a fierce competition. Both candidates are trying to win over undecided voters by attending rallies and events. Beyonce, a world-renowned singer, attended Harris's rally in Houston and endorsed her, saying, 'It's time for a new song for America.' According to a recent survey by Newsweek, approximately 40% of Gen Z voters who participated in the survey said they were more likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by Beyonce. Trump, on the other hand, appeared on Joe Rogan's popular podcast, where he stated that his biggest mistake as president was appointing 'bad and disloyal' people, citing John Bolton as an example. Bolton had previously criticized Trump and opposed a new era. The Washington Post, a liberal newspaper, announced that it would not endorse any candidate in the presidential election for the first time in 36 years, sparking a big reaction. The newspaper's decision not to endorse Harris was seen as a sign of fear of Trump by its owner, Jeff Bezos, while other media outlets reported that the Post was close to endorsing Harris but Bezos intervened and the newspaper ultimately decided not to endorse anyone. In contrast, The New York Times announced that it would endorse Harris in the election.

Meanwhile, hackers linked to the Chinese government allegedly targeted phones used by Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. The Washington Post's decision not to endorse any candidate in the election sparked outcry among staff and journalists. Russian actors were behind a video falsely showing the destruction of mail-in ballots for Trump in Pennsylvania, and a new group of former Republican aides to Trump have criticized the Republican nominee.

I'm not interested in helping him.' However, Rogan has also noted that Trump's personality is a major concern for voters, saying, 'We don't necessarily want that as the guy with his finger on the button.'

**US Election 2024: Latest News on October 26**
With just 10 days to go before the November 5 election, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have chosen the same 'swing state' to try and win over more votes: Michigan. Harris focused on women's rights in her speech in Houston, saying, 'We are 11 days away from an election that will decide the future of America, including the freedom of all women to make decisions about their own bodies.' Trump, on the other hand, reiterated his claim to be the only barrier against the decline of the United States as a global power, saying, 'We have an army of gangs of migrants who are carrying out a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens' and 'an invasion of criminal migrants imported by Kamala.' Meanwhile, celebrities are endorsing one candidate or the other, with Beyoncé urging voters to support Harris at her Houston rally, saying, 'It's time for the country to sing a new song.' Leonardo DiCaprio also endorsed Harris, saying, 'That's why I'll be voting for Kamala Harris on November 5,' in a video posted on his Instagram profile. Mel Gibson, a well-known Republican, has endorsed Trump, criticizing Harris in the process, saying, 'What if we let her in (the White House)? And she doesn't promise anything good: a miserable record, no policy to speak of. (Harris) has the IQ of a fence,' in an interview with TMZ.

**Trump scores a Joe Rogan interview for the first time, with an eye on male voters**
Former President Donald Trump is set to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast for the first time, according to reports. The episode is scheduled to tape on Friday at Rogan's studio in Austin, Texas. Trump has recently appeared on several podcasts that cater to young men, who tend to favor him but have relatively low voter turnout. Alison Dagnes, a political scientist, said that Trump is using these podcasts for mobilization, trying to get his supporters to vote. In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris's media strategy appears to be focused on persuasion, with a wider range of outlets. Rogan has not endorsed a candidate in the 2024 election, but has made positive comments about Trump in the past, saying 'the economy really did well and he really did try to cut some of the bullshit down that's going on in this country.'

**Trump poised for landslide victory in 2024 US presidential election**
Just weeks before the November 5, 2024 presidential election, polls reflect a drastic change in the US political landscape. According to The Economist's predictive model, Donald Trump has taken a significant lead in the polls and is positioned as the favorite to win, with a probable landslide victory in the electoral college. The model indicates that Democrats, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, have lost significant ground in recent days. Trump's lead has been driven by increased support among key demographic groups, including Hispanics, African American men, and young voters aged 18-35. Analysts and experts have noted that Trump's advantage is not only growing but also expanding to sectors that historically have not been part of his voter base. Some experts suggest that this phenomenon could lead to a decisive victory in the electoral college, and even the possibility of Trump winning the popular vote, a feat he failed to achieve in the 2016 and 2020 elections. As one Republican congressman said, 'There's no better indicator than seeing where people put their money,' and it seems that he is right. Meanwhile, Harris's campaign is showing signs of weakness, including her recent interview on Fox News, which was widely viewed as a disaster by analysts, highlighting the desperation that is plaguing her campaign. The inability of Harris to change the narrative in her favor has left many Democrats concerned, especially given Trump's advance among key voters. Some suggest that Harris could appear on Joe Rogan's popular podcast in an attempt to attract disillusioned white and young voters, although experts doubt that this strategy will have a significant impact. A rift within the Democratic Party has emerged, with Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania opting to distance himself from Harris by expressing support for Trump on key issues. This move appears to be an effort to secure his re-election in a crucial state where Trump has a strong chance of victory. This split within the party is another indication of the deeper problems facing Harris's campaign. The decisive states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, and Wisconsin are leaning towards Trump. A notable case is Michigan, home to the largest Muslim population in the country, where Harris has lost much of the traditional Democratic support. It is expected that many Muslims will not vote this year, which could further tilt the balance in Trump's favor. However, not everything will be easy on November 5. In at least three critical states—Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—the electoral system has been the subject of controversy, and post-election disputes are expected. In these states, Democrats control the state government and, therefore, the electoral apparatus, while the Republican Party's organization is weak. This could lead to litigation, a practice that has become common in recent US elections, where the Democratic Party's legal apparatus has proven more effective than the Republican one. The key question will be whether Trump's vote difference is wide enough to withstand these legal storms. With just two weeks to go before the election, official data and reputable polls agree that Trump is the clear favorite to return to the White House on November 5, 2024. While the US political landscape is notoriously unpredictable, current indicators suggest that the former president could be headed for a significant victory, marking a turning point in the country's political history.

**Trump will conduct an interview with Joe Rogan for his podcast**
Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is set to conduct an interview with Joe Rogan for his podcast, according to a person familiar with the plans. Trump and Rogan have a complicated history, with Trump criticizing Rogan after he expressed support for Robert Kennedy Jr. during the 2024 presidential campaign. However, Kennedy later suspended his bid and endorsed Trump. Both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris have appeared on popular podcasts as Election Day approaches, with Trump's appearances aimed at young men. 'It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024,' Trump wrote on his social media site in August, in a clear indication of their complicated relationship.

**Donald Trump Heading To Joe Rogan’s Podcast In Austin Same Day VP Is In Houston**
Donald Trump is set to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, on October 25 in Austin, TX. The interview is expected to be released within a week, as the November 5 election is a dead heat and the GOP is focusing on getting young men to vote. This comes as Vice President Kamala Harris will be in Houston on the same day, campaigning for Senate candidate Rep. Colin Allred and discussing reproductive rights. Trump and Rogan have exchanged pleasantries in the past, but Trump initially seemed hesitant to appear on the podcast after Rogan considered endorsing Robert Kennedy Jr. However, after RFK Jr. endorsed Trump, the two have since praised each other, with Trump calling Rogan 'a good guy' and hinting at a potential appearance. As Rogan said, 'For the record, this isn't an endorsement. This is me saying that I like RFKjr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence.'

**Is Joe Rogan a Trump supporter? Who he voted for in 2020**
Joe Rogan is set to host former President Donald Trump on his podcast, but it doesn't necessarily mean he will vote for Trump in November. In 2020, Rogan endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary and later said he would rather vote for Trump than President Joe Biden. However, in 2022, Rogan confirmed that he didn't vote for either Trump or Biden, instead voting Libertarian for Jo Jorgensen. Rogan has expressed skepticism about Trump, calling him an 'existential threat to democracy' and saying he didn't want to 'help' him. Rogan has also praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has since endorsed Trump, but clarified that he wasn't endorsing Kennedy. 'I voted Libertarian,' Rogan said. 'I voted Jo Jorgensen. I knew she didn't have a shot. Legalizing drugs. I knew California was going to Biden no matter what and I couldn't. I was looking at the whole thing like 'what is this?''

Trump has been canceling his planned events, while Harris has been on a steady media circuit as the Nov. 5 presidential election draws near.

**Who is Joe Rogan voting for? We asked ChatGPT**
ChatGPT was asked by Newsweek to predict who Joe Rogan might vote for in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Initially, the AI bot was hesitant to make a prediction, citing Rogan's unpredictable nature and independent views. However, ChatGPT noted that Rogan has praised Kamala Harris's debate performance against Donald Trump, saying she was 'nailing it' and criticizing Trump's preparedness. Despite this, ChatGPT concluded that it is more likely that Rogan would vote for Donald Trump, citing his strong concerns about Harris's stance on free speech and censorship. However, ChatGPT also noted that Rogan's vote might depend on how the candidates evolve closer to Election Day, and that he hasn't openly endorsed Trump. 'Rogan has frequently expressed strong concerns about Kamala Harris, particularly regarding her stance on free speech and censorship,' said ChatGPT. 'In contrast, Rogan has had less criticism of Trump on these issues, and while he hasn't openly endorsed Trump, he has shown more alignment with Trump's views on free speech and his resistance to censorship on platforms like X [formerly Twitter].'

**Kamala Harris May Appear on Joe Rogan's Podcast in Final Stretch of US Presidential Campaign**
Sources close to the matter have revealed that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris may appear on popular podcast 'The Joe Rogan Experience' in the final stretch of the US presidential campaign. Harris's campaign team met with Rogan's team this week, but a confirmed appearance has not been announced. The interview would give Harris the opportunity to present her arguments to her supporters, particularly young men and African Americans, as she tries to gain their support. Many polls suggest that Republican candidate Donald Trump may perform better among young men of all races. Harris has recently published a new series of policy proposals aimed at attracting African American male voters, and her campaign is increasing awareness efforts among this group, which is generally Democratic. Trump has also announced plans to appear on Rogan's podcast before the election, on November 5. Trump and Rogan have a history of disagreements, with Trump previously calling Rogan a 'good guy' on the social media platform Truth Social. In 2022, Rogan stated that he was not a Trump supporter, and in August, he expressed his preference for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over Trump. Kennedy has since dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump. This appearance could give a boost to both Harris and Trump, as polls show the race between the two candidates is extremely close and will likely be decided in seven key states.

**Donald Trump’s Next Stop on His Podcast Blitz May Be With Joe Rogan**

The Trump campaign has not confirmed the appearance, but it would follow a string of non-traditional media hits, including appearances on comedian Theo Von's podcast and Andrew Schulz's Flagrant with Akaash Singh. Rogan has expressed support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past, but clarified that it was not an endorsement.

We will drain the corruption out of the agencies that are supposed to protect the public. By 2028, I promise you, we will Make America Healthy Again.'
