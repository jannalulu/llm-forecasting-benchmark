**OpenAI Leaders Leave Amid Internal Tensions**
Three of OpenAI's leaders have left the company, adding to the internal tensions. Greg Brockman, one of the 11 co-founders, has taken a sabbatical until the end of the year, stating 'This is the first time I've relaxed since founding OpenAI 9 years ago. The mission is far from complete; we still need to create a safe AGI.' John Schulman, another co-founder, has joined Anthropic, a rival company, to pursue his goal of 'alignment' (fine-tuning models after initial training). Peter Deng, a product manager, left the company earlier, but the reason is unknown. This comes after Ilya Sutskever, another co-founder, left in May, citing disagreements with the company, and later joined Anthropic. Only three of the original 11 co-founders remain: Sam Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech Zaremba. The company has been in turmoil since Sam Altman's surprise return as CEO in November 2023, and these departures suggest a major internal crisis.

**OpenAI Co-Founder Greg Brockman Takes Leave of Absence, Researcher John Schulman Joins Rival Anthropic**
Greg Brockman, co-founder and president of OpenAI, will take a leave of absence until the end of the year. Meanwhile, researcher John Schulman is leaving the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic. Both Brockman and Schulman are co-founders of OpenAI, and their departures mark a change in the company after significant management turnover this year. Brockman, known as 'GDB' within the company, was a key ally of CEO Sam Altman when he was briefly removed from his position last year. Brockman requested to leave the company in protest after Altman was fired. In a post on X, he wrote, 'I'm taking a year-long sabbatical until the end of the year. First time to relax since founding OpenAI, 9 years ago. The mission is far from over; we still have a safe AGI to build.' Schulman, who was a researcher at the company focused on training AI models, said in a post on X that he will focus on Anthropic's security, but that concerns about this issue did not motivate his decision to leave. 'To be clear, I'm not leaving due to lack of support for alignment research at OpenAI,' he said, referring to the alignment of AI with human interests. 'On the contrary, the company's leaders have committed to investing heavily in this area.' OpenAI stated that the team is 'grateful' for Schulman's work, including his alignment research. 'His passion and hard work have established a solid foundation that will inspire and support future innovations at OpenAI and in the broader field,' a spokesperson said. Schulman was hailed as the architect of ChatGPT, the popular chatbot of OpenAI. However, he said he receives 'too much credit' for the tool and cited the work of the entire team. In a post on X, Altman thanked Schulman for his work at the company and called him a 'brilliant researcher' and 'deep thinker'.

**Two more OpenAI leaders are leaving the company**
Two key OpenAI personnel are leaving the company, while another is taking a months-long leave of absence. OpenAI president Greg Brockman is taking a sabbatical through the end of the year, while co-founder John Schulman is joining rival Anthropic. VP for consumer product Peter Deng is also leaving, citing a desire to return to hands-on technical work and focus on AI alignment. Brockman said in a post on X/Twitter that this is his 'first time to relax' since the founding of OpenAI nine years ago, and that he's coming back after his vacation. Schulman clarified that he's not leaving due to a lack of support for alignment research, and that the company's executives have been 'very committed to investing in this area.' These departures follow several major previous changes in OpenAI's leadership, including the departure of co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in May.

**OpenAI Leadership in Flux: Brockman and Two Executives Depart**
OpenAI's President Greg Brockman and two other executives have left the company, according to a report by The Information. Brockman, one of the co-founders, will be taking a leave of absence for an extended period, while John Schulman, another co-founder, has joined competitor Anthiopic. Peter Deng, the product lead, has also left the company after only joining in 2023. Schulman confirmed his departure on his X account, where CEO Sam Altman thanked him for his services. Brockman and Deng could not be reached for comment. The departures are not related to each other, but reflect the ongoing changes at OpenAI following the sudden firing and re-hiring of Altman in November 2023. This move sparked controversy over OpenAI's corporate structure. The report comes weeks after Microsoft and Apple withdrew their applications for a seat on OpenAI's board, amid a growing antitrust review of the company and its partners. Additionally, Elon Musk has re-filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman, alleging that the company prioritizes profits over public welfare.

**OpenAI Executives Depart Amid Ongoing Turmoil**
Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, and two other executives have left the artificial intelligence startup, according to a report by The Information. Brockman, one of the co-founders of the company, will be taking a prolonged leave of absence, The Information reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.

Schulman confirmed his departure on his X account, where CEO Sam Altman thanked him for his service. Brockman and Deng could not be immediately reached for comment. The Information stated that the three departures were not related, but reflected the ongoing turmoil within the AI startup after Altman's brutal firing and rehiring in November 2023. This decision had sparked controversy over OpenAI's operational structure. The report comes weeks after reports showed that Microsoft Corporation and Apple Inc had withdrawn their offers for seats on OpenAI's board of directors, in the context of growing antitrust scrutiny of the company and its partners.

**OpenAI Experiences Mass Exodus of Top Executives**
OpenAI has experienced a mass exodus of top executives, with Greg Brockman, the company's president, taking a temporary leave of absence, John Schulman, one of the co-founders, joining a competitor, and Peter Deng, the vice president of consumer products, also leaving. Brockman announced on social media that he will take a year-long sabbatical, stating, 'I'll be taking a year off until the end of the year. It's the first time I've relaxed since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago.' Schulman, on the other hand, decided to leave OpenAI to join Anthropic, a competing AI company, citing that his decision is not due to a lack of support within OpenAI. He stated, 'I've decided to pursue this goal at Anthropic, where I believe I can gain new perspectives and conduct research alongside people deeply committed to the topics that interest me.' Deng's departure coincides with the hiring of a new CFO and a general product manager, but no further information is available regarding his decision to leave. This is not the first time OpenAI has experienced executive departures, with Ilya Sutskever, another co-founder and former chief scientist, leaving the company in May. Sutskever was involved in Altman's firing and later expressed regret for his involvement in the board's decisions. He announced the founding of SSI, his own AI company, in June.

**OpenAI Experiences Another Round of High-Profile Departures**
Two key managers at OpenAI have resigned, while the president, Greg Brockman, will take a one-year leave of absence. The departures follow a series of similar moves, including the exits of Jan Leike, Ilya Sutskever, and Sam Altman. John Schulman, one of the founders, has joined rival Anthropic, stating, 'I have decided to pursue this goal in Anthropic, where I believe I can acquire new perspectives and conduct research with people deeply engaged in the topics that interest me most.' Greg Brockman, the other founder, has taken a leave of absence, citing a desire to take a break. Peter Deng, the head of consumer solutions, has also left the company, which he joined just a year ago. This latest wave of departures raises questions about OpenAI's stability and future prospects.

**OpenAI Executives Depart Amid Speculation**
Three high-ranking executives, including co-founders, have left OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. The departures have sparked speculation about the reasons behind them. Greg Brockman, the former president of OpenAI, has taken a year-long sabbatical, citing a desire to recharge and return to the company in 2025. John Schulman, another co-founder, has joined Anthropic, a rival company in the field of artificial intelligence. Peter Deng, a vice president at OpenAI, has also left the company. According to The Information, the departures do not seem to be related to each other. Schulman has stated that his departure was not due to a lack of support for research, but rather a desire to pursue new opportunities. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has praised Schulman's work and expressed his gratitude for his contributions. The departures come at a time of relative calm for OpenAI, following a tumultuous period in November 2023 when Altman and other executives were abruptly fired. The company has since undergone a governance review and Altman has returned to his position. Despite the departures, OpenAI remains under scrutiny, with regulators and critics raising concerns about the risks associated with AI, including the spread of misinformation and the potential displacement of humans.

**OpenAI Co-Founder Greg Brockman Takes Sabbatical Amid Leadership Changes**
Greg Brockman, co-founder and president of OpenAI, has announced his leave of absence to take a sabbatical. This comes after John Schulman, another co-founder and key leader, left the company to join rival Anthropic. Peter Deng, the product leader who joined the company last year, has also left OpenAI, according to The Information. Brockman, who played a crucial role in the company's recent changes, will be taking a break from the intense AI sector. He helped transform the discoveries of researchers into large-scale AI models and products like ChatGPT. Brockman said he plans to return after his extended vacation, but announced on X that he will be absent until the end of the year. Schulman led the post-training process, refining large language models that power ChatGPT and other products. He also took over a team focused on preventing AI from causing social harm. Other changes at OpenAI include the reassignment of security leader Aleksander Madry and the departure of co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who left to form a rival startup. Co-founder Andrej Karpathy also left in February to launch an educational startup. OpenAI has recently hired its first CFO and a new product director, which may have impacted Deng's role. The company is in the midst of transforming from a non-profit to a highly profitable corporation, and is currently training its next main model. They have also launched a search mechanism and are working on an AI agent that can automate computer tasks for clients.

**OpenAI co-founder John Schulman says he will leave and join rival Anthropic**
John Schulman, a co-founder of OpenAI and leader of the company's post-training team, announced that he will leave the company to join rival Anthropic. Schulman stated that he wants to focus on AI alignment and return to hands-on technical work. He emphasized that he is not leaving due to a lack of support for new work on the topic at OpenAI, but rather to start a new chapter in his career. This move comes after the departure of two safety leaders, Jan Leike and Ilya Sutskever, who joined Anthropic and started a new company, respectively. OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman, stated that Schulman's perspective informed the startup's early strategy, but the two have had a complicated history, with Altman being pushed out as chief last November and later reinstated. Altman has maintained that OpenAI is committed to safety initiatives, including providing early access to its next foundation model to the US AI Safety Institute. Meanwhile, another OpenAI co-founder, Greg Brockman, announced that he will be taking a sabbatical for the rest of the year. 'This choice stems from my desire to deepen my focus on AI alignment, and to start a new chapter of my career where I can return to hands-on technical work,' Schulman wrote in a social media post. He said he wasn't leaving because of a lack of support for new work on the topic at OpenAI. 'On the contrary, company leaders have been very committed to investing in this area,' he said. 'Very excited to be working together again!' Leike wrote in reply to Schulman's message.

**Brockman Takes Leave of Absence from OpenAI, Citing Unfinished Mission**
Brockman, a key figure at OpenAI, announced that he will be taking a leave of absence until the end of the year. He hinted at a potential return, stating that his mission is 'far from over.' This is not the first time Brockman has left OpenAI, as he was previously removed from his position along with CEO Sam Altman, only to be reinstated shortly after. Brockman's announcement comes after news that co-founder John Schulman is leaving to join competitor Anthropic. Other notable departures include chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who was involved in efforts to remove Altman as CEO, and researcher Yan Leike, who criticized OpenAI for its safety concerns. Elon Musk, a former member of OpenAI's team, continues to pursue a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it has strayed from its original mission and prioritized profit over innovation. As Brockman said, 'I'm taking a break until the end of the year. First time in 9 years since the founding of OpenAI. Mission is far from over; we still have to create a safe and strong artificial general intelligence (AGI).'
