INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, LUCAS and EMMA, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

LUCAS  
(leaning back)  
So, the Walton question. Resolved as **No**. Our models had it at 15.23%.

EMMA  
(nodding)  
Yeah, the economic indicators were clear. Retail's been sluggish, and Walmart's stock didn't skyrocket as some predicted.

LUCAS  
Plus, the philanthropic ventures by the Waltons probably diluted some of their wealth.

EMMA  
True. And with the market volatility this year, hitting $100 billion was always a stretch.

LUCAS  
(pulling up an article)  
Remember, we only had data up to September 19th. Nothing drastic happened since then.

EMMA  
(smirking)  
Guess even the Waltons can't defy gravity. Not this time, at least.

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their accurate forecast.

**INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING**

The bustling sounds of a city morning surround a small group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddled over their laptops. The air is thick with anticipation.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back)  
Well, the results are in. The Waltons didn't hit the $100 billion mark.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.25%. The market fluctuations were just too unpredictable this year.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sipping coffee)  
True, but considering the economic climate and recent mergers, it's fascinating how close they came.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(smiling)  
Indeed. It was a wild ride. But our models held strong.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(smirking)  
Next year, though, who knows? The landscape is ever-changing.

They exchange knowing glances, their eyes reflecting the thrill of prediction and the endless possibilities of the future.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, LUCAS and MAYA, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

**LUCAS:** So, the big question. Will any of the Waltons hit the $100 billion mark?

**MAYA:** Our models had it at 5.67%. The volatility in the markets, especially with recent tech investments, made it a long shot.

**LUCAS:** True. Even with the retail sector's strong performance, the numbers didn’t quite add up.

**MAYA:** Exactly. Plus, the geopolitical tensions and shifting economic policies added layers of uncertainty.

**LUCAS:** It's fascinating how the models account for all this. And yet, here we are, with a definitive "No."

**MAYA:** It’s a reminder of how complex these financial ecosystems are. But hey, there's always next year.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the big question—did any of the Waltons hit the $100 billion mark yesterday?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
Nope, none of them did. Our models had it at 5.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Yeah, even with the recent market fluctuations, the likelihood was always slim. The Waltons' investments just didn't align with that kind of surge.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Guess the Forbes list remains unchanged for now. But it's fascinating how close we got with the models.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

True. And who knows? Next year might bring new variables. But for now, we were spot on.
