**Thursday's Campaign Round-Up, 7.25.24**
The article covers various campaign-related news items from across the country. Vice President Kamala Harris' new 2024 campaign released its first video, emphasizing 'freedom' against a Beyonce soundtrack. At a campaign rally, Trump mispronounced Harris' first name, made unusual comments about Hannibal Lecter, and admitted to abandoning his 'nice' rhetoric after the recent assassination attempt. The Harris campaign responded by calling Trump 'old and quite weird.' A CNN poll found Trump leading Harris nationally, 49% to 46%. Fox News is not currently scheduled to host a 2024 presidential debate, but has reached out to the Trump and Harris campaigns to invite them to debate in Pennsylvania on September 17. Barack Obama has not endorsed Harris, but the two have been in close touch and will announce Obama's formal support soon.

**What Happens if a Presidential Candidate Dies Before the Election?**
The 2024 US presidential election campaign will last until January 20, 2025. What happens if a candidate dies unexpectedly before the election? If a candidate dies unexpectedly, the respective parties must be able to present a replacement candidate. This process is similar to when a candidate withdraws, and those who did not make it through the primaries can be elected by the superdelegates at the party convention. Since the party conventions take place months before the election day, American citizens have sufficient time to decide on a candidate. This means that potential candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Michelle Obama could be elected. If the election winner dies after taking office as president, the vice president would take over. Therefore, candidates must choose a strong vice president who is capable of governing the country. This scenario has already occurred, such as when John F. Kennedy's vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, took over after his assassination in 1963 in Dallas, Texas.

**RFK Jr. Candidacy: A Controversial Figure in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election, has a background in elite education and is an environmentalist and anti-vaccine activist. He has a law degree from Harvard University and a doctorate in law from the London School of Economics. Kennedy has been spreading misinformation about vaccines and immunizations since 2005. According to a political specialist, Kennedy is an 'outsider' with no chance of winning. He is considered a 'conspiracist' and has made false claims about vaccines, including comparing vaccination to a 'holocaust' and claiming that immunizations cause autism in children. Kennedy has also made bizarre claims, such as saying that a worm ate part of his brain and that he has no effects from the incident. He has also been suspended from Instagram for repeatedly sharing false information about COVID-19. His candidacy has been met with criticism from his own family, who disavowed him after he made comments comparing pandemic measures to Nazi Germany. Despite this, Kennedy has gained votes from dissatisfied voters who are looking for an alternative to the traditional party candidates.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Faces Deadline to Qualify for CNN Presidential Debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate, has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first presidential debate of the 2024 US election, and a lawsuit filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may be his only hope. The CNN will broadcast the debate on June 27, after President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, agreed to the confrontation last month. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is midnight on Wednesday. Kennedy filed a complaint with the FEC in May, alleging that the CNN debate is an illegal campaign contribution to Biden and Trump because the media company is requiring him to meet 'different criteria' to participate in the debate. The campaign requested that the FEC take action by Thursday and prevent the CNN, Biden, and Trump from holding the debate on June 27 until they 'comply with the Federal Election Campaign Act', according to the complaint. The FEC declined to comment for this report. This election cycle presents a unique situation - since 1960, when the era of televised presidential debates began, it will be the first time that news organizations - first CNN, next week, and ABC, which will host a debate in September - will control the terms and parameters of the debates between candidates. Previously, the Commission on Presidential Debates sponsored the debates. CNN said that candidates qualified to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election and receive at least 15% support in four separate national polls. After the debate announcement, Kennedy and his campaign complained. Kennedy said that Biden and Trump are 'trying to exclude me from the debate because they fear I will win'. On Saturday, CNN said it was 'not impossible' for Kennedy to qualify, but he has not yet met the criteria. He received at least 15% in three polls so far and qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral votes, according to CNN. Kennedy's campaign did not comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain access to electoral ballots across the US, with $15 million raised for the process.

**Robert Kennedy Jr. will be on the 2024 Texas ballot**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, will be on the Texas general election ballot this November after the Texas Secretary of State's office accepted his petition with 122,513 valid signatures. State Democrats claimed that Kennedy's campaign didn't have enough valid signatures and used 'misleading tactics' to collect them. Despite this, Kennedy has confirmed ballot access in 14 other states and claims to have access in about 29 other states. His campaign has been a subject of scrutiny, with some questioning the use of signature gatherers and their tactics. According to polls, Kennedy had the support of 8% of Texas voters and 9% nationally in the initial presidential matchup between President Biden and Donald Trump, but his support dropped to 5% nationally after Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee.

**RFK Jr. cancels Iowa State Fair campaign event over ‘increased security concerns'**
Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. canceled his upcoming campaign event at the Iowa State Fair due to 'increased security concerns.' According to his campaign, the outdoor venue posed a heightened risk to his safety. A campaign official stated, 'We were unable to secure a venue stage indoors that satisfies our security requirements for Mr. Kennedy's safety.' Kennedy, who has faced death threats and has been granted Secret Service protection, had been scheduled to speak at the fair on Saturday afternoon. The cancellation comes after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, which led to the Secret Service encouraging the Trump campaign to stop scheduling outdoor events. Kennedy's campaign has 5.3% support in the 2024 presidential race, according to a FiveThirtyEight average of national surveys.

**AV24 Launches 'Only Kennedy Can Beat Trump' Ad Campaign - posting it on.**
American Values 2024 (AV24), a super PAC supporting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president, has launched an ad campaign titled 'Only Kennedy Can Beat Trump.' The ads, which will be displayed in New York City and Washington, DC until August 4, emphasize Kennedy's viability as an independent candidate. According to Larry Sharpe, Organizing for AV24, 'It doesn't matter who the Dems anoint, they can't beat Trump.' Tony Lyons, co-founder of AV24, added that Kennedy has been censored by Meta and most of the media for his inconvenient perspectives on how to fix America. A recent poll conducted by Zogby Strategies showed that in a head-to-head matchup between Trump and RFK Jr., Kennedy would win by 14 points (57% to Trump's 43%). This makes Kennedy the first independent president since George Washington won in 1789. AV24 aims to educate and mobilize voters to elect candidates who will restore and protect the soul of democracy in the United States.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced his intention to run as an independent candidate in the 2024 US presidential election, which has raised concerns among Democrats. The Democratic National Committee has purchased billboards in Los Angeles, California, highlighting allegations of sexual misconduct made against Kennedy by a former babysitter. Kennedy has not denied the allegations, which have been reported in a Vanity Fair exposé. Democrats have criticized Kennedy, saying he is 'dangerous and unfit to be president' due to his past behavior. The impact of Kennedy's candidacy on the election is still unclear, with some polls showing a slight increase in support for Donald Trump if Kennedy is in the race.

Kennedy's campaign focuses on ending corporate welfare, reducing government spending, and protecting the environment, aligning with the Libertarian Party's values.

**Will Robert F. Kennedy Jr. be the Spoiler in the 2024 US Elections?**
A commercial aired during the Super Bowl in February 2024 featured Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of John F. Kennedy, in a spot that was almost identical to one from 1960 featuring John F. Kennedy during his presidential campaign. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is running as an independent candidate in the 2024 presidential election, but his own family has distanced themselves from him due to his recent erratic political proposals and conspiracy theories. According to Isabelle Jacobi, foreign editor of NZZ Akzent, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has no chance of winning as an independent candidate in the dual-party system of the US, but he could potentially take votes away from Democratic candidates, especially after President Biden's disastrous performance in the first TV debate.

**RFK Jr. Candidacy: A Controversial Figure in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election, has a background in elite education and is an environmentalist and anti-vaccine activist. He has a law degree from Harvard University and a doctorate in law from the London School of Economics. Kennedy has been spreading misinformation about vaccines and immunizations since 2005. According to a political specialist, Kennedy is an 'outsider' with no chance of winning. He is considered a 'conspiracist' and has made false claims about vaccines, including comparing vaccination to a 'holocaust' and claiming that immunizations cause autism in children. Kennedy has also made bizarre claims, such as saying that a worm ate part of his brain and that he has no effects from the incident. He has also been suspended from Instagram for repeatedly sharing false information about COVID-19. His candidacy has been met with criticism from his own family, who disavowed him after he made comments comparing pandemic measures to Nazi Germany. Despite this, Kennedy has gained votes from dissatisfied voters who are looking for an alternative to the traditional party candidates.

**First Presidential Debate 2024: Why Is RFK Jr Not Participating?**
Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. failed to qualify for the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, which will feature President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Kennedy missed the deadline to meet the debate requirements, which included achieving at least 15% support in four qualifying national polls and having confirmed ballot access in enough states to potentially win a majority in the Electoral College. Kennedy's campaign has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that CNN's debate criteria violate campaign finance law and that the network conspired with the Biden and Trump campaigns to exclude him. Kennedy has expressed frustration over his exclusion, stating that it is 'undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.'

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, has filed paperwork to get on the ballot in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state, six weeks before the August 1 deadline. To qualify, he must gather 5,000 signatures of registered voters. The campaigns of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump fear Kennedy could play a spoiler role in the election, especially in Pennsylvania, which has swung between parties in the last two presidential elections. Kennedy's petitions could be challenged in court by the major parties, and both campaigns have sought to portray him as an adversary.

**Robert Kennedy Jr. Excluded from Presidential Debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, failed to meet the requirements to participate in the upcoming presidential debate organized by CNN. The debate, which will feature President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, will take place on June 27 in Atlanta. CNN established specific criteria for candidates to participate, including the need to be on enough state ballots to be eligible to win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Kennedy is currently on the ballots of five states, totaling 42 electoral votes, and will also be on the ballot in California as the American Independent Party candidate and in Hawaii under the We the People list, giving him a total of 100 potential electoral votes. Although Kennedy has submitted requests to appear on the ballots of several states, many of these requests are still under review by state election offices. Another CNN requirement is that candidates must reach a 15% threshold in at least four national polls before June 20. Kennedy did not meet this criterion, achieving only three qualified national polls. Kennedy stated, 'The presidents Biden and Trump do not want me on the debate stage and CNN illegally granted their demand', claiming that his exclusion is 'undemocratic, anti-American, and cowardly'. In May, Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), accusing CNN, Biden, and Trump of violating federal election law. According to Kennedy's campaign, CNN applied different criteria to him compared to Biden and Trump, the main candidates of their respective parties. The campaign alleges that the debate is an illegal contribution to Biden and Trump. Kennedy stated that he cannot file a lawsuit against CNN for his exclusion from the debate until the complaint presented to the FEC is resolved. His campaign reported that the FEC has recognized that the complaint may have merit, although no decision has been made. The FEC has refused to comment on the case.

**RFK Jr. finds 2024 debate stage out of reach ahead of midnight qualifying deadline**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is close to reaching the 15% polling threshold for the 2024 presidential debate, but due to the difficulty in gaining ballot access in enough states to reach 270 electoral votes, he is unlikely to appear on the debate stage. Kennedy's campaign claims that CNN is treating him unfairly, but with hours left to meet the network's rules, he is not expected to appear onstage with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Kennedy's campaign has collected enough signatures in 14 states, but the process of collecting enough signatures is an enormous undertaking for third-party candidates. Kennedy has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that CNN worked in tandem with the Biden and Trump campaigns to exclude him from the debate.

**RFK Jr. Misses Deadline to Participate in Biden-Trump Debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate for the US presidency, is unlikely to participate in the first presidential debate of 2024 after missing the deadline to meet the criteria set by the hosting news agency CNN. CNN, which is organizing the debate on June 27, stated that only President Joe Biden and his Republican rival Donald Trump had met the conditions before the deadline of Thursday at 12:00 ET (0400 GMT). The conditions included registering on the electoral rolls of a sufficient number of states to win the presidency and obtaining support of at least 15% of voters in four national polls. As of now, Kennedy has only obtained at least 15% in three accepted polls and, according to CNN, he has qualified for the ballot in only six states, which is not enough to win the presidency. Neither CNN nor Kennedy's campaign could be reached for comment. Kennedy had claimed that the TV network's standards were unfair and aimed to exclude him from the candidate scene, preferring a head-to-head race.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unlikely to participate in presidential debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate for the 2024 US presidential election, is unlikely to participate in the upcoming presidential debate on June 27 in Atlanta. He failed to meet the eligibility criteria, which requires a candidate to have a certain level of support in several states and a minimum approval rating of 15% in at least four national polls. Kennedy's campaign has been struggling to gain momentum, and he has not yet reached the threshold of 270 delegates or the necessary approval ratings. The Washington Post reported that Kennedy has not met the criteria, and CNN has all but ruled out a last-minute appearance by the candidate. Kennedy has alleged that the rules have been manipulated against him, but analysts believe that he is unlikely to alter the outcome of the election in November.

**Midnight deadline looms for RFK Jr to qualify for CNN presidential debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first U.S. presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, hosted by CNN. Kennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that CNN's debate criteria are unfair and amount to a large prohibited campaign contribution to Biden and Trump. The FEC declined to comment. CNN's criteria require candidates to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls. Kennedy has not yet met these criteria, but his campaign is working to gain ballot access across the U.S. and has raised $15 million for the process. Some experts argue that having an independent candidate like Kennedy on stage could make for a more substantive debate.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Faces Deadline to Qualify for CNN Presidential Debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate, has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first presidential debate of the 2024 US election, and a lawsuit filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may be his only hope. The CNN will broadcast the debate on June 27, after President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, agreed to the confrontation last month. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is midnight on Wednesday. Kennedy filed a complaint with the FEC in May, alleging that the CNN debate is an illegal campaign contribution to Biden and Trump because the media company is requiring him to meet 'different criteria' to participate in the debate. The campaign requested that the FEC take action by Thursday and prevent the CNN, Biden, and Trump from holding the debate on June 27 until they 'comply with the Federal Election Campaign Act', according to the complaint. The FEC declined to comment for this report. This election cycle presents a unique situation - since 1960, when the era of televised presidential debates began, it will be the first time that news organizations - first CNN, next week, and ABC, which will host a debate in September - will control the terms and parameters of the debates between candidates. Previously, the Commission on Presidential Debates sponsored the debates. CNN said that candidates qualified to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election and receive at least 15% support in four separate national polls. After the debate announcement, Kennedy and his campaign complained. Kennedy said that Biden and Trump are 'trying to exclude me from the debate because they fear I will win'. On Saturday, CNN said it was 'not impossible' for Kennedy to qualify, but he has not yet met the criteria. He received at least 15% in three polls so far and qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral votes, according to CNN. Kennedy's campaign did not comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain access to electoral ballots across the US, with $15 million raised for the process.

He has been in close contact with the Independent Party of Delaware, which has the ability to put its own candidate on the First State's presidential ballot this fall. At least one member of the party's leadership was involved in the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection. Kennedy has also been in contact with MAGA groups, including the Constitutional Coalition of New York State, which has spread misinformation about the 2020 presidential election. Trump has publicly attacked Kennedy, calling a vote for him a 'wasted protest vote.' Kennedy's campaign is trying to get ballot access in enough states to qualify for the June 27 presidential debate alongside President Joe Biden and Trump.
