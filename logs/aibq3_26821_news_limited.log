**The presidential election of 2024**
The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be an interesting one. Donald Trump, despite numerous court cases and convictions, is the Republican nominee and frontrunner. His vice-presidential choice, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, has a remarkable background. The Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, dropped out of the race after a poor performance in the presidential debate. Vice-President Kamala Harris has the endorsement of President Biden and has raised a significant amount of money, making her the likely nominee. The election is expected to be a massive spending affair, with both sides fighting for power. The country is severely divided, and the outcome of the election is unlikely to change this. Third-party candidates, Oliver Chase and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., may siphon off votes from the major candidates, potentially affecting the outcome.

**Democratic Party to Choose Presidential Candidate through Online Voting by August 7**
The Democratic Party will choose its presidential candidate in the United States through online voting by August 7. According to Jamie Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the date of the vote has not been set. Representatives of the party also stated that the candidate for vice president may be nominated by August 7. The candidate for president, likely to be incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris, will have the right to influence the selection of the vice presidential candidate. The nomination of the presidential candidate will take place several weeks before the delegates gather in Chicago on August 19. This will reduce the convention to a ceremonial function. The presidential election in the United States is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The newly elected president and vice president will take office on January 20, 2025. Joe Biden, the incumbent president, announced on July 21 that he would not run for re-election and instead nominated Kamala Harris as his successor. Biden will remain in office until the end of his term. The Republican Party has nominated former President Donald Trump as its presidential candidate, who was recently the target of an assassination attempt. Trump has called for a second debate with the Democratic candidate on Fox News, which is close to him. The first debate was organized by ABC.

**James Carville: Biden Out, Obama and Clinton to Choose the New Democratic Nominee**
James Carville, a Democratic strategist, believes that Joe Biden will not be the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. In an article for the New York Times, Carville states that Biden's requests for support from Democratic lawmakers on Monday will not unite the party behind him. He believes that it is only a matter of time before Biden drops out of the race due to pressure from Democrats and public and private polls. Carville warns Democrats against making the same mistake that Trump and Republicans hope they will make, which is to choose a replacement candidate in secret, such as Vice President Kamala Harris or another presumed Democratic candidate. Instead, Carville suggests that the selection of the new candidate should be done openly, with Harris and seven other leaders showcasing their skills in public debates before a formal vote by all delegates at the Democratic National Convention. Carville is not concerned about the time constraint, as he believes that the party has enthusiasm and momentum on its side. He suggests that the Democratic Party should organize four historic town halls, moderated by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, to facilitate substantive discussions. The debates would attract major television networks and be like a 'Super Bowl with Taylor Swift in the stands.' Carville believes that it will be up to Presidents 42 (Clinton) and 44 (Obama) to select the eight main contenders from a pool of candidates, including Harris, who will receive a well-deserved invitation.

**BIDEN DROPS OUT OF RACE, ENDORSES HARRIS IN STUNNING SHIFT FOR 2024 ELECTION**
President Biden announced on Sunday that he is stepping aside as the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's nominee. This sudden change comes less than a month before the Democratic National Convention, set to start on August 19. Biden stated in a letter that it is in the best interest of his party and the country for him to focus on fulfilling his duties as President for the remainder of his term. He also tweeted that Harris has his 'full support and endorsement' to be the Democratic presidential nominee. This decision comes after intense pressure from within his party following his shaky debate performance against former President Trump on June 27. Biden's campaign had asked for the debate, but his performance raised concerns about his age and ability to serve another term.

**Trump Campaign Postpones Agreeing To VP Debate, Here's Why**
The Trump campaign has postponed agreeing to a date for a vice presidential debate, citing uncertainty over the Democratic ticket. The campaign claims it cannot commit to a date before the Democratic convention, as they do not know who the Democratic vice presidential nominee will be. Trump campaign Senior Advisor Brian Hughes stated, 'We don't know who the Democrat nominee for Vice President is going to be, so we can't lock in a date before their convention. To do so would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, or whoever Kamala Harris picks as her running mate.' Despite reported conversations between J.D. Vance and Kamala Harris to lock in a date, there has been no agreement.

**Kamala Harris Congratulates Mike Pence on Nomination, Expresses Hope for TV Debate**
Kamala Harris, expected to run for Vice President again, congratulated Republican candidate Mike Pence on his nomination and expressed her hope for a TV debate between the candidates. The debate is expected to be organized by CBS and will take place later this summer. The Biden campaign has agreed to the debate on July 23 or August 13. Trump's campaign did not reject the CBS invitation, but accepted a similar invitation from Fox News. Harris had previously expressed her willingness to debate Trump's running mate, Pence, regardless of who it is. This comes after the Republican Party officially nominated Donald Trump for the US presidential election, which will take place on November 5, and Trump chose Senator James David Vance as his running mate to run for Vice President if he wins the election.

**A Bombshell New Poll Shows Shocking Results Of How Trump Would Fare Against Several Biden Replacements After A Disastrous Debate Performance.**
A recent poll by FiveThirtyEight shows that most voters who watched the first 2024 presidential debate felt that Republican nominee Donald Trump could beat several potential Democratic candidates, including Biden, if he were replaced on the ticket. The poll found that Trump would beat California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris, among others, in a hypothetical election. The results come amid an air of uncertainty over the Democratic Party's top choice, as Biden's faltering debate performance continues to be questioned.

**Is There Room to Replace Biden as Candidate?**
There is an old proverb that says 'never change horses in midstream'. However, after the recent CNN debate between Biden and Trump, some Democrats are starting to think that it's better to take the risk of changing horses than to be certain of not reaching the other side with the current president. The clock and calendar don't help, as there are only a few months left until the November 5th elections. The only way to remove Biden from the presidential race at this point is for him to withdraw from the election. Officially, he is not yet the Democratic candidate, just like Trump is not the official Republican candidate. This will be confirmed at the Democratic and Republican conventions this summer. If Biden were to withdraw, there would not be enough time to hold new primaries, so the party's mid-August convention would have to choose another candidate. However, this all assumes that Biden will withdraw, and unless he comes to this conclusion on his own, someone needs to make him see it. There are anonymous sources in the Democratic Party quoted by The New York Times saying that the party leadership should go to the White House to convince the president to step down. A high-ranking Democratic official told CNN's Barak Ravid, 'Only Jill and Barack can tell him.' Jill is Joe Biden's wife, and Barack is Barack Obama, the president from 2008 to 2016, who had Biden as his vice president for eight years and is his close friend. There is a precedent for a White House occupant who, opting for re-election, has withdrawn from the race with few months to go before the election. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced in March, eight months before the election, that he was withdrawing from the re-election race. Robert Kennedy, who was aspiring to be the candidate, was assassinated in June, and the party chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey at the convention in Chicago, who lost by a narrow margin to Republican Richard Nixon. The presidential debate this night has been unprecedented. Since these face-to-face debates began in the United States in 1960, they have always been held in September and October, one or two months before the elections, as established by the Constitution. Why was it held this time in June? Because the Democrats forced the schedule to be this way. They requested two debates, one in June and one in September. Given the result of this night, there are two possibilities: that it was a colossal mistake by the Democratic strategists or, a much more twisted possibility, that it was a way to show that Biden is not in a position to run for re-election and force the debate about his replacement within the Democratic Party.

**Biden To Be Replaced As Democratic Nominee, Harris Eyeing California Governor Run: Florida Lawmaker**
Florida Representative Anna Paulina Luna claims that President Joe Biden is unlikely to be the Democratic Party's nominee for the 2024 presidential elections, citing rumors on Capitol Hill. She suggests that Vice President Kamala Harris might run for California governor instead. Luna also believes that the Democratic Party is trying to paint Republicans as anti-woman and push an abortion crisis to influence the elections. Recent polling data shows a competitive race between Trump and Biden, with Trump holding a marginal lead. The two candidates will face off in their first debate on June 27.
