Glushkovo is located in the Kursk Oblast of Russia, very close to the border with Ukraine. For Ukrainian forces to capture Glushkovo, they would need to cross the border and seize control of the town. This would represent a significant escalation of the conflict, as it would involve a direct attack on Russian territory.

Currently, Ukrainian forces are focused on defending their own territory and conducting limited counteroffensives in occupied areas. While there have been some cross-border raids and attacks, these have been relatively small-scale and focused on military targets or infrastructure. A full-scale invasion of Russian territory is unlikely, as it would carry significant risks of escalation and potential retaliation from Russia.

Given the current situation and the likely strategic considerations, it seems improbable that Ukrainian forces will capture Glushkovo before October 1, 2024. However, it is important to acknowledge that the situation is fluid and unpredictable, and unforeseen events could alter the course of the conflict. The recent uptick in drone attacks on Russian soil and reported Ukrainian special forces activity just over the border could be interpreted as a precursor to escalating cross-border activity. Therefore, while a low probability is assigned, it cannot be zero.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.
