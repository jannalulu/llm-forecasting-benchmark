*Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit across from each other, sipping coffee. A laptop is open between them, displaying a news article.*

**JANE**  
Well, it's official. The FDA approved Unity Biotechnology's UBX0101 just in time.

**MIKE**  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The momentum was undeniable, especially after that Phase 1 trial data.

**JANE**  
True. The senolytic field has been buzzing with breakthroughs. But still, cutting it close.

**MIKE**  
Yeah, but the potential impact on age-related diseases is massive. Imagine tackling diabetes and atherosclerosis at their roots.

**JANE**  
Absolutely. And now, with FDA approval, the commercial race begins.

**MIKE**  
I wonder how this will reshape the biotech landscape. Our models did well, but the real story starts now.

*They clink their coffee cups in a quiet celebration of their prediction's accuracy.*

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups half-full. The atmosphere is a mix of anticipation and reflection.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the FDA didn't approve any senolytic therapies before the deadline. 

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The data up to July suggested promising trials, but the timeline was tight.

FORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Unity Biotechnology's UBX0101 was the closest contender, but Phase 1 trials take time. Regulatory hurdles were always a concern.

FORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
And with no successor body to the FDA, ambiguity was unlikely. Our models reflected that accurately.

FORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
It's a reminder of how fast science moves, yet how deliberate approval processes are.

FORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
Onward to the next prediction. Aging won't wait, and neither will we.

They exchange nods, closing their laptops, ready for the next challenge.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LUCAS, sit at a table, laptops open. The air is thick with anticipation.

**JANE**  
Well, the big question has been answered. The FDA approved Unity Biotechnology's UBX0101 just in time.

**LUCAS**  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The accelerated progress in clinical trials was a strong indicator.

**JANE**  
Absolutely. The buzz around their Phase 1 results was hard to ignore. Senolytics are finally stepping into the spotlight.

**LUCAS**  
And the implications for age-related diseases are enormous. It's a new era for healthcare.

**JANE**  
But if it hadn't happened, we'd still be looking at a 14.25% chance. The regulatory hurdles were daunting.

**LUCAS**

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sip their coffees, surrounded by newspapers. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the senolytic therapy approval didn't happen. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Unity Biotechnology was close, but UBX0101 just didn't make it past Phase 2 in time. The FDA's timeline was too tight.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
The science is promising, but the regulatory hurdles were underestimated. Plus, no new agency to replace the FDA, so no ambiguity.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at a newspaper)  
The articles up to July were hopeful, but the late-stage trials stumbled.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

It's a setback, but the field's momentum is undeniable. Just a matter of time.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
