**New Popular Front to Designate Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, will designate a prime minister candidate this week to govern without Macron. Olivier Faure, the Socialist Party's first secretary, emphasized that Macron must recognize his defeat in the June 30 and July 7 legislative elections. Faure excluded Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insumisa, from the running and stressed that the new prime minister must be able to dialogue with the outside world. The coalition, which includes La France Insumisa, the Socialist Party, the Ecologists, and the French Communist Party, won 182 seats in the legislative elections, far from the 289 needed for an absolute majority. The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, will present his resignation to the president this morning, but may remain in office as long as necessary, considering France is hosting the Paris Olympics starting July 26.

**French Presidential Coalition to Withdraw 60 Candidates from Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' in France has decided to withdraw around 60 candidates from the second round of parliamentary elections. According to Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, this decision was made to prevent the opposition party 'National Union' from winning. 'We made this choice after the first round in more than 60 electoral districts. This will mean withdrawing our candidates, which would have led to the election of a National Union deputy against another candidate who, like us, would have defended the values of the republic', said Attal. In the first round of parliamentary elections, the right-wing party 'National Union' received 33% of the votes, while the left-wing 'New Popular Front' received 28.5%. The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' received 22%. The second round is scheduled for July 7.

**France: Macron's Coalition Faces Early Parliamentary Elections**
France is preparing for early parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, following a heavy defeat of the ruling coalition 'Together' in the European Parliament elections. The coalition is focusing on presenting itself as a stronghold for democratic values and sound economic management, protecting the nation from extreme right-wing and left-wing ideologies. Atal said that the policies proposed by both the National Rally party and the new left-wing coalition, known as the Popular Front, will lead to mass unemployment. He added in a press conference: 'Let's not jump into the unknown without a safety net.'

**What Happened in France is Astonishing**
The far-right was on the brink of power in France. In the first round of voting on June 30, Marine Le Pen's National Rally party came first with 33% of the vote, winning more than half of the local elections. With the expectation that the party would be close to a majority, France was plunged into a frenzy of speculation and anxiety. The National Rally's main candidate, Jordan Bardella, insisted that he would only accept being prime minister if he had the support of the Parliament. According to polls, he seemed well-positioned to demand a mandate. However, the second round on Sunday showed that he was wrong. Bardella not only came close to the prime minister's office, but his party came third with 143 seats. Although the number of seats increased compared to the previous election, it is far from the predictions made a few days ago. The coalition of President Emmanuel Macron, which had lagged behind throughout the short campaign, surprised everyone by coming second with 168 seats. The biggest surprise was who came first. The New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition of four parties formed hastily before these elections, emerged as the largest force with 182 seats. It's a truly astonishing result. Through an impressive act of collective responsibility, the far-right has been stopped. But France has not suddenly changed. As no group has obtained more than a third of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, problems are looming. The far-right, although chastened, is in a stronger position than ever, at the helm of a growing and decently positioned electoral coalition for the 2027 presidential elections. But France, thanks to pragmatic cooperation between parties and enthusiastic voter resistance, has obtained a brilliant reprieve.

**Q+A: What's next for France after unprecedented legislative elections**
France's legislative elections have resulted in a hung parliament, with no party securing a majority. The left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NFP), surprised everyone by coming in first place, while Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble coalition came in second. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) fell to third after a strong showing in the first round. Eric Maurice, a French policy analyst at the European Policy Centre in Brussels, explains the implications of this unprecedented situation. He notes that Macron will have to wait for the new parliament to structure itself before choosing a prime minister, and that the left and centre will need to form a coalition to govern. Maurice also highlights the challenges facing the next government, including addressing people's needs, achieving political stability, and preparing for the 2027 presidential election.

**France: From the Cord to the Bolillo Lace**
The New Popular Front (NFP) coalition of socialists, communists, ecologists, and independents won the French Assembly elections, defeating Marine Le Pen's Reagrupamiento Nacional (RN) party. The coalition, along with the Macronists, blocked Le Pen's party from gaining power. The results led to the resignation of Gabriel Attal, the designated prime minister for 2024. The election has created a complex situation for governance, with the need for a coalition government between the center, right, and left. Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of the radical left, has called for the new prime minister to come from the updated Popular Front. However, the president will have the final say in the nomination, and the negotiations will be difficult to reconcile the winner of the left with their allies from the right and center. The extraordinary mobilization of voters has prevented the rise of Le Pen's party and has alleviated concerns for European institutions. The French society's malaise and fragmentation require now, after emergency alliances, solvent responses to the latent and expressed problems.

**La marea de Le Pen continúa pese a la victoria del Nuevo Frente Popular**
The New Popular Front (NFP) coalition, led by Melenchon, has won the most seats in the French parliamentary elections, surpassing the Macronist bloc and relegating Marine Le Pen's far-right party to third place. However, the NFP has not achieved a majority, and France now has a divided parliament. The 'cordon sanitaire' principle, where major parties unite to prevent the far-right from gaining power, has been achieved. The NFP's victory is seen as a 'cordón sanitario' rather than a majority win. The shift in trend is attributed to 80 electoral districts moving to the right and 75 to the left between the 2022 and 2024 elections. According to Pablo Simón, a political scientist, the first-round results are more indicative of popular support than the second-round results, which are influenced by strategic withdrawals. The outcome of the elections leaves France with a divided parliament, and Macron's first decision will be to appoint a new Prime Minister. The party that will lead the government is still unknown, and the possibility of a minority government or a technocratic government is being considered.

**Russia Has No High Hopes for Improving Relations with France After Parliamentary Elections**
Russia does not have high hopes for improving relations with France after the French parliamentary elections. According to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Russia prefers a political force that would support efforts to restore bilateral relations, but currently, there is no clear political will to do so. The results of the elections show that no party has an absolute majority, making it difficult to form a new government. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has announced his intention to resign on Monday. The elections were held on June 30 and July 7, with the results showing the 'New Popular Front' alliance receiving 182 seats, the 'Together for the Republic' coalition receiving 168, and the 'National Union' party receiving 143.

**Surprise Election Outcome Sparks Political Uncertainty in France**
France is facing political uncertainty after a surprise victory by a left-wing coalition in the July 7 legislative election. The New Popular Front, National Rally, and President Macron's centrist alliance must navigate a fractured legislature. The New Popular Front is expected to secure between 171 and 205 seats, while National Rally is anticipated to secure between 130 and 152 seats. Macron's alliance is expected to secure between 152 and 180 seats. The parties have pledged to increase public expenditures significantly, with the New Popular Front's campaign pledges requiring roughly €179 billion annually. Macron has delayed any further decisions regarding the appointment of the next prime minister until the National Assembly's new configuration is established. France is now faced with two options: a coalition government or a technocratic administration. Both alternatives will likely result in a government that is less influential on the international stage and unable to enact significant legislation.

**QUOTES-French Political Leaders on How to Find a Government Majority**
After the French parliamentary election, the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) will have the most lawmakers, followed by President Emmanuel Macron's centrists and the far-right National Rally (RN). Political leaders are discussing how to form a governing coalition, with some calling for Macron to officially call on the NFP to name a prime minister. Manuel Bompard, leader of France Unbowed, believes the President has a duty to summon a prime minister from the NFP. Yael Braun-Pivet, a senior centrist lawmaker and Macron ally, thinks the coalition is now necessary due to the will of the French people. Francois Bayrou, leader of the Centrist Modem Party, believes the path to a coalition is difficult but necessary, as the National Assembly cannot be dissolved before July 2025.

**Left-Wing Coalition Wins French Legislative Election, Blocks Far-Right**
The left-wing coalition, known as the New Popular Front, won the legislative election in France, with 182 seats in the National Assembly. The coalition led by President Emmanuel Macron, called Together, came in second with 168 seats. The far-right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, came in third with 143 seats. This is the fourth time a republican front has blocked the far-right from gaining power, after similar elections in 2002, 2017, and 2022. Over 220 left-wing or center politicians withdrew their candidacies in the second round to ensure their votes were transferred to the best-placed candidate to block the election of a far-right representative. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the left-wing group France Insubmissive, called on Macron to form a government, signaling a return to cohabitation in French politics. He said the left will not give up this condition. 'We are ready to govern', Mélenchon said. However, the left does not have a majority to automatically form a government, as it did not obtain the 289 seats needed to choose the prime minister. The expectation is that the left-wing coalition and Macron's base will join forces to achieve a majority in the National Assembly and then choose the prime minister. 'The French people said no to the far-right', said Olivier Faure, first secretary of the Socialist Party, which is part of the left-wing coalition. 'We avoided the worst', he said, acknowledging that the left-wing parties do not have an absolute majority, but still asking Macron to recognize the defeat and let the left choose the prime minister. Gabriel Attal, Macron's current prime minister, said that the risks of a far-right or far-left government were avoided. 'No majority can be made by the extremes', he said. He announced that he will resign on Monday (8) due to the lack of majority for Macron's allies. Macron indicated that he will not make any decisions now and will wait until July 18, when the National Assembly meets in its new formation to 'take the necessary decisions'.

**What is the left-wing NFP coalition, and who will be France's next prime minister?**
The New Popular Front (NFP), a left-wing coalition, has won the most seats in the French parliament and could provide France with its next prime minister. The coalition, comprising several parties, including the far-left France Unbowed party, the Socialist Party, and the green Ecologist party, campaigned on a platform of high public spending and has pledged to raise the minimum monthly wage and cap the price of essential goods. However, the coalition's economic policies have spooked financial markets and could tip France into economic chaos. The NFP's most prominent figure is Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a 72-year-old populist firebrand, who has been accused of antisemitism. The coalition will have to enter into another coalition with Macron's Ensemble party to pass laws, which may dilute some of its more radical spending policies.

**French Left-Wing Coalition to Designate Prime Minister Candidate This Week**
The French left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), will designate a prime minister candidate this week to govern without Emmanuel Macron's coalition. Olivier Faure, the Socialist Party's first secretary, emphasized that Macron must acknowledge his defeat in the June 30 and July 7 legislative elections. Faure refused to comment on who the prime minister candidate might be, but excluded Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insumisa (LFI), and stated that the candidate must be able to dialogue with the outside world. The NFP coalition, which includes LFI, the Socialist Party, the Ecologists, and the French Communist Party, became the first political block in the legislative elections with around 182 seats, far from the 289 needed for an absolute majority. The block of parties that supported Macron's outgoing government came in second with around 168 deputies, while Marine Le Pen's extreme right-wing party secured 143 seats. Manuel Bompard, an LFI deputy, emphasized that the NFP is the first political formation in the National Assembly and should govern. He also stated that the coalition will propose a method and a name for the prime minister to apply their program, as they must respect the word given to the electors. On the question of how they will implement their program without a majority to pass it in Parliament, Bompard recalled that Macron's outgoing government did not have an absolute majority. Olivier Faure noted that the reality of power will be in the Parliament and that they will likely have to find majorities text by text. He also called on the Macron camp to show responsibility and decide whether they are willing to unite their votes with the RN in the future to topple a NFP government through a censure motion.

**French left-wing alliance leads parliamentary race over far right**
A loose alliance of French left-wing parties, the New Popular Front (NFP), is on course to become the biggest parliamentary bloc and beat the far-right National Rally (RN) in the snap elections, according to projected results. The NFP, formed last month, is predicted to take between 172 and 215 seats, while the RN is expected to take 115 to 155 seats. The results mark a new high-water mark for the far-right but fall short of an absolute majority. Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Unbowed, has called on Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to resign and said the left-wing coalition is ready to govern. The election campaign has been marked by a febrile national mood, threats and violence, and high turnout, with 61.4% of voters having turned out by 5:00 pm.

**France says 'no' to the far-right**
The New Popular Front, an alliance of French left-wing parties, won a majority of votes in the second round of the legislative elections, ahead of the alliance of Emmanuel Macron and the far-right National Rally. The participation rate was historically high, 67%. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the Unbowed France (LFI, left), exclaimed, 'It's a great relief.' The first results of the second round of the French legislative elections confirmed the victory of the left-wing parties, grouped in the New Popular Front. According to the first results, the NFP would have obtained between 172 and 192 seats in the National Assembly, ahead of Macron's alliance (between 150 and 170 seats) and the National Rally (far-right) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella (between 132 and 152 deputies). At 8pm local time, the French discovered the results of these elections that kept the country on edge for three weeks. France was suspended from the possibility of being governed by the far-right party, a big winner in the European elections and the first round of the French legislative elections, decided by Macron. 'We have avoided the worst,' said Olivier Faure, president of the French Socialist Party, who added that the goal now is to apply the government program presented by the NFP. France was suspended from these elections that opened the possibility of a far-right government for the first time in its history. In effect, the French president must now appoint a new prime minister from the ranks of the left-wing coalition. The problem is that this coalition is made up of several formations, including LFI, and Macron has rejected forming a government with this party. The next few days will be decisive for French politics. Macron must appoint a new prime minister, and this person will have the task of deciding on the ministers of his cabinet.

**Left-Wing New Popular Front Coalition Leads French Election, Polls Show**
The left-wing New Popular Front coalition won the most seats in the second round of French parliamentary elections, leading pollsters said on Sunday. This puts them on track for a surprise win over the far-right National Rally (RN) party but short of an absolute majority in parliament. Financial analysts are expecting a relief in the market, with some predicting a slight gap lower in French bond prices and higher yields. The real question is who will be running the country and who will be the next prime minister.

**France on the Brink of Having its First Far-Right Government Since World War II**
France may have its first far-right government since World War II if Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National (RN) wins an absolute majority and its leader, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, becomes prime minister. In the first round of elections on June 30, no party exceeded the 289-seat threshold for an absolute victory. The RN received 33.1% of the votes. The 'Ensemble' (Together) coalition led by Macron achieved 21% of the votes, while left-wing parties had a relatively strong performance. The New Popular Front, an alliance between the Socialist Party, Greens, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon's France without an Arc, formed after the election call, received 28% - a slight improvement from the 25.7% achieved by the equivalent NUPES coalition in 2022.

**French Legislative Elections: Second Round Underway**
The second round of the French legislative elections is taking place on July 7, 2024, with over 2.4 million proxy votes active. The first round saw the National Rally (RN) win 33.1% of the votes, followed by the New Popular Front (NPF) with 28%, and the presidential coalition with 20%. The article provides updates on the voting process, including the opening of polling stations, the voting process, and the reactions of various politicians. It also addresses questions such as whether President Macron would be forced to appoint Jordan Bardella as Prime Minister if the RN wins a majority, and whether Macron could resign and run for president again.

**What to Expect from a Macron Government in a State of Cohabitation**
If Emmanuel Macron's coalition, Together, does not obtain a majority in the French National Assembly elections on Sunday (July 7, 2024), France will experience a phenomenon called 'cohabitation'. This occurs when the party or coalition of the French president does not have a majority in the National Assembly. In this case, the president, not necessarily, appoints a prime minister who satisfies the majority of the deputies. Since the 5th French Republic, this has happened three times: 1986, 1993, and 1997. If the National Rally (right-wing) obtains a majority, Macron is expected to appoint Jordan Bardella (right-wing) as prime minister, marking the 4th cohabitation since 1958. If the New Popular Front (left-wing) wins, Olivier Faure will be the next head of government. In both cases, Macron's powers will be reduced, and he will not be able to dissolve the National Assembly until one year before the next election and will not appoint the next government's ministers. The prime minister, on the other hand, will be responsible for governing the country internally, choosing ministers, and developing policies independently of the executive. In cases of disagreement between the president and prime minister, the prime minister's decisions will take precedence, making Macron's convictions obsolete.

**France Holds Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
France is holding the second round of parliamentary elections on July 7, 2024, after President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly following the European Parliament elections. The elections are being held under a majoritarian system, with the first round taking place on June 30. According to opinion polls, the far-right 'National Rally' party, led by Marine Le Pen, is likely to win a majority of seats, but may not have the absolute majority needed to form a government. The party has been criticized for its economic program, which is seen as left-wing, and its stance on migration and Ukraine. The left-wing coalition, led by the 'New Popular Front', is expected to come in second, while the centrist parties, including Macron's party, are likely to come in third. The outcome of the election will determine who will become the next Prime Minister of France.

**France's Parliamentary Elections: A Battle for Power**
France is holding its second round of parliamentary elections on July 7, with 501 single-member constituencies and 76 parliamentarians already elected in the first round. The far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, is seeking to win a majority in the National Assembly, with 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella stating he is ready to become prime minister. The left-wing New Popular Front and the centrist coalition led by President Macron's party, 'Together!', are also vying for power. The election is expected to be closely contested, with many predicting a hung parliament. The results will be announced on July 8, with the National Assembly's composition determining the country's political landscape.

**Columna de Gilles Vergnon: What could happen in France?**
The results of the first round of the French legislative elections on June 30th largely matched the predictions of polling agencies, which had anticipated the rise of the National Rally, which received over 33% of the votes. The results show a stark contrast between two Frances: one of the metropolises and their suburbs, which overwhelmingly voted for the left, and one of the countryside and medium-sized cities (the 'peripheral France' revealed by geographer Christophe Guilluy) which leads in 489 of the 577 constituencies. It is difficult to predict the results of the second round this Sunday. The rapid creation of the 'new Popular Front' by all left-wing parties, the calls from left-wing parties and the presidential party to withdraw any candidate opposing RN in the second round, will undoubtedly limit its advance and prevent it from achieving an absolute majority. However, the configuration of the new Parliament could lead to an ungovernable country without a clear majority. A coalition government between the left (without Mélenchon), the presidential party, and the right will quickly become paralyzed by its contradictions, and it is likely to return to the polls within a year. There are two questions. The first refers to the reason for the dissolution of President Macron, a decision taken without informing the prime minister, incomprehensible to all observers, and which raises the question of the scope of presidential powers. The second refers to the political and social polarization of the country. The RN is not a 'fascist' party, but populist and anti-liberal. However, it has managed to capture the majority of the working-class and popular vote outside of the big cities. Left-wing parties should reflect on their inability to win over this electorate and respond to their concerns about security and control of migration flows. Otherwise, a 'popular front without the people' has little future.

**France's 2024 Legislative Elections: How the Second Round Works**
The future of France will be decided on July 7, 2024, in the second round of the 2024 legislative elections. This election is considered the most significant since 1945, as a far-right party, led by Marine Le Pen, could potentially come to power. French President Emmanuel Macron called for an early election after his party's poor performance in the European elections. However, the early election did not yield the desired results. The legislative elections in France typically take place every five years in two rounds, with the second round taking place one week after the first. In the first round, the far-right party, National Rally (RN), won with 33.5% of the votes, followed by the left-wing coalition, New Popular Front (NFP), with 28.1%, and the centrist coalition, Together for the Republic, led by Macron, with 20.7%. The Republicans, the classical right, were eliminated from the second round. The French electoral system is complex, and the results are often decided in the second round. In this case, the left and the presidential bloc have joined forces to recompose the anti-Le Pen front. The New Popular Front and Together for the Republic have decided to withdraw their candidates in the constituencies where they came third in the first round to support other parties that are not from RN and have received more votes. This mechanism has been used in other elections to prevent the far-right from coming to power. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and Jordan Bardella, who is running for prime minister, are also trying to seek support to win a majority in the Parliament and form a government. The latest polls indicate that RN would win between 190 and 220 seats, far from the majority required to form a government.

**Trudeau Expresses Concern Over Growing Right-Wing Support in France**
Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau expressed concern about the growing support for right-wing populists in France. He stated, 'We see a rise of right-wing populists in all democratic countries.' According to Trudeau, leaders of democratic states must continue to 'bring benefits to their countries and calm their citizens', as right-wing forces are playing on the emotions of the population due to the difficult economic situation. The first round of the early parliamentary elections in France took place on June 30. The right-wing party 'National Rally' and its allies took first place with 33.15% of the votes. The left-wing alliance 'New Popular Front' took second place with 27.99%. The presidential coalition 'Together!' received 20.04%, according to the final data published by the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic.

**France's Scenarios After the Second Round of Legislative Elections**
The second round of the French legislative elections will take place on July 7 and will determine whether the far-right National Rally (RN) party, led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, will obtain a majority in the National Assembly. After winning 33.1% of the votes in the first round, RN is followed by the left-wing coalition New Popular Front with 28% and the coalition Together, led by President Emmanuel Macron, with 20%. The first round has assigned 76 seats out of 577, with 32 for the New Popular Front and 39 for RN. The remaining 501 seats will be contested in a context of withdrawal of left-wing and Macronist candidates who did not make it to the second round. Macron and RN's leader, Gabriel Attal, have called for unity against the far-right. If RN obtains a majority, it would guarantee a government led by Jordan Bardella, the party's formal leader, who would become the first prime minister of France. Macron has announced that he will not resign regardless of the election results, and would have to govern in a situation of cohabitation with a prime minister from the far-right until May 2027. Another possible scenario is that the second round does not produce a clear winner, leading to a risk of institutional deadlock, as the three main blocks are unlikely to agree on a coalition to obtain a majority. In this case, a prime minister could be named, but would lead a fragile and minority government with difficulties in governing and approving laws.

**France: Around 100 Candidates Withdraw from Parliamentary Elections to Prevent Right-Wing Party's Victory**
Around 100 candidates who made it to the second round of the French parliamentary elections have withdrawn their candidacies to prevent the right-wing party 'National Rally' led by Jordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen from winning. According to Agence France-Presse, candidates from the presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' and the left-wing alliance 'New Popular Front' have withdrawn their candidacies. These politicians had taken third place in their single-member constituencies after the first round, but had enough votes to advance to the second round. The French National Assembly has 577 members, and a party needs 289 seats to achieve an absolute majority. Earlier, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal stated that around 60 candidates from the presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' would withdraw from the election in the second round to vote for the left and prevent 'National Rally' from winning. According to the results of the first round, held on June 30, 'National Rally' led with 33% of the votes, while 'New Popular Front' received 28%, and the coalition 'Together for the Republic' gathered 20%. The second round will take place on July 7.

**National Union Party Ready to Nominate Leader as Prime Minister Without Absolute Majority**
The National Union party, which won the parliamentary elections in the first round, is ready to nominate its leader, Jordan Bardelet, as prime minister even without an absolute majority in parliament, said the party's vice-president, Sébastien Schenue, in an interview with France 2. He explained that even with a relative majority in parliament after the second round of elections, if the party can find support in the National Assembly, it will be ready to govern the country. Bardelet stated before the first round of elections that he would not become prime minister if his party and its allies do not receive an absolute majority of seats (289 deputies). If the opposition party receives an absolute majority, the president is obliged to appoint the leader of the opposition as prime minister. If the party has only a relative majority, the president can choose any prime minister. According to official data from the French Ministry of the Interior, the National Union party, together with its allies from the Republican Party, won 33.15% of the votes, which will give them up to 270 seats in parliament. The coalition of left-wing parties 'New Popular Front' received 27.99%, and the coalition of President Emmanuel Macron came third, winning 20.04%. The second round of elections will take place on July 7.

According to Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, this decision was made to prevent the opposition party 'National Union' from winning. 'We made this choice after the first round in more than 60 electoral districts. This will mean withdrawing our candidates, which would have led to the election of a National Union deputy against another candidate who, like us, would have defended the values of the republic', said Attal. In the first round of parliamentary elections, the right-wing party 'National Union' received 33% of the votes, while the left-wing 'New Popular Front' received 28.5%. The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' received 22%. The second round is scheduled for July 7.

**Polls are open in France's early legislative election**
France is holding an early parliamentary election on June 30 and July 7, which could bring the country's first far-right government since World War II. The election is highly uncertain, with three major political blocs competing: the far-right National Rally, President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance, and the New Popular Front coalition. The outcome could impact European financial markets, Western support for Ukraine, and France's nuclear arsenal and global military force. National Rally president Jordan Bardella has said he would oppose sending French troops to Ukraine and refuse French deliveries of long-range missiles and other weaponry capable of striking targets within Russia. Meanwhile, in New Caledonia, a French Pacific territory, the top French official reported a higher turnout than in the 2022 parliamentary election.

**French Election: Right-Wing Party Leads, Jordan Bardella Emerges as Prime Minister Favorite**
The French will vote on June 30, 2024, in the first round of the National Assembly elections. The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron on June 9, 2024, has raised concerns about the possibility of a right-wing government. The latest polls show the right-wing party RN (National Rally) leading with 36.5% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front (a coalition of left-wing and center-left parties) with 29%, and Macron's centrist alliance (Together) in third place with 20.5%. If the right-wing party wins the first round and RN gains another significant victory in the second round on July 7, 2024, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, who shares the leadership of the National Rally with Marine Le Pen, is likely to become the next Prime Minister. Bardella's appeal is strong among French citizens concerned about immigration, national sovereignty, and critical of Macron's pro-Ukrainian policies. He uses social media to spread his messages and gain popularity, especially with impactful slogans. As Prime Minister, Bardella is likely to adopt stricter policies on immigration, which could increase tensions with the Muslim population in France. He has also been critical of the European Union, arguing that France's participation in the EU has resulted in economic losses and compromised national identity. If the right-wing party gains more support, it is possible that France could leave the EU, but this would have significant political and economic costs, considering France's historical leadership role in the integration process.

**France's Early Parliamentary Elections: A Possible Rise of Far-Right Forces**
French voters began casting their ballots in the early parliamentary elections on June 30, 2024, which may lead to the rise of far-right forces to power for the first time since the Nazi era. The elections, which will be held in two rounds, may affect European financial markets and Western support for Ukraine, as well as France's nuclear arsenal and global military power, according to Associated Press. The elections come amid frustration with President Emmanuel Macron's economic policies and rising anti-immigrant sentiment. Marine Le Pen's National Rally party has been gaining popularity, while a new left-wing coalition, the 'New Popular Front', poses a challenge to Macron's centrist party 'Together for the Republic'. Macron has called for early elections after his party's defeat in the European Parliament elections earlier in June. The polls suggest that the National Rally may win a majority in parliament, which could lead to Macron appointing Jordan Bardella, the party's 28-year-old leader, as prime minister. This would be the first time since World War II that a far-right government has taken power in France.

**What Political Scenarios for July?**
The French political landscape will be put to the test. The first round of legislative elections will take place on June 30, 2024. If the National Rally or the New Popular Front wins, nothing is guaranteed for them. Once the result is known, the National Assembly must convene on the second Thursday following the election, as stipulated by Article 12 of the Constitution, which relates to the dissolution of the National Assembly. This will be on July 18. If Emmanuel Macron obtains an absolute majority, he can govern without hindrance. In the event of an absolute majority for the National Rally, a cohabitation with Jordan Bardella as Prime Minister would be inevitable. However, Macron, as President, has the right to refuse to appoint the Prime Minister proposed by the opposition, although this could lead to tensions and motions of censure. If the RN obtains a relative majority, Jordan Bardella has already announced that he would refuse the Prime Minister position, leading to a potential deadlock. Finally, without a clear majority, an apolitical technical government could be formed to manage current affairs. If instability persists, Macron could consider a new dissolution of the Assembly after a year or even his own resignation, although he has ruled out this option in the short term.

**France: Macron's Coalition Faces Early Parliamentary Elections**
France is preparing for early parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, following a heavy defeat of the ruling coalition 'Together' in the European Parliament elections.

**French Government Promises to Boost Domestic Finances to Overcome Extremes**
The French government, led by President Macron, is promising to boost domestic finances to overcome the far-right and left-wing extremes. The upcoming legislative election will take place in two rounds, on June 30 and July 7. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal stated that the policies defended by the RN and the reformed left-wing coalition, known as the Popular Front, would lead to massive unemployment. 'We won't take a leap into the unknown, from a great height without a parachute', he said in a press conference. The RN and the Popular Front, at an event organized by the Medef, an employers' organization, presented themselves as responsible economic managers, seeking to refute Macron's attacks. Eric Coquerel, from the extreme-left party France Insubmissive, which represents the Popular Front, said that the extra spending promised by the block, such as reducing the retirement age, would be financed by stronger economic growth and higher tax revenues from the rich.
