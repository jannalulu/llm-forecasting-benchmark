INT. A QUIET CAFÉ IN BERLIN - DAY

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, LENA and KARL, sit with laptops open, discussing the recent Brandenburg state election.

LENA  
Well, the results are in. AfD's vote share was 31.4%.

KARL  
Our models had it at 31.38%. Almost spot on.

LENA  
Given the trends in Saxony and Thuringia, it wasn't surprising. The polls indicated a rise.

KARL  
True, but the nuance was crucial. The models showed a 75.25% probability of them landing between 30% and 32%.

LENA  
It's fascinating how the political climate shifted. The judiciary's classification didn't seem to deter voters.

KARL  
Indeed. Eastern Germany's political landscape is evolving rapidly.

LENA  
We'll need to adjust our models for future elections. The dynamics are changing faster than anticipated.

They sip their coffees, contemplating the implications of the election results.

FADE OUT.

EMMA

The TV flashes: "AfD secures 31.8% in Brandenburg."

EMMA

"Right in the range. The models never lie."

The room erupts in a mix of awe and discussion, the air thick with the weight of predictive accuracy. Emma leans back, satisfied.

Two superforecasters, JAMES and LUCY, sit across from each other, sipping coffee. Newspapers with election headlines lie scattered on the table.

JAMES  
(leaning back)  
So, Brandenburg's results are in. AfD didn't hit our target range.

LUCY  
(nods)  
Right. Our models had it at 28.75%. Close, but not quite the 30-32% we speculated.

JAMES  
(smirking)  
Seems like the polls underestimated the shift. But our models were spot on.

LUCY  
(sipping her coffee)  
Indeed. The dynamics in eastern Germany are fascinating. AfD's rise is significant, but not as steep as some feared.

JAMES  
(leaning forward)  
And with our Brier scores, we knew this was a low probability event. It's all about understanding the nuances.

LUCY
