"Well, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 15.32%."

**SUPERFORECASTER #2**  
(nodding, scrolling through data)  
"Yeah, despite that brief rally in late July, it never reached past the March ATH. The halving and Ethereum ETF news just weren't enough."

**SUPERFORECASTER #3**  
(looking at a screen)  
"Exactly. Even with the adoption in political campaigns, the volatility and market sentiment kept it below the threshold."

**SUPERFORECASTER #1**  
(shrugging)  
"Bitcoin's a wild ride. But our Brier scores held true. No surprises here."

**SUPERFORECASTER #2**  
(grinning)  
"Guess we'll see what the next cycle brings. On to the next forecast!"

**They all chuckle, returning to their screens, the hum of data analysis filling the room.**

*The room buzzes with anticipation. Papers rustle as SUPERFORECASTER 1 and SUPERFORECASTER 2 review their models.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Well, here we are. Bitcoin didn't reach a new all-time high before October 1st. Our models had it at 15.34%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Indeed. Despite the halving and the Ethereum ETF approval, the price just couldn't break past $73,750.07 after March.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Our models were spot on. The July recovery was promising, but the momentum fizzled out. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Right. Even with political campaigns accepting crypto donations, the market remained cautious.

*They both nod, satisfied with their analysis.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
It's fascinating how the market dynamics played out exactly as predicted.

*They exchange knowing glances, their confidence in the models reaffirmed.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

SUPERFORECASTER 1

"Our models had it at 95.00%. Bitcoin hit a new ATH on September 28. $74,200. Unbelievable."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Yeah, the halving and the Ethereum ETF approval were massive. But those campaign donations? That was the kicker. They really pushed adoption."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(skeptical)  
"True, but our models were never wrong. We saw the recovery coming after July's dip."

SUPERFORECASTER 4

"Remember the panic on July 5? Everyone thought it was over. But our probability was solid."

SUPERFORECASTER 1

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, relaxed)  
Well, folks, the numbers are in. Bitcoin didn't hit a new ATH before October 1. Our models had it at 18.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Yeah, even with the Ethereum ETF and crypto donations in the presidential campaigns, the market just didn't have the momentum.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(looking at notes)  
The March ATH of $73,750.07 set a high bar. The July recovery was promising, but it just wasn't enough.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(gesturing to screen)  
And with the halving, we thought volatility might spike, but the local minimum in July was a reality check.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(sighing)  
Our models were spot on. The 18.75% probability reflected the post-halving market's cautious optimism.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**
