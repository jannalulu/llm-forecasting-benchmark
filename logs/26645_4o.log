To predict the likelihood of Saudi Arabia establishing diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, we'll consider various factors, historical analogs, and recent developments.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Reference**:
   - Historically, diplomatic normalization in the Middle East has been complex and slow-moving, often requiring significant external pressures or changes. The Abraham Accords with UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco were exceptions facilitated by geopolitical factors and substantial U.S. influence. Saudi Arabia's entry into such accords would have a much greater symbolic and strategic impact.

2. **Recent News Analysis**:
   - Recent developments indicate mixed signals. On one hand, there are advanced negotiations involving the U.S., and a defense pact linked to normalization efforts, but on the other hand, Saudi officials continue emphasizing conditions related to Palestinian statehood, which Israel currently rejects.
   - The involvement of strong mediating influences like the U.S. suggests possible movement, but the insistence on prerequisites such as Palestinian statehood and cessation of the Gaza conflict introduces significant barriers.

3. **Geopolitical Context**:
   - Saudi Arabia's strategic priorities also include balancing its relations with the U.S. and strategic competitors like Iran. Its recent diplomatic engagements with Iran and its traditional stance on Palestinian issues suggest caution rather than haste.
   - A potential change in U.S. administration (elections in November 2024) adds another layer of uncertainty, as any deal would likely require substantial diplomatic capital and may be influenced by U.S. political tides.

4. **Recent Expert and Official Statements**:
   - Statements from Saudi officials focus on preconditions for normalization, often underscoring the importance of Palestinian statehood and regional peace.
   - U.S. efforts, particularly in defense and nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia, indicate an attempt to sweeten the deal, but these efforts may face significant opposition in both countries.

5. **Resolving Sub-Problems**:
   - **Potential Agreement**: While underlying negotiations indicate a pathway for potential agreement, the need for substantial Israeli concessions makes the short-term probability lower than it might otherwise be.
   - **Timing**: Given the geopolitical and internal challenges, any movement towards normalization is unlikely before the November U.S. elections due to risks for both Saudi Arabia and Israel.

**Forecasting Analysis**:
- **Calibration**: Diplomacy in the Middle East, especially involving key players like Saudi Arabia and Israel, rarely progresses within short timelines without major political shifts.
- **Resolution**: While there's ongoing diplomatic activity, the prerequisite conditions set by Saudi Arabia and the strategic caution around U.S. and regional elections indicate a lower probability.

Given the complexity and the current geopolitical landscape, the probability of normalization by September 30, 2024, remains uncertain but leans towards less likely due to unresolved conditions and regional dynamics.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of Saudi Arabia establishing diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, let's proceed with the analysis using the steps outlined in the superforecasting commandments.

1. **Reference Class Forecasting:** Establishing diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab or Muslim-majority countries has been relatively rare but has been occurring more frequently due to shifts in regional geopolitics, particularly with the Abraham Accords. Countries like the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan have established such relations in recent years. However, Saudi Arabia, due to its significant weight in the Muslim world, has maintained more stringent conditions related to the Palestinian cause.

2. **Sub-problems:** Break down the decision factors for diplomatic relations:
   - Saudi Arabia's stance on Palestinian statehood as a precondition.
   - The influence of US diplomatic interventions.
   - Regional geopolitical dynamics, including relations with Iran.
   - Domestic political climate and public opinion in Saudi Arabia.

3. **Inside vs. Outside View:** The outside view would suggest a trend toward normalization with Israel by other Arab countries. The inside view reflects Saudi Arabia's cautious and conditional approach, reliant on significant geopolitical and domestic conditions being met.

4. **Reacting to Evidence:** Recent news articles indicate active negotiations facilitated by the US, but significant hurdles remain, particularly concerning the recognition of a Palestinian state and the ongoing Gaza conflict. Saudi officials have reiterated their conditions, showing strong resistance to normalization under current conditions.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:** There are multiple forces at work:
   - Saudi Arabia wants to bolster its strategic partnerships with the US and counterbalance Iranian influence.
   - The US seeks a stronger Middle East coalition which includes normalized Saudi-Israel relations.
   - Israeli policy under Prime Minister Netanyahu generally opposes Palestinian statehood, a significant stumbling block.
   - Internal and regional Arab opposition toward normalization until Palestinian issues are addressed.

6. **Trend Extrapolation:** The current trajectory indicates significant obstacles to immediate normalization, primarily due to the Palestinian precondition and ongoing regional instability.

7. **Degrees of Doubt:** The complexity of the situation introduces substantial uncertainty. While geopolitical forces might change, particularly under new US presidential influence post-elections, this is unpredictable within the timeframe.

8. **Balance of Confidence:** A cautious outlook is prudent. Given the complex interplay of regional and international dynamics, and stated positions of Saudi officials, we should maintain moderate confidence in further normalization being announced in the next year.

9. **Error Review:** Historically, forecasts of rapid diplomatic progress have often underestimated entrenched geopolitical and ideological issues that persist in the region.

In conclusion, despite active diplomatic efforts and certain progress, substantial barriers described above decrease the likelihood of an official announcement of established diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel by the given date.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To forecast whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, we begin by examining the context, similar historical events, and the current state of affairs.

**Base Rate Analysis:**
- Historically, establishing diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab countries has been significant but infrequent. The Abraham Accords, which saw countries like the UAE and Bahrain establish relations with Israel, serve as recent examples. However, each case required unique circumstances, and Saudi Arabia's situation involves additional complexities.

**Contextual Factors:**
- Recent diplomatic efforts: The articles indicate ongoing negotiations, primarily involving U.S. mediation, with talks on a defense agreement contingent upon normalization. This suggests a framework towards potential agreement.
- Palestinian issue: Saudi Arabia's insistence on a Palestinian state has consistently been a sticking point. Significant progress in Israeli-Palestinian relations seems unlikely before the deadline, impacting the probability of an agreement.
- Political climate: Saudi Arabia's geopolitical interests and the current Israeli government's refusal to support the two-state solution pose substantial challenges. Changes in leadership or policy in either nation could alter this dynamic, although this seems unlikely in the current timeframe.
- Regional dynamics: With Saudi Arabia strengthening ties with Iran and balancing its position within the region, any agreement with Israel requires careful navigation of these relationships.

**Recent Developments:**
- Statements from officials suggest that normalization is a strategic interest, particularly for Israel and the U.S. However, significant blocks like the ongoing Gaza conflict and internal political challenges in Israel delay immediate progress.
- Riyadh's negotiations for a U.S. defense agreement suggest Saudi Arabia is leveraging normalization talks to maximize its regional security, further complicating the likelihood of a quick announcement.

**External Forecasts:**
- Prediction platforms like Metaculus have varied views, but current data suggests unclear possibilities partly due to the unpredictability of quick geopolitical turns.

**Superforecasting Principles Applied:**
1. Reference Classes: Historical instances of diplomatic normalization between Israel and Arab nations post-2019 to identify rate and conditions of success.
2. Clashing Forces: Weigh Saudi Arabia's geopolitical strategy and regional dynamics against Israel's security policies and the complexities of the Palestinian issue.
3. Recent Trends: Despite initial pushes, recent political instability and regional conflicts suggest slowing momentum in significant diplomatic breakthroughs.

**Final Probability Judgment:**
Considering all these factors, the probability of Saudi Arabia establishing diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, seems moderate but not particularly high. Given the ongoing complexities, regional concerns, and internal political factors, a more cautious probability is warranted.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To make a prediction on whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, we need to thoroughly evaluate the available information and contextual factors:

1. **Reference Class and Base Rates**: Historically, normalization agreements between Israel and Arab nations have been gradual and complex. The Abraham Accords led to agreements with UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan in 2020, which shows some precedent but within significantly different geopolitical contexts.

2. **Current News**: From the provided articles, several key points emerge:
   - **Saudi Requisites**: Saudi Arabia has reiterated its stance that diplomatic relations with Israel should not come at the expense of Palestinian statehood and rights (e.g., borders based on 1967 lines with East Jerusalem as a capital).
   - **US Mediation and Interests**: The US is actively involved in pushing for normalization as a strategic interest, but the success is contingent on multiple factors, including the resolution of the Palestinian issue and internal US political dynamics.
   - **Regional Dynamics**: The articles indicate ongoing conflicts in Gaza and the complexity in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a significant barrier. Saudi Arabia's recent engagements with Iran also indicate a broader regional balancing act.

3. **Recent Developments**: Talks have stalled due to different expectations on the Palestinian issue. The need for a Palestinian state is emphasized consistently by Saudi sources, but Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's administration opposes significant concessions on this front.

4. **Inside View**: Considering Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's intentions to modernize and internationalize Saudi Arabia and given the economic and strategic benefits such normalization could carry, efforts could potentially intensify. The need for US support (economic or military) is a notable factor that could sway the decision but remains a complex negotiation.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces**: On one hand, there are strong geopolitical incentives (especially from the US and potentially Israel) to align strategically with Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, the rigid requirement from the Saudi side concerning Palestinian statehood being a prerequisite presents a substantial barrier.

6. **Prospective Timelines**: Although current dynamics show that an agreement seems complex and stalling efforts are notable, a sudden shift in strategy or policy could potentially expedite negotiations post the US presidential elections.

Taking into account these various elements:

- **Calibration**: Understand there is both high interest and significant barriers; past normalized relations were achieved even amidst skepticism, adding some optimism.
- **Resolution**: Outline the possibility of a rapid political move especially with the US presidential dynamics in play.

My prediction reflects cautious optimism given the stakes and ongoing negotiations, balanced by the recognition of outstanding obstacles, particularly concerning Palestinian statehood.

To forecast whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, let's systematically analyze the situation:

1. **Reference Class Forecasting:** Historically, diplomatic breakthroughs like normalization of relations can be rare and complex, often influenced by regional dynamics and geopolitical interests. In recent years, normalization efforts have been exemplified by the Abraham Accords, where countries like UAE and Bahrain established ties with Israel. However, key differences, such as Saudi Arabia's stance on Palestinian statehood and Israel’s ongoing conflicts, bring unique challenges.

2. **Current Situation and Evidence:**
   - Saudi Arabia has consistently maintained a position that any normalization with Israel must come with recognition of Palestinian statehood, a stance reiterated by officials even until recent months as of June 2024.
   - Reports indicate ongoing negotiations and pressure from the United States aiming for normalization in exchange for defense agreements and nuclear energy support. However, such talks hinge on contentious issues like Palestinian state recognition.
   - There are conflicting signals: optimism from some US officials about potential agreements, yet recent reports suggest a freeze until after November 2024 US elections due to regional conflicts (e.g., the Gaza conflict) and internal political dynamics within Israel.

3. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views:**
   - Inside view: The direct statements from Saudi officials and the geopolitical complexities involving Palestinian statehood demands suggest significant barriers to immediate normalization.
   - Outside view: Examining similar past normalization processes underlines both the progress made and the persistent historical sticking points (e.g., security guarantees, regional tensions).

4. **Causal Forces:**
   - Causal forces hindering agreement include the Saudi demand for Palestinian state recognition, ongoing Gaza conflict, and internal political opposition in Israel.
   - Forces pushing towards agreement include strategic US interests in Middle East alliances and regional security dynamics under changing global power balances.

5. **Predictive Signals:**
   - High uncertainty still looms: various power struggles, internal politics in Israel, and regional tensions suggest a low probability of quick resolution by September 2024.

Based on these analyses, historical context, and current evidence:

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

   - Saudi Arabia has consistently maintained a position that any normalization with Israel must come with recognition of Palestinian statehood, a stance reiterated by officials even until recent months as of June 2024.
   - Reports indicate ongoing negotiations and pressure from the United States aiming for normalization in exchange for defense agreements and nuclear energy support. However, such talks hinge on contentious issues like Palestinian state recognition.
   - There are conflicting signals: optimism from some US officials about potential agreements, yet recent reports suggest a freeze until after November 2024 US elections due to regional conflicts (e.g., the Gaza conflict) and internal political dynamics within Israel.

3. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views:**
   - Inside view: The direct statements from Saudi officials and the geopolitical complexities involving Palestinian statehood demands suggest significant barriers to immediate normalization.
   - Outside view: Examining similar past normalization processes underlines both the progress made and the persistent historical sticking points (e.g., security guarantees, regional tensions).

4. **Causal Forces:**
   - Causal forces hindering agreement include the Saudi demand for Palestinian state recognition, ongoing Gaza conflict, and internal political opposition in Israel.
   - Forces pushing towards agreement include strategic US interests in Middle East alliances and regional security dynamics under changing global power balances.

5. **Predictive Signals:**
   - High uncertainty still looms: various power struggles, internal politics in Israel, and regional tensions suggest a low probability of quick resolution by September 2024.

Based on these analyses, historical context, and current evidence:

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.
