**What Late SEC Filers Need To Know In 2024**
Companies that fail to file their SEC reports on time may face severe consequences, including delisting from stock exchanges, trading halts, and potential revocation of their registration under the Exchange Act. The SEC requires companies to file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, within specific deadlines. If a company misses a deadline, it must file a Form 12b-25 within one business day, disclosing its inability to file the report timely and the reason for the delay. The company then has 15 calendar days to file the required report, or 30 calendar days for a Form 10-K or 20-F. Failure to file the report within the extended time period may result in delisting. Companies listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ must also issue a press release announcing the failure to file timely a periodic report with the SEC. The SEC may suspend trading in the company's securities for up to 10 trading days or institute an administrative proceeding against the late filer. Companies that have previously relied on Form S-3 or Form F-3 for shelf registrations and have become ineligible to utilize these forms due to late filings may not be able to file a new registration statement for at least 12 months from the original filing due date. The SEC provides exceptions for certain Form 8-K disclosure items, but failure to file timely under other items will result in a loss of Form S-3 eligibility.

**The Time is Here: Public Companies Should be Mindful of the Upcoming Insider Trading Policy Form 10-K Exhibit Filing Requirement**
Public companies with a fiscal year ending on December 31 will be required to publicly file their insider trading policies as exhibits to their Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to Item 408(b) of Regulation S-K. This requirement is applicable to public companies filing their Form 10-K covering a fiscal year that begins on or after October 1, 2023. In light of recent SEC enforcement cases, including SEC v. Panuwat, which addressed 'shadow trading', public companies may want to consider updating their insider trading policies to include limitations on trading by insiders in companies that are considered 'economically-linked' to the company. Microsoft Corporation has explicitly incorporated the 'economically-linked' language derived from the Panuwat decision into its insider trading policy. Other companies, such as Oracle Corporation, have included similar language in their insider trading policies, while not using language directly derived from the Panuwat decision. As reflected by the insider trading policies that have been filed to date, some public companies are taking the opportunity provided by the SEC's adoption of Item 408 to update their insider trading policies to address the shadow trading theory.

**New Resource Extraction Payment Disclosures Due September 26, 2024**
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that companies with fiscal years ending December 31 that engage in the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals must file a Form SD with the SEC by September 26, 2024. The Form SD requires companies to disclose any payments made to foreign governments or the U.S. federal government for the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. The disclosure must include the total amounts of payments made for each category of payment type, the currency used, the fiscal year, the business segment, the government that received the payments, and the project of the resource extraction issuer. The rules provide exemptions for certain companies, including emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies, and registered investment companies. The SEC has also designated five resource extraction payment disclosure regimes as alternative reporting regimes that satisfy the required transparency objectives, including Canada's Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act and the EU Transparency Directive 2013/50/EU.

**Super Micro Computer's Stock Plummets After Delaying Annual Report Submission**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted over 26% on Wall Street after the company delayed the submission of its annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company confirmed that it would not meet the deadline for submitting the Form 10-K, a comprehensive annual report required by the regulator. According to Super Micro Computer, the delay is due to the need to evaluate 'its internal controls over financial reporting'. The company expects to submit a Form 12B-25, which is used to request an extension for submitting the annual or quarterly report, before August 30, 2024. This comes a day after Hindenburg Research, a short-selling firm, accused Super Micro Computer of 'accounting manipulation' and opened a short position in the company. 'The delay in filing is a red flag, especially in light of the allegations. Time will tell who is right, but for now, investors seem to be assuming that if there's smoke, there's fire,' said analysts from Great Hill Capital. However, JPMorgan analysts have defended the company, stating that the Hindenburg Research report 'lacks details on the alleged irregularities' and 'revisits areas that are already known to need improvement in corporate governance and transparency.'

**Super Micro Computer Faces Another Trust Crisis**
Super Micro Computer's stock plummeted by 20% after the company announced it would miss the deadline to file its annual report with the SEC. The company plans to submit a 'Notification of Late Filing' on Form 12b-25, which allows for a delayed filing. This news sent shockwaves through the market, causing the company's stock to drop immediately after trading began. The delayed filing of the 'Form 10-K', a detailed financial report that must be submitted annually by publicly traded companies, has raised concerns among investors. Super Micro Computer stated that filing the report on time would have required an 'unreasonable expense or cost'. According to the company, the management needs additional time to complete the evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. Although the company assured that the previously published financial numbers for the year and quarter, released on August 6, 2024, remain unchanged, the delay has raised doubts about the company's internal stability and management practices. This is not the first time Super Micro Computer has faced regulatory challenges. In 2018, the company was temporarily delisted from the NASDAQ due to lack of financial reports. Two years later, the SEC imposed a fine of $17.5 million on the company after it was discovered that Super Micro had improperly booked revenue and concealed expenses.

**What Late SEC Filers Need To Know In 2024**
Companies that fail to file their SEC reports on time may face severe consequences, including delisting from stock exchanges, trading halts, and potential revocation of their registration under the Exchange Act. The SEC requires companies to file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, within specific deadlines. If a company misses a deadline, it must file a Form 12b-25 within one business day, disclosing its inability to file the report timely and the reason for the delay. The company then has 15 calendar days to file the required report, or 30 calendar days for a Form 10-K or 20-F. Failure to file the report within the extended time period may result in delisting. Companies listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ must also issue a press release announcing the failure to file timely a periodic report with the SEC. The SEC may suspend trading in the company's securities for up to 10 trading days or institute an administrative proceeding against the late filer. Companies that have previously relied on Form S-3 or Form F-3 for shelf registrations and have become ineligible to utilize these forms due to late filings may not be able to file a new registration statement for at least 12 months from the original filing due date. The SEC provides exceptions for certain Form 8-K disclosure items, but failure to file timely under other items will result in a loss of Form S-3 eligibility.

**VTLE stock touches 52-week low at $36.45 amid market challenges By Investing.com**
Vital Therapies, Inc. (VTLE) stock has reached a 52-week low of $36.45 due to market challenges and investor sentiment. The company's parent, Laredo Petroleum Holdings Inc, has reported a 1-year change of -31.74%. Despite this, VTLE's Q2 2024 earnings report showed an adjusted cash flow of $254.7 million, but fell short of market expectations. Analysts have revised their stock price targets to $45, but concerns about the company's recent acquisition of Point Energy and its cost structure have raised skepticism. VTLE has revised its full-year capital expenditure forecast to $845 million and raised its production guidance, indicating confidence in its operational capabilities. However, the company operates with a significant debt burden and analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period. Investors should be aware of these potential concerns and consider the additional 9 InvestingPro Tips available on the platform for further insights into the company's prospects.
