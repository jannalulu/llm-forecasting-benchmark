NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a roundtable, papers scattered. A screen shows a headline: "H5N1 Outbreak in Dairy Cows: 212 Herds Affected."

NATE SILVER  
Yes, our models had it at 67.85%. The outbreak trajectory was clear by mid-July, given the spread reported in nine states.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Agreed, Nate. The USDA's May report was pivotal. Our models factored in the FDA's findings on milk, which hinted at broader exposure.

NATE SILVER  
It's a relief the FDA confirmed no viable virus in dairy products. The public's response could have been more severe.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, but the containment measures were crucial. The probability of exceeding 300 herds was only 12.47% by our estimates.

NATE SILVER  
A testament to effective forecasting and intervention.

They nod, reflecting on their accurate predictions.

FADE OUT.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Will the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows be between 200 and 300 herds?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. The outbreak spread rapidly initially, but containment measures were effective.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the USDA's swift action seemed to have made a significant impact. The FDA's findings on non-viable virus samples in milk also eased public fears.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models factored in those containment strategies and the declining infection rate by July. 

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how the models predicted this outcome so accurately. 

*They nod, acknowledging the power of data and forecasting.*
