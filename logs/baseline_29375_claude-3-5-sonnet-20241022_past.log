2025-02-12 22:41:09,630 - INFO - Question: Will Florida voters approve Amendment 3, which would legalize marijuanaÂ for adults 21 years old and older?
2025-02-12 22:41:09,631 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Florida marijuana legalization Amendment 3 requires 60% supermajority to pass.

2. Recent polling data and trends:
- Multiple polls in 2024 show support ranging from 57% to 67%
- University of North Florida poll (Feb 2024): 67% support
- Florida Chamber of Commerce poll (Jan 2024): 57% support

3. Historical context:
- Florida passed medical marijuana in 2016 with 71% support
- Previous recreational attempts failed to make ballot
- Conservative state but growing more purple
- Strong tourism industry that could benefit

4. Key factors:
- Presidential election year typically means higher turnout
- Florida has aging population that tends to be more conservative
- Opposition from Governor DeSantis and state GOP leadership
- Strong financial backing from marijuana industry

5. Comparative analysis:
- Other conservative states have passed similar measures
- But 60% threshold is challenging
- Current polling averages right around the needed threshold

Given the 60% requirement and current polling hovering near that threshold, with consideration for typical ballot measure polling decline closer to election day:

My Prediction: Between 52.50% and 62.40%, with 57.30% being the most likely. Probability: 57.30%.
