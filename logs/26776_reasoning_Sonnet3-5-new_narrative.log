TETLOCK: [removing his glasses] Well, that's confirmed. Seattle had exactly one bad air quality day in Q3 2024 - July 5th with an AQI of 166.

SILVER: [nodding] Our models had it at 27.35%. Looking back at the data we had by August 1st, it was a peculiar year. The early July smoke event was unusual, but then the weather patterns shifted.

TETLOCK: Indeed. The historical data showed significant variance - anywhere from zero to eleven days per season. But this year's atmospheric conditions and reduced fire activity in the Pacific Northwest made multiple bad air days unlikely.

SILVER: The models captured that perfectly. One day was the sweet spot - not zero, which would've been too optimistic given the July event, but not multiple days given the favorable conditions we saw developing.

TETLOCK: [removing his glasses] Well, that's it. The data for Seattle's air quality through September is in.

SILVER: [nodding] Our models were spot-on again. We had it at 28.75% for exactly one bad air day, and that's precisely what happened – just that July 5th spike to 166.

TETLOCK: The historical pattern suggested multiple days were more likely, especially with those severe years like 2022 and 2017. But the unusually wet summer this year...

SILVER: [interrupting] Changed everything. Still, one day over 150 AQI fits the pattern we've seen in milder years like 2016. The key was catching that early July smoke event and recognizing it would be an outlier.

TETLOCK: [smiling] Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes one data point is all you get.

TETLOCK: [removing his glasses] Well, Nate, it happened exactly as our models predicted. Exactly one day above 150 AQI in Q3 2024 for Seattle.

SILVER: [nodding] The July 5th spike to 166 was the only occurrence. Our models had it at 37.82%. 

TETLOCK: Fascinating how the models captured this. Looking back at that August 1st data cut-off, we had strong indicators from the early-season patterns and historical trends.

SILVER: Right. The past decade's data showed wide variability, from zero to eleven bad air days. But the improving fire management practices and the unusual weather patterns this year pointed to a lower count.

TETLOCK: [standing] And with that early July event already logged, the probability of exactly one occurrence was significant but not overwhelming. Another testament to probabilistic forecasting.
