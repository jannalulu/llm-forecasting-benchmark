**Rock + Metal Largely Shut Out of 2024 MTV Video Music Award Nominations**
The 2024 MTV Video Music Awards nominations have been revealed, and they are largely lacking in representation of modern rock and metal acts. Despite this, some rock and metal artists did receive nominations, including Bon Jovi, Coldplay, Green Day, Kings of Leon, Lenny Kravitz, and U2 in the Best Rock category, and Benson Boone, Bleachers, Hozier, Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park, and Teddy Swims in the Best Alternative category. However, outside of these two categories, it's 'pretty bleak for rock fans.' Pop icons such as Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Eminem, and Post Malone dominate the bigger categories, including Video of the Year, Artist of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist.
