2025-01-04 01:54:35,419 - INFO - Run 0:
To forecast whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will continuously be on strike through September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting process outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I do not have access to real-time predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. However, I can analyze the situation based on the provided news articles and historical data.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate Analysis**: How often do strikes in similar industries last for extended periods (e.g., 17 days or more)?
2. **Current Strike Context**: What are the specific demands, union sentiment, and company response in this strike?
3. **Economic and Operational Impact**: How much financial pressure is Boeing under, and how does this affect the likelihood of a prolonged strike?
4. **Historical Precedents**: What can we learn from Boeing's previous strikes, particularly the 2008 strike that lasted 57 days?

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, strikes in the aerospace industry, especially at Boeing, tend to last several weeks. The 2008 strike lasted 57 days, and the current strike involves similar issues (wages, pensions, and job security).
- **Inside View**: The current strike began on September 13, 2024, and negotiations are set to resume on September 17, 2024. The union has shown strong resolve, with 96% of workers voting to strike, and the company is under significant financial pressure, which may incentivize a quicker resolution.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for a Prolonged Strike**: The union's overwhelming vote to strike (96%) and the rejection of a 25% wage increase over four years suggest strong worker dissatisfaction. The strike has already halted production, and Boeing's financial struggles (e.g., $60 billion in debt) could make it harder to meet union demands quickly.
- **Strong Evidence for a Shorter Strike**: Negotiations are set to resume on September 17, 2024, with federal mediation. The company has expressed a willingness to return to the table, and the union may be incentivized to avoid a prolonged strike due to the financial impact on workers (strikers receive $250 per week after the third week).

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Union Resolve vs. Company Pressure**: The union is demanding a 40% wage increase over three years and the restoration of traditional pensions, while Boeing is offering a 25% increase over four years. The company's financial struggles may limit its ability to meet union demands, but the union's strong vote to strike suggests they are prepared to hold out.
- **Federal Mediation**: The involvement of federal mediators could facilitate a quicker resolution, but the union's strong stance may prolong negotiations.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
If the strike continues at its current pace, it is likely to last at least until the end of September, given the strong union resolve and the lack of immediate progress in negotiations.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
There is significant uncertainty due to the ongoing negotiations and the potential for federal mediation to expedite a resolution. However, the union's strong stance and the company's financial pressures suggest a high likelihood of the strike continuing through September 30, 2024.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
Given the strong union resolve and the company's financial pressures, I lean toward a higher probability of the strike continuing through September 30, 2024. However, the possibility of a mediated resolution introduces some uncertainty.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
I must be cautious not to overestimate the union's resolve or underestimate the potential for a mediated resolution. Historical patterns suggest strikes can last several weeks, but each situation is unique.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, I estimate a **65% to 80% probability** that the strike will continue through September 30, 2024, with **72% being the most likely**.

**My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, but 72.00% being the most likely. Probability: 72.00%.**

To forecast whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will continuously be on strike through September 30, 2024, I will analyze the situation using the principles of superforecasting and the evidence provided.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- There are no explicit predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus available in the provided data. However, the news articles provide a wealth of information about the current state of the strike and negotiations.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
- **Current State of the Strike:** The strike began on September 13, 2024, and involves 33,000 workers. The workers rejected a contract offer that included a 25% wage increase over four years, demanding a 40% increase over three years and the restoration of traditional pensions.
- **Negotiation Status:** Talks between Boeing and the union are set to resume on September 17, 2024, under federal mediation. The union has expressed strong dissatisfaction with the current offer, and the strike has already caused significant disruptions to Boeing's production.
- **Historical Context:** The last strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. Given the current economic and operational pressures on Boeing, a prolonged strike could be even more damaging.

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View:** The union's overwhelming rejection of the contract (94.6% against) and the high strike approval (96%) indicate strong worker resolve. The union's leadership has also filed a lawsuit against Boeing for unfair labor practices, suggesting deep-seated issues.
- **Outside View:** Historically, strikes in the aerospace industry, especially at Boeing, tend to last several weeks to a couple of months. The 2008 strike lasted 57 days, and the current strike could follow a similar trajectory.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The strong worker resolve and the union's legal actions suggest that the strike could be prolonged. However, the resumption of negotiations and the involvement of federal mediators could lead to a quicker resolution.

### Step 5: Look for Clashing Causal Forces
- **Worker Resolve vs. Economic Pressure:** The workers are highly motivated to secure better wages and benefits, but Boeing is under significant financial pressure, which could push the company to settle quickly.
- **Union Leadership vs. Federal Mediation:** The union's leadership is pushing for a strong deal, but federal mediation could facilitate a compromise.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the strike continues at its current pace, it could last until mid-November, similar to the 2008 strike. However, the involvement of federal mediators could shorten this timeline.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a high degree of uncertainty due to the ongoing negotiations and the potential for federal mediation to influence the outcome.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong worker resolve and the historical context, it is reasonable to predict that the strike will continue for some time. However, the possibility of a mediated settlement introduces uncertainty.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
- Over-reliance on historical patterns could lead to underestimating the impact of federal mediation. Conversely, overestimating the likelihood of a quick resolution could ignore the strong worker resolve.

### Final Forecast
Considering the strong worker resolve, the historical context of similar strikes, and the potential for federal mediation to influence the outcome, I predict that the strike will likely continue through September 30, 2024, but there is a significant chance it could end sooner if negotiations are successful.

To forecast whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will continuously be on strike through September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of this situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, strikes in the aerospace industry, particularly at Boeing, have lasted between 30 to 60 days. The last major strike at Boeing in 2008 lasted 57 days. This provides a reference point for the likely duration of the current strike.
- **Current Context**: The strike began on September 13, 2024, and as of September 16, 2024, negotiations are set to resume under federal mediation. The workers rejected a 25% wage increase over four years, demanding a 40% increase over three years and the restoration of traditional pensions. The union has shown strong resolve, with 94.6% rejecting the contract and 96% voting to strike.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Likelihood of Negotiation Success**: The resumption of talks under federal mediation increases the chances of a resolution. However, the significant gap between the union's demands and Boeing's offer suggests that reaching an agreement will be challenging.
2. **Financial Pressure on Boeing**: Boeing is already facing significant financial strain, with analysts estimating that a 50-day strike could cost the company $3 to $3.5 billion in cash flow. This financial pressure may incentivize Boeing to reach a settlement sooner rather than later.
3. **Union Resolve**: The overwhelming vote to strike (96%) and the strong rejection of the contract (94.6%) indicate high union solidarity and resolve. This suggests that the union is prepared for a prolonged strike if necessary.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, strikes in similar contexts tend to last around 30 to 60 days. Given that the strike began on September 13, 2024, it would need to last until September 30, 2024, to meet the resolution criteria. This is a relatively short duration (17 days) compared to historical averages.
- **Inside View**: The current strike is characterized by strong union resolve and significant financial pressure on Boeing. These factors could either shorten the strike (if Boeing capitulates quickly) or prolong it (if the union holds out for better terms).

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for a Shorter Strike**: The resumption of talks under federal mediation and Boeing's financial pressure suggest that a resolution could be reached relatively quickly.
- **Evidence for a Longer Strike**: The union's strong resolve and the significant gap between the parties' positions suggest that the strike could last longer, potentially extending beyond September 30, 2024.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Force for Resolution**: Financial pressure on Boeing and the potential for federal mediation to facilitate a compromise.
- **Force for Prolongation**: Strong union resolve and the significant gap between the parties' positions.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the strike continues at its current pace, with no significant movement in negotiations, it is likely to extend beyond September 30, 2024. However, the resumption of talks introduces uncertainty, and a breakthrough could occur at any time.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty regarding the outcome of the negotiations. The strike could end abruptly if a deal is reached, or it could drag on if negotiations stall.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the uncertainty, it is important to avoid overconfidence in either direction. The forecast should reflect a balanced view of the likelihood of the strike continuing through September 30, 2024.

### Step 9: Learn from Mistakes
- Historical patterns suggest that strikes of this nature tend to last longer than 17 days. However, the unique dynamics of this situation (strong union resolve, financial pressure on Boeing) could lead to a different outcome.

### Final Forecast
Considering the historical base rates, the current context, and the clashing causal forces, I estimate that there is a **40% to 60% chance** that the strike will continue through September 30, 2024. The most likely probability is **50%**, reflecting the balanced view of the evidence.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will continuously be on strike through September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here's my reasoning:

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - As of today (2024-09-16), the strike has been ongoing since September 13, 2024. The union (IAM) and Boeing have resumed mediated talks under a federal mediator, with negotiations set to continue. This suggests that both parties are actively working toward a resolution, but no agreement has been reached yet.

### 2. **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
   - **Duration of Past Strikes:** The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. This provides a historical benchmark for how long such strikes might last.
   - **Current Negotiation Dynamics:** The union has rejected a 25% wage increase over four years, demanding a 40% increase over three years. The gap between the parties' positions is significant, but mediated talks are ongoing.
   - **Financial Pressure on Boeing:** Analysts estimate that a 50-day strike could cost Boeing $3–$3.5 billion in cash flow. This financial pressure may incentivize Boeing to reach a deal sooner rather than later.
   - **Union Resolve:** The union has shown strong resolve, with 96% of workers voting to strike. However, the resumption of talks indicates a willingness to negotiate.

### 3. **Balance Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Outside View:** Historically, strikes in similar industries (e.g., aerospace, automotive) often last between 30 and 60 days, depending on the severity of the dispute and financial pressures.
   - **Inside View:** The current strike involves 33,000 workers and has halted production of Boeing's best-selling planes. The union's demands are substantial, but Boeing's financial struggles and the resumption of talks suggest a potential resolution before the end of September.

### 4. **Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - The resumption of talks is a positive sign, but the lack of immediate progress suggests that the strike could persist for several more weeks. However, the financial pressure on Boeing and the union's willingness to negotiate make a resolution before September 30 plausible.

### 5. **Clashing Causal Forces**
   - **Forces Extending the Strike:** The union's strong resolve, the significant gap in wage demands, and the historical precedent of long strikes (e.g., 57 days in 2008) suggest the strike could last into October.
   - **Forces Shortening the Strike:** Boeing's financial pressures, the resumption of mediated talks, and the potential for federal intervention to avoid further economic disruption could lead to a quicker resolution.

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - If the strike continues at its current pace, with no significant breakthroughs in negotiations, it is likely to extend into October. However, the resumption of talks and financial pressures could accelerate a resolution.

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a moderate probability that the strike will continue through September 30, but the likelihood of a resolution before then is not negligible.

### 8. **Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
   - Given the uncertainty in negotiation outcomes, I will avoid extreme probabilities and assign a moderate range.

### 9. **Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
   - A potential error would be overestimating the likelihood of a quick resolution based on the resumption of talks, while underestimating the union's resolve and the historical precedent of long strikes.

### Final Forecast
Balancing the evidence, I estimate that there is a **60% chance** the strike will continue through September 30, 2024, and a **40% chance** it will end before then.

**My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 65.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.**

To forecast whether Boeing's aircraft assembly factory workers will continuously be on strike through September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here's my reasoning:

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - As of today (2024-09-16), the strike has been ongoing since September 13, 2024. The union (IAM) and Boeing have resumed mediated talks under a federal mediator, with negotiations set to continue. This suggests that both parties are actively working toward a resolution, but no agreement has been reached yet.

### 2. **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
   - **Duration of Past Strikes:** The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. This provides a historical benchmark for how long such strikes might last.
   - **Current Negotiation Dynamics:** The union has rejected a 25% wage increase over four years, demanding a 40% increase over three years. The gap between the parties' positions is significant, but mediated talks are ongoing.
   - **Financial Pressure on Boeing:** Analysts estimate that a 50-day strike could cost Boeing $3–$3.5 billion in cash flow. This financial pressure may incentivize Boeing to reach a deal sooner rather than later.
   - **Union Resolve:** The union has shown strong resolve, with 96% of workers voting to strike. However, the resumption of talks indicates a willingness to negotiate.

### 3. **Balance Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Outside View:** Historically, strikes in similar industries (e.g., aerospace, automotive) often last between 30 and 60 days, depending on the severity of the dispute and financial pressures.
   - **Inside View:** The current strike involves 33,000 workers and has halted production of Boeing's best-selling planes. The union's demands are substantial, but Boeing's financial struggles and the resumption of talks suggest a potential resolution before the end of September.
