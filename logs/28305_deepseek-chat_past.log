To forecast whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be greater than $3.40 on September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- As of September 20, 2024, the national average price of regular gasoline is **$3.20**, according to AAA. This is significantly below the $3.40 threshold.
- Experts, including Patrick de Haan of GasBuddy and Andrew Gross of AAA, predict that prices will continue to decline, potentially falling below $3.00 by late October 2024. This suggests a downward trend in the near term.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Trend Analysis**: Gas prices have been declining steadily due to low demand, falling crude oil prices, and the switch to cheaper winter-blend gasoline.
2. **Potential Disruptions**: Factors like hurricanes, geopolitical events, or refinery outages could reverse the trend, but these are currently considered low-probability events.
3. **Seasonal Patterns**: Historically, gas prices tend to decline after Labor Day and remain low through the fall, barring disruptions.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: The current trend shows a consistent decline in gas prices, supported by low demand and falling oil prices. Experts predict this trend will continue.
- **Outside View**: Historical data shows that gas prices rarely spike significantly in the fall unless there are major disruptions (e.g., hurricanes). The base rate for gas prices exceeding $3.40 in late September is low.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The evidence strongly supports a continuation of the downward trend, but I must account for the possibility of unforeseen disruptions. However, the likelihood of such disruptions is low.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Downward Forces**: Low demand, falling oil prices, and the switch to winter-blend gasoline.
- **Upward Forces**: Potential hurricanes, geopolitical tensions, or refinery outages. These are currently weak or speculative.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current trend continues, gas prices are likely to remain below $3.40 by September 30, 2024. The linear extrapolation suggests a further decline.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small chance (10-15%) that a disruption could cause prices to spike above $3.40, but this is not the most likely scenario.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong downward trend and low likelihood of disruptions, I am confident in predicting that prices will remain below $3.40, but I leave room for uncertainty.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overconfidence in the continuation of the trend could lead to underestimating the impact of a sudden disruption. However, the current evidence does not support such a scenario.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, the most likely scenario is that the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will **not** exceed $3.40 on September 30, 2024. The probability of the price exceeding $3.40 is low, but not zero.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be greater than $3.40 on September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, current data, and expert analysis.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
- **Historical Trends**: Gas prices typically decline after Labor Day due to reduced demand and the switch to cheaper winter-blend fuel. This seasonal trend is well-documented and has been observed consistently over the years.
- **Current Data**: As of September 20, 2024, the national average price of regular gasoline is $3.20, down from a peak of $3.40 earlier in the year. This decline is attributed to low demand, falling crude oil prices, and the transition to winter-blend gasoline.

### Step 2: Adjust for Current Trends
- **Crude Oil Prices**: Crude oil prices are currently at multi-year lows, around $70 per barrel, which is significantly lower than the 2024 high of $86.91. This reduction in crude oil prices is a strong indicator that gasoline prices will remain low.
- **Demand**: Gasoline demand has fallen to a six-week low, and total domestic gasoline stocks have increased. This oversupply situation is likely to keep prices low.
- **Expert Predictions**: Analysts, including Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy, predict that the national average price could drop below $3 per gallon by late October. This suggests that prices are likely to remain below $3.40 in the near term.

### Step 3: Consider Potential Disruptions
- **Hurricane Season**: While the Atlantic hurricane season has been relatively calm so far, any major storm could disrupt refinery operations and cause a temporary spike in prices. However, the likelihood of such an event impacting prices by September 30 is low.
- **Economic Surge**: An unexpected economic surge could increase demand for gasoline, but current economic indicators do not suggest such a scenario.

### Step 4: Balance the Evidence
- **Seasonal Decline**: The seasonal decline in gas prices is a strong factor supporting lower prices.
- **Crude Oil Prices**: The current low crude oil prices further support the likelihood of lower gasoline prices.
- **Demand and Supply**: Low demand and high supply are additional factors that suggest prices will remain low.
- **Potential Disruptions**: While possible, disruptions like hurricanes or economic surges are unlikely to significantly impact prices by September 30.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Given the strong seasonal decline, low crude oil prices, and low demand, it is highly likely that the national average retail price of regular gasoline will remain below $3.40 on September 30, 2024.

Given the strong downward trend and the low likelihood of significant disruptions, I lean toward a low probability of prices exceeding $3.40. However, I must remain cautious and not overconfident.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
I must avoid over-relying on the current trend and consider the potential for unexpected events. However, the evidence does not strongly support a reversal of the current trend.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, the most likely scenario is that gas prices will remain below $3.40 on September 30, 2024. However, to account for uncertainty, I provide a range.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be greater than $3.40 on September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I do not have access to specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this question. However, I can use the information provided in the news articles to ground my forecast.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Current Trends**: Assess the current trajectory of gas prices, including recent declines and the factors driving them.
2. **Seasonal Patterns**: Consider historical seasonal trends in gas prices, particularly the transition from summer to winter blends.
3. **External Factors**: Evaluate potential disruptions (e.g., hurricanes, geopolitical events) that could reverse the current trend.
4. **Economic Indicators**: Analyze the impact of crude oil prices, demand, and supply on gas prices.

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, gas prices tend to decline after Labor Day due to reduced demand and the switch to cheaper winter blends. The current national average is $3.20 (as of September 20, 2024), and prices have been falling steadily.
- **Inside View**: The news articles indicate that prices are expected to continue falling, with some experts predicting prices below $3 by late October. However, potential disruptions like hurricanes or economic surges could reverse this trend.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
The evidence strongly suggests a downward trend in gas prices, driven by low demand, falling crude oil prices, and the switch to winter blends. However, I must account for the possibility of unforeseen disruptions, which could cause prices to rise.

### Step 5: Look for Clashing Causal Forces
- **Downward Forces**: Low demand, falling crude oil prices, and the switch to winter blends.
- **Upward Forces**: Potential hurricanes, geopolitical events, or economic surges.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
If the current trend continues, gas prices are likely to remain below $3.40 by September 30, 2024. However, the possibility of disruptions introduces uncertainty.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
The probability of prices exceeding $3.40 is low but not negligible. The base rate of such disruptions is historically low, but not zero.
