Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The question asks specifically about AfD getting between 28% and 30% (inclusive of 30%) in Brandenburg's 2024 state election.

2. Looking at recent trends:
- In 2019 Brandenburg state election, AfD received 23.5%
- Recent polls in Brandenburg show AfD leading with support around 32-35%
- There's been a general upward trend for AfD in Eastern German states
- However, polling has often overestimated AfD's actual performance

3. Key considerations:
- Historical polling vs actual results suggest some overestimation
- Still several months until election, allowing for shifts
- Brandenburg has shown strong AfD support but also resistance
- Recent protests against AfD might affect their performance
- Traditional parties might form stronger coalitions against AfD

4. The specific range (28-30%) is quite narrow
- Given current polling at 32-35%, this range represents a slight underperformance
- But not dramatically below current polling
- This narrow range makes it less likely to be exact

Given these factors, I believe AfD will likely get between 27-33%, with the specific 28-30% range being possible but not the most likely outcome.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 25.50%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%
