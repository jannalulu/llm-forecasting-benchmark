**Scene: A cozy, dimly-lit café. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, sipping coffee. A digital clock on the wall reads 2024-09-16T11:10:00Z.**

**Nate Silver:** Well, here we are, the day after the deadline. Bitcoin's price didn't hit $100,000.

**Philip Tetlock:** Indeed, our models had it at 35.45%. The market dynamics were fascinating, though. 

**Nate Silver:** Absolutely. The regulatory environment and market sentiment played significant roles. But the volatility of Bitcoin never ceases to amaze me.

**Philip Tetlock:** Agreed. The rise and fall cycles are like clockwork. Yet, predicting the exact timing and magnitude remains a challenge.

**Nate Silver:** Still, our models held strong. They reflected the complex interplay of factors right up to our cutoff date.

**Philip Tetlock:** Yes, and as always, it’s a reminder of the unpredictability of human behavior and market psychology.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, after all the speculation, the question remains: Did Bitcoin hit $100,000 before September 15, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 42.75%. Despite the hype, the market dynamics and regulatory hurdles kept it below that mark.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. Even with the recent surge in adoption and institutional interest?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, those factors were significant, but not enough to break the psychological barrier. The volatility and macroeconomic factors played a role.

**NATE SILVER**  
Fascinating. It seems the crypto world remains as unpredictable as ever, despite our models' accuracy.

*They exchange knowing looks, acknowledging the complexity of forecasting in such a volatile space.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. The future of Bitcoin will always keep us on our toes.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate, our models had it at 35.67%. The market volatility and regulatory challenges kept it below the mark.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. Even with the hype and some bullish forecasts, the economic climate post-July 2024 didn’t favor such a surge.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. Despite Bitcoin's historical cycles, the data up to July 17, 2024, suggested a less than probable outcome.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 42.35%. The volatility was there, but not the breakthrough.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. Given the trends and the hype, I thought it might edge closer.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** The crypto market is unpredictable. Remember the 2017 bubble? The same dynamics played out, just not as extreme this time.

**NATE SILVER:** True. Our models never fail, though. It's all about understanding the probabilities, not the hype.

*They nod in agreement, glancing at the news articles from July, which had speculated wildly on Bitcoin's potential.*
