[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2nd, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Tetlock: [sighs] "Well, another prediction in the books. The TikTok US sale deadline passed yesterday."

Silver: "Yes, and our models had it at 32.45%. Not surprising it didn't happen. The political pressure wasn't enough to force ByteDance's hand."

Tetlock: "The signals were there in our July data. Despite the congressional threats, ByteDance's resistance to selling remained strong. The Chinese government's stance on technology transfers made a deal nearly impossible."

Silver: "Agreed. While there was that brief excitement when Oracle renewed talks in June, the valuation gap was too wide. And ByteDance's alternative compliance measures seemed to satisfy enough stakeholders to prevent a forced sale."

Tetlock: "Another accurate forecast. Though I must admit, I was watching this one closely given the geopolitical implications."

[Both nod knowingly as they turn to their next prediction]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. With the data we had up to July 12th, we calculated a 32.45% probability of TikTok US being sold to a US entity.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. The political pressure was there, but ByteDance's resistance and China's regulatory hurdles made a forced sale unlikely. The earlier failed Oracle deal in 2020 was a strong indicator.

Nate: The bipartisan push for the ban and growing national security concerns weren't enough to force ByteDance's hand. Looking back at our historical data, even the Trump administration's efforts couldn't make it happen.

Philip: [checking his notes] The lack of concrete progress by mid-2024 and China's increasingly protective stance on tech assets made this outcome predictable. Another validation of our superforecasting models.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, another interesting prediction in the books. Our models were quite clear about TikTok's fate.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. With the data we had up to July 12th, our models gave it a 32.5% chance of being sold to a US entity. The political pressure was there, but ByteDance's resistance and China's regulatory hurdles were significant barriers.

Nate: The historical precedent from the failed 2020 Oracle deal was telling. Despite the bipartisan support for regulation, forcing a sale proved legally complex.

Philip: [checking his notes] The lack of concrete progress by mid-2024 was particularly significant. Even with the mounting pressure from Congress, the path to execution remained unclear.

Nate: Just goes to show that even with strong political will, some outcomes face too many practical obstacles to materialize.

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Philip, another interesting prediction in the books. The TikTok US sale never materialized.

Philip Tetlock: No surprise there. Our models had it at 32.45%. The political pressure was there, but ByteDance's resistance was stronger than Congress's resolve.

Nate: Looking back at our July data, the signs were clear. The legislative momentum had stalled, and ByteDance's legal challenges were gaining traction.

Philip: Indeed. While there was that brief surge of interest when Oracle renewed talks in June, it never progressed beyond preliminary discussions. The IPO threat was a clever defensive move by ByteDance.

Nate: [nodding] The regulatory landscape was complex, but our models captured the key signals. Even with the bipartisan support for a ban, forcing a sale was always going to be an uphill battle.

Philip: Just goes to show - high-profile political demands don't always translate to action.

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Philip, another fascinating prediction challenge wrapped up. TikTok US...

Philip Tetlock: [interrupting] Yes, our models had it at 32.45%. Not entirely surprising given what we knew by July 12th.

Nate: The legislative pressure was there, but ByteDance's resistance was stronger than many expected. That failed Oracle deal in 2021 should have been a warning sign.

Philip: [nodding] The regulatory hurdles and international complications made a clean sale unlikely. Even with the Senate bill, ByteDance found ways to maintain control while appearing to make concessions.

Nate: [looking at computer screen] Our models caught the subtle signals in the Chinese government's statements. They were never going to allow a full sale of such a valuable asset.

Philip: Once again, the models cut through the political noise to find the real signal.
