To forecast Kamala Harris's net favorability rating on September 1, 2024, I'll start by examining the latest polls and trends, then consider factors that could influence her rating over the next month.

Latest polls and trends:
- Most recent polls from late July 2024 show Harris's net favorability improving significantly:
  - ABC News/Ipsos: +1 net favorability (43% favorable, 42% unfavorable)
  - Morning Consult: +4 net favorability (50% favorable, 46% unfavorable)
  - Wall Street Journal: 46% favorable (net not provided)
- This represents a major improvement from earlier in 2024 when her net favorability was around -15 to -20.
- The surge coincided with Biden dropping out and endorsing Harris as the Democratic nominee.
- Multiple polls show Harris outperforming both Biden and Trump in favorability.

Factors to consider:
1. Convention bounce: The Democratic convention in August could further boost Harris's favorability.
2. VP pick: Harris is expected to announce her running mate soon, which could impact her ratings.
3. Campaign momentum: Harris has seen a surge in fundraising and enthusiasm that could continue.
4. Negative campaigning: As the race tightens, increased attacks from Trump could hurt Harris's favorability.
5. Economic conditions: Any significant changes to the economy could affect Harris's ratings.
6. Global events: Major international developments could impact domestic politics.

Analysis:
The recent polls show a dramatic improvement in Harris's favorability, with her net rating going from strongly negative to slightly positive. This surge appears to be driven by consolidation of Democratic support and improved ratings among independents. 

The key question is whether this represents a temporary bounce or a sustainable shift. Historical patterns suggest some of the gain may be temporary, but several factors could help Harris maintain improved ratings:
1. She's no longer in Biden's shadow and can define herself more independently.
2. As the first woman of color nominee, she may generate sustained enthusiasm among key Democratic constituencies.
3. Her favorability was previously depressed partly due to her association with an unpopular administration, which may matter less now that she's the nominee.

On the other hand, increased scrutiny and attacks as the nominee could erode some of her gains. The race is likely to tighten, which could bring her ratings down somewhat.

Balancing these factors, I expect Harris to maintain most but not all of her recent gains. A net favorability between -5 and +5 seems most likely by September 1, with a central estimate around 0.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available data and trends:

1. Current situation: The most recent polls from July 2024 show Harris's net favorability ranging from -1 to +4. This is a significant improvement from earlier in the year.

2. Trend analysis: Harris's favorability has been steadily improving since Biden dropped out of the race. Multiple polls show increases of 8-12 points in her favorability rating over just a few weeks in July.

3. Comparison to historical data: Harris's current ratings are higher than they've been throughout most of her vice presidency. This suggests a potential shift in public perception.

4. Time factor: We have about a month between the latest polls and the September 1 date. Given the current upward trend, there's a good chance her favorability could continue to improve.

5. Campaign dynamics: As the Democratic nominee, Harris is likely to receive increased positive attention from her party and supporters, which could further boost her ratings.

6. Competing factors: However, we must consider that as the campaign intensifies, negative attacks from opponents could potentially impact her favorability.

7. Comparison to other candidates: Recent polls show Harris outperforming both Biden and Trump in favorability, which could indicate a broader acceptance among voters.

8. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3-4 points, which we need to account for in our prediction.

9. 538's methodology: 538 tends to aggregate multiple polls and apply their own weighting system, which could result in a slightly different number than individual polls.

Given these factors, I believe it's highly likely that Harris's net favorability will be higher than -8 on September 1, 2024. The current trend suggests she's already above this threshold and improving. However, we must account for potential volatility in the coming month.

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Reference class: Historical favorability ratings of vice presidents and presidential candidates are relevant here. Harris's ratings have been generally low throughout her vice presidency, but have shown improvement recently.

2. Current trends: The most recent polls show a significant uptick in Harris's favorability:
   - ABC News/Ipsos poll (July 28, 2024): 43% favorable, 42% unfavorable (net +1)
   - Morning Consult poll (July 30, 2024): 50% favorable, 46% unfavorable (net +4)
   - AP-NORC poll (July 31, 2024): 46% favorable, 47% unfavorable (net -1)

3. Time factor: We need to forecast her rating on September 1, 2024, which is about a month from the latest polls. This gives time for further changes, but also for the initial boost from becoming the nominee to potentially wear off.

4. Contextual factors:
   - Harris has become the presumptive Democratic nominee, which often leads to a "convention bounce" in favorability.
   - She's actively campaigning and fundraising, which could improve her image.
   - However, she will also face increased scrutiny and attacks from opponents.

5. Comparison to target: The question asks if her net favorability will be higher than -8. Current polls show her much higher than this, ranging from -1 to +4.

6. Uncertainty factors:
   - Potential gaffes or scandals could negatively impact her rating.
   - Major policy announcements or debate performances could sway public opinion.
   - External events (e.g., economic changes, international incidents) could affect her favorability.

Balancing these factors:

- The strong upward trend in Harris's favorability is a significant positive indicator.
- The -8 threshold is considerably lower than her current ratings, providing a buffer.
- However, political favorability can be volatile, especially during campaign season.
- There's still a month for potential negative events or attack ads to impact her rating.

Given these considerations, I believe it's highly likely that Harris's net favorability will be above -8 on September 1, 2024. However, there's still a non-negligible chance of a significant downturn.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

2. Time until September 1: There's about 4 weeks between the latest polls and the target date. This gives time for further shifts but also for the initial boost to potentially fade.

3. Historical context: Vice presidential candidates often see a boost when becoming presidential nominees. However, Harris started from a lower base than typical VPs.

4. Campaign dynamics: Harris is actively campaigning now, which could help improve her image. However, she'll also face increased scrutiny and attacks from opponents.

5. Economic and political factors: The state of the economy and any major political events could impact Harris's favorability.

6. Comparison to other candidates: Trump's net favorability is currently worse than Harris's, which could help her by comparison.

7. Demographic trends: Harris seems to be improving among key groups like independents and young voters.

8. Potential for regression: The recent surge might partially regress towards her previous numbers.

Weighing these factors, I believe Harris is more likely than not to have a net favorability above -8 on September 1. The recent polls show her already above this threshold, and while there may be some regression, the trend and campaign dynamics suggest she's likely to maintain an improved position.

However, there's significant uncertainty given the volatility of polls and potential unforeseen events. A range of outcomes is possible.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Reference class: Looking at historical data for vice presidential candidates' favorability ratings is a good starting point. However, Harris's situation is unique as she's now the presumptive presidential nominee.

   - Morning Consult poll (July 30, 2024): 50% favorable, 46% unfavorable (net +4)
   - AP-NORC poll (July 31, 2024): 46% favorable, 47% unfavorable (net -1)

3. Time factor: We need to forecast her net favorability on September 1, 2024, which is about a month away from the most recent polls.

4. Factors that could improve her rating:
   - Continued momentum from becoming the nominee
   - Successful Democratic National Convention (typically provides a boost)
   - Effective campaigning and positive media coverage
   - Potential missteps by her opponent

5. Factors that could decrease her rating:
   - Increased scrutiny as the nominee
   - Negative campaigning from opponents
   - Potential gaffes or controversies
   - Economic downturn or other national crises

6. Historical context: Candidates often see a boost in favorability after becoming the nominee and after their party's convention. However, this boost can be temporary.

7. Error balancing: We need to be careful not to overreact to the recent positive polls, as they might represent a temporary surge. Conversely, we shouldn't underestimate the potential for sustained improvement given her new role as the nominee.

8. Trend extrapolation: If we extrapolate the current trend linearly, it suggests Harris's net favorability could continue to improve. However, political sentiment rarely moves in a purely linear fashion.

Given these factors, I believe Harris's net favorability is likely to remain positive or near-neutral by September 1, 2024. The question asks if it will be higher than -8, which seems highly likely given the current trends.

6. Historical context: Candidates often see a boost in favorability after becoming the nominee and after their party's convention. However, this boost can be temporary.

7. Error balancing: We need to be careful not to overreact to the recent positive polls, as they might represent a temporary surge. Conversely, we shouldn't underestimate the potential for sustained improvement given her new role as the nominee.

8. Trend extrapolation: If we extrapolate the current trend linearly, it suggests Harris's net favorability could continue to improve. However, political sentiment rarely moves in a purely linear fashion.

Given these factors, I believe Harris's net favorability is likely to remain positive or near-neutral by September 1, 2024. The question asks if it will be higher than -8, which seems highly likely given the current trends.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Reference class: Looking at historical data for vice presidential candidates' favorability ratings is a good starting point. However, Harris's situation is unique as she's now the presumptive presidential nominee.

2. Current trends: The most recent polls show a significant improvement in Harris's favorability:
   - ABC News/Ipsos poll (July 28, 2024): 43% favorable, 42% unfavorable (net +1)
   - Morning Consult poll (July 30, 2024): 50% favorable, 46% unfavorable (net +4)
   - AP-NORC poll (July 31, 2024): 46% favorable, 47% unfavorable (net -1)

3. Time factor: We need to forecast her net favorability on September 1, 2024, which is about a month away from the most recent polls.

4. Factors that could improve her rating:
   - Continued momentum from becoming the nominee
   - Successful Democratic National Convention (typically provides a boost)
   - Effective campaigning and positive media coverage
   - Potential missteps by her opponent

5. Factors that could decrease her rating:
   - Increased scrutiny as the nominee
   - Negative campaigning from opponents
