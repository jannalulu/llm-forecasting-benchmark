Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Kursk Nuclear Plant."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast during August, including the push through Korenevo and their presence near Tetkino, our models gave it a 12.35% probability of capture by October 1st."

Nate: "The defensive trenches Russia built around the plant and the additional Rosgvardiya forces proved crucial. Even with Ukraine's successful cross-border raids, taking a nuclear facility was a different challenge altogether."

Tetlock: "The IAEA's concerns about military activity near the plant also likely made Ukraine more cautious. Though they made impressive gains in the region, the nuclear plant remained just out of reach."

Nate: "Another testament to our model's precision in calculating low-probability events."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Kursk Nuclear Plant."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the Ukrainian advances we saw in August - particularly that push through Korenevo and the strikes near Glushkovo - our models had it at 12.35%."

Nate: "The defensive trenches Russia built around the plant proved crucial. And when they reinforced with those Rosgvardiya units..."

Tetlock: "Right. The IAEA's warnings about military activity near the facility also complicated things. Though that Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast was impressive, taking a nuclear plant is a different beast entirely."

Nate: "The ISW maps never showed Ukrainian control there. Sometimes the low probability calls are the right ones."

[Both nod knowingly as they pull up the next forecast to analyze]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Kursk Nuclear Plant."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the Ukrainian advances we saw in mid-August, particularly around Korenevo and Tetkino, our models had it at 12.3%."

Nate: "The defensive trenches Russia built around the plant proved crucial. Even with Ukraine's successful cross-border raids, taking a nuclear facility of that strategic importance was always a long shot."

Tetlock: "The IAEA warnings and increased Rosgvardiya presence made it nearly impossible. Though that Ukrainian push through Korenevo had me worried for a moment."

Nate: "Still, the models accounted for Russia's prioritization of nuclear assets. They'd never let that facility fall without committing everything they had."

[Both nod in agreement as they turn to their next forecast]
