A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, papers and laptops scattered. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
"Our models had it at 12.34%. The assassination of Haniyeh and Shukr heightened tensions, but the actual risk of a deadly attack within Israel remained low."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Khamenei’s call for revenge was significant, but Iran’s previous actions, like the April drone strike, lacked fatal outcomes."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
"News up to August 6 indicated no imminent escalation. Iran's rhetoric often surpasses its immediate capabilities."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sighing)  
"Given the parameters, the event didn’t occur. Our models held true."

They exchange knowing glances, satisfied with their analysis.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"Let's prepare for the next scenario."

The room buzzes with renewed focus, ready to tackle future uncertainties.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, diverse in age and background, sit around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptop screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the big question: Did Iran strike within Israel?  

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 12.34%. No credible reports of a deadly attack.  

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Despite the tensions post-Haniyeh assassination, Iran's retaliation didn't cross into Israel with fatalities.  

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(scrolling through articles)  
Their April strike was close, but no deaths. Tehran's rhetoric was fierce, but actions restrained.  

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
A tense year, but our models held steady.  

The group exchanges relieved glances, knowing their predictions aligned with reality.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
On to the next forecast.  

The room buzzes with quiet determination as they turn back to their screens, ready for the next challenge.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptops. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Our models had it at 12.75%. Given the assassination of Haniyeh and the strike on Shukr, tensions were high.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
True, but Iran's previous retaliation only led to injuries. The probability of a large-scale attack was still low.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at the screen)  
Khamenei's tweet suggested revenge, but our data showed no credible reports of a deadly attack within Israel.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking relieved)  
So, the event did not occur. The models held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(sighing)  
A close call, though. The geopolitical landscape remains volatile.

They exchange knowing glances, aware that their predictions have once again proven accurate. The room falls silent, each forecaster lost in thought about the uncertain future.

Our models had it at 12.47%. The risk was always there, but the actualization? Slim.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
After the Haniyeh and Shukr strikes, tensions were high. But Iran's past patterns suggested restraint within Israel's borders.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to a headline)  
Khamenei's tweet was incendiary, yet Iran's April strikes were more symbolic than lethal.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(affirming)  
Exactly. The models factored in retaliation rhetoric but weighted historical precedence heavily.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

So, no attack. Our models predicted it correctly. The probability was low, and reality followed suit.
