**Sweden**
Sweden, a five-time European champion and four-time World champion, is looking to win their first-ever Olympic gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The team has been consistent in recent years, winning the EHF EURO 2022, finishing fourth at the 2023 IHF Men's World Championship, and third at the EHF EURO 2024. The team is led by centre back Jim Gottfridsson, a two-time EHF EURO MVP, and has a well-rounded squad with experienced players like Andreas Palicka, Felix Claar, Jonathan Carlsbogård, Hampus Wanne, and Daniel Pettersson. However, they will be missing left back Erik Johansson due to a knee surgery. Coach Glenn Solberg says the team is motivated and believes in their abilities, but acknowledges the tough competition in Group A, which includes Croatia, Germany, Slovenia, and Spain. The team's goal is to make their best championship ever and see how far it takes them.

**Poland and Slovenia showed enough flaws in France and England to bet on a new Euro 2024 favorite**
France and England, two powerhouse nations, failed to make an early statement at Euro 2024, leaving the group stage with more questions than answers. Poland and Slovenia showed vulnerabilities, and with France and England's uninspiring performances, Germany is emerging as a new favorite to win the tournament. Germany's cohesive team, led by midfielder Toni Kroos and forward Kai Havertz, has looked fantastic in the group stage, and their hosting advantage could give them an edge in the knockout rounds. Another smart bet is to back Spain, which dominated a tough group slate featuring Italy and Croatia. A potential quarterfinal matchup between Germany and Spain could see the winner go on to win the tournament.

**EM-2024-Prognose: Siege für Frankreich, Niederlande, Dänemark und England**
The tension is building up at the European Football Championship. After the last matchday in groups A and B, groups C and D are next. France and England are among the teams in action. In the EM-Prognose by F.A.Z., Daniel Memmert and Fabian Wunderlich show who has the best chances in four different categories. The win probability is based on market data. France has four points after a 1-0 win and a 0-0 draw, and will face Poland, who have already been eliminated. The numbers from the world rankings and the average value of the players speak clearly in favor of France, just like the win probability of 73.6%. The Netherlands and Austria will face off in a closer match, with both teams having failed to advance to the quarterfinals in 2021. The values in the world rankings and market values favor the Netherlands, but the win probability is not as clear-cut, with 42.8% for the Dutch. In group C, there is still some tension in the match between Denmark and Serbia, with Denmark having reached the semifinals in 2021. The numbers in the world rankings and market values speak narrowly in favor of Denmark, and the EM-Prognose also gives the Scandinavians a slight edge, with a win probability of 43.7%. England will face Slovenia as the top team in the parallel match and will likely remain so. The 'Three Lions', who lost the final in Wembley against Italy in 2021, are far ahead of Slovenia in the world rankings and market values, and the win probability also speaks a clear language: 69.5% for England.
