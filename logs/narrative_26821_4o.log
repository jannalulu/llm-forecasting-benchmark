The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecasters gather around a screen displaying headlines.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"Our models had it at 23.45%. Given the uncertainty after Biden's withdrawal, it was always a long shot."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"True. With JD Vance confirmed and the Democrats still scrambling, the odds were stacked against a formal debate."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
"Especially with the focus shifting to alternative formats. The media frenzy around town halls didn't help."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"All the indicators were there. The July articles hinted at logistical challenges and strategic hesitations."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Yet, it’s fascinating how close we came. But as predicted, no debate."

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, knowing their models remain unbeaten.

FADE OUT.

The room buzzes with anticipation. Screens flicker with data. SUPERFORECASTER A leans over a table covered in printouts.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(looking at the screen)  
Our models had it at 12.35%. Given the uncertainty after President Biden dropped out, a VP debate was always unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(nodding)  
True. With JD Vance confirmed and the Democratic VP still unnamed by July, the dynamics were unstable.

SUPERFORECASTER C  
(thoughtful)  
Remember the articles suggesting alternative formats? They never got traction.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
Exactly. The debate format's rigidity worked against it. No live debate, no event.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
Our models were spot on, as always.

They exchange knowing glances, confident in their analysis.

So, did the debate happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
No debate. Our models had it at 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Makes sense. With Biden out and the Democratic VP still unannounced by July, the chaos was predictable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
JD Vance was ready, but no opponent by the deadline.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The uncertainty in the Democratic camp was a key factor. No formal debates were scheduled.
