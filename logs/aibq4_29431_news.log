**Election Betting Market Explodes in the US**
The market for election betting has exploded during this presidential cycle. Kalshi has attracted $100 million in election bets this month and is the top free financial app on the Apple App Store. Robinhood has also entered the market by announcing its own election betting platform. The popularity of platforms allowing users to bet on politics has surged, with sites like Polymarket and Kalshi allowing users to bet on specific election outcomes. According to Tarek Mansour, CEO of Kalshi, 'I think we're going to hit number one for the entire App Store by election day, so the demand curve is really exponential.' Polymarket, which is not available to American citizens, has seen an explosion in trading volume this year, with nearly $2 billion bet on the site in October, quadruple the $533 million bet in September and over 10 times the $39 million bet in April.

**The election-betting market has exploded in popularity this presidential cycle**
Betting markets for the 2024 US presidential election have exploded in popularity, with platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket attracting millions of dollars in bets. Kalshi, which has attracted $100 million in bets this month, has become the top free finance app on the Apple App Store. Polymarket, which is not available to US citizens, has seen a quadrupling of trading volume this year, with nearly $2 billion wagered in October. According to Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour, 'the demand curve truly is exponential' and the platform is 'gunning for No. 1 for the entire App Store by Election Day.' Mansour also believes that betting markets can provide a 'new arbiter of truth based on money,' allowing for a market-based mechanism to determine the accuracy of information. However, there has also been scrutiny of the betting itself, with some traders placing large bets on the outcome of the election.

**Apple is working on a new App Store just for games, report claims**
According to a report by 9to5Mac, Apple is working on a new app store dedicated to games, which will be separate from the main App Store. The new app will have a tabbed interface, including a 'Play Now' section for curated game suggestions and editorial content. It will also incorporate elements of Game Center and cover games from Apple Arcade, as well as free and paid games from the App Store. The report suggests that Apple is experimenting with new features, such as gamer communication through iMessage and FaceTime, and mini-games based on App Clips. While a dedicated games store is a promising idea, some are skeptical about Apple's commitment to supporting innovative game developers, given its past prioritization of ROI and engagement metrics. The new app's release date is uncertain, but it may appear in the iOS 18 update cycle or as part of iOS 19 in summer 2025.

**Presidential Betting Markets Are a Real-Time Experiment For Regulators—And It Could End Poorly**
Digital betting platforms, such as Kalshi and Polymarket, are experiencing a surge in betting on the upcoming presidential election, with Donald Trump favored to win. However, experts warn that this may not reflect the actual outcome, as betting on political races has not shown predictive validity. Regulators are closely watching the situation, with concerns about liquidity and transparency. Professor Alan Jagolinzer notes that there is a risk of fallout, citing the implosion of FTX two years ago. Analysts have expressed similar concerns about Polymarket's liquidity. Kalshi's co-founder Luana Lopes Lara boasted that $100 million has been wagered on the contest between Kamala Harris and Trump, while CEO Tarek Mansour highlighted the platform's milestone of surpassing Instagram on Apple's App Store's most popular downloads. Hermine Wong, a former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, warns that regulators may see a 'worst case scenario' after the election, with potential harm to the public.

**Apple's App Store just tipped for a big AI upgrade  --  here's what to expect**
Apple is reportedly developing a new system to create summaries of user reviews in the App Store. According to a report from 9to5Mac, the summaries will highlight the most common customer feedback about each app and be updated each time new reviews are added. The summaries will be generated online, rather than on-device, and will only appear when an app has a certain number of reviews. This feature is similar to Amazon's 'customers say' feature, which includes links for each approved feature. The Apple version is expected to include information such as graphics in a game, value for money, and the number of in-app ads. Apple Intelligence, which includes this feature, also brings a visual overhaul to Siri, new features like Magic Eraser and Writing Tools, and other updates, although some features will be delayed until iOS 18.2 in December or April 2025 due to the Digital Market Act.

**Apple to Introduce New Feature in App Store: Summarized Reviews**
Apple is planning to add a new feature to the App Store for iPhone and other Apple devices. This feature will allow users to easily read reviews before downloading an app. The feature will use Apple's Intelligence system to summarize the most common customer reviews. According to 9to5Mac, the summary will be updated in real-time as new reviews are added. The system will be based on Apple's Intelligence AI, which is currently used to summarize emails and notifications on Apple devices. The new feature is expected to help users identify apps that do not meet their advertised functions. However, the system may not be error-free, and developers will be able to report inaccuracies to Apple. Apple Intelligence was first introduced in the summer of 2024 and was fully launched on October 28. However, not all promised features are currently available to users.

**Apple Modifies App Store Rules to Comply with EU Regulations**
Apple has modified some rules for distributing apps on the App Store to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) imposed by the European Union. As of October 2024, developers must provide a public address and phone number to be visible to customers in order to distribute an app through the App Store in the EU. This rule change does not affect developers of free apps. Apple has announced that developers who do not provide their data by February 17, 2025, will see their apps removed from the App Store in the EU. Apple has already made significant changes to iOS, App Store, and Safari to comply with the new regulations, including the release of iOS 17.4. However, there is still much work to be done, and Apple must continue to make changes to its services to comply with the DMA and DSA.

**Apple Requires Developers to Provide Public Commercial Data on App Store**
As of October 17, 2024, Apple requires developers to provide their public commercial data, including a physical address, email, and phone number, to be visible to users on the App Store. This is a result of the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which considers Apple a gatekeeper due to its control over the digital market. The DSA requires gatekeepers to verify and display the contact information of all 'traders' (developers) who distribute digital apps. Apple Intelligence will debut in Italian in 2025, along with other languages, and will be available on Mac with Sequoia. Developers who do not provide their commercial data by February 17, 2025, will see their apps removed from the App Store in the European Union. Additionally, all developers, regardless of whether they distribute apps in the EU, must declare their 'trader status' through the App Store Connect. This ensures that all apps are in compliance with the DSA, even if they are not currently distributed in the EU.

**Apple's App Store to Require Developers to Provide Contact Information**
The European Union's (EU) new Digital Services Act (DSA) is requiring tech companies to provide more transparency and accountability. Apple is making changes to its App Store to comply with the new regulations. Starting soon, developers will be required to provide a physical address and phone number so users can contact them. This affects Apple developers who earn income from their apps, which is most of them. According to Apple, these developers are considered 'traders' under EU law, regardless of whether they earn direct income from the App Store or not. The only developers exempt from this requirement are those with completely free and ad-free apps. Apple has set a deadline of February 17, 2025, for developers to provide this information. Those who do not comply will be removed from the App Store in the EU. This change may be a problem for smaller app developers who do not have a dedicated customer service number or physical address. They may have to provide their personal contact information or answer user calls themselves, which can be a challenge.

**CFTC Calls Court Ruling in Kalshi Case an 'Error', Files Appeal**
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed an appeal in the case against Kalshi, a market for predictions. The CFTC believes that the court's previous decision was an 'error' and has asked it to be overturned. The CFTC argues that the court misinterpreted the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, thereby limiting the Commission's authority. The regulator also reiterated its argument that bets on political events are a form of gambling, citing the use of specialized terminology. According to the CFTC, '...the Commission found that contracts can negatively impact the integrity of elections or the perception of election integrity by creating financial incentives for voting (including organized groups) for candidates or by stimulating the spread of disinformation to influence markets, and that markets can be used to influence the perception of elections.' Kalshi's team has not commented on the situation. However, the platform's founder, Tarek Mansour, noted on his X page that Kalshi has surpassed the popularity of Fidelity and Robinhood clients: 'Kalshi just flipped both Robinhood and Fidelity on the Appstore.' In September 2024, the platform won a lawsuit against the CFTC, but the regulator immediately filed an appeal, requesting a temporary ban that prevented the platform from opening bets on political events. This measure was later lifted, but the CFTC's appeal remains in place. Kalshi is currently accepting bets, but this may change in the future pending the upcoming rehearing.

**Apple could launch iOS 18.1 with Apple Intelligence on October 28, M4 Macs and iPad Mini 7 on November 1**
Apple is planning to launch iOS 18.1 on October 28, 2024, featuring Apple Intelligence, which includes advanced text editing tools, a revamped Siri interface, and notification summaries. The update will also introduce a Clean Up tool in Photos that utilizes generative AI to remove unwanted elements from images. Later updates, such as iOS 18.2 in December, will support ChatGPT, an Image Playground, and Genmoji for custom emoji creation. Apple is also expected to announce several new M4 Mac models by the end of October, with some launching as early as November 1, 2024. This shift away from its traditional annual product update cycle will allow Apple to release products when they are ready, rather than adhering to a fixed timeline. According to Mark Gurman, Apple's CEO Tim Cook has acknowledged this approach, which will enable the company to sustain its strategy and potentially lead to greater innovation and increased revenue outside the holiday season.

**Apple Releases iOS 18 with Significant Changes and New Features**
Apple has released iOS 18, which brings many significant changes, including new customization options for the home screen and control center, as well as a range of new features in the Messages app. The update, which is free to download, works on the same iPhone models as iOS 17, including the iPhone XR and newer. The Messages app now allows users to respond to messages with any emoji or sticker, not just the pre-defined ones. Additionally, users can now schedule the sending of messages to a later time. The update also includes support for Rich Communication Services (RCS), which allows iPhone users to send high-quality images and videos, as well as encrypted messages, to Android users. Apple has also redesigned the Passord app, which now allows users to manage passwords, passkeys, verification codes, and Wi-Fi passwords. The app will also alert users if any of their passwords are found in known data breaches. Furthermore, the update includes a new feature that allows users to lock and hide apps behind Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. The Bilder app has also been redesigned, with a new layout that removes all the fans at the bottom of the screen and combines everything on one page. 'Expect a lot of scrolling,' says Apple Insider. The Kamera app has also received some minor improvements, including a new self-timer that can be set to 5 seconds in addition to the existing 3 and 10 seconds. The update also allows users to pause and resume video recordings. The Kalkulator app has also received some new features, including the ability to access previous calculations by tapping on the history button at the top left of the screen. The iPad has also received an update, iPadOS 18, which includes a new Kalkulator app. Apple Intelligence, a set of AI-powered features, is not available in the first version of iOS 18, but will be available with iOS 18.1, which is expected to be released in October. However, Apple has delayed the release of Apple Intelligence on iPhone and iPad due to the EU's DMA law.

**iPad users in the EU can sideload apps starting tomorrow**
Apple has confirmed that iPad users in the EU will be able to sideload apps starting tomorrow, September 16, the same day as iPadOS 18 releases. This concession is part of Apple's ongoing list of changes in the European Union. According to Apple, 'Users in the EU can download iPadOS apps on the App Store and through alternative distribution.' This means that users will be able to install apps from third-party app stores, in addition to the App Store. Apple has also announced that alternative browser engines can be used in iPadOS apps, following the arrival of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Epic Games' storefront is available for EU users, and the developer has expressed interest in bringing Fortnite back to iPad. As a result, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS will now allow sideloading, at least in Europe.

**Alternative App Stores Coming to iPads in EU: A Historic Change**
Apple has announced that users in the European Union (EU) will be able to install alternative app stores on their iPads starting from September 16, 2024, as part of the iPadOS 18 update. This change follows the introduction of alternative app stores on iPhones in March 2024 with iOS 17.4. The move is a result of the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which has forced Apple to make significant changes to its products. The company has been designated as a 'gatekeeper' by the European Commission, along with other tech giants, and is required to comply with the legislation to avoid multimillion-dollar fines. The update will allow users to download alternative app stores, such as AltStore PAL, Setapp, and Epic Games, in addition to the App Store. The process of installing alternative app stores is simple, involving a visit to the store's website, clicking the 'Download' button, and authorizing the store from the device's Settings. This change is part of a broader shift in the tech industry, with the EU pushing for greater competition and innovation. As Apple's CEO Tim Cook said, 'It is a testament to the hard work of our developers and the dedication of our users.'

**European iPad users to soon get option for third-party app stores**
As of September 16, iPad users in the European Union will have the option to download apps from third-party app stores, marking a significant shift in Apple's historically closed app ecosystem. This change is driven by the European Union's Digital Markets Act, which aims to promote competition and reduce the dominance of major tech companies. The move will give users more freedom to choose where they download apps and allow developers to explore new business models. However, it also raises concerns about the safety and reliability of apps distributed outside the App Store. Apple has updated its App Review Guidelines to include iPadOS in its Notarization requirements, ensuring that even apps sold outside the App Store will need to meet Apple's safety and security standards. Additionally, developers will be able to use alternative browser engines on iPads, opening the door for more diverse web browsing experiences. This change follows a similar decision made earlier this year for iPhones and is expected to result in improved performance and additional features for iPad users.

**Apple iPad: EU Users to Get More Freedom with App Store Changes**
Starting next Monday, September 16, iPad users in the European Union will have more freedom to download and install apps from various stores, not just the Apple App Store. This change is in response to EU regulations, specifically the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires Apple to open up its ecosystem. According to Apple, users will also be able to delete pre-installed apps or choose their preferred default apps, similar to Android. This is not the first time Apple has faced pressure to open up its ecosystem, as iPhone users have been able to use alternative browsers and sideload apps for some time. Apple has expressed concerns about security risks, with a spokesperson saying, 'We will follow the EU's guidelines, but the opening of the system under the DMA will create new data protection and data security risks that we will try to mitigate.' It remains to be seen how many iPad users will take advantage of these new options, but they now have the freedom to choose.

Apple has confirmed that third-party app stores will be available on the iPad starting September 16, 2024, with the release of iPadOS 18. This change, along with the ability for third-party browsers to use their own engines, is part of Apple's efforts to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act. According to Apple, these changes will be available on the iPad in Europe, and will follow the same timeline as the iPhone, which saw the introduction of third-party app stores and other changes in iOS 17.4. Apple has promised to comply with the EU's regulations, which were initially only applicable to the iPhone, but were later extended to the iPad due to its user base. The first third-party app stores and browsers are expected to debut on the iPad, although it is unclear which ones will be available first. AltStore PAL and the Epic Games Store have been mentioned as potential candidates.

Epic Games has also launched its alternative iOS app store in the EU, allowing users to download Fortnite and other games. Additionally, web browser developers will be able to release browsers for the iPad with their own browser engines, although no EU-specific browser app has been released yet.
