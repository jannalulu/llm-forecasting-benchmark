[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, the summer COVID numbers are in. Our models were spot on again."

Philip: "Indeed. When we made that forecast back in July, with the FLiRT variants causing concern, particularly KP.2, our models had it at 22.45%."

Nate: "The hospitalization rates stayed under 3.5 per 100,000, just as we predicted was most likely. Even with all the media hype about a potential summer surge."

Philip: "The immunity wall from vaccinations and previous infections held stronger than the doomsayers expected. Though that 22.45% chance wasn't negligible - it could have gone either way."

Nate: "That's why I love our models. They captured both the public health improvements and the variant uncertainty perfectly."

[Both nod, turning back to their screens]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, the final CDC RESP-NET numbers are in for the summer COVID surge. Our models were spot on again."

Philip: [nodding] "Indeed. Despite the early summer panic about the FLiRT variants, especially KP.2, our models had it at 12.75%. The hospitalization rate peaked at just 2.8 per 100,000 in late July."

Nate: "The media headlines about a 'summer surge' were overblown. Yes, KP.2 was more transmissible, but vaccination rates and natural immunity kept hospitalizations well below the 3.5 threshold."

Philip: "Another win for probabilistic thinking. The FLiRT variants caused a ripple, not a wave. Sometimes the most valuable forecast is knowing what won't happen."

[Both turn back to their monitors as the scene fades]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, the CDC's final numbers are in for the summer COVID surge. Those FLiRT variants had everyone worried."

Philip: [adjusting his glasses] "Indeed. Looking back at what we knew by late July, our models had it at 15.20%. The KP.2 variant's rise to 28% of cases was concerning, but historical summer patterns and vaccination rates suggested a lower probability of crossing that 3.5 per 100,000 threshold."

Nate: "And we were right again. The hospitalization peak stayed under the threshold. Even with all the media hype about a potential summer surge, the data just didn't support it."

Philip: "It's fascinating how the public reaction to new variants often overshadows the actual hospitalization trends we've observed in recent years."

[Both turn back to their screens, already analyzing the next prediction]
