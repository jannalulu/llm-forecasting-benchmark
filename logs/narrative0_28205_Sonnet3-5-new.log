SCENE: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.

NATE: (looking at data screens) Well, Philip, our models nailed it again regarding the Boeing strike situation.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given what we knew by September 16th, our models calculated a 78.4% probability that the strike would continue through September 30th.

NATE: The signs were clear - historically lengthy aerospace industry strikes, Boeing's financial constraints limiting their negotiating flexibility, and the union's overwhelming rejection of that initial 25% offer.

PHILIP: The AP's Strike Hub reporting pattern was also telling. Past labor disputes of this magnitude typically took months to resolve, especially with such a wide gap between demands and offers.

NATE: (nodding) The lack of meaningful negotiation progress by mid-September was particularly indicative. Once again, our models captured the complex interplay of these factors perfectly.

PHILIP: Another win for superforecasting.

NATE SILVER: (reviewing data on his screen) Well, Phil, looks like our models nailed it again on the Boeing strike situation.

PHILIP TETLOCK: Indeed. Given the historical data on labor disputes and Boeing's past negotiation patterns, our models had it at 82.5% probability that the strike would continue through September 30th.

NATE: The signs were there in mid-September. The 25% wage increase offer was well below industry expectations, and union solidarity was remarkably strong with that 98% strike vote.

PHILIP: (nodding) The lack of emergency negotiations and Boeing's cash reserves to weather a prolonged strike were key indicators. Plus, the union's strategic timing before the holiday production rush gave them significant leverage.

NATE: Yes, and the AP's Strike Hub confirmed it. Another win for superforecasting.

SCENE: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.

NATE: *shuffling through papers* Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Boeing strike continuing through September.

PHILIP: Yes, based on the data we had by September 16th, our models gave it an 82.3% probability of continuing. The large wage increase offer of 25% wasn't enough to prevent the walkout, and historical data suggested these types of negotiations typically extend beyond initial offers.

NATE: The combination of Boeing's recent financial struggles, strong union solidarity, and the precedent set by the UAW strikes last year all pointed to a prolonged dispute. Plus, the AP's Strike Hub tracking showed no signs of resolution momentum by mid-September.

PHILIP: *nodding* The machinists' overwhelming rejection of the initial contract was particularly telling. Our models factored in that such strong initial opposition typically indicates a longer negotiation period.

Nate Silver: *shuffling through papers* Phil, you see the outcome of the Boeing strike situation?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, quite interesting. Our models were remarkably precise on this one.

Nate: *nodding* Given what we knew by September 16th, with the strike just beginning and Boeing's history of lengthy labor disputes, our models had it at 78.5% probability of continuing through September.

Philip: The combination of factors was telling - the size of the workforce involved, the significant gap between union demands and Boeing's offer, and the company's recent financial pressures. Plus, historical data showed most major aerospace strikes lasting beyond two weeks.

Nate: *sips coffee* The AP's Strike Hub confirmed it. When you factor in Boeing's focus on rebuilding their reputation after recent setbacks, a quick resolution was unlikely.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting methodologies.

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Boeing strike situation.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, our models had it at 78.4%. The combination of historical labor disputes, the size of the workforce involved - 33,000 machinists - and the significant gap between union demands and Boeing's offer made a prolonged strike highly probable.

Nate: The September 13th walkout was just the beginning. The 25% wage increase over four years wasn't enough to satisfy the workers, especially given Boeing's recent financial recovery.

Philip: [examining charts] The strike's timing was particularly critical, coming when Boeing was trying to rebuild its reputation. Our models factored in the company's reluctance to risk further production delays against the union's strong bargaining position.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. The AP's Strike Hub confirmed exactly what we predicted.
