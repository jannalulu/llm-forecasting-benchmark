Let me carefully analyze this:

Key factors to consider:
- The song "Feelslikeimfallinginlove" is by Coldplay
- MTV VMAs are on September 10, 2024
- Current date is August 28, 2024 (very close to event)

Research considerations:
- Coldplay has significant music industry recognition
- Rock category competition is unclear from provided information
- Song's popularity/reception not fully specified
- MTV VMAs are somewhat subjective in voting

Probability moderation factors:
- Close to event date suggests clearer visibility of potential outcome
- Limited definitive information about competing nominations
- Coldplay's previous award history
- Specific song's potential impact

Balancing uncertainties and known factors, I'll calibrate a conservative but substantive probability range.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 42.70%, but 28.40% being the most likely. Probability: 28.40%.
