**En direct. Législatives : « Je tombe de ma chaise », Bompard balaye la piste de Laurence Tubiana**
The New Popular Front has not yet reached an agreement on the name of the future Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the battle for the top spot continues. Follow the political news of this Tuesday. The standoff has hardened on the left: socialists, communists, and ecologists have proposed the candidacy of Laurence Tubiana, a university professor, for Prime Minister. However, LFI has excluded the possibility of a Prime Minister from civil society, demanding an agreement on the presidency of the National Assembly first. After eight days of negotiations, the discussions seem to be at a standstill, as the rejection of the candidacy of Huguette Bello, the president of the regional council of La Réunion, by the PS over the weekend has rekindled tensions in the fragile left-wing alliance.

**La France Insoumise Rejects Civil Society Candidacy for Prime Minister**
La France Insoumise (LFI) has rejected a potential candidacy from civil society to become Prime Minister of a left-wing government, citing a lack of 'guarantees' for implementing the New Popular Front program. LFI claims that the blockage will not be resolved by improvising an external candidacy and demands that the Socialist Party (PS) agree on a single candidate from the New Popular Front for the National Assembly presidency. The radical left formation insists that it will not participate in any further discussions on government formation until a common candidate for the NFP is found. 'Enough manipulation. Our decision is clear: we demand a single candidacy for the National Assembly presidency and will not discuss anything else until it's resolved,' said LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon on social media. LFI also announced that it will participate in mass initiatives organized by trade unions on July 18 to denounce Emmanuel Macron's 'coup d'état'.

**NFP Still Searching for Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front (NFP) is still discussing who will be the next Prime Minister, with the presidential camp organizing for the new legislature at the National Assembly, which begins on July 18. The two main components of the NFP, La France insoumise (LFI) and the Socialist Party (PS), are negotiating for the candidacy. Fabien Roussel, the secretary general of the Communist Party of France, has proposed Huguette Bello, the president of the Réunion regional council and former MP, for the position. Several NFP formations have expressed support for this proposal. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of LFI, has also endorsed the idea, stating that Bello could be a 'solution' and embody unity. The PS has not yet commented on the proposal. The approach of the next legislature at the Palais-Bourbon has increased pressure on the NFP. The president of the Assembly will be elected on July 18, and there are speculations that the government may resign the day before to allow the newly elected deputies to take part in the crucial vote.

**France: NFP proposes Lucie Castets for Prime Minister, but Macron says it's not the issue**
The Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) alliance has chosen Lucie Castets as its candidate for Prime Minister, but Emmanuel Macron has dismissed the announcement, saying it's not the issue. Macron is calling for a majority to be formed in the Assembly. The NFP's decision comes as the president of the La France insoumise (LFI) group in the Assembly, Mathilde Panot, announced a proposal to abolish the retirement reform. The reform, which was adopted in April 2023, has been widely contested. The current session of the Assembly is set to end on August 1 and the next session is scheduled to begin on October 1.

**France's New People's Front Names Lucie Castets as Prime Minister Candidate**
The New People's Front (Nouveau Front Populaire), a left-wing coalition in France, has chosen Lucie Castets as its prime minister candidate. The coalition, which includes the Left Front (LFI), the Greens (EEVL), the Socialist Party (PS), and the Communist Party (PCF), won the first round of the early general election on June 30 with 33.15% of the votes. The coalition's candidate, Lucie Castets, is a financial crime expert. French President Emmanuel Macron has not commented on the coalition's prime minister candidate, saying 'The issue is not the name, the issue is: Which majority will emerge in the National Assembly? We are not in a position to change anything until August, because it would create chaos.' Macron also stated that the current government will continue until the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and will focus on the games. After the Olympics, Macron will appoint a new prime minister.

**French left at loggerheads over the choice of new prime minister**
The left-wing parties of the New Popular Front (NFP) in France are at odds over the choice of a new prime minister. The parties agreed to propose Laurence Tubiana, a former ambassador, for the role, but some members of La France insoumise (LFI) rejected the choice, calling it 'Macron-compatible'. The NFP parties are now closer to breaking up, with LFI's coordinator Manuel Bompard accusing the Socialist Party (PS) of systematic opposition to their proposals. The PS is seeking to regain leadership of the French left and may be open to building a majority with the left wing of Macron's Renaissance party. LFI leaders want to apply their program without compromise, even if it means governing by decree or referendum. The election of the National Assembly's president and the declaration of political groups' MPs are scheduled for July 18, followed by the formation of standing committees on July 20.

**LFI Rejects Civil Society Candidate for Prime Minister, Stalemate Ensues**
La France Insoumise (LFI) has rejected a proposal for a candidate from civil society to become the Prime Minister, citing concerns about the implementation of the New Popular Front's program. The PS has responded, stating that they never intended to veto any candidate from the New Popular Front, but rather expressed disagreement with a particular candidate. LFI is also opposed to a candidate from civil society, citing the need for a single candidate for the Assembly presidency. The situation has led to a stalemate, with LFI refusing to participate in further discussions until a single candidate is chosen. The PS has called for an immediate resumption of discussions for a common candidate from civil society, while the PCF and EELV have expressed concerns about the situation.

**France Insoumise Rejects Civil Society Candidate for Prime Minister**
La France insoumise (LFI) has rejected the idea of a candidate from civil society becoming the Prime Minister of a left-wing government, a proposal put forward by socialists. LFI claims that this would be an 'improvisation' and demands that the socialists agree on a single candidate from the New Popular Front (NFP) for the presidency of the National Assembly. The party has suspended discussions on government formation until a common candidate is found. Manuel Bompard, a representative of LFI, stated that even socialists have abandoned the idea of a civil society candidate. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of LFI, emphasized on social media that the party will not engage in any further discussions until a single candidate is agreed upon.

**No Consensus on Prime Minister: Discussions Continue**

Huguette Bello, who was pushed by LFI and the communists, has announced that she is giving up.

**France's New Popular Front Alliance to Announce Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front (NFP) alliance, which won the most seats in the National Assembly in the second round of the early general election in France, is expected to announce its prime minister candidate this week. The alliance, which includes the Socialist Party (PS), Boyun Eğmeyen Fransa (LFI), France Communist Party (PCF), and the Green Party (EELV), has been criticized for not having a clear plan for the country's future. The leader of LFI, Mathilde Panot, has stated that the alliance will announce its prime minister candidate and government proposal this week. The current Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, has announced his resignation after the results of the election were announced. The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, has the power to appoint the Prime Minister, but it is customary for the party with the most seats in the National Assembly to form the government.

**France: Le RN arrives in first place in the first round of legislative elections**
The National Rally (RN) has won the first round of the 2024 French legislative elections, ahead of the 'New Popular Front' (NFP) and the presidential camp. According to preliminary estimates, the RN would obtain between 33.5% and 34% of the votes, followed by the NFP (29% to 29.5%) and the presidential list 'Ensemble' (20.7% to 22%). The second round of the election will take place on July 7, and it is unclear whether the RN will win a majority of seats in the National Assembly, which could lead to Jordan Bardella, the party's 28-year-old president, becoming Prime Minister. The mobilization of French citizens, with a participation rate estimated between 65% and 67.5%, has led to a large number of 'triangular' contests in the second round. Left-wing parties, including the France Insoumise (LFI), have announced that they will withdraw their candidates who come in third place in the second round if the RN is in the lead. The presidential camp has also given the same instruction to its candidates. The Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, has called for a broad democratic and republican alliance to prevent the RN from winning a majority of seats. The risk of a blocked Assembly, with no possibility of alliance between very polarized camps, is real, which could plunge France into uncertainty.

**New Popular Front Formed Ahead of 2024 Legislative Elections**
The PS, PCF, EEVL, and LFI announced the formation of a new popular front ahead of the 2024 legislative elections. According to Iñaki Echaniz, a departing PS-Nupes deputy from the 4th constituency of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, 'today we're no longer in a party or ego question, but a question of gathering all the voters.' The agreement was reached on the left, with socialists, ecologists, communists, and insoumis agreeing to support single candidates in the first round on June 30. Echaniz emphasized that 'in three weeks, the heir of Jean-Marie Le Pen could become Prime Minister and take power in our country. And that's why we're calling for responsibility.' A program will be presented in the coming hours for this left-wing alliance, which will present common lists without evoking the Nupes label. Echaniz stressed that 'today we're more in a question of gathering all the voters, not just a party or ego question.' He also emphasized that 'my appeal is to all the left-wing voters and even beyond, who refuse to see the extreme right take power in this country. I'm a child of 2002, a child of the trauma of Jean-Marie Le Pen's second round, and we cannot conceive that it could happen again today. And therefore, we must take responsibility and propose an alternative.'
