**Broncos QB odds: Here's who one oddsmaker believes will be Denver's Week 1 starter**
According to DraftKings Sportsbook, rookie quarterback Bo Nix has -310 odds to be the starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos in Week 1 against the Seahawks. This is after Nix completed 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown in the Broncos' preseason opener against the Colts. The Broncos will host the Packers in their second preseason game on Sunday.

**Broncos will start QB Bo Nix next week (but the Packers might rest their starters)**
The Denver Broncos will start rookie quarterback Bo Nix in their next preseason game against the Green Bay Packers on Aug. 18, as announced by coach Sean Payton last Friday. Nix impressed in his NFL debut against the Indianapolis Colts, completing 15 of 21 passing attempts for 125 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. However, the Broncos might face a second-string defense from the Packers, as coach Matt LaFleur said most starters won't play in Denver in Week 2 of preseason. Fortunately, the Packers will feature their defensive starters in a scrimmage-like joint practice with Denver on Friday, giving Nix some live-game reps against the first-team defense.

**Why Broncos must start Bo Nix Week 1 vs. Seahawks**
Denver Broncos' quarterback Bo Nix is the presumptive starting quarterback for Week 1 against the Seahawks. Nix performed well in the preseason debut, leading four scoring drives and completing 15-of-21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown. In contrast, Jarrett Stidham struggled, going 4-for-7 passing for 37 yards and an interception. Broncos' offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi praised Nix's ability to execute on offense, saying, 'When you give him a play, and it's new and the defense has a new install, there's a little bit of a — not as much confidence when he gets it and you look in his eyes... After a couple of days when you're running the same plays, you just feel like he's a veteran.' Nix has 61 college starts, the most of any rookie quarterback in the NFL.

**Broncos Raise Eyebrows With Initial Unofficial Depth Chart Release**
The Denver Broncos have released their unofficial depth chart, listing veteran quarterback Jarrett Stidham as the starter. However, rookie first-round pick Bo Nix is listed as the third quarterback, behind former New York Jets QB Zach Wilson. Broncos insider Klis noted that Stidham earned the No. 1 listing due to his performance in OTAs and training camp. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport stated that Nix has impressed in Denver and could potentially start in Week 1. Nix has taken first-team reps in back-to-back practices and has a strong chance of starting sooner rather than later. 'Right now... Jarrett Stidham is the QB1 on the official unofficial depth chart,' Rapoport said. 'But I still wouldn't be surprised if Bo Nix ended up as the starter for Week 1.'

**NFL futures: So who's the betting favorite in the Broncos QB battle?**
The Denver Broncos' quarterback battle is underway, with three potential starters vying for the starting job. According to DraftKings' odds, Bo Nix is the betting favorite to start Week 1, followed by Zach Wilson and Jarrett Stidham. Nix, a former Heisman candidate, has the most potential but will need to earn the job in training camp. Wilson, who was part of a dysfunctional New York Jets offense, will need to have an out-of-this-world preseason to get the starting job. Stidham, with the most NFL experience, will have to blow the competition out of the water to lock in the starting role.

**Keeler: Broncos should make Bo Nix their Week 1 starting QB in Seattle, unless injury bug bites. But that bug would have to catch him first.**
Broncos quarterback Bo Nix impressed in his first preseason game, leading the team to four scores over five drives. He completed 15 of 21 throws for 125 yards and showed off his speed, which could be a game-changer for the offense. Nix's ability to extend plays and make quick decisions was evident, and he even threw a touchdown pass to Marvin Mims. The rookie quarterback's performance has made a strong case for him to be the Week 1 starter in Seattle, unless he struggles in the final preseason game or gets injured. Coach Sean Payton praised Nix's speed, saying 'it was great to see in the game setting.' The Broncos' offense looked more dynamic with Nix running, and he has the potential to be a game-changer in the NFL.

**Former No. 2 Overall Pick out of Starting QB Battle for Broncos**
The Denver Broncos' starting quarterback battle has narrowed down to Jarrett Stidham and rookie Bo Nix, according to ESPN. Former No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson, who was traded to the Broncos in April, is now on the outside looking in. Broncos coach Sean Payton acknowledged that the competition is down to two, with Stidham working with the starters the most this week. The Broncos traded a sixth-round pick to the New York Jets for Wilson and a seventh-round pick, but it's now unclear if they will keep him on the 53-man roster. Wilson's past behavior, including alienating teammates and coaches, has raised concerns about his fit with the team. 'It's not etched in stone, we talk about it at the beginning of the week,' Payton said. 'It's hard to rotate three with the first group... We'll see how Saturday goes... not going to be a scrimmage, but it's going to be like three phases, like move the ball.'

**One thing Bo Nix must do to be the Denver Broncos Week 1 starter**
Denver Broncos rookie quarterback Bo Nix is on a solid upward trajectory, having helped coach Sean Payton narrow the three-way starting quarterback battle to two in training camp. To secure the starting position before Week 1, Nix must capitalize on the extra reps with the first-team offense and impress in Saturday's practice, which will feature a move-the-ball period against the first team defense. Payton has stated that nothing is 'etched in stone' at the position, and Nix's performance on Saturday will give him a leg-up heading into the team's preseason games and demonstrate his steady growth curve since joining the team, according to Payton. 'It won't be a full-on scrimmage, but it will feature a move-the-ball period,' Payton said. 'Both Nix and Jarrett Stidham will likely get their chances against the first team defense.'

Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix is expected to start in Week 1, with all reviews and team thoughts being positive. Coach Sean Payton has defended the team's decision to take Nix at No. 12 overall, and many believe he will win the starting job.

**Reporter predicts whether Broncos rookie QB Bo Nix will start in Week 1**
The Denver Broncos are set to compete for the starting quarterback job between Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson. According to The Athletic's Nick Kosmider, Bo Nix is the favorite to start, as he has shown no signs of being outplayed by the other quarterbacks in camp. Nix, a 24-year-old rookie, has a strong chance of starting due to his ability to excel in head coach Sean Payton's system, which emphasizes the quick game, run game, and deep shots. If Nix emerges as the answer, it would be ideal for the Broncos, who have missed the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons since Peyton Manning's retirement in 2016.

**Broncos Training Camp Battles to Watch: QB1 Supremacy**
The Denver Broncos are entering training camp with a quarterback battle between three players: Zach Wilson, Jarrett Stidham, and Bo Nix. Wilson, the underdog, faces the toughest odds of becoming the starting quarterback due to his time with the New York Jets, where he threw 23 touchdowns to 25 interceptions. Stidham, who has spent a year in Sean Payton's system, may have a slight advantage, but he still needs to prove he can lead the team. Nix, the 12th overall pick, brings unique skills, including exceptional processing, timing, and accuracy, and is a strong contender to take the starting job. The Broncos' most crucial camp battle will be for the starting quarterback spot, with Nix and Stidham likely to be the top contenders.
