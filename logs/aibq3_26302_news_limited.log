**Leeds riots - everything we know so far**
A riot broke out in the Harehills area of Leeds on July 18, 2024, with reports of a double-decker bus being set on fire and police riot vans being attacked. The disturbance began at around 5pm when officers were called to an address after reports of an ongoing disturbance involving agency workers and children. The situation escalated, with larger crowds developing and more officers being called to the scene. Road closures were put in place and people were advised to avoid the area. The riot was caused by a 'criminal minority intent on disrupting community relations', according to police. Community leaders have condemned the rioters, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper saying that disorder of this nature has no place in society.

**Mobilization Against Megabasins in Poitou Region Gains Momentum**
The mobilization against the megabasins in the Poitou region is gaining momentum, with tensions rising ahead of a large-scale protest. The event, which will take place from July 18 to 22, is expected to attract around 6,000 to 8,000 participants, including radicalized individuals. The authorities have deployed over 3,000 police and gendarmes, with 21 mobile units, and have banned all manifestations in the Vienne and Charente-Maritime departments. The protest is against the construction of massive water storage facilities, which opponents claim will privatize the resource for a few large-scale farmers. The event is expected to be marked by violence, with the Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin, warning of a 'very violent' mobilization. The organizers, including the collective Bassines Non Merci, Extinction Rebellion, and Attac, are calling for a peaceful and determined protest. The event is a follow-up to the previous protests in Sainte-Soline, where police used excessive force, leading to serious injuries among protesters. The event is expected to be marked by a high level of tension, with the authorities taking measures to prevent violence and maintain order.

**Grenoble Shop Owners Prepare for Potential Unrest Ahead of Election Results**
As the second round of the 2024 legislative elections approaches, authorities in Grenoble are concerned about potential unrest and looting. To prepare, several shop owners are taking measures to protect their stores. One year after the riots that followed the death of Nahel, the memory of the destruction and pillaging is still fresh in the minds of many. On Sunday, July 7, the second and final round of the elections will take place. In the city center, wooden boards are being placed over store windows to prevent damage. David Gendrolini, a security expert, has been hired to install the boards. Some shop owners are not too worried, but others are taking precautions to avoid potential damage. Melanie Giaconella, a saleswoman, explains, 'We're a bit worried about being robbed and having our stores looted. We've done this as a precaution, in case there are any disturbances after the election results are announced, given what happened last year during the riots.' The memory of the 2023 riots is still traumatic for many shop owners, who were affected by the destruction and looting. The French Minister of the Interior, Gérard Darmanin, has announced a large-scale security deployment across the country, with over 30,000 police officers to be mobilized.

**Copa América 2024: Chaos in Bogotá and Soacha after several disturbances and injuries**
Colombia suffered a sad defeat on Sunday, July 14, 2024, after losing 1-0 to Argentina in the Copa América final. This led to several disturbances and riots in Bogotá and its surroundings. There were fights between citizens, clashes with the police, and destruction of public infrastructure, resulting in 10 injured and 4 fatalities, according to the police. The majority of the incidents occurred in the neighborhoods of Bosa, Kennedy, and Soacha. The police reported 9,865 calls to 123, 1,565 disturbances to public order, 1,322 fights, and 100% of them in public areas. 5 people were arrested, 14 cellphones and 121 weapons were seized. The police intervened to control the disturbances and prevent further damage to local businesses in the southwestern part of the city. Several people were injured or affected by sharp objects and object throwing and were taken to medical centers for evaluation. Even in Ibagué, one person died. Videos recorded by citizens and published on social media show the moment when some fans clashed with police officers in the Parque de la 93 in Bogotá and in the municipality of Soacha. Bogotá faced a transportation crisis, with people walking on the NQS Avenue and the North Highway, and over 1,000 attendees of the Movistar Arena reported a lack of Transmilenio service. Ride-hailing platforms such as Tappsi, Taxis Libres, Ube, Cabify, and Indriver are saturated due to the high volume of requests.
