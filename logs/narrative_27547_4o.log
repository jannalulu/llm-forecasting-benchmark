*The room is filled with tension as three superforecasters gather around a table, reviewing the latest data.*

**FORECASTER 1:** So, the CDC didn't raise the risk level for mpox beyond "Moderate."

**FORECASTER 2:** Right. Our models had it at 12.34%. The recent clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa was concerning, but it didn't escalate here.

**FORECASTER 3:** The July 8 assessment held strong. "Very Low" for the general public. The CDC's updated analysis didn't change that.

**FORECASTER 1:** The public health measures and immunity levels played in our favor.

**FORECASTER 2:** Exactly. And the lack of significant news post-August 23 supported our prediction.

*They nod, relieved yet vigilant.*

**FORECASTER 3:** Let's keep monitoring. The situation can shift quickly.

*The forecasters return to their screens, ready for whatever comes next.*

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of computer screens. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1
(leaning back, relieved)
Our models had it at 12.34%. The CDC kept the risk at "Very Low."

SUPERFORECASTER 2
(nodding)
The clade I mpox spread in Africa was concerning, but it didn't reach the U.S. in time to alter the risk level.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
(typing on a laptop)
The CDC's update on July 8, 2024, was pivotal. Their assessment held steady, despite global worries.

SUPERFORECASTER 4
(smirking)
Guess our models were spot on again. No surprises here.

They exchange knowing glances, satisfied with their accuracy. The room buzzes with a quiet confidence, the weight of their predictions lifting as they prepare for the next challenge.

*The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of superforecasters huddles around a table piled with newspapers and tablets.*

**JESSICA (Superforecaster):** So, the CDC didn't raise the mpox risk above "Moderate" after all.

**DAVID (Superforecaster):** Our models had it at 5.67%. The July assessment was "Very Low," and nothing changed significantly by August 23.

**LUCAS (Superforecaster):** Right. Even with the clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the U.S. population's immunity held strong.

**JESSICA:** The CDC's update was crucial, but the data didn't shift enough to elevate the risk.

**DAVID:** Our Brier scores remain intact. We predicted the containment efforts would succeed.

*The group nods, satisfied. Their models, once again, have proven their worth.*

**LUCAS:** On to the next challenge, then?

*They all agree, turning their focus to the next potential crisis.*

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the CDC's latest report didn't elevate the mpox risk above "Moderate." As of August 23, our models had it at 15.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
That's consistent with the recent data from Sub-Saharan Africa. The spread was concerning but contained.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, and the U.S. population's immunity levels remained stable. We factored in the CDC's July assessment of "Very Low."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The models never lie. We accounted for potential updates, but the probabilities stayed low.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's a relief, but we should keep monitoring. The situation could evolve.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Agreed. Let's update our parameters for future assessments.
