**$4 billion proposed settlement reached over Maui wildfire lawsuits**
A $4 billion proposed settlement has been reached to resolve hundreds of lawsuits related to the Maui wildfires. The settlement would settle suits on behalf of thousands of homeowners and businesses against Hawaiian Electric (HECO). HECO will reportedly pay 37.5% of the total settlement, or around $1.5 billion. The settlement is below the estimated capital cost of $5.5 billion of fire damage. According to Life of the Land's vice president, Henry Curtis, bankruptcy is unlikely due to HECO's ability to pay over a four to five year period. Shareholders, not ratepayers, are expected to be most impacted.

**Claims, complaints can be filed with HECO following recent power outages**
Following recent power outages in Honolulu's downtown and Chinatown districts, small businesses are filing claims for lost revenue with the Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO). However, 90% of damage claims filed with HECO in 2023 were denied. HECO will hold an event on June 30 to answer questions about filing claim forms. Customers can also file a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission if they are not satisfied. Mike Angelo, consumer advocate at the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, emphasized the importance of investing in infrastructure to prevent outages. Customers must file a claim with HECO within 30 days of the service interruption.

**Downtown Honolulu businesses recoup after power outage results in revenue losses**
A power outage in downtown Honolulu and Chinatown caused by a fire damaged underground cables, affecting around 3,000 customers. Hawaiian Electric has restored power, but businesses suffered revenue losses. The utility is allowing customers to file claims for lost revenue and products, with a 30-day deadline. Businesses can file claims on Hawaiian Electric's website, but the process takes time and there is no guarantee of approval. The outage had a significant impact on restaurants and businesses with perishable items, with some having to throw away food and close during the multi-day outage.

Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (NYSE: HE) shares are rising today after a report suggests the company has reached an agreement to settle lawsuits related to the Maui fires. According to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the deal, Hawaiian Electric has agreed to pay over $4 billion to settle hundreds of lawsuits. The company is responsible for approximately $1.5 billion of the agreement, while the shares of other companies are still being defined. The payment is expected to be made over a four-year period. The proposed agreement, pending final approval, aims to settle lawsuits filed by thousands of homeowners and businesses against Hawaiian Electric.

The proposed agreement is lower than the estimated $5.5 billion in capital costs for the fires, which damaged or destroyed 2,207 structures, mostly residential, according to last year's damage assessment.

**Hawaiian Electric shares surge 40% after report of preliminary agreement to resolve Maui wildfires claims**
Hawaiian Electric Industries (HE) shares increased by 40% on Friday after a Bloomberg report on a preliminary agreement to resolve numerous legal claims resulting from the destructive wildfires that affected Maui last year. The agreement, pending final confirmation, may involve HE contributing over $1.5 billion to a total sum of over $4 billion, providing compensation to thousands of property owners and businesses affected by the wildfires. Other parties involved in the agreement may include a Charter Communications subsidiary, as well as state and local authorities. This development could be a positive news for HE, which saw a significant drop in its stock price after the wildfires. The company was severely criticized for not disconnecting electricity despite strong wind forecasts, leading to approximately $5.5 billion in material damages and a credit rating downgrade to non-investment grade, making it harder for the company to obtain financing. According to Bloomberg, the payment total is expected to be made over a four-year period, with insurers seeking to cover a large part of it for claims that have already been settled. Insurers are seeking around $2 billion from the liquidation fund as reimbursement for claims they have already covered. However, lawyers representing property owners and businesses are contesting these claims from insurers. The Maui County government plans to review the proposed agreement at a meeting today. Although details are being kept secret, authorities have shown willingness to consider a negotiated agreement. If concluded, this agreement could represent a significant step in resolving the legal issues related to the Maui wildfires and help restore the economic stability of Hawaiian Electric.

**Hawaiian Electric Industries May Be Seeing The Light At The End Of The Tunnel**
Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) is an electric utility company that produces and distributes approximately 95% of the electricity consumed in the U.S. state of Hawaii. The company has been at the center of litigation related to a series of wildfires that devastated the island of Maui in August 2023. The company's stock price has fallen by 71.58% over the past year due to concerns about the potential impact of the litigation on its financial performance. However, the company's revenue and cash flow have not been significantly impacted by the litigation, and its operating cash flow has only declined by 8.79% compared to the same period last year. The company's net income has declined by 17.69% compared to the same period last year, but this decline is largely due to the impact of the wildfires on its financial performance. The company's financial performance has not been significantly impacted by the litigation, and its financial structure remains strong. The company's net debt-to-equity ratio is 1.41, which is comparable to that of its peers. The company's stock price has recently risen by 20.77% due to optimism about the potential resolution of the litigation. A global settlement has been proposed to resolve the litigation, which would resolve all of the claims and cross-claims related to the wildfires. If the settlement is approved, it would remove much of the uncertainty surrounding the company's financial performance and allow for a more accurate valuation of the company.

Hawaiian Electric's Shift and Save six-month pilot program will end on July 31. Customers who enrolled in the program will see their electric bills return to normal unless they choose to continue. Those who choose to continue do not need to take any action, while those who do not want to continue must decline participation on the Hawaiian Electric website before their August bill. The program has kept customer bills within normal range for the past six months, and customers are protected from unanticipated bill increases with a bill protection credit. Eligible customers can still enroll in the program, which could reduce bills.

**Downtown Honolulu electric grid upgrade will be long, disruptive**
Hawaiian Electric is planning to upgrade the underground electric cable network in downtown Honolulu, which could take 10 years to complete. The upgrade is being accelerated after two recent power outages in the area. The company has already completed about 25% of the project before the coronavirus pandemic, but the remaining 75% is now a priority. The upgrade will be challenging due to the confined spaces and logistics involved. Some of the work will require cutting power to customers, and the company is examining strategies to minimize disruptions. The recent outages were caused by an underground cable failure and a fire, and an analysis is ongoing to determine the root cause. Customers can file claims for losses or damage resulting from the outages.

**Wells Fargo Maintains Underweight Rating on Hawaiian Electric Amid Ongoing Legal Challenges**
Wells Fargo has maintained its Underweight rating on Hawaiian Electric (NYSE:HE) due to ongoing legal challenges related to the Lahaina forest fire. The financial institution highlighted that Hawaiian Electric's claims of responsibility against the Maui County could complicate the resolution of potential liabilities. The company's claims suggest that the damages caused by the fire could have been reduced if the county had better planned and responded. However, Wells Fargo emphasized that the ignition source of the second afternoon fire remains a crucial legal point, particularly in terms of claims for material damages. The results of the ATF investigation are essential, given the over 400 lawsuits filed against Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO), alleging fault and negligence. Wells Fargo's position on Hawaiian Electric reflects the potential legal implications of the Lahaina fire on the company's financial and operational prospects. The analysis suggests that the stock direction is closely tied to developments in the courtroom and the ongoing investigation.
