Based on the information provided and considering the following factors, I will make a forecast on the likelihood of Kennedy Iyere winning the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria.

1. **Candidate Support and Endorsements**: The news articles heavily favor Asue Ighodalo, the PDP's candidate, who received strong endorsements, particularly from the current governor, Godwin Obaseki. This suggests that Ighodalo is a strong contender, while Kennedy Iyere is not mentioned at all, suggesting he may not be a significant player in this election.

2. **Electoral Environment**: There is an anticipation of strong support for the PDP candidate, with Governor Obaseki's backing and claims of winning a significant percentage of votes. Meanwhile, the candidacy of other party candidates like the APC and LP seems to be under pressure due to a lack of positive attention or outright criticism from different party sources.

3. **Polling Data and Public Sentiment**: Some polls and public sentiment analyses suggest that the PDP is leading. Although there are mentions of tensions and claims of potential electoral manipulations, these do not appear to favor Kennedy Iyere.

4. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: In Nigerian gubernatorial elections, candidates from major parties, such as the PDP and APC, tend to dominate elections. Since Iyere is not mentioned in any major capacity within the provided information, it's reasonable to assume he might not be affiliated with a major party.

5. **Historical Biases and Forecasting Principles**: Engaging with the historical data and predictions related to similar elections, I need to balance between overreacting to endorsements and underreacting to the potential unquantifiable influence of lesser-known candidates.

Given these points, Kennedy Iyere seems highly unlikely to win the election as per the current situation and available information. His presence in the election is negligible as per the information provided.

**My Prediction:** Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To forecast the outcome of the September 21, 2024, Edo State gubernatorial election, specifically focusing on the likelihood of Kennedy Iyere's victory, we must assess the available data about his candidacy and the broader electoral context.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
   - In Nigerian gubernatorial elections, incumbents and candidates with strong political party backing often have an advantage, particularly those associated with the ruling national party or the dominant state party. Although Kennedy Iyere and the details regarding his candidacy were not explicitly mentioned in the article set provided, we can infer from the articles that Asue Ighodalo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and candidates from the All Progressives Congress (APC) are more prominently featured as leading candidates.

2. **Current Context and Trends:**
   - The articles highlight major involvement by PDP, with confidence expressed multiple times by Governor Obaseki about the PDP candidate, Asue Ighodalo's chances. Additionally, there has been significant mobilization for Ighodalo and substantial backing from high-level politicians like Governor Obaseki.
   - The APC also appears active, receiving defectors and engaging in campaigns, but their candidate is criticized in several articles and lacks the same level of visibility and activity as Ighodalo.

3. **Local Dynamics:**
   - There seems to be considerable tension in Edo State, with controversial statements and potential for unrest should Ighodalo not win. This underscores the highly competitive and polarized nature of this election.

4. **Probabilities and Prediction:**
   - Given the lack of direct evidence in the articles suggesting a strong campaign or support for Kennedy Iyere and the prominence of other candidates like Asue Ighodalo and Monday Okpebholo, it's reasonable to assume that Iyere is a less likely winner. The news largely anticipates a PDP victory or a strong battle with APC, but not mentioning Iyere as a serious contender.

5. **Balancing Evidence:**
   - The forecast may need adjustment if Iyere has significant developments or backing that weren't covered in the provided information. However, based on available data, the odds seem weighed against his winning the election.

Given this assessment, Kennedy Iyere's chance of winning seems low due to the lack of prominence in the articles and given the established dominance by other candidates, particularly Asue Ighodalo from the PDP.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

To forecast whether Kennedy Iyere will win the September 21, 2024, Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria, let's explore the current situation and relevant details comprehensively.

1. **Background Context and Base Rates:** 
   - Kennedy Iyere does not appear prominently in the provided content, indicating either an omission or, more likely, that he is not a major candidate. The primary focus is on candidates Asue Ighodalo (PDP), Monday Okpebholo (APC), and Olumide Akpata (LP).
   - According to typical base rates for political races, unknown or less-publicized candidates have lower probabilities of winning against more established party candidates in Nigerian gubernatorial elections.
   
2. **Candidate Positioning and Support:**
   - There is significant political support and media backing for the PDP candidate, Asue Ighodalo, who is repeatedly highlighted as a frontrunner with various political endorsements and described as having a strong electoral ground game.
   - Reports and statements from credible figures (like the current state governor, Godwin Obaseki) suggest confidence in Ighodalo's victory. These endorsements create a strong narrative of dominance in the race.
   - The APC candidate, Monday Okpebholo, and the LP candidate, Olumide Akpata, also receive media coverage, but there's no mention of Kennedy Iyere among key candidates or electoral developments, casting doubt on his candidacy's viability.

3. **Current Trend Analysis:**
   - The absence of any notable mention about Kennedy Iyere in new coverage or discussions implies his public recognition is likely low. This, combined with his non-mention among the primary candidates by the press, reduces perceived chances.
   
4. **Combining Inside and Outside Views:**
   - The outside view suggests that historically, candidates who are not part of the main political parties (such as PDP or APC) and without media visibility face substantial challenges. The inside view, based on the articles, does not provide any supporting evidence for Kennedy Iyere's candidacy to counter this historical pattern.
   
Given all the strong indications that Kennedy Iyere is not a significant candidate in this election and the overwhelming focus and confidence expressed in other candidates, his probability of winning is extremely low.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

To forecast Kennedy Iyere's chances of winning the September 21, 2024, Edo State gubernatorial election, let's analyze the available information:

1. **Base Rates**: Examine historical election outcomes and political dynamics in Edo State. The People's Democratic Party (PDP), represented by Asue Ighodalo, seems to be the predominant force. Generally, incumbents or their parties tend to have an advantage.

2. **Current Situation**: Asue Ighodalo is the PDP candidate, the party that currently seems favorable, given the support from the outgoing governor and recent court endorsements. There is consistent reporting of Ighodalo's popularity and expected victory from various sources, suggesting a strong position in the race. Conversely, there's minimal information supporting Kennedy Iyere's chances, possibly indicating a low profile or non-existent candidacy.

3. **Political Endorsements & Influencers**: Governor Godwin Obaseki's strong endorsement of Ighodalo adds significant weight to his candidacy. Influential figures and strategic party alignments play crucial roles in Nigerian elections.

4. **Polling Data**: Polls and internal party assessments indicate Ighodalo's dominant position, predicting a victory and raising doubts about Iyere’s viability as a competitive candidate.

5. **Overall Analysis**: There’s no substantial evidence or media reporting suggesting Kennedy Iyere is in a position to win the election. The narrative focuses heavily on Ighodalo and, to a lesser extent, his opponents from the APC and Labour Party.

Based on these observations, Kennedy Iyere's probability of winning the election appears negligible. 

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

To forecast whether Kennedy Iyere will win the September 21, 2024, Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria, we'll analyze the available evidence and consider historical patterns and probabilities. 

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: An important baseline assessment involves examining previous gubernatorial elections in Nigeria and the likelihood of third-party or independent candidates winning such elections. Historically, elections in Nigeria have been dominated by the two major parties: the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC). Independent candidates or those from less-established parties have typically had low success rates.

2. **Current Context**: The primary candidates in focus according to the news reports are Asue Ighodalo of the PDP and Monday Okpebholo of the APC. These reports consistently highlight Ighodalo's strong position, supported by endorsements from the incumbent governor, Godwin Obaseki, and predictions of victory by various stakeholders, including polls and PDP leaders. There is no mention of Kennedy Iyere in the context of these reports, suggesting that his candidacy might not be among the leading contenders.

3. **News Analysis**: The news sources provided extensively cover the campaigns and endorsements of Ighodalo (PDP) and Okpebholo (APC), with Ighodalo generally perceived as having a stronger campaign. Additionally, no specific information was found about Kennedy Iyere's candidacy, suggesting he is not a significant contender in the election based on the available data.

4. **Current Political Dynamics**: A significant factor mentioned is the fear of interference and manipulation, which might affect outcomes. However, if Kennedy Iyere isn't highlighted in these competitive dynamics or alleged manipulations, it further suggests his impact or likelihood of winning is minimal.

5. **Forecast Uncertainty**: Given that Kennedy Iyere isn't mentioned as a key candidate and observing that elections typically see low success for lesser-known or independent candidates in Nigerian state elections, the probability of his victory appears to be low.

Considering these factors, Kennedy Iyere's probability of winning can be placed low due to a lack of substantive evidence indicating his competitiveness in the race.

Independent candidates or those from less-established parties have typically had low success rates.

2. **Current Context**: The primary candidates in focus according to the news reports are Asue Ighodalo of the PDP and Monday Okpebholo of the APC. These reports consistently highlight Ighodalo's strong position, supported by endorsements from the incumbent governor, Godwin Obaseki, and predictions of victory by various stakeholders, including polls and PDP leaders. There is no mention of Kennedy Iyere in the context of these reports, suggesting that his candidacy might not be among the leading contenders.

3. **News Analysis**: The news sources provided extensively cover the campaigns and endorsements of Ighodalo (PDP) and Okpebholo (APC), with Ighodalo generally perceived as having a stronger campaign. Additionally, no specific information was found about Kennedy Iyere's candidacy, suggesting he is not a significant contender in the election based on the available data.

4. **Current Political Dynamics**: A significant factor mentioned is the fear of interference and manipulation, which might affect outcomes. However, if Kennedy Iyere isn't highlighted in these competitive dynamics or alleged manipulations, it further suggests his impact or likelihood of winning is minimal.

5. **Forecast Uncertainty**: Given that Kennedy Iyere isn't mentioned as a key candidate and observing that elections typically see low success for lesser-known or independent candidates in Nigerian state elections, the probability of his victory appears to be low.

Considering these factors, Kennedy Iyere's probability of winning can be placed low due to a lack of substantive evidence indicating his competitiveness in the race.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.
