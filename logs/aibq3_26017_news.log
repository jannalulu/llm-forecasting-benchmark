**Starships Makes Perfectly Imperfect Flight on Its Fourth Launch, Overshadows the Starliner**
SpaceX successfully launched its Starship spacecraft on its fourth flight, reaching an altitude of 124 miles (200 km) and a top speed of 16,000 mph (25,750 kph). The mission was not perfect, with some tiles on the ship's heat shield lost and its forward flap ignited during re-entry. Despite this, the flight demonstrated the ability to control the vehicle using its flaps and will be used to advance the development of the Starship, which is expected to be used for interplanetary travel and potentially as a means of transport for people on Earth. The Starship is powered by 33 Raptor engines and has the potential to lift 150 metric tons of cargo, with plans to expand to 250 metric tons. A variant of the Starship, called the Human Landing System (HLS), will be used to support the NASA Artemis III mission to the Moon in 2026.

**Elon Musk Sets Target Date for Starship's Fifth Test Flight**
Elon Musk announced that SpaceX aims to launch the Starship for the fifth time by the end of July. This could be the most spectacular test flight for the 120-meter-tall rocket. For the first time, SpaceX will attempt to 'catch' the Super Heavy booster of the first stage, allowing the first stage to be reused for multiple flights, making Starship missions more cost-effective. Musk revealed the target date on Twitter, saying 'I'm counting on trying this by the end of July!' The maneuver involves a pair of robotic arms on the launch tower grasping the booster as it returns to Earth shortly after the deployment of the Starship upper stage into orbit. SpaceX has already perfected the safe return of the first stage of its smaller Falcon 9 rocket, although this particular booster lands vertically without using robotic arms. 'Capturing the booster reduces the mass of the launcher, moves material complexity to the ground, and enables rapid reuse of the rocket,' SpaceX said in a published document. 'After liftoff, and after the separation of the two stages in flight, the Super Heavy will return to the launch site, relight its engines to slow down the vehicle, and the tower's arms will catch the rocket booster before re-impacting it for the next orbital launch.' Starship, the world's most powerful rocket, has flown four times since its first launch in April 2023. The most recent flight, at the beginning of the month, was its most successful to date, with the Super Heavy and Starship successfully landing before falling into the water. Once fully tested and certified, Starship is expected to be used for crewed and cargo missions to the Moon and could even transport the first humans to Mars. While SpaceX hopes to send Starship on its first lunar mission before the end of this decade, crewed flights to Mars are still far away.

**Starship Completes Fourth Test Flight with Success**
The Starship, a large rocket, successfully completed its fourth test flight on June 6, 2024, with a 50-minute delay. The launch was successful, with only one of the 33 engines of the first stage failing shortly after liftoff, which was compensated by the remaining 32 engines. About two and a half minutes after liftoff, the separation of the first stage, also known as Super Heavy, from the second stage, the actual Starship, was performed. While some of the engines of the Super Heavy were still running, the six engines of the Starship ignited and quickly reached their full power. The gases then exited through a grid structure between the two rocket stages. Shortly after, the first stage separated from the Starship and began a roll maneuver for its return to Earth. The Starship continued to fire its engines, entering a suborbital trajectory after eight minutes, heading towards the Indian Ocean. For about 45 minutes, it moved on this trajectory, gradually losing altitude. The critical phase of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere began soon after. Unlike the third test flight in March, the Starship did not rotate around its longitudinal axis, but instead maintained its orientation towards the Earth's surface as planned. After 45 minutes of flight, the Starship entered the atmosphere at an altitude of around 105 kilometers, which was live-streamed thanks to built-in cameras, showing a reddish glow on the heat shield. At an altitude of 84 kilometers, the Starship's control surfaces took over. The event was closely monitored, with the hot plasma on the heat shield visible in detail. 56 minutes after liftoff, the plasma had burned through the heat shield, and parts of the control surfaces broke off. Despite this, the spacecraft continued to function and landed with low speed in the Indian Ocean. With this flight, SpaceX has made significant progress towards its goal of having a operational large rocket.

**SpaceX's Starship Launches for Fourth Test Flight**
SpaceX's Starship, the largest and most powerful in the world, launched from Texas for its fourth test flight, aiming to achieve a controlled re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere after about an hour of flight. The spacecraft is being developed by Elon Musk's company to transport NASA astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972. The Starship is composed of two stages: the Super Heavy booster and the Starship itself, which gives the entire rocket its name. The spacecraft measures 120 meters tall. During its previous flight, the spacecraft exceeded the boundary of space, but its signal was lost 49 minutes after launch due to a loss of control of its orientation in flight caused by clogged valves. Since then, several improvements have been made to the vehicle. The first test flight was conducted in April 2023. The goals of this flight were to achieve a soft landing of Super Heavy in the Gulf of Mexico and a controlled entry into the atmosphere of the spacecraft. If successful, the spacecraft will end its mission in the Indian Ocean. With each test flight, SpaceX aims for more ambitious objectives, such as the transfer of liquid oxygen from one tank to another within the rocket, which is essential for reaching the Moon. The NASA is counting on Starship for its Artemis 3 mission in 2026, which will send astronauts to the Moon. Elon Musk plans to use Starship as the main instrument to establish a self-sustaining colony on Mars, making humanity a multi-planetary species.
