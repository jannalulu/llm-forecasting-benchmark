The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, their eyes glued to the latest reports.

**FORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
Well, folks, the CDC page is up. The extent of the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows is officially less than 300 herds.

**FORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 85.67%. Given the spread by July, containment efforts were impressive.

**FORECASTER 3**  
(glancing at notes)  
The FDA's quick response on testing and transparency played a crucial role. By July 17, we had enough data to refine our predictions.

**FORECASTER 1**  
(satisfied)  
Another win for the models. The collaboration between agencies really made the difference.

They exchange relieved smiles, knowing their predictions once again proved accurate.
