INT. A MODERN LIVING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits in a circle, sipping coffee. They stare at a tablet displaying the latest headline: "Pavel Durov Remains in France Amid Legal Turmoil."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, our models had it at 95.32%. We predicted he'd stay.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. With the August 24th arrest, leaving seemed unlikely. The legal web is too intricate.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
No credible reports of him leaving by October 1st. Just as we anticipated.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The geopolitical climate, the charges—our data showed he'd be anchored here.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And the encryption keys issue... It’s a global chess game.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. His presence is pivotal. The stakes are too high for a sudden departure.

They nod, confident in their analysis, the room filled with a quiet satisfaction of another prediction confirmed.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, diverse in age and background, sit around a table, sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, did Pavel Durov leave France?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No credible reports by the deadline. Our models had it at 15.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nods)  
His arrest was a curveball, but not enough to push him out.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
The legal wrangling kept him tied here. Fascinating to see the probabilities play out.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
A testament to our model's accuracy. A high-stakes game, yet predictable.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(grinning)  
And now, we wait for the next twist in the tale of Durov.

They share a knowing smile, their conversation fading into the ambient chatter of the cafe.
